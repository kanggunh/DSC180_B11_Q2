"All-perovskite tandem solar cells with improved grain surface passivation
A thick mixed Pb-Sn narrow-bandgap subcell is needed to achieve high photocurrent density in tandem solar cells 6 , yet this is challenging owing to the short carrier diffusion length within Pb-Sn perovskitesHere we develop ammonium-cation-passivated Pb-Sn perovskites with long diffusion lengths, enabling subcells that have an absorber thickness of approximately 1.2 Î¼m",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04372-8,Pb-Sn perovskites,None,None,1,0,0

Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that widely used phenethylammonium cations are only partially adsorbed on the surface defective sites at perovskite crystallization temperaturesThe passivator adsorption is predicted to be enhanced using 4-trifluoromethyl-phenylammonium (CF3-PA), which exhibits a stronger perovskite surface-passivator interaction than does phenethylammonium",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04372-8,Phenethylammonium,None,None,1,0,0

The three passivators were then assessed using steady-state photoluminescence (PL)The PL intensity was increased noticeably with the CF3-PA passivating agent (Fig",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04372-8,None,CF3-PA,None,0,1,0
