Chatextract notes

Sentence and Paragraph did work with prompt: PCE. One paragraph had surpassed the token limit, failing extraction

- Go around exceeding token limit by...
	-If we can calculate token limit on data preparation, split it at that point in the middle
	-If not, we can pass first 2000 token, it is what it is.


Result: 

Chatextract will take out ALL instances of PCE that was mentioned in sentence / paragraph. 
  - This means if paragraph mentioned 3 different PCE, they will all be extracted with different materials attatched. 

	PROBLEM:This means that we need to come up with a tally system or some sort of metric to find the correct PCE and material from this extraction.
