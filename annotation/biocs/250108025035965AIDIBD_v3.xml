      <text>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have now achieved efficiencies in excess of 22%, but very little is known about their long-term stability under thermal stress. So far, stability reports have hinted at the importance of substituting the organic components, but little attention has been given to the metal contact. We investigated the stability of state-of-the-art PSCs with efficiencies exceeding 20%. Remarkably, we found that exposing PSCs to a temperature of 70 °C is enough to induce gold migration through the hole-transporting layer (HTL), spiro-MeOTAD, and into the perovskite material, which in turn severely affects the device performance metrics under working conditions. Importantly, we found that the main cause of irreversible degradation is not due to decomposition of the organic and hybrid perovskite layers. By introducing a Cr metal interlayer between the HTL and gold electrode, high-temperature-induced irreversible long-term losses are avoided. This key finding is essential in the quest for achieving high efficiency, long-term stable PSCs which, in order to be commercially viable, need to withstand hard thermal stress tests.&#13;</text>

      <text>W hile the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly achieved remarkable values of 22.1%,  1  this has not been matched by equal developments in long-term stability.  2, 3  At this stage, operational stability is considered one of the main obstacles for the commercialization of PSCs.  4, 5  The perovskites used in photovoltaics commonly employ an ABX 3 formula, where A is a monovalent cation (methylamonium, MA; formamidinium, FA; Cs, etc.), B is a divalent metal, such as Sn or Pb, and X is I, Br, or Cl. In previous studies, perovskite films have been subjected to different environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and illumination.  [6] [7] [8]  It has been found that the stability of this material class varies greatly depending on the mixing of A and X ions.  [9] [10] [11] [12]  Perovskites are thermally stable at temperatures not exceeding those typically achieved by solar cells in operation (up to 85 °C),  6, 7  with humidity identified as the main degradation trigger.  6, 13  Similarly, stability of complete PSC devices has been investigated with relation to the same environmental factors.  6, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]  Interestingly, in addition to the perovskite-related degradation, the stability of the devices was found to greatly depend on device architecture.  17, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24]  This was explained partly by interfacial degradation  19, 25  and also by degradation of the charge-transporting layers.  14, 22  Recently, there have been efforts to substitute the widely used organic spiro-MeOTAD holetransporting layer (HTL) with inorganic materials to improve the stability of PSCs.  20, 21, 26  However, it is still unclear what the mechanism increasing the stability is. Furthermore, while most of the published reports focus on dark "shelf stability",  20, 22, 27  only a handful have investigated devices under load and illumination  17, 18, 26, 28  and even fewer attempted to match the realistic operation conditions of solar cells by subjecting them simultaneously to temperatures in excess of 70 °C,  29  which are routinely achieved on a hot, sunny day.  30  Here, we investigate the stability of state-of-the-art perovskite devices with PCEs above 20%. We show that operating devices, employing a spiro-MeOTAD HTL and a Au or Ag back contact (the most widely used architectures, currently yielding the highest PCEs), at temperatures exceeding 70 °C causes irreversible changes to the devices, which results in a dramatic performance loss. By means of elemental analysis on aged devices, we observe that considerable amounts of Au from the electrode diffuse across the HTL into the perovskite layer. We pinpoint the diffused Au to cause the irreversible loss of opencircuit voltage (V oc ), fill factor (FF), and short-circuit current density (J sc ) in the aged devices. We further show that introduction of a Cr interlayer alleviates the problem of fast device aging at elevated temperatures. This is an encouraging  finding as it shows that neither perovskite nor spiro-MeOTAD is the limiting factor for the high-temperature stability of PSCs. &#13;</text>

      <text> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The PSCs were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass and composed of a typical stack of compact TiO 2 / mesoporous TiO 2 /perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au as recently reported by us.  31  The active layer of the device consists of a perovskite-filled mesoporous TiO 2 scaffold and a solid perovskite layer sitting on top of it. The chemical composition of the perovskite precursor is a Cs-containing FA 0.83 MA 0.17 Pb-(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 formulation, referred to as "triple cation" perovskite in this work.  12  Figure  1a  shows the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the device with a thin perovskite-infiltrated mesoporous TiO 2 layer (an electron selective layer, ESL) of ca. 200 nm and a 500 nm perovskite capping layer composed of large crystals. A 200 nm layer of spiro-MeOTAD (as HTL) sits atop the perovskite layer, and finally, a gold top electrode is deposited to contact the device. With this architecture, we achieved very high PCEs of up to 20.6% (stabilized at 20.0%; Figure  1b ). The aging experiments were conducted by keeping the devices at controlled temperature (20 or 75 °C), in nitrogen atmosphere and under 1 sun equivalent white light-emitting diode (LED) illumination at maximum power point (MPP) for over 15 h (see Scheme S1). Figure  2a  shows the currentvoltage (J-V) curves of the device aged at 20 °C: before, at the end of the aging experiments, and after 7 h of recovery (in dark, under nitrogen flow and 20 °C; cf. Figure  S1a  for the evolution of J-V parameters), while Figure  2c  shows the evolution of PCE, V MPP , and J MPP over the course of the experiment. The 20 °C device has shown very high stability overall, with V oc being the most stable parameter individually. The limited decrease in PCE was mostly due to a small and temporary loss of J sc , and the device regained its performance following 7 h of recovery (Table  1 ). On the other hand, the degradation of the device aged at 75 °C was much more severe (Figure  2b ,d and Figure  S1b ), and no recovery was seen. All J-V metrics saw a substantial reduction, with J sc /J MPP suffering the most and the earliest into the experiment. Additionally, a large, irreversible loss of V oc was observed. This pattern of small, reversible PCE loss for devices aged around room temperature and a severe, permanent PCE loss including a substantial reduction in V oc after aging at 75 °C is reproducible, and we confirmed this by repeating the experiment several times (Figure  S2 ). A similar pattern was found for samples aged under the identical conditions but by keeping the devices at V oc , indicating that the degradation was not primarily due to the load on the device (Figure  S3 ). Moreover, a similar observation was made for devices aged at 75 °C in the dark (Figure  4c ), confirming that light was only partially responsible for the degradation. Hence, we concluded that the heating is responsible for most of the degradation. In order to investigate the effect of aging on perovskite, we performed UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (Figure  S4 ) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Figure  S5 ) before and after the aging experiments (Au electrode was removed). No major difference was found in the material's structural and optical properties with the temperature treatment. The absorption of aged devices was independent of the aging temperature. Similarly, XRD analysis showed no correlation between temperature of aging and perovskite degradation. However, the peak indicating the presence of PbI 2 (2θ = ∼12.8°; the devices are fabricated with a small PbI 2 excess) has slightly increased in both devices aged at 20 and 75 °C. Since the structural and optical changes of the perovskite are not the main cause of the dramatic device performance loss, the elemental composition of the aged devices was investigated. Time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) elemental depth profiling is a perfectly suited technique for this, and it has been proven to work well to characterize perovskitebased devices.  [32] [33] [34]  By rastering an energetic beam of ions across a sample and analyzing the debris of those collisions, spatially resolved elemental maps can be obtained. Figure  3a  shows a depth profile of an as-fabricated control device, which has never been exposed to high-intensity light, electric field, or temperature higher than room temperature. The Au -ion trace is indicative of the top electrode; the CN -ion can be ejected from either the spiro-MeOTAD HTL or the perovskite layer. I - comes from the perovskite layer, TiO 2 -is from either the mesoporous scaffold or the ESL; and SnO 2 -is from the FTO electrode. The relative intensity of CN -and I -from the HTL to the FTO layer is beyond the scope of this publication and will be the subject of future work. Further, these ions are sensitive to diffusion and segregation at the surface because of the primary ion bombardment/implantation, which can explain their long diffusion tails in the FTO and the substrate.  35  We clearly see a sharp interface between Au and HTL; however, roughness induced by the primary ion erosion explains the sharpness decrease with the increased fluence. Moreover, passing the TiO 2 mesoporous layer also affects the interface evaluation. When comparing the control device with the aged ones (see Figure  S6  for full SIMS profiles and the Methods section for an explanation of how ToF-SIMS profiles can be compared), one striking observation for the device aged at 70 °C is the occurrence of a Au -signal (in yellow) in the mesoporous TiO 2 perovskite, which peaks close to the TiO 2 /SnO 2 interface. This unexpected occurrence of the high Au peak is the first ever reported direct evidence of metal migrating from the electrode to inside the perovskite layer. This phenomenon, however, has been observed previously in inorganic semiconductors for several different metals such as Au, Ag, Ni, Cu, and Fe.  [36] [37] [38] [39] [40]  Figure  3b  presents the 3D distribution of the ions shown in Figure  3a  across a 100 μm 2 region of the samples (see Movie S1 for an animated 3D reconstruction). One can clearly see that the respective ions are distributed uniformly in the xy plane of the device. At 70 °C, a considerable amount of Au has diffused inside the perovskite layer and accumulated close to the TiO 2 / SnO 2 interface. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to quantify the amount of Au diffused in the    instrument (∼1 ng for the amount of solution used). This translated to a concentration of 1.45 nM cm -2 of Au (or 8.9 × 10 14 Au atoms cm -2 ; compared to ∼10 17 Pb atoms cm -2 ) in the perovskite layer of the aged device. Based on the evidence (ToF-SIMS, ICP-MS), it was concluded that Au from the top electrode can diffuse across the organic spiro-MeOTAD HTL and into the perovskite before it is stopped at the TiO 2 /perovskite interface. Since some Au was already found within the HTL of the control device (Figure  3 ), it shows that spiro-MeOTAD is a very poor barrier for the migration of Au. Therefore, even heat produced during back contact evaporation is sufficient to cause Au diffusion into the HTL. Subsequently, the Au -signal in HTL increases in the device aged at 30 °C. However, this does not seem to have a detrimental effect on the performance of the device. When the aging temperature is increased to 70 °C, Au appears to easily pass through the HTL and accumulate within the perovskite layer. It appears that only when inside the perovskite, Au critically degrades the performance of PSCs. Au diffusing inside the perovskite can have several detrimental effects. First of all, it can produce shunts across the device, reducing the FF.  24  Moreover, Au atoms can create deep trap states within the semiconductor, which enhances nonradiative recombination and consequently degrades V oc as well as J sc . Indeed, we observe a severe, irreversible reduction in V oc , J sc , and FF in the devices aged at high temperature. The phenomenon of Au creating mid-band-gap states for silicon devices has been reported before.  36, 37  In order to pinpoint the observed degradation to Au diffusion into perovskite and to exclude possible influence of interfacial or HTL degradation, we performed dark heating experiments on two identically fabricated devices, one of which had the Au electrode temporarily removed for the duration of the heating phase (see Methods). We found that the device heated without the Au electrode did not degrade significantly and later recovered almost all of its initial performance (Figure  4a ). On the other hand, the device aged with Au on top has seen a severe degradation (Figure  4c ) similar to that shown above. While replacing the Au electrode of the degraded devices with a fresh one helped to partially recover J sc , the loss of V oc and FF was permanent. The reason for the recovered J sc is likely due to the partially reversible nature of degradation in PSCs when they are left in the dark. We note that the process of replacing the electrode takes around 1.5 h. However, it may also indicate degradation of the Au/spiro-MeOTAD interface. Next, Au was compared to the other most widely used electrode for PSCs, namely, Ag. The average initial efficiency of Ag-contacted devices was 11.8% compared to 18.3% for Aucontacted devices from the same batch. By heating the devices to 75 °C in the dark and in a nitrogen atmosphere, we found that devices with a Ag electrode degrade dramatically, as seen for the Au analogues (Figure  S7 ). While the loss of V oc was relatively lower, the increased degradation may come from the fact that iodine can migrate through the HTL, reacting with Ag and altering the electronic properties of the Ag/HTL interface.  23, 27  A similar phenomenon has been also shown for Al-contacted devices.  27  This further confirms that metal electrodes (Au and Ag) are intrinsically incompatible with organic spiro-MeOTAD HTL-based perovskite devices such as solar cells,  [41] [42] [43]  photodetectors,  [44] [45] [46]  lasers,  47  and LEDs.  48  The problem of metal-induced degradation cannot be simply resolved by sealing the devices, and metal diffusion must be stopped by an alternative HTL or an interfacial layer preventing this phenomenon. Several strategies were explored to resolve the issue of metalmigration-induced degradation of PSCs. First, the HTL was modified by mixing spiro-MeOTAD with Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles. This approach has been proposed by Guarnera et al. to stop metal diffusion across the HTL.  24  While the stability of asprepared devices aged under MPP conditions and 75 °C was improved significantly, the extent of degradation proved unacceptable and a linear degradation component was observed (Figure  5b  and Figure  S8 ). Thin interlayers of Cr (10 nm) were deposited as diffusion barriers between the spiro-MeOTAD HTL and Au. The initial performance of these devices was 13.0%, which was lower than that without a Cr layer and likely due to high series resistance or work function mismatch of the Au/Cr/spiro-MeOTAD stack. By subjecting the Cr/Au devices to realistic solar cell operating conditions (75 °C, 1 sun illumination, and MPP tracking), the stability was found to improve critically (Figure  5c ), and any degradation was reversible (due to an increase of V oc , the device outperformed itself following 9 h of recovery, Figure  S9a ). After an early period of exponential decay, the PCE stabilized at 83% of the initial value. Importantly, no degradation of V oc in the aged devices occurred (Figure  S9 ), indicating that Au diffusion across the HTL into perovskite has been hindered by the Cr interlayer. We have confirmed this by performing ICP-MS spectrometry on the aged Cr/Au devices and not finding any trace of Au or Cr inside the perovskite layer. Furthermore, we imaged the fresh and degraded Au electrodes of the three devices with different HTL/electrode configurations (Figure  5b ). While the Au electrode of the spiro-MeOTAD + Au device became evidently porous following high-temperature exposure, both devices with spiro-MeOTAD/ Al 2 O 3 + Au and spiro-MeOTAD + Cr/Au architectures had no visible evidence of electrode degradation or decomposition. This finding suggests that it is plausible that the spiro-MeOTAD layer cracks when heat-stressed, which in turn creates pores and a point of contact between Au/perovskite. This effect could be hindered by a Cr interlayer, or cracking of spiro-MeOTAD could be considerably reduced by mixing it with Al 2 O 3 . The high-temperature stability of Cr/Au devices is unprecedented, and such behavior has never been observed in devices using Au or Ag as contacts. In addition, deposition of a thin Cr interlayer is industrially feasible as Cr can be evaporated from Cr-plated W wires by sublimation. Finally, this work brings to light the misconception that the perovskite materials and HTLs are the main contributors to the long-term degradation of device performance. Several reports of successful employment of inorganic HTLs, inorganic interfacial layers, or transparent conductive oxide electrodes have shown considerable improvement of PSC stability.  20, [24] [25] [26] 50  Although not directly acknowledged, the improvement in stability may have come from hindering metal diffusion from the contact across the HTL into the perovskite rather than more efficient protection of perovskite from oxygen or humidity. &#13;</text>

      <text> CONCLUSIONS We investigated the stability of state-of-the-art, "triple cation" perovskite devices with PCEs above 20%. We show that operating devices employing a spiro-MeOTAD HTL and a Au or Ag back contact at temperatures exceeding 70 °C causes irreversible changes to the devices, which results in a dramatic performance loss. By means of elemental analysis on aged devices, we observe that considerable amounts of the Au from the electrode diffuse across the HTL into the perovskite layer. We pinpoint the diffused Au to cause the irreversible loss of V oc , FF, and J sc in the aged devices. We further show that insertion of a thin Cr interlayer between the HTL and Au alleviates the problem of severe device degradation at elevated temperatures. This shows that neither perovskite nor spiro-MeOTAD is the primary limiting factor for high-temperature stability of PSCs in the current configuration, as it has previously been suggested. Our study creates a roadmap for high-temperature stability measurements of PSCs by taking into consideration metal migration. Therefore, it is important for the field to investigate other interlayer materials that can hinder this phenomenon. &#13;</text>

      <text> METHODS Device Fabrication. Perovskite Precursor Solution and Film Preparation. Nippon sheet glass (10 Ω cm -2 ) was cleaned by sonication in a 2% Hellmanex water solution for 30 min. After being rinsed with deionized water and ethanol, the substrates were further cleaned with UV ozone treatment for 15 min. Subsequently, a 30 nm TiO 2 compact layer was deposited on FTO via spray pyrolysis at 450 °C from a precursor solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis-(acetylacetonate) in anhydrous ethanol. After being sprayed, the substrates were left at 450 °C for 45 min and left to cool to room temperature. Then, a mesoporous TiO 2 layer was deposited by spincoating for 20 s at 4000 rpm with a ramp of 2000 rpm s -1 , using a 30 nm particle paste (Dyesol 30 NR-D) diluted in ethanol to achieve a 150-200 nm thick layer. After the spin-coating, the substrates were dried at 100 °C for 10 min and then sintered again at 450 °C for 30 min under dry air flow. Li-doping of mesoporous TiO 2 , as described elsewhere,  31  is accomplished by spin-coating a 0.1 M solution of Li-TFSI in acetonitrile at 3000 rpm for 10 s followed by another sintering step at 450 °C for 30 min. After being cooled to 150 °C, the substrates were immediately transferred in a nitrogen atmosphere glovebox to deposit the perovskite films. Perovskite Precursor Solution and Film Preparation. The organic cations were purchased from Dyesol, the lead compounds from TCI, and CsI from abcr GmbH. The triple cation perovskite precursor solutions were prepared from a precursor solution containing FAI (1 M), PbI 2 (1.1 M), MABr (0.2 M), and PbBr 2 (0.2 M) in anhydrous DMF/DMSO 4:1 (v/v).  51, 52  Then CsI, which was predissolved in DMSO, was added to this perovskite precursor to achieve the 5 mol % triple cation composition. We note that this composition contains a lead excess as reported elsewhere.  12  The perovskite solution was spin-coated in a two-step program at 1000 and 6000 rpm for 10 and 20 s, respectively. During the second step, 100 μL of chlorobenzene was poured on the spinning substrate 5 s prior to the end of the program. Films with Cs-containing perovskite turned dark immediately after spin-coating. The substrates were then annealed (at 100 °C) for 1 h in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Hole-Transporting Layer and Top Electrode. After the perovskite was annealed, the substrates were cooled for few minutes and a spiro-MeOTAD (Merck) solution (70 mM in chlorobenzene) was spincoated at 4000 rpm for 20 s. Spiro-MeOTAD was doped with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, Sigma-Aldrich), tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III) tris-(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209, Dynamo), and 4-tertbutylpyridine (TBP, Sigma-Aldrich). The molar ratio of additive spiro-MeOTAD was 0.5, 0.03, and 3.3 for Li-TFSI, FK209, and TBP, respectively. Finally, 70-80 nm of the Au top electrode was thermally evaporated under high vacuum. The active area of the device, as defined by the overlap of Au and FTO electrodes, was 0.26 cm -2 . The Cr interlayer between spiro-MeOTAD and Au was thermally evaporated. The vacuum was not broken between evaporation of Cr and Au. J-V and Stability Measurements. The initial efficiency of the record devices was measured under AM 1.5G illumination provided by 450 W xenon lamp (Oriel) fitted with a Schott K113 Tempax filter (Prazisions Glas &amp; Optik GmbH). The light intensity was calibrated with a Si photodiode equipped with an IR cutoff filter (KG3, Schott). All the other J-V curves were measured with a Biologic SP 300 potentiostat under a 1 sun equivalent white LED lamp. The light intensity of the LED lamp was adjusted so that the stabilized J sc of the devices matched their stabilized J sc measured under aforementioned calibrated xenon lamp setup. The devices were masked to 0.16 cm 2 , cooled to 20 °C, and flushed with nitrogen with an in-house developed sample holder. The stability measurements were performed by tracking the maximum power point of the devices illuminated with a white 1 sun equivalent LED lamp with a Biologic SP 300 potentiostat. The MPP was updated every 60 s by a standard perturb and observe method. The temperature of the devices was precisely controlled with a Peltier element in direct contact with the films, and the temperature was measured via a surface thermometer inserted between the Peltier element and the film. Before the beginning of each experiment, J-V curves of the devices were measured (at 10 mV s -1 ). Additionally, J-V curves were taken every 15 min (at 100 mV s -1 ; only backward scan) during the aging in order to track the evolution of J-V metrics. Finally, several hours after the end of the experiment, the J-V characteristics of the devices were remeasured (the devices being stored in the dark, at 20 °C, and under nitrogen flow between the measurements). The experiment shown in Figure  4  with Au electrode removal was performed in the following way. Two devices (pixels) were fabricated on one substrate. J-V characteristics of both pixels were measured, and subsequently, the Au electrode was removed from one pixel. The devices were left in the dark under a nitrogen flow and at 75 °C overnight. Subsequently, the pixel aged with Au was remeasured, and then it had the electrode removed. Finally, the Au electrode was redeposited on both pixels (the process took approximately 1.5 h), and their J-V characteristics were remeasured immediately and then measured again after 7 h or recovery in the dark, under nitrogen flow and 20 °C. ToF-SIMS Spectrometry. A dual-beam ToF-SIMS V (IONTOF) was used with Cs + primary ions (1 keV, 65 to 72 nA, 250 × 250 μm 2 ) for the erosion and a Bi + pulsed primary ion beam for the analysis (30 keV, 1.2 pA, 100 × 100 μm 2 ). The analysis area was centered inside the cesium raster area. The noninterlaced mode was used, with 2.5 s sputtering after each bismuth analysis cycle (128 × 128 pixels). The gold electrodes were connected to the sample holder with carbon tape for a better charge compensation using the electron flood gun. The analyzer reflectron voltage was adjusted 25 V over the cutoff voltage on the secondary ion image. The depth profiles (Figures  3a  and S7 ) were normalized to the SnO 2 -signal (from the FTO substrate). The SnO 2 -interface of the control devices was used as a reference for the fluence scale on each batch of samples. Indeed, the deposited layer thicknesses are similar, although small variations of the cesium sputtering current and of the interface positions are expected in the same batch of measurements. It is important to note that the relative fluence scale of the subsequent layers does not reflect their actual thickness. The apparent thickness of each layer depends on the erosion rate of the cesium primary ion beam in different materials. Although ToF-SIMS is a sensitive analytical technique, the relative secondary ion intensities cannot be related to their relative concentration/amount because it depends on their ionization probability. For a given departing secondary ion, the ionization probability depends on factors such as the surrounding chemical element or the probability of neutralization when it escapes the surface.  49  Hence, a meaningful comparison can only be made for the same element within the same layers for different devices. ToF-SIMS analysis was performed on devices based on FA 0.83 MA 0.17 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 . However, the formulation of the later devices used for aging experiments contained a small addition of Cs. We found identical degradation patterns (Figure  S10 ) for both types of devices, and hence, we concluded that the addition of a small amount of Cs to the perovskite blend does not affect the phenomena of metal-induced degradation of PSCs. ICP Spectrometry. The Au electrodes of complete devices were removed from the samples with a piece of scotch tape. This step was repeated three times using a fresh piece of tape each time. Subsequently, the samples were cut into three pieces (the areas of the electrodes were cut off the central piece), and only the central region which contained the active area was taken for further processing. Next, the samples were immersed in a bath of chlorobenzene for 5 min in order to dissolve the spiro-MeOTAD layer with any remains of Au. Then, each sample was rinsed with chlorobenzene individually, dried, and, finally, placed in a vial containing 10 mL of 4:1 HCl (37%)/HNO 3 (67%) aqua regia. The vials were subsequently sonicated for 1 min, and the samples were left overnight to dissolve. The ICP analysis was performed with Shhimadzu ICPE-9000 on the aqua regia solution diluted in a 1:1 ratio with water. The detection limit for Au was ∼1 ng in 20 mL of the solution. The active area of the device, as defined by the overlap of Au and FTO electrodes in the central part of the device, was 0.26 cm 2 . SEM, XRD, and UV-Visible Absorption Spectrometry. A Zeiss Merlin HR-SEM was used to characterize the morphology of asfabricated device cross sections. XRD and absorption measurements were performed on complete devices, just prior to evaporation of the Au contact. Following Au contact evaporation and subsequent aging, the Au electrode was removed from the devices with a piece of scotch tape and XRD and absorption characterization were repeated. Hence, the aging, absorption, and XRD data shown here were obtained physically from the same devices. XRD analysis was performed using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154178 nm) at a scanning rate of 2°min -1 in the 2θ range from 11 to 40°and separately with a rate of 0.5°min -1 in the range from 12.5 to 15°. UV-visible absorption measurements were performed on a Varian Cary 5. &#13;</text>
