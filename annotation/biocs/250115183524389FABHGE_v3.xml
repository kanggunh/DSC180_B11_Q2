      <text>Realizing solution-processed heterostructures is a long-enduring challenge in halide perovskites because of solvent incompatibilities that disrupt the underlying layer. By leveraging the solvent dielectric constant and Gutmann donor number, we could grow phase-pure two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskite stacks of the desired composition, thickness, and bandgap onto 3D perovskites without dissolving the underlying substrate. Characterization reveals a 3D-2D transition region of 20 nanometers mainly determined by the roughness of the bottom 3D layer. Thickness dependence of the 2D perovskite layer reveals the anticipated trends for n-i-p and p-i-n architectures, which is consistent with band alignment and carrier transport limits for 2D perovskites. We measured a photovoltaic efficiency of 24.5%, with exceptional stability of T 99 (time required to preserve 99% of initial photovoltaic efficiency) of &gt;2000 hours, implying that the 3D/2D bilayer inherits the intrinsic durability of 2D perovskite without compromising efficiency. &#13;</text>

      <text>T he progressive increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solutionprocessed perovskite solar cells (PSCs) (1, 2) has been enabled in part by strategies to passivate the grain boundaries and interfaces between the perovskite absorber and the charge transport layers  (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Twodimensional (2D) halide perovskite (HaP) passivation layers, which have been the most effective in improving the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) and fill factor (FF)  (10) (11) (12) (13) , are commonly grown by spin-coating an organic cation dispersed in isopropyl alcohol or chloroform on top of 3D HaPs  (14, 15) . This coating removes some excess lead iodide (PbI 2 ) from the 3D perovskite layer to then form heterogeneous 2D phases or ultrathin layers of wide-bandgap 2D HaP  (16) (17) (18) . These advances have enhanced durability, as demonstrated recently by Azmi et al., using damp-heat tests  (19) ; however, the lack of control over the phase purity, film thickness, orientation, and structural phase of the 2D HaP has limited their use as an interfacial passivation layer  (20) . A solvent-free growth of the 2D BA 2 PbI 4 perovskite on the 3D film by controlling the pressure, temperature, and time was demonstrated by Jang et al., indicating the importance of a high-quality 3D/2D interface  (21) . However, such solid-state in-plane growth is difficult to scale to large areas. Thus, the fabrication of solution-processed heterostructures of 3D/2D HaP with the desired energy levels, thickness, and orientation has been lacking. We report a solvent design principle for fabricating solution-processed 3D/2D HaP bilayer structures with the desired film thickness and phase purity of any 2D HaP-including Ruddlesden-Popper (RP), Dion-Jacobson (DJ), or alternating cation interlayer (ACI)-described by the general formula of L′A n-1 B n X 3n+1  (DJ)  where L′ is a long-chain organic cation, A is a small monovalent cation, B is a divalent metal, X is a monovalent anion, and n is the number of PbI 6 bonded octahedra along the stacking axis. Our approach leverages two essential properties of the processing solvents, the dielectric constant (e r ) and the Gutmann donor number (D N ), which controls the coordination between the precursor ions and the solvent  (22) . Processing solvents with dielectric constant e r &gt; 30 and Gutmann number, 5 &lt; D N &lt; 18 kcal/mol could effectively dissolve the 2D HaP powders without dissolving or degrading the underlying 3D perovskite film during processing by using spin coating, doctor blading, or slot die coating. Control over the different n value and film thicknesses allowed us to progressively tune the heterostructure from a type I to a type II, with the 2D perovskites acting as a transport layer. We achieved a PCE of 24.5% with a high V OC of 1.20 V in a regular n-i-p device using a RP 2D BA 2 MA 2 Pb 3 I 10 perovskite with a thickness of 50 nm. A comparison of the International Summit on Organic Photostability ISOS-L-1 protocol [maximum power point tracking under ambient conditions] stability of 3D/phasepure 2D (PP-2D) HaP bilayer PSC with the 2D-passivated 3D, control-3D, and control-2D PSCs showed that the 3D/PP-2D HaP bilayer device exhibited exceptional stability with T 99 (time required to preserve 99% of the initial PCE) &gt; 2000 hours. Thus, these structures had the durability of the 2D perovskite films without compromising PCE  (23) . The comprehensive selection criteria for solvents that could selectively dissolve either the 2D or 3D HaP without disrupting the underlying 3D or 2D layer, respectively, were based on the dielectric constant and the Gutmann donor number (Fig.  1A ). These two distinct attributes are correlated. The dielectric constant determines the power of a solvent to dissolve any ionic compound by screening the Coulomb attraction between the ions, whereas the Gutmann donor number describes the Lewis basicity of the solvent and measures the extent to which coordination compounds may form between solvent and cations (high donor number) or between the precursors themselves (low donor number) in the absence of competitive binding of the solvent  (24, 25) . For example, in the precursor solution composed of methylammonium iodide (MAI), formamidinium iodide (FAI), and PbI 2, a solvent with a high Gutmann number would strongly coordinate with divalent metal centers (Pb 2+ ) and suppress the formation of molecular clusters {for example, iodoplumbates such as [PbI 6-x (solvent) x ] - (4-x) , where x ≤ 6} that would otherwise form in a solvent with low Gutmann number. The strength of these interactions determined the differences in the solubility of the 3D and 2D HaP powders in various solvents (Fig.  1A ). Typical vials of RP 2D (BA 2 MAPb 2 I 7 ) and the 3D HaP powders (Fig.  1B ) illustrate their solubility in different solvents. Polar aprotic solvents (Fig.  1A , green dots) with a dielectric constant &gt; 30, such as N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), fully dissolved both 3D and 2D HaP. Solvents such as acetonitrile (MeCN), tetramethyl sulfone (TMS), propylene carbonate (PC), and ethylene carbonate (EC) also have a dielectric constant &gt; 30 but did not dissolve the 3D HaP powders because their weak Lewis basicity (D N &lt; 18 kcal/mol) made the formation of Pb 2+ solvent coordination complexes unlikely. However, these solvents completely dissolved the 2D perovskite powders. This difference is consistent with 3D perovskite lattices being more stable and difficult to disrupt with solvents of intermediate D N than the 2D perovskites and implied the presence of additional favorable interactions of these solvents with the organic spacer cations (readily accessible from the edges of the slabs) that were absent in the 3D perovskites. We observed that both nonpolar (Fig.  1A , blue dots) and polar protic solvents (Fig.  1A , red dots) did not completely dissolve the 2D HaP powders (Fig.  1B ). As controls, we also tested solvents with a high Gutmann number and low dielectric constant, such as tetrahydrofuran (D N = 20 kcal/mol, e r = 7.6), and vice versa, such as nitromethane (NME) (D N = 2.7 kcal/mol, e r = 35.9), both of which did not dissolve the 2D perovskite powders (figs. S1 and S2). Taken together, these results implied that solvents with a dielectric constant &gt; 30 and the Gutmann number 5 &lt; D N &lt; 18 kcal/mol should enable the fabrication of 3D/2D HaP bilayers without disrupting or degrading the underlying 3D HaP film. To fabricate 3D/2D HaP bilayers with different phases of 2D perovskite and having desired n values and thicknesses, we tested the solubility of the archetypical RP 2D perovskites (BA 2 MA n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 , with n = 1 to 4) and other crystal phases such as DJ [(4AMP)MAPb 2 I 7 ] and ACI [(GA)MA 2 Pb 2 I 7 ] in the identified 2D perovskite-selective solvents (Fig.  1C ). Because of its high polarity, propylene carbonate dissolved the 2D RP phases better than tetramethyl sulfone or acetonitrile. In general, we observed an overall decrease in the solubility of RP 2D HaPs with increasing n value, from &gt;100 mg/ml for n = 1 to 30 to 40 mg/ml for n = 4. The decrease in the solubility as a function of increasing n value was consistent with the increase in inorganic lattice fraction of the 2D HaP as the n value approached 3D composition. In addition, the n = 2 ACI and DJ perovskites exhibited low solubilities of 20 to 40 mg/ml and 10 to 25 mg/ml, respectively, which was consistent with the structure of ACI and DJ 2D perovskites, which was near that of 3D with short interlayer cations that reflected the role of organic spacer cations in the dissolution process. Of all the target solvents, the high The protocols for fabricating the 3D/2D HaP bilayer by use of spin coating, drop-casting, blade coating, or slot-die coating (Fig.  1D ) followed our recent work on obtaining PP-2D HaP films. We created a stable dispersion of 2D perovskite seed solution by dissolving the parent crystal powders in MeCN (fig.  S5  and supplementary text)  (26, 27) . In general, other than the solvents with Gutmann number 5 &lt; D N &lt; 18 kcal/mol, any Pb 2+ -weakly coordinating solvents such as DMF, GBL, and DMAc compared with DMSO can produce a dispersion of 2D perovskite seed solution. The precursor solution with 2D perovskite seeds was coated on top of a 3D HaP layer [Cs 0.05 (MA 0.10 FA 0.85 )Pb(I 0.90 Br 0.10 ) 3 ] and then annealed at 80°C for 5 min. We also used other scalable techniques such as doctor blading, drop-casting, and blade-coating (fig.  S6 ) to demonstrate the industrial viability of the process. By controlling the concentration and deposition technique, we tuned the thickness of the 2D perovskite layer on top of the 3D film ranging from sub-10 nm to submicrometer scales (fig.  S7 ). Using the design approach described in Fig.  1 , we fabricated a 3D/2D HaP [RP BA 2 MA n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 (n = 1 to 4)] bilayer stack and characterized its phase purity using x-ray diffraction (XRD), optical absorbance, and photoluminescence (PL) techniques. The XRD pattern for the control-3D and 3D/2D HaP bilayers with different 2D RP BA 2 MA n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 perovskite (n = 1 to 4) (Fig.  2A ), matching the low-angle Bragg peaks with the corresponding simulated patterns suggested that the overlying 2D HaP layer had high phase purity (fig.  S8 ). The phase purity was further confirmed with absorbance (Fig.  2B ) and PL (Fig.  2C ) measurements. The optical absorbance revealed the presence of a 3D HaP band-edge at 1.6 eV for the control film, which was accompanied by a sharp excitonic peak varying from 2.4 eV (n = 1) to 1.9 eV (n = 4) corresponding to the different n values in the 3D/2D bilayer. The steady-state PL measurements further confirmed the phase purity of the 3D/2D HaP bilayers. We did not observe any change in the bandgap of the underlying 3D HaP, indicating that the presence of the 2D HaP layer did not disrupt the 3D perovskite. &#13;</text>

      <text> of 6 To further assess the spatial homogeneity of the 3D/2D HaP bilayer, we monitored the PL emission centered at the 3D peak (1.6 eV) and the 2D peak (n = 2, 2.15 eV) using confocal microscopy (Fig.  2D ). We observed a uniform emission over a large area of 20 by 20 mm from the 2D as well as the underlying 3D HaP layer, confirming the homogeneity of the 3D/2D HaP bilayer stack. These measurements indicated that we had grown highly crystalline PP-2D HaP of varying n values on the 3D surface. This fabrication process also worked well with the pure FAPbI 3 and MAPbI 3 3D HaP, demonstrating its broad applicability (fig.  S9 ). We used several techniques to characterize the interface between the 3D and PP-2D layers. The time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) depth profile of the control 3D (Fig.  3A ) and 3D/PP-2D HaP bilayer (Fig.  3B ) revealed the distribution of ions as a function of film thickness. Upon introduction of BA 2 MAPb 2 I 7 2D perovskite layer on top of the 3D film, in addition to the Cs 2 I + and Cs 2 Br + ions and CH 5 N 2 + (FA + ) cations, we observed higher intensity of the C 4 H 12 N + (BA + ) compared with the background BA + intensity (supplementary text) and CH 6 N + (MA + ) ions. These ions were uniformly distributed for a thickness of 50 nm, after which there was a sharp decrease in the concentration. Fitting the change in intensity of the BA + to the background (representing no BA) yielded an interface transition of 20 nm from the top 2D layer to the underlying 3D HaP. The TOF-SIMS measurements of the 3D|PP-2D (RP BA 2 MA 2 Pb 3 I 10 ) bilayer stack show similar results (fig.  S10 ). The grazing incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) spectra of the 3D/PP-2D HaP bilayer for different incident angles (or depth) (Fig.  3, C  and D ) shows the presence of horizontal oriented BA 2 MAPb 2 I 7 2D HaP on the surface (a = 0.08°) and the 3D HaP (Cs 0.05 (MA 0.10 FA 0.85 )Pb(I 0.90 Br 0.10 ) 3 ] in the form of rings at the bottom (a = 0.5°) (fig.  S11  and supplementary text). This result is well correlated with the calculated x-ray penetration depth curve for the RP-2D HaP, showing a critical angle (a c ) of 0.181°(Fig.  3E )  (28, 29) . The integrated area under the (020) peak (2D signature feature) and the (111)/(001) peak (3D signature feature) from the GIWAXS spectra for various incident angles (0°to 0.5°) (Fig.  3F ) revealed the 3D/PP-2D interface at an incident angle of 0.2°. The integrated area under the (020) peak became invariant, whereas the (111)/(001) increased, which confirmed the presence of a 2D HaP layer with a thickness of 50 to 60 nm stacked on top of the 3D HaP film as estimated from the penetration depth curve. The BA 2 MA 2 Pb 3 I 10 2D HaP shows a mixed orientation in the 3D/PP-2D (n = 3, RP) HaP bilayer stack with similar interfacial characteristics (detailed GIWAXS analysis is available in fig.  S12 ). The presence of some texture in the same orientation as in the n = 3, RP perovskite is required for efficient charge transfer through the 2D perovskite, resulting in the efficient 3D/PP-2D bilayer HaP solar cells (Fig.  4 )  (26, 27) . bilayer stack also showed similar interfacial characteristics (fig.  S14 ). All of these results demonstrated that our solvent design strategy allowed for the fabrication of 3D/PP-2D bilayers with a high-quality interface without destroying or altering the crystallinity of the underlying 3D perovskite. We fabricated solar cells with the 3D/PP-2D HaP bilayer perovskites and measured their performance and durability. We first created an energy-level diagram for the 2D HaP, RP BA 2 MA n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 (n = 1 to 4), with the 3D perovskite Cs 0.05 (MA 0.10 FA 0.85 )Pb(I 0.90 Br 0.10 ) 3 (Fig.  4A ) according to values predicted from first-principles calculations (fig.  S15 ) and corroborated with photoemission yield spectroscopy (PES) and absorption measurements  (30)  (figs. S16 to S18). We observed a type II band alignment between the 3D and the n = 3 2D HaP with a near-perfect alignment of valence band edges for 3D and 2D HaP, which is ideal for extracting holes but presents a large energy barrier for electrons (fig.  S19 ). The 3D/PP-2D (n = 1, n = 2) HaP bilayer stack shows a type I alignment, which was further confirmed by fabricating solar cells showing a barrier for charge extraction using higher thicknesses of the corresponding 2D layers (supplementary text and fig.  S20 ). As a result, we fabricated n-i-p PSCs with the architecture FTO/SnO 2 /3D/PP-2D (n = 3)/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, controlling the PP-2D (n = 3) HaP thickness by spin-coating different concentrations of 2D perovskite solution in MeCN (fig.  S21 ). The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics for three selected thicknesses of 2D HaP layers are shown in Fig.  4B , with 3D HaP as the control. For n-i-p cells, increased 2D HaP thickness from 0 to 50 nm increased V OC from 1.09 to 1.20 V. This increase in the V OC was accompanied by a slight increase in the FF from 0.80 to 0.84, and even a small increase in J SC from 23.54 to 24.34 mA/cm 2 resulting in a peak PCE of 24.5% for a 2D HaP thickness of 50 nm with no hysteresis (figs. S22 and S23). The PCE as a function of 2D HaP thickness shows that increasing the 2D HaP thickness beyond 50 nm decreased the overall PCE (Fig.  4C ). We attributed this decrease in PCE to the reduced transport of the free charge carriers from 3D to the 2D HaP limited by the &lt;100 nm diffusion length for a polycrystalline 2D n = 3, RP HaP film with mixed orientation (31, 32) (PV statistics are provided in fig.  S23 ). However, the p-i-n devices with ITO/PTAA/3D/PP-2D(n = 3)/C60/ BCP/Cu exhibited an increase in PCE for a 2D HaP thickness of 5 nm, which is consistent with recent studies of 2D/3D interfaces with an ultrathin 2D layer passivation followed by a drastic decrease for higher thicknesses of 2D HaP (Fig.  4C , black curve, and figs. S24 and S25)  (33, 34) . The reduction in PCE was consistent with the energy band diagram (Fig.  4A  and fig.  S19B ), which showed a large barrier to electron collection in the p-i-n geometry. To understand the increase in PV parameters (J SC , V OC , and FF) of the 3D/PP-2D HaP bilayer solar cells, we performed optical and self-consistent transport modeling to simulate the PV characteristics that are supported by the surface photovoltage (SPV), steady-state PL, and time-resolved PL measurements. The optical modeling revealed that the 2D HaP layer increased the photogeneration of the bilayer stack and improved J SC (fig.  S26 ). This result was consistent with the observed increase in the J SC by 1.5 mA/cm 2 as we went from the 3D control to the champion 3D/PP-2D HaP bilayer device, validated by external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements shown in Fig.  4D  and the change in EQE (DEQE) between them (figs. S27 and S28 and supplementary text). The self-consistent transport simulation predicted reduced recombination at the 3D/HTL interface after the introduction of a 2D HaP layer, improving the V OC and FF (fig.  S29 ). To We tested the long-term operational stability of our 3D/PP-2D bilayer encapsulated device following the ISOS-L-1 protocol (Fig.  4G )  (23) . After 2000 hours of continuous illumination, the 3D/PP-2D HaP bilayer device showed negligible degradation with T 99 &gt; 2000 hours, whereas the control 3D device lost 25% of its initial PCE. As controls, we also measured the stability of the 3D PSC passivated with a spin-coated organic cation, butylammonium iodide, and compared it with our 3D/PP-2D PSCs using the same conditions. The 2D HaP passivated 3D PSCs show a 10% loss of efficiency after 1000 hours of continuous operation, which is consistent with other recent reports  (4, 19) . We also measured a pure 2D HaP control device, which showed a T 97 &gt; 1500 hours, implying that the 3D/PP-2D bilayer perovskite has acquired the inherent stability of the 2D perovskite material.   &#13;</text>

      <text> Phase-selective 2D perovskite thin film formation Step 1: High purity 2D perovskite powder synthesis: The 2D Ruddlesden popper perovskite parent-crystals of different n-values thicknesses, BA2MAn-1PbnI3n+1 were synthesized using our previously reported method where lead oxide (PbO, Sigma Aldrich, 99%), methylamine hydrochloride (MACl, Sigma Aldrich, ≥98%) and butylamine (BA, Sigma Aldrich, 99.5%) was mixed in appropriate stoichiometry in a mixture of hydroiodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in H2O) and hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2, 50% in H2O). The solution was stirred to a temperature of 240 C until all the precursors were dissolved, and the solution started boiling. Then, the precursor solution was allowed to cool down at room temperature which led to the crystallization of flat single crystals of micrometer to millimeter size. The quality and phase purity of the synthesized were verified by a combination of x-ray diffraction and absorbance measurements. Step 2: Solution processing and film fabrication: To obtain phase-pure (PP) 2D perovskite thin films, we dissolved the high purity 2D perovskite powders in acetonitrile (MeCN, Sigma Aldrich, &gt;99.9%) by stirring overnight at room temperature. Further 70 μl of the prepared solution was instantly dropped and spin-coated over substrates at 4000 r.p.m for 200 s followed by heating at 80℃ for 3-5 min resulting in the formation of the 2D perovskite thin films. &#13;</text>

      <text> Regular Planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs): The glass/FTO substrates (Kaivo Tech., &lt; 15Ω/sq) were sequentially cleaned using soap water, water, acetone, and acetone: ethanol (1:1) by ultrasonication for 15 min. The substrates were further dried under clean dry air and left for UV-ozone for 30 min. To grow the electron transport layer (ETL), the SnO2 colloid precursor solution obtained from Alfa Aesar (tin (IV) oxide, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion) was diluted by water to 2.67%, followed by spin coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Further, the SnO2 films were baked in ambient air at 150 ºC for 30 min. Before transferring it to the glove box, the ETL substrates were placed in UV-ozone for 15 min to improve the wetting properties. The triple cation (TC) perovskite solution, Cs5(MA0.10FA0.90)95Pb(I0.90Br0.10)3 was prepared by mixing 1.09 M lead iodide (perovskite grade, TCI America), 1.0 M Formamidinium iodide (FAI, Greatcell), 0.22 M lead bromide (PbBr2, Sigma Aldrich) and 0.2 M methylammonium bromide (MABr, Greatcell) in a mixture of N, N-dimethyl formamide, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMF: DMSO, 4:1). The solution was further mixed with 5 vol% of 1.5 M cesium iodide (CsI, Sigma Aldrich) dissolved in DMSO, and left under stirring for 3 h at 70 ºC. The 70 μl of the solution was further spread in the middle of the ETL substrate and spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s, and 6000 rpm for 20 s with an acceleration of 2000 rpm/s, followed by annealing at 100 ºC for 30-40 min. The 3D/PP-2D bilayer stack was fabricated using the technique described in the supplementary methods section 1.1. Following this, the spiro-MeOTAD (1-Material) acting as the hole transport layer (HTL) was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 4000 rpm for 20 s, where 1 ml Spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (90 mg ml -1 ) solution was employed with the addition of 20 μl Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (520 mg ml -1 ) and 34 μl tBP. Finally, the Au electrode was thermally evaporated at a pressure of &lt;2x10 -6  torr. The active area was 0.5 cm 2 . &#13;</text>

      <text> Inverted Planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs): The patterned glass/ITO substrates were sequentially cleaned with soap water, deionized water, acetone, and acetone: ethanol (1:1) under ultrasonication for 15 min each. After drying the substrates and cleaning using the UV-ozone for 30 min, the substrates were transferred to the glove box, where an HTL of ~8 nm thickness was made of poly(triarylamine) (PTAA, Sigma Aldrich) with a concentration of 2 mg/ml in chlorobenzene by spin coating at 6000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 150 ˚C for 10 min. The TC perovskite precursor solution of 1.5 M was prepared by mixing PbI2, FAI, MABr, PbBr2, and CsI in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (4:1), to obtain a composition of Cs5(MA0.10FA0.90)95Pb(I0.90Br0.10)3. A two-step spincoating protocol of 1000 rpm for 10 s and 6000 rpm for 20 s with an acceleration of 2000 rpm/s was utilized to obtain uniform coverage of the perovskite film. The samples were further annealed at 100 ˚C for 30-40 min. The 3D/PP-2D bilayer stack was fabricated using the technique described in the supplementary methods section 1.1. Finally, the devices were completed by thermally evaporating C60 (30 nm), BCP (1 nm), and Copper (100 nm) under a vacuum of &lt;2x10 -6 torr. The active area chosen was 0.5 cm 2 . &#13;</text>

      <text> Optical absorbance and photoluminescence measurements Thin-film photoluminescence (PL): Steady-State Photoluminescence (SS-PL) was acquired through a lab-built confocal microscopy system. Spectra were collected using a spectrometer (Andor Kymera 329i) and a CCD (Andor iDus 416), then fit using a Savitzky-Golay filtering. The samples were photo-excited at 2.58 eV (480 nm) using a monochromatic pulsed laser (6ps pulse, repetition rate 78.1 MHz, NKT Photonics SuperK Fianium) focused near diffraction limit (~0.5um resolution) with excitation intensity tuned at 360 W/cm 2 . Data were collected from 450 -900 nm using a dwell time of 0.1 s with samples under vacuum (10 -5 torr) at room temperature. PL maps were measured for a 40 µm x 40 µm region or a 100 µm x 100 µm with a step size of 1 µm, where the peak position was extracted at each step. Thin-film absorbance: Film absorbance measurements were performed by illuminating the samples with monochromatic light modulated at 2 kHz coming from a quartztungsten-halogen light source fed into a monochromator (SpectraPro HRS 300, Princeton instruments). Synchronous detection of the transmitted light was achieved with a silicon photodiode hooked to an SR865 lock-in amplifier. Data was collected from 400 -800 nm using a dwell time of 0.1 s. During all measurements, the samples were kept under a vacuum (~10 -4 torr) and at room temperature. &#13;</text>

      <text> Time-resolved PL: The TRPL of the 3D and 3D/2D perovskite film deposited on the ITO/SnO2 substrate was measured using a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments FLS1000). The sample was excited by a 405 nm pulsed laser (60 μW/cm 2 at 1 MHz repetition rate) on the perovskite side, and the time-resolved emission was collected at the peak of the PL. The obtained TRPL decay was fitted using a tri-exponential function and convoluted with the instrument response function (IRF). The carrier lifetime of each of the samples was calculated based on a weighted average of the fitted decay. &#13;</text>

      <text> Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurements Positive high mass resolution depth profiles were performed using a ToF-SIMS NCS instrument, which combines a TOF.SIMS instrument (ION-TOF GmbH, Münster, Germany) and an in-situ Scanning Probe Microscope (NanoScan, Switzerland) at Shared Equipment Authority from Rice University. The analysis field of view was 80 × 80 μm 2 (Bi3 + @ 30 keV, 0.35 pA) with a raster of 128 x 128 along with the depth profile. A charge compensation with an electron flood gun has been applied during the analysis. An adjustment of the charge effects has been operated using a surface potential of -36V and an extraction bias of 0V. The cycle times was fixed to 90 μs (corresponding to m/z = 0-735 a.m.u mass range). The sputtering raster was 450 × 450 μm 2 (Cs + @ 1 keV, 44 nA). The beams were operated in non-interlaced mode, alternating 1 analysis cycle and 1 frame of sputtering (corresponding to 1.31s) followed by a pause of 2 s for the charge compensation. The MCsn + (n = 1, 2) depth profiling has also been used to improve the understanding of the data. This is a useful method, mainly applied to quantify the alloys but also to identify any ion compounds. The cesium primary beam is used for sputtering during the depth profile and permits the detection of MCs + or MCs2 + cluster ions where M is the element of interest combined with one or two Cs atoms. The advantages of following MCs + and MCs2 + ions during ToF-SIMS analysis include reducing matrix effects and the possibility of detecting the compounds from both electronegative and electropositive elements and compounds. All depth profiles have been point-to-point normalized by the total ion intensity and the data have been plotted using a 5-points adjacent averaging. Both normalization and smoothing have permitted a better comparison of the data from the different samples. The depth calibrations have been established based on the measured thicknesses using the surface profiler to obtain a line scan of the craters with the in-situ SPM by contact scanning. &#13;</text>

      <text> Grazing incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) Experimental methods: All synchrotron GIWAXS patterns used in this paper were measured at beamline 8-ID-E at the Advanced Photon Source (APS)  (40) . Samples were mounted on a custom grazing incident scattering sample wheel and were measured inside a vacuum chamber (10 -4 torr) to prevent degradation. The Pilatus 1M (Dectris) area detector was 217mm away from the sample. The X-ray beam energy was 10.91keV and the beam size was 200𝜇𝑚 x 20𝜇𝑚 (Height vs Vertical). All GIWAXS patterns were corrected with experimental conditions (detector sensitivity, X-ray polarization, and geometrical solid-angle parameters)  (41) . The GIWAXS patterns were processed using the GIXSGUI package running on Matlab 2018b. &#13;</text>

      <text> GIWAXS Analysis: To analyse the GIWAXS patterns, we performed a full angular integration to extract a 1-D X-ray spectrum. We used the Debye-Scherrer formula to extract the average grain size (Dhkl) of the 2D/3D perovskite thin film (hkl is the miller indices)  (42) . The (020) plane was used for the analysis of the 2D perovskite top film and the (001) plane was used for the 3D perovskite film. A shape factor (K) of 0.9 was used in the Scherrer equation. The formula is given as the following 𝐷 ℎ𝑘𝑙 = 𝐾𝜆 𝛽 ℎ𝑘𝑙 cos 𝜃 ℎ𝑘𝑙 (1) where 𝜆 is 1.1365 Å and is the X-ray wavelength, 𝜃 is the diffraction peak position, 𝛽 is the full-with-at-half-max (FWHM). The FWHM was extracted by fitting the diffraction profile to a pseudo-Voigt function  (43) . The FWHM was correct for the measurement geometry such as the X-ray beam divergence, energy bandwidth, and the parallax effect of the beam footprint  (44) . Penetration depth curve: The penetration depth calculation was performed by using the GIXA calculator in  https://gixa.ati.tuwien.ac.at/tools/penetrationdepth.xhtml . Here we use the materials constants of the Z, average atomic number, A, average atomic mass (g/mol), p, mass density (g./cm 3 ), and 𝛍, the linear attenuation coefficient. &#13;</text>

      <text> Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy measurements Surface photovoltage measurements: Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) experiments were performed using an Asylum Research MFP-3D atomic force microscope (AFM) mounted on an inverted Nikon Eclipse microscope. The tips used were Pt-coated silicon tips (MikroMasch HQ: NSC15/Pt, 325 kHz, and 40 N/m). All measurements were collected using a flow cell in a nitrogen environment. Amplitude modulated (AM) SKPM was used with a lift height of 30 nm. For surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements, the samples were illuminated from the bottom (glass side) using a 590 nm orange LED (2.39 mW/cm 2 ) with the LED spot focused on the surface and co-aligned with the tip. SKPM images were collected in the dark and under illumination in the same area, and the CPD values were allowed to equilibrate before they were used to determine the SPV. This process was repeated for at least three 4 x 4 μm 2 areas used for averaging. Here, we use the convention where CPD is equal to the sign of the voltage on the tip, meaning a more positive CPD corresponds to a smaller work function (closer to vacuum). &#13;</text>

      <text> Extraction of the size of the particles in solution: The analysis of the multi-angle DLS data obtained for different concentrations of precursor solutions are detailed below. The angular dependence of the autocorrelation curve was measured for each solution. The obtained correlation curves were fitted using a single-exponential decay model. Also, the resulting correlation fitting residuals were calculated and plotted followed by linear regression of Γ vs q 2 between 30° and 150°. The scattered light correlation function, g (2) , compares the intensity of the received signal between time t and later time t+τ,(  45 ) 𝑔 (2) (𝑞, 𝜏) = &lt;𝐼(𝑡)𝐼(𝑡+𝜏)&gt; &lt;𝐼(𝑡) 2 &gt; (2) We use the Siegert relationship to relate the intensity correlation function and the field correlation function which is given (  45 ) 𝑔 (2) (𝑞, 𝜏) -1 = 𝛽|𝑔 (1) (𝑞, 𝜏)| 2 where β is a constant proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio. For a system undergoing Brownian motion, the electric field correlation function is shown to decay exponentially as 𝑔 (1) (𝑞, 𝜏) = exp (-Γ𝜏) For several groups of particles with different sizes (labeled as i) are present in the solution, the DLS data can be fitted using  (46) : 𝑔 (2) (𝑞, 𝜏) -1 = ∑ 𝛼 𝑖 𝑖 |𝑔 𝑖 (1) (𝑞, 𝜏)| 2 = ∑ 𝛼 𝑖 𝑖 |exp (-Γ 𝑖 𝜏)| 2 (5) Then, for the group of particles i the value Γ 𝑖 is related to the translational diffusion coefficient 𝐷 𝑇,𝑖 and wave number q through Γ 𝑖 = 𝐷 𝑇,𝑖 𝑞 2 (6) with, 𝑞 = 4𝜋𝜂 𝜆 sin ( 𝜃 2 ) (7) 𝜂 is the refractive index of the solvent, 𝜆 is the wavelength of the laser, and𝜃 is the angle between the incident laser beam and the scattered light.

      <text> Determination of electronic band levels using Photoemission yield spectroscopy (PES) The PES (AC-2, Riken-Keiki) measurements were used to obtain the valance band maximum (VBM) of the 3D, 2D (BA2MA2Pb3I10, Ruddlesden-popper), and 3D/2D perovskite. The samples were illuminated by a monochromatic ultra-violet (UV) light under ambient conditions. The UV photon with energy higher than the ionization energy (I.E) of the sample to be measured, was used to ionize an electron to the vacuum level. This electron can ionize a gas molecule in proximity to the surface which is measured by the detector. For a typical measurement, the energy of the photons varies between 4.2 eV to 6.2 eV, and the number of generated photoelectrons is measured for each energy. This value is corrected according to the intensity spectrum of the UV lamp. For semiconductors, the number of photo-generated electrons near the VBM generally increases as a cube root of the energy. Hence the cube root of the corrected PYSA spectrum is plotted against the photon energy. The linear region of the plot above the onset is fitted to find the VBM, at the crossing of the linear fit and the background level. The conduction band minimum (CBM) with respect to the vacuum level (electron affinity (EA)), is calculated by subtracting the measured bandgap from the ionization energy. &#13;</text>

      <text> DFT simulation for band alignments of 3D/2D heterostructure DFT-based(48) calculations were performed using SIESTA  (49)  with a basis set of finiterange of numerical atomic orbitals. For structural optimization, we used the van der Waals density functional with C09 exchange(50) within the van der Waals DF2 flavor to describe the exchange-correlation term (we modified SIESTA version "master-post-4.1-251" to include DF2 flavor). This tuning was suggested to improve C09-based geometry optimization over that with the original DF1 flavor  (51) . The latter has already proven to provide a good description of experimental lattice constants similar to those obtained with optimized GGA-based PBEsol functional in solids  (52) . Norm-conserving Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials were used for each atomic species to account for the core electrons  (53) . 1s 1 , 2s 2 2p 2 , 2s 2 2p 3 , 5s 2 5p 5 and 5d 10 6s 2 6p 2 3s 2 3p 4 were used as valence electrons for H, C, N, I, Pb respectively. A Polarized Double-zeta (DZP) basis set with an energy shift of 200 meV and a real space mesh grid energy cut-off of 400 Rydberg were used for the calculations. We used 8x8x8 and 4x4x1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grids for the bulk and heterostructure systems, respectively. For band alignments, we used single-point calculations with GGA-PBE functional combined with DFT-1/2, including spin-orbit coupling on top of vdwDF2-C09 optimized structures  (54) . Spin-orbit coupling (SOC), when used, was considered in its on-site approximation as proposed by Fernàndez-Seivane et al.  (55) . For the heterostructure construction, we used the doubled cubic cells in the plane of the perovskite to lattice match it to the 2D layer cell. This cell doubling corresponds to multiplying the cubic lattice constant by √2 (𝑎 ℎ𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑜 = √2𝑎 𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘 ). For the heterostructure using 2D-based BA, we used the room-temperature structure of BA2PbI4  (56) . For the n=2-4, we used the structures reported in Ref.  (57) . We considered 9 octahedral layers for the 3D FA Cs PbI3(FA Cs = FA replaced with Cs) to mimic the 3D part of the heterostructure  (58) . The in-plane lattice constants of the 3D part were imposed for the whole heterostructure and were not allowed to relax during the 2D/3D interface geometry optimization. We only allowed the c-lattice constant along z to relax along with the atomic positions. Moreover, the two surface octahedral layers of the 3D perovskite part were allowed to relax while keeping the bulk-like regions frozen to the positions of the optimized bulk structure. This strategy allows capture of the surface effects during the relaxation while maintaining the integrity of the bulk region of heterostructures, which is useful for the energy level alignment. We used the fast-inertial relaxation engine (FIRE) algorithm  (59)  for the different relaxations and the maximum force was set to 0.06 eV/Å. For the absolute valence energy level alignment, we constructed slabs from the experimental bulk structures for both 2D and 3D systems. FA Cs PbI3 was used for the 3D slab while the Ruddlesden-Popper phase n=1-4 was used for the 2D. The absolute valence energy levels of the different systems were computed using the Hartree potential alignment with the vacuum level set as the reference. Here, the absolute valence energy level 𝐸 𝑣 𝑎𝑏𝑠 is obtained using: 𝐸 𝑣 𝑎𝑏𝑠 = 𝑉𝐵𝑀 𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘 + ∆𝑉 𝐻 + ∆𝐸 𝑣𝑎𝑐𝑢𝑢𝑚 (9) where 𝑉𝐵𝑀 𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘 is the valence band maximum of the bulk system, ∆𝑉 𝐻 = 𝑉 𝐻 𝑠𝑙𝑎𝑏 -𝑉 𝐻 𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘 is the shift of the Hartree potential between the slab and the bulk systems, and ∆𝐸 𝑣𝑎𝑐𝑢𝑢𝑚 = 0 -𝐸 𝑣𝑎𝑐𝑢𝑢𝑚 is the vacuum level shift with respect to zero energy level. 𝑉𝐵𝑀 𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘 is corrected using the DFT-1/2 method. For the conduction band, we added to 𝐸 𝑣 𝑎𝑏𝑠 the experimentally reported electronic band gaps. This then gives, 𝐸 𝑐 𝑎𝑏𝑠 = 𝐸 𝑣 𝑎𝑏𝑠 + 𝐸 𝑔 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (10) &#13;</text>

      <text> Solar cell devices characterization Solar cell performances: The performances of the solar cells were obtained by measuring the current-voltage (J-V) curves of each device illuminated by an ABB solar simulator from Newport (model 94011). The arc simulator modeled AM 1.5G irradiance of 100 mW/cm 2 whose intensity was calibrated using a NIST-certified Si solar cell (Newport 91150V, ISO 17025) and corrected by measuring the spectral mismatch between the solar spectrum, reference cell, and the spectral response of the PV device. We estimate a mismatch factor of 3%. The solar cells were measured with a Keithley 2401 instrument from 1.2 to 0 V and back, with a step size of 0.05 V and a dwell time of 0.1 s, after light soaking for 10 s. The defined active area was 0.5 cm 2 . External quantum efficiency: The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the solar cell devices was collected by first illuminating each device with monochromatic light modulated at 2 kHz coming from a quartz-tungsten-halogen light source fed into a monochromator (SpectraPro HRS 300, Princeton instruments). The photocurrent response of the solar cells was measured by an SR865 lock-in amplifier. The light source spectrum response was calibrated using a calibrated silicon diode (FDS1010, Thorlabs). Stability tests: For stability test measurements, the perovskite devices were encapsulated with a UV-curable epoxy (Poland Inc.) and a glass coverslip as a barrier layer in an argonfilled glove box. Argon gas was blown over the devices to remove any contaminants or dust particles just before encapsulation. All the devices were tested at the continuous maximum power point condition, under full-spectrum simulated AM 1.5G (100 mA cm -2 irradiance) in the air using an ABB solar simulator (94011A, Newport) -ISOS-L1 protocol. Each data point was collected after an interval of 15 min. The relative humidity was measured to be constant at 70 ± 5 %RH and the operating temperature was 60± 5 ˚C. &#13;</text>

      <text> Device simulation Optical Modelling: Optical absorption in different layers of the PV cell is calculated by the full-wave solution of Maxwell's equations with the input of AM 1.5G illumination. The materials in different layers of the cell are characterized by absorption coefficient and refractive indices that are obtained from the literature  (60) (61) (62) (63) (64)  or measured data by the authors. Transfer matrix method (TMM)  (65)  calculations are used for the optical studies of the planar cell structure. In this approach, the entire solar cell stack, including the contact layers, is modeled using a series of interface and phase matrices. The central quantity which is calculated in this approach is the point-wise optical absorbance [A(λ,r)] inside various layers of the cell. The wavelength range of 300-1500 nm has been used for our calculations (see Fig.  S26A-D ). The spatially resolved absorption profile is integrated over the wavelength range to create the generation profile for the electron and holes for self-consistent carrier transport simulation as described below. Self-consistent transport simulation: The transport of charged carriers (electrons and holes) is modeled by generalized drift-diffusion formalism  (66) . Photo-generation is calculated from the optical absorption profile (integrated over the wavelengths) discussed previously. The electron and hole transport inside the cell is stimulated by a self-consistent solution of Poisson and continuity equations by a commercial-grade device simulator MEIDCI TM  (67)  The generation term in the e-h continuity equations is calculated from the solution of a photo-generated profile. The recombination term in continuity consists of direct and Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination with lifetime found in the literature. We do not account for hot electron effects. The excitons -if anyare presumed to dissociate into free electron and hole pairs immediately after generation. For all the simulations (including different thicknesses), we consider four quantum wells for the 2D perovskite layer throughout the film thickness, which gives 4 lower bandgap wells along with 5 high bandgap barriers. We assume the distance of those potential wells is uniformly distributed in the model. The thickness of each potential well is thus the thickness of full film divided by nine. For example, for perovskite thickness of 45 nm, 30 nm, 18 nm, 6 nm, the thickness of quantum well is 5 nm, 3.33 nm, 2 nm, 0.66 nm, respectively. See Table  S1  for model equations and see Table  S2  to S7 for simulation parameters. The parameters with references are taken from the literature; the rest are assumed to match the data for 2D and 3D perovskite layers. To follow the trend of experimental results we used quantum wells with a depth of 35 𝑚𝑒𝑉 at both conduction and valence band. Therefore, the bandgap in the quantum well is 70 𝑚𝑒𝑉 lower than the outside. We note that optical simulations do not account for the variations in microstructural properties such as interface roughness, orientation, and film morphology in solving this model.              volatility of MeCN [boiling point (b.p.) ≈ 82°C] compared with those of the others-such as TMS (b.p. ≈ 285°C), PC (b.p. ≈ 242°C), and EC (b.p. ≈ 248°C)-made it attractive for lowtemperature processing without affecting the stability of the entire stack (figs. S3 and S4 and movies S1 and S2). We focused on the solvent MeCN for fabricating the targeted 3D/2D HaP bilayer. &#13;</text>
