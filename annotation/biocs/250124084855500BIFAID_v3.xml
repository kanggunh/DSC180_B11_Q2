      <text>Engineering two-/three-dimensional (2D/3D) perovskite solar cells is nowadays a popular strategy for efficient and stable devices. However, the exact function of the 2D/3D interface in controlling the long-term device behavior is still obscure. Here, we reveal a dynamical structural mutation of the 2D/3D interface: the small cations in the 3D cage move towards the 2D layer, which acts as an ion scavenger. If structurally stable, the 2D layer physically blocks the ion movement at the interface boosting the device stability. Otherwise, the 2D layer embeds them, dynamically self-transforming into a quasi-2D structure. The judicious choice of the 2D constituent is decisive in controlling the 2D/ 3D kinetics and improving the device lifetime, opening a new avenue for perovskite interface design.&#13;</text>

      <text>Introduction Within the last decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been receiving great attention in the area of new generation photovoltaics, with power conversion efficiency (PCE) recently surpassing 25%.  1  Careful interface engineering between the perovskite active layer (AL) and the device interface, i.e. the electron or hole transporting layer (ETL/HTL), is the key to device development and optimization. Various engineering strategies have been explored, including interface functionalization with bulky organic molecules, 2 inert polymeric layers,  [3] [4] [5]  inorganic interlayers,  6, 7  and graphene or parent 2D materials.  [8] [9] [10]  Alternatively, layered perovskites, popularly referred to as 2D perovskites,  11, 12  have been incorporated into the AL-ETL or -HTL interface, forming graded 2D/3D interfaces.  [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]  Thanks to the superior robustness of the 2D perovskite compared to the parent 3D perovskite, such 2D/3D architectures have attracted growing interest as a route to stable and efficient devices.  2  For instance, a combination of methylammonium (MA) lead iodide perovskite and aminovaleric acid-based 2D perovskite resulted in solar cells with greater than 1 year stability, demonstrating the robust nature of combined systems.  19  The 2D perovskite has been shown to simultaneously function as a protective layer and surface defect passivant.  17, 20, 21  However, whether the 2D perovskite is an essential ingredient for future PSC technology or a popular transitory trend is an open question.  22, 23  To answer this point, it is imperative to understand how the 2D perovskite affects the quality of the 3D perovskite surface, and the processes therein, as well as the ultimate device behavior, performance and stability over time. Here, we report the observation of a slow evolution of the performance of 2D/3D PSCs using a new family of thiophene alkylammonium-based organic cations as building blocks for the layered 2D perovskites and its impact on the device efficiency and stability. We reveal a double effect: rst, unexpectedly, during aging for several months in a dark and dry environment, the PSC efficiency increases (from 15% to over 20% in the most striking case), mainly associated with an enhancement of the device open circuit voltage (V oc ). While this is found to be true also for the control device, a signicant boost is observed as derived from a slow structural rearrangement of the 2D/3D interface. We attribute this to the "so" nature of the 2D perovskite overlayer that can act as an ion-scavenger. As a consequence of ion movement from the 3D layer towards the interface, small MA cations accumulate at the interface. As a getter, the 2D structure can incorporate the MA cations by selfmodifying its pure layered structure into a quasi-2D (or mixed) phase.  11  This interface modication generally improves the device performance. On the other hand, depending on the chemical nature of the 2D perovskite, a "more robust" 2D layer can prevent such structural change, physically blocking the ion movement. This leads to a dramatic increase in the device stability, retaining 90% of the initial value under continuous illumination over 1000 hours. The structural change with time has been monitored over a time window of months combining solar cell operation with thin lm structural and optical characterization on aged samples and/or under different aging conditions (i.e. different thermal stress). Overall, results reveal that the conscious choice of proper 2D components can control the dynamical evolution of the 2D/3D interface and is a key element to control for the realization of efficient and stable devices. &#13;</text>

      <text> Results and discussion We synthesized a series of bulky thiophene-terminated cations as building blocks for the layered 2D perovskite structure. Chemical formulae of the thiophenealkylammonium salts namely 2-thiophenemethylammonium iodide (2-TMAI), 3-thiophenemethylammonium iodide (3-TMAI), and 2-thiopheneethylammonium iodide (2-TEAI) along with the derived 2D structure are shown in Fig.  1a . Notably, they only differ in the position and length of the alkyl chain connecting the thiophene core and the ammonium entity. The salts were prepared from the commercially available amines and HI (see ESI † for details). To create the 2D/3D thin lms and devices, we dissolved the salts in isopropanol (IPA) and dynamically spin-coated them on top of a triple-cation [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.87 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.13 ] 0.92 (CsPbI 3 ) 0.08 based 3D perovskite lm, where FA stands for formamidinium (see ESI † for details). As a result, a thin layer of 2D perovskite is formed on top of the 3D bulk, as veried by low angle grazing incidence X-ray Diffraction (XRD). Patterns are shown in Fig.  1b . We note the presence of the peaks at 14 , and at 6 and 4 which correspond to (001) diffraction signals from the 3D perovskite, and, at lower angles, from (002) of the layered 2D perovskite, respectively (the 2D crystal structure is either centro-symmetric or near centro-symmetric such that the (001) diffraction, 1 odd, is forbidden or weak). More in detail, the peak at 6 is related to the formation of a pure 2D perovskite, which takes the formula of R 2 (MA) nÀ1 PbI 3n+1 for n ¼ 1 (where n denes the number of inorganic layers), while the peak at 4 is related to a mixed phase (or the quasi-2D perovskite) where, in this case, n ¼ 2. Depending on the organic salts, slightly different 2D perovskites are formed: for 2-TMAI mostly n ¼ 2; for 3-TMAI only n ¼ 2; and for 2-TEAI mostly n ¼ 1 2D phase (see also XRD patterns of the pure 2D perovskite in Fig.  S1  and S2 †). The 2D perovskite layer, z50 nm thick, covers the entire 3D surface, as shown in Fig.  1c  by top view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. From the top surface image, we could observe that the 2D overlayer smooths out the surface, rendering it less dened in terms of grain boundaries and crystal borders with respect to the 3D surface (Fig.  S3 † ). We implement these lms as AL in standard (n-i-p) device structure solar cells (see ESI †). The optimized thiophenealkylammonium salt concentration implemented in the devices is 0.06 M, resulting in an z50 nm thick 2D layer on top of the 3D layer (see Table  S1  † for details). The photovoltaic (PV) response of the thiophene-based 2D/3D cells is shown in Fig.  2 , Table  1  (statistics in Table  S2  and Fig.  S4 † ). It is worth remarking that commonly device data shown in the literature do not specify the aging status of the measured device, making the comparison among reported PCEs rather difficult. This also hides important information on the slow dynamic behavior of the device interfaces that can alter the PSC performances.  24  Slow processes such as those related to ionic motion are still not yet fully understood  [25] [26] [27]  but are considered as the common source of aging phenomena. To address this point, here we monitor the evolution of the device PV performances by comparing fresh (measured 1 day aer device fabrication) and aged devices over months (stored in a dark and dry air environment with the humidity controlled below 10%). Fresh device PCEs range from 15% to 19% depending on the 2D/3D system. For the control it reaches peak performances aer 2 weeks resulting in 21.1% PCE, but decreasing aerwards (Fig.  2d ). On the other hand, the 2D/3D systems all show a monotonic improvement in the PCE nearly saturating aer 6 months. The aged samples all deliver around 20% PCE with an increase in the device FF and V oc . The 3-TMAI device outperforms the 3D control aer aging. Notably, the 2-TEAI 2D/3D systems show the largest improvement of approx. 25% going from 15.70% to 19.42%. Hysteresis and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are reported in Fig.  S5  and S6 . † This represents our rst nding: the presence of the 2D layer improves the performances over time on month-based analysis. Notably, the highest performances of the devices (also the control) are always reached aer a few days of storage in the dark and in dry air. However, it is worth mentioning that the nal V oc is higher for the 2D/3D system employing 3-TMAI and 2-TMAI. In agreement with previous work on the 2D/3D interface,  28  this can be associated with a surface passivation effect of the 2D layer. To assess that, we investigated the device characteristics under different sunlight intensities, as shown in Fig.  S7  and S8 † and we nd that the 2D layer has a benecial effect on surface recombination. Studies of the device ideality factor, based on the intensity dependence of the V oc (Fig.  S7 † ) and J sc (Fig.  S8 † ) provide insight into the recombination kinetics in the device.  29, 30  Additional interface impedance analysis will be performed to better elucidate the interface recombination channels. Relative to the control, all 2D/3D devices exhibit indeed less monomolecular (trap-mediated) recombination which points toward a reduction of the surface trap density, responsible for the improvement in the V oc and FF. A second important observation relates to device stability where a distinct behavior is observed depending on the nature of the 2D cation. In general, the 2D/3D devices only slightly outperform the 3D reference when measured under continuous 1 sun illumination at the full maximum power point for 1000 h in an inert atmosphere (Fig.  2e ) showing, aer initial decay as commonly observed for 3D PSCs, 31 a similar degradation curve. Interestingly, the 2-TEAI based 2D/3D device behaves differently: the stability aer the initial decay, as commented above, recovers  and is kept at 90% of the initial PCE value with no sign of degradation for the 1000 h tested. This represents a net improvement with respect to the control which decays to 65% of the initial value. To rationalize our nding and elucidate the intimate mechanisms behind such long-term stability, we investigate the evolution with time of the 2D/3D structure by means of photoluminescence (PL) spectral analysis as a simple and immediate method to identify the emissive species, and the related perovskite phase. PL measurements have been carried out over months, mimicking the same time window as for the device tests, as well as fresh but upon different thermal stress, see Fig.  3 . Fig.  3a-c  show the PL spectra from the front side (2D perovskite side) of the 2D/3D lm exciting both the 2D and the 3D layer for the fresh and aged samples. A weak emission from the 3D perovskite at 770 nm is observed upon front side excitation. Contrarily, upon back side (3D perovskite side) excitation the emission from the 3D perovskite is dominant, see Fig.  S9 . † For fresh lms, peaks at short wavelengths are observed, which appear at: (1) 520 nm and 570 nm for 2-TMAI; (2) 570 nm only for 3-TMAI; (3) 520 nm (dominant) and a shoulder at 550 nm for 2-TEAI. In agreement with XRD analysis, we can assign the 520 nm PL peak to the emission from n ¼ 1 2D perovskite, and the 570 nm peak to n ¼ 2 perovskite. This assignment also matches the emission from pure 2D thin lms with n ¼ 1 or n ¼ 2 (see Fig.  S10  and S11 † ). This indicates the formation of distinct 2D perovskite phases depending on the nature of the organic cations. Upon aging, the emission spectra change: (1) 520 nm peak (related to n ¼ 1 2D) vanishes, while the 570 nm peak grows in 2-TMAI; (2) the 570 nm is unchanged, but a new broad peak at a higher wavelength appears in 3-TMAI. This is related to the formation of a mixed 2D lm with a higher n value;  11  (3) 2-TEAI based 2D/ 3D does not show any visible change. This indicates a structural rearrangement of the 2D/3D interface upon aging that holds true for all cases except for the 2-TEAI-2D/3D thin lm. A stable n ¼ 1 2D phase upon aging is also observed for PEAI-based 2D/ 3D systems, conrming the general validity of our observation, see Fig.  S12  and S13 . † Such structural changes are also conrmed by Grazing Incidence Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) analysis carried out on aged samples, as shown in Fig.  S14 . † This observation reveals a structural transformation of the 2D perovskite from a low n to a higher n quasi-2D/3D interface over time for all the cations (2-TMAI and 3-TMAI) except for the 2-TEAI based 2D/3D system. To better elucidate the origin of this change, we simulate aging by stressing the thin lms at 50 C from 0 to 360 min and we measure the evolution of the PL spectra over time (Fig.  3d-f ). A clear change in the emission peak position and relative intensity is again observed for the 2-TMAI and 3-TMAI 2D/3D lms, while only a minor modication is observed for 2-TEAI lms. More in detail, for 2-TMAI 2D/3D, the peak at 520 nm reduces in intensity in favor of the peak at 570 nm, vanishing completely aer 360 min, while for 3-TMAI 2D/3D, the peak at 570 nm does not change. In both cases, a broad peak at a higher wavelength grows. In contrast, for 2-TEAI the 520 nm peak is mostly unaltered (a small shoulder at 550 nm appears) and no emission at longer wavelengths is observed. The broad red peak present in 2-TMAI and 3-TMAI can be related to the formation of the quasi-2D phase. This result matches with what is observed upon aging, pointing to a similar phenomenon behind such structural changes. It is worth mentioning that the aging does not degrade the 3D bulk underneath, since the absorption spectra of the lms do not change (Fig.  S15 † ) and also the XRD patterns of aged and thermally stressed lms show no change in the 3D structures (Fig.  S16  and S17 † ). The preceding observations can be explained by the following mechanism as shown in Fig.  3g . The 2D perovskite, in the case of 2-TMAI and 3-TMAI, functions as a dynamical "sponge" that can embed small ions (such as MA or FA) migrating from the 3D bulk underneath immobilizing them into the new quasi-2D structure. This does not happen for the 2-TEAI 2D/3D that only physically blocks the ion at the interface, preserving the initial purity of the 2D phase (n ¼ 1). We can thus infer that the presence of a structurally robust 2D layer (such as in the case of the 2-TEAI) is paramount to control device stability, demonstrating that the purity of the layered 2D structure and its robustness against ion movement and inltration have a crucial impact on the long-term device stability. We can speculate that this is intimately related to the different packing motif of the organic cations dictated by the length of the side alkyl chain which imparts robustness to the 2D structure. Further work on the structural stability is the focus of ongoing work. &#13;</text>

      <text> Conclusions We revealed that 2D/3D interfaces are dynamical in nature, acting as ion-scavengers and self-transforming, upon aging or thermal stress, into quasi-2D graded interfaces. In general, the deposition of a 2D layer with various thiophene alkylammonium iodide cations protects the 3D layer from the degradation in the ambient air. This can improve the device performance upon dark aging, but does not lead to stable device operation under illumination. Proper engineering of the 2D/3D system, by judicious choice of the organic cation can lead to structurally stable and robust 2D overlayers (with n ¼ 1) that have a decisive role in improving device stability under illumination. A careful molecular design of a large organic cation which can maintain the quasi-2D graded interface (n ¼ 2) over dark aging and thermal stress is very important to deliver both stable and efficient PSCs. These observations pave the way for new avenues for the development of an intelligent molecular engineering approach to guide smart device design and application of stable 2D/3D interfaces even beyond PVs. PbI 2 (TCI), and PbBr 2 (TCI) in DMF and DMSO (0.78:0.22 v/v). For the 2D perovskite n=1 (R 2 PbI 4 , R is the corresponding thiophene alkylammonium cation), the perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving thiophene alkylammonium cation and PbI 2 with the molar ratio of 2:1 in mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (0.78:0.22 v/v). For the quasi 2D perovskite n=2 (R 2 MAPb 2 I 7 ), the perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving thiophene alkylammonium cation, methylammonium iodide (MAI, GreatCellSolar), and PbI 2 with the molar ratio of 2:1:2 in mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (0.78:0.22 v/v). The prepared perovskite precursor was then spin-coated on the prepared at 2000 rpm for 12 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s. Chlorobenzene was added as an anti-solvent at 15 s before the end of spin coating process. The films were subsequently annealed at 100 °C for 60 min. After cooling down to room temperature, 0.06 mol/L of thiophene alkyl ammonium iodide cations in 2-propanol was spin-coated dynamically by adding the solution during spinning at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 6 min. Spiro OMeTAD was used as the hole-transporting materials (HTM). The HTM layer was prepared by dissolving 78.2 mg spiro-OMeTAD (Merck) in 1 mL chlorobenzene doped with 31.28 µL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (Sigma-Aldrich), 18.57 µL of Libis (trifluoromethanesulphonyl) imide (Aldrich) from the stock solution (196 mg in 379 µL acetonitrile), 13.69 µL of FK 209 Co(III) TFSI (GreatCellSolar) from the stock solution (99 mg in 263 µL acetonitrile). The doped spiro-OMeTAD solution was then deposited by spincoating at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 70 nm-thick gold counter electrode was thermally evaporated on top of HTM layer. &#13;</text>

      <text> Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements GIWAXS measurements were carried out in reflection geometry at the CMS beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS II), a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) office of the Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office of Science by Brookhaven National Laboratory. Samples were measured at a detector distance of 0.153 m using X-ray wavelength of 1.24 Å, at 0.16° angle of incidence with respect to the substrate plane. Scattering intensity was detected by a PILATUS 300K detector. Nika foot_1  software package was used to sector average the 2D GIWAXS images. Data plotting was done in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR, USA). &#13;</text>

      <text> Device characterization The current density-voltage (J-V) curves were measured under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5G) by xenon lamp solar simulator (450 W, Oriel Sol3A, AAA class). The J-V measurements were carried out under ambient condition and room temperature. The light intensity was calibrated to 1 sun by using a Si reference equipped with an IR-cutoff (KG5) filter. An external voltage bias was applied and the current responses were measured at the same time using a digital source meter (Keithley 2400). An active area of 0.16 cm 2 was determined by a metal mask with aperture of 0.16 cm 2 . The J-V curves were scanned with the rate of 50 mV s -1 without any preconditioning, such as light soaking or pre-biasing for a long time. For the light intensity dependent measurement, the J-V characteristics were obtained using a VeraSol LED solar simulator (Newport) under various light intensity. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement was carried out by using IQE200B (Oriel).
