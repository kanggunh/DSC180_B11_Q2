"All-perovskite tandem solar cells with improved grain surface passivation
All-perovskite tandem solar cells hold the promise of surpassing the efficiency limits of single-junction solar cells  [1] [2] [3]  ; however, until now, the best-performing all-perovskite tandem solar cells have exhibited lower certified efficiency than have single-junction perovskite solar cells  4, 5  . A thick mixed Pb-Sn narrow-bandgap subcell is needed to achieve high photocurrent density in tandem solar cells 6 , yet this is challenging owing to the short carrier diffusion length within Pb-Sn perovskites. Here we develop ammonium-cation-passivated Pb-Sn perovskites with long diffusion lengths, enabling subcells that have an absorber thickness of approximately 1.2 μm. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that widely used phenethylammonium cations are only partially adsorbed on the surface defective sites at perovskite crystallization temperatures. The passivator adsorption is predicted to be enhanced using 4-trifluoromethyl-phenylammonium (CF3-PA), which exhibits a stronger perovskite surface-passivator interaction than does phenethylammonium. By adding a small amount of CF3-PA into the precursor solution, we increase the carrier diffusion length within Pb-Sn perovskites twofold, to over 5 μm, and increase the efficiency of Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells to over 22%. We report a certified efficiency of 26.4% in all-perovskite tandem solar cells, which exceeds that of the best-performing single-junction perovskite solar cells. Encapsulated tandem devices retain more than 90% of their initial performance after 600 h of operation at the maximum power point under 1 Sun illumination in ambient conditions.
Metal-halide perovskites are emerging photovoltaic (PV) materials that are suitable for tandem solar cell applications: their bandgaps can be tuned from approximately 1.2 eV to 3.0 eV through compositional engineering  2  . An all-perovskite tandem solar cell is constructed by stacking a mixed bromide/iodide wide-bandgap (WBG, approximately 1.8 eV) perovskite front cell and a mixed lead-tin (Pb-Sn) narrow-bandgap (NBG, approximately 1.2 eV) perovskite back cell  4, 7  . All-perovskite tandem solar cells unite low-cost solution processing with the prospect of high efficiency  8  . Despite this promise, the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all-perovskite tandem solar cells has yet to surpass that of single-junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) (which have a highest certified PCE of 25.5%)  9  , a limitation that is dominated by the low photocurrent density (below 16 mA cm -2 ) seen in all-perovskite tandem solar cells to date  4, [10] [11] [12] [13]  . Considering the current-matching condition, high photocurrent densities will require a Pb-Sn perovskite active layer more than 1 μm thick in the bottom subcell (Extended Data Fig.  1 ). However, efficient (>20%) Pb-Sn PSCs have so far only been demonstrated using an active-layer thickness of less than 1 μm (refs.  6, 10, 11, [13] [14] [15]  ). We reason that this is due to the short carrier diffusion length of polycrystalline Pb-Sn perovskite thin films: the carrier diffusion length should be several times the absorber thickness to ensure sufficient charge transport and good PV performance in PSCs  16, 17  . Grain surface passivation is a promising route to increase the carrier diffusion length of perovskite films  13, 18  , given that grain surfaces (film surface and grain boundaries) exhibit a trap density one to several orders of magnitude higher than that within the grain  [19] [20] [21] [22]  . Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites, Lewis bases/acids  23  and zwitterions  10  have been used for the passivation of Pb-Sn perovskites, all of which are approaches that address deep traps and reduce Sn 2+ oxidation  [24] [25] [26]  . However, until now, the absorber thickness of grain-surface-passivated Pb-Sn PSCs has been limited to less than 1 μm in optimized devices  10, 11, 15, 27  . This we attribute to insufficient defect passivation: a certain amount of surface area remains unpassivated, due to the incomplete adsorption of passivating agent into the defective sites during film formation  28  . We posit that enhancing the adsorption of passivating agents during perovskite film formation-in effect, increasing the completeness of the coverage using passivators, ensuring that they fully interact with the defective sites on the grain surfaces-could further improve passivation and thus increase the diffusion length in thick Pb-Sn perovskite films. This will enable thicker absorber layers in Pb-Sn PSCs and thus higher matched photocurrent densities in all-perovskite tandem solar cells. We note that this requires further progress to be made in the rational molecular design of passivators. Previous works have designed passivating molecules based on a static picture of the interaction between passivators and perovskite surfaces  29  ; here we instead explore the dynamic process of passivator adsorption on grain surfaces using ab initio molecular dynamic simulations, an approach that guided our experimental design.

"All-perovskite tandem solar cells with improved grain surface passivation
 Density functional theory studies Here we investigated the passivation capability of ammonium cations for mixed Pb-Sn perovskite surfaces  [30] [31] [32]  . Three aromatic ammonium cations, phenethylammonium (PEA), phenylammonium (PA) and 4-trifluoromethyl-phenylammonium (CF3-PA), were selected to study how the molecular properties influence the adsorption and binding on mixed Pb-Sn perovskite surfaces (Fig.  1a ). The electrostatic potentials (φ max ) at the -NH 3 + side are different for the three passivators: φ max,PEA < φ max,PA < φ max,CF3-PA (Fig.  1a ). We posited that this electrostatic potential difference could affect the surface adsorption of ammonium cations  33  . We carried out density functional theory (DFT) simulations to study the surface adsorption and defect passivation for the three ammonium cations (see details in the Methods). As illustrated in Fig.  1b , the three passivators interact with acceptor-like defects at the Pb-Sn perovskite surfaces through ionic bonding and hydrogen bonding, and are therefore anchored on the surfaces. We note that this mechanism of passivator adsorption is distinct from that of Lewis base molecules  18  . The passivator adsorption is a dynamic process that occurs during perovskite crystallization at elevated temperatures. We first investigated, using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the dynamic process of passivator adsorption on the grain surface (see details in the Methods and Supplementary Fig.  1 ). CF3-PA has the strongest tendency to anchor on the perovskite surface during film formation (at a temperature of approximately 400 K), with all 16 cations adsorbed completely on the surface (Fig.  1c, d ). In comparison, one PA cation and three PEA cations are not adsorbed into the A-site vacancies. Iodide ions are also seen to escape from the surface at 400 K in the PA and PEA cases (Fig.  1c ), which indicates that CF3-PA not only increases the probability of adsorbed ammonium cations on the perovskite grain surface but also suppresses the formation of iodine vacancies on the surface at elevated temperatures. Reduced iodide desorption may also suppress the formation of iodine interstitial (I i ) defects  34  . The binding energies (E b ) shown in Fig.  1e  indicate that CF3-PA has the strongest binding with acceptor-type defects on the perovskite grain surface. The highly electronegative fluorine atom in CF3-PA withdraws electron density strongly from the neighbouring atoms, leaving a higher electropositivity at the NH 3 + side, thus enhancing the binding with the negatively charged defects. Looking at the electronic structures, one can see that the deep in-gap states from the I Sn and I Pb antisite defects are eliminated (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). In addition, CF3-PA passivation is predicted to increase the defect formation energy of the Sn vacancy (V Sn ), reducing the numbers of vacancies (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). CF3-PA passivation also reduces the formation of donor-type defects (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Figs.  4  and 5 ). 
 PV performance of Pb-Sn PSCs DFT calculations indicated that CF3-PA has the potential to provide more effective grain surface passivation than does conventional PEA. To test this idea, we fabricated mixed Pb-Sn PSCs with a thick absorber layer (approximately 1.2 μm) to evaluate the effect of passivating agents on materials and device characteristics. We incorporated the passivating agents onto the grain surfaces of Pb-Sn perovskite films by adding PEA, PA and CF3-PA directly into the perovskite precursor solutions (Methods). The optimal concentrations of PEA, PA and CF3-PA were 0.2, 0.3 and 0.3 mol%, respectively (Extended Data Fig.  2 ). Figure  2a  and Supplementary Table  1  compare the PV parameters of the control, PEA PA and CF3-PA solar cells (15 devices for each type) with an absorber layer thickness of 1.2 μm fabricated over several identical runs. Compared with control devices, Pb-Sn PSCs with passivating agents showed improved performance across all PV parameters. Among the three passivators investigated here, CF3-PA resulted in the best performance values of open-circuit voltage (V oc ), short-circuit current density (J sc ), fill factor (FF) and thus PCE. We also fabricated control and CF3-PA devices with a range of absorber thicknesses; the corresponding current density-voltage J-V curves and PV parameters are summarized in Fig.  2b , Extended Data Fig.  3  and Supplementary Table  2 . The J sc values of the CF3-PA devices increased with thickness, reaching approximately 33 mA cm -2 at a thickness of 1.2 μm. The increased J sc with thicker absorber is ascribed to higher light absorption at the near-infrared range, as indicated by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra in Fig.  2c . By contrast, the J sc values of the control devices did not exhibit an increase when the thickness was increased from 900 to 1,200 nm, whereas the V oc and FF values (and thus PCE) dropped considerably with thickness beyond 900 nm (Extended Data Fig.  3 ). This indicates that the photogenerated carrier transport limits the performance in thick devices based on the control material processing strategy (Extended Data Fig.  4a ). By adding CF3-PA, we increased the diffusion length to achieve higher J sc , V oc and FF values. We fabricated more than 200 CF3-PA mixed Pb-Sn PSCs with 1.2-μm-thick absorber; a histogram of their PCE values is shown in the inset of Fig.  2d . The devices exhibited an average PCE of 20.8 ± 0.5%, which is a narrow distribution compared with typical Pb-Sn perovskite statistics. The best CF3-PA device showed a PCE of 22.2% (stabilized 22.0%), with a V oc of 0.841 V, a J sc of 33.0 mA cm -2 and a FF of 80% under reverse scan (Fig.  2d  and Extended Data Fig.  4b, c ). Figure  2e  presents the EQE spectra of the best CF3-PA device, with the integrated J sc value of 32.5 mA cm -2 , in good agreement with the J-V characterization.

Among the three passivators investigated here, CF3-PA resulted in the best performance values of open-circuit voltage (V oc ), short-circuit current density (J sc ), fill factor (FF) and thus PCE. We also fabricated control and CF3-PA devices with a range of absorber thicknesses; the corresponding current density-voltage J-V curves and PV parameters are summarized in Fig.  2b , Extended Data Fig.  3  and Supplementary Table  2 . The J sc values of the CF3-PA devices increased with thickness, reaching approximately 33 mA cm -2 at a thickness of 1.2 μm. The increased J sc with thicker absorber is ascribed to higher light absorption at the near-infrared range, as indicated by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra in Fig.  2c . By contrast, the J sc values of the control devices did not exhibit an increase when the thickness was increased from 900 to 1,200 nm, whereas the V oc and FF values (and thus PCE) dropped considerably with thickness beyond 900 nm (Extended Data Fig.  3 ). This indicates that the photogenerated carrier transport limits the performance in thick devices based on the control material processing strategy (Extended Data Fig.  4a ). By adding CF3-PA, we increased the diffusion length to achieve higher J sc , V oc and FF values. We fabricated more than 200 CF3-PA mixed Pb-Sn PSCs with 1.2-μm-thick absorber; a histogram of their PCE values is shown in the inset of Fig.  2d . The devices exhibited an average PCE of 20.8 ± 0.5%, which is a narrow distribution compared with typical Pb-Sn perovskite statistics. The best CF3-PA device showed a PCE of 22.2% (stabilized 22.0%), with a V oc of 0.841 V, a J sc of 33.0 mA cm -2 and a FF of 80% under reverse scan (Fig.  2d  and Extended Data Fig.  4b, c ). Figure  2e  presents the EQE spectra of the best CF3-PA device, with the integrated J sc value of 32.5 mA cm -2 , in good agreement with the J-V characterization.

 Characterization of Pb-Sn perovskites To understand the improvement of device performance by passivating agents, we performed structural and optoelectronic characterization of Pb-Sn perovskite films. We first investigated the effect of passivating agents on the morphology and crystal structure of Pb-Sn perovskite films. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that introducing the passivator additives did not notably affect the surface morphology (Fig.  3a , b and Supplementary Fig.  6  and Extended Data Fig.  5a, b ). The presence of passivating agents (for example, CF3-PA) in the perovskite films is indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (Extended Data Fig.  5c ). The spatial distribution of the CF3-PA cations within the perovskite film was investigated using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS, Extended Data Fig.  5d ). This revealed that passivators were anchored on the top and bottom film surfaces as well as at the grain boundaries within the film. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the control and the films modified by the passivating agent exhibited a single three-dimensional (3D) perovskite phase without a 2D (reduced-dimensional) phase and without non-perovskite phases (Fig.  3c  and Supplementary Fig.  7 ). We found no diffraction peaks relating to 2D layered perovskites even when a large amount of CF3-PA (for example, 20 mol%) was added to the precursor solution (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig.  8 ). The absence of 2D perovskite is beneficial for charge transport and extraction throughout the thick Pb-Sn perovskite absorber in solar cells. We also extended the structural characterization to different thicknesses of Pb-Sn perovskite films (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 9-11). The above results indicate that the introduction of a trace amount of passivating agent is not likely to change the film formation. To examine the extent of surface Sn 2+ oxidation, we performed angle-dependent XPS measurements (Extended Data Fig.  6a ). Spectra were recorded at electron take-off angles of 0 o , 45 o and 75 o , with the probing depth varying from approximately 6-8 nm at 0 o to 1.5-2 nm at 75 o (ref.  28  ). The XPS spectra for the control film only show a Sn 4+ peak for the most surface sensitive angle at 75 o (Extended Data Fig.  6b ), which indicates that Sn 4+ primarily forms on the surface  28  . Surface Sn 2+ oxidation was successfully suppressed after anchoring of CF3-PA on the grain surfaces (Extended Data Fig.  6f ), indicating that passivation of surface defects (for example, undercoordinated Sn atoms and Sn vacancies) could retard the Sn 2+ oxidation  21, 30  . The three passivators were then assessed using steady-state photoluminescence (PL). The PL intensity was increased noticeably with the CF3-PA passivating agent (Fig.  3d ), implying suppressed non-radiative charge recombination through the defects. An enhanced PL intensity was also observed in perovskite films passivated with PEA and PA, but it was not as strong as that with CF3-PA. In addition, we carried out time-resolved PL to study the charge-carrier dynamics (Fig.  3e ). The perovskite films with passivating agents exhibited effective carrier lifetimes (CF3-PA, τ = 966 ns; PA, τ = 437 ns; PEA, τ = 365 ns) that were much longer than that of the non-passivated control film (τ = 159 ns). The longer charge-carrier recombination lifetime with CF3-PA was also confirmed by transient photovoltage decay measurements (Supplementary Fig.  12 ). We further performed femtosecond-resolved optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy to obtain the carrier mobility of Pb-Sn perovskite films  [35] [36] [37]  . The control and CF3-PA films exhibited similar effective d.c. charge-carrier mobilities (μ d.c. ) of approximately 80 cm 2 V -1 s -1 , where μ d.c. is the sum of the electron and hole mobilities (μ d.c. = μ e + μ h , Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig.  13 ). Although it is challenging to obtain directly the exact mobility of electrons versus holes, we found the mobility of the limiting carrier (μ e,h ) to be 11.7 ± 1.5 and 8.2 ± 1.2 cm 2 V -1 s -1 for the CF3-PA and control Pb-Sn perovskite films, respectively (see details in Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig.  14 ). Because of the longer carrier lifetimes, the diffusion length (L d ) of the CF3-PA passivated films was increased threefold when compared to that of the control films (5.4 μm versus 1.8 μm) (Fig.  3f ). Overall, device performance and film characterization demonstrate improved grain surface passivation in mixed Pb-Sn perovskite films with CF3-PA. The DFT studies suggest one possible mechanism for the origin of the improvement: the higher surface adsorption of the passivating agent enables better passivation in perovskite films.  
 Performance and stability of tandem solar cells We fabricated monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells using the optimized NBG perovskite layers described above (see details in the Methods). The WBG solar cells exhibited a PCE of 17.3%, with a V oc of 1.22 V, a J sc of 17.4 mA cm -2 and a FF of 81.6% (Extended Data Fig.  7 ). The NBG perovskite films were fabricated using the CF3-PA additive. The thicknesses of the WBG and NBG absorber layers for the front and back subcells were optimized to be approximately 380 and 1,200 nm (Fig.  4a ), respectively, to obtain a high matched current density between the subcells. Figure  4b  presents the J-V curves of all-perovskite tandem devices with various thicknesses (750, 900 and 1,200 nm) for the NBG absorber; the corresponding PV parameters are summarized in Supplementary Table  3 . The J sc values, as determined from the J-V curves, were increased from 15.4 to 16.5 mA cm -2 when the thickness of the NBG perovskite absorber increased from 750 to 1,200 nm (the WBG perovskite thickness was kept at approximately 380 nm). Correspondingly, the PCE was increased from 25.0% for the 750-nm-thick NBG subcell to 26.4% for the 1.2-μm-thick NBG subcell. The higher J sc is due mainly to the higher spectral response (light absorption) in the back subcell, as shown in Fig.  4c  and Supplementary Fig.  15 . We fabricated 96 all-perovskite tandem solar cells (with aperture area of 0.049 cm 2 ) with 1.2-μm-thick NBG subcells; the devices had an average PCE of 25.6 ± 0.5% (Extended Data Fig.  8a ).

The CF3-PA and control tandem devices had initial PCEs of 25.6% and 24.3% measured under a two-lamp simulator, respectively. The device temperature was approximately 35 o C during operation, which was a result of self-heating under solar illumination. There was no active cooling during device operation and the environmental temperature was kept at approximately 25 o C. T 90 represents the lifetime at which the PCE declines to 90% of its initial value.

The control and CF3-PA films exhibited similar effective d.c. charge-carrier mobilities (μ d.c. ) of approximately 80 cm 2 V -1 s -1 , where μ d.c. is the sum of the electron and hole mobilities (μ d.c. = μ e + μ h , Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig.  13 ). Although it is challenging to obtain directly the exact mobility of electrons versus holes, we found the mobility of the limiting carrier (μ e,h ) to be 11.7 ± 1.5 and 8.2 ± 1.2 cm 2 V -1 s -1 for the CF3-PA and control Pb-Sn perovskite films, respectively (see details in Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig.  14 ). Because of the longer carrier lifetimes, the diffusion length (L d ) of the CF3-PA passivated films was increased threefold when compared to that of the control films (5.4 μm versus 1.8 μm) (Fig.  3f ). Overall, device performance and film characterization demonstrate improved grain surface passivation in mixed Pb-Sn perovskite films with CF3-PA. The DFT studies suggest one possible mechanism for the origin of the improvement: the higher surface adsorption of the passivating agent enables better passivation in perovskite films.  
 Performance and stability of tandem solar cells We fabricated monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells using the optimized NBG perovskite layers described above (see details in the Methods). The WBG solar cells exhibited a PCE of 17.3%, with a V oc of 1.22 V, a J sc of 17.4 mA cm -2 and a FF of 81.6% (Extended Data Fig.  7 ). The NBG perovskite films were fabricated using the CF3-PA additive. The thicknesses of the WBG and NBG absorber layers for the front and back subcells were optimized to be approximately 380 and 1,200 nm (Fig.  4a ), respectively, to obtain a high matched current density between the subcells. Figure  4b  presents the J-V curves of all-perovskite tandem devices with various thicknesses (750, 900 and 1,200 nm) for the NBG absorber; the corresponding PV parameters are summarized in Supplementary Table  3 . The J sc values, as determined from the J-V curves, were increased from 15.4 to 16.5 mA cm -2 when the thickness of the NBG perovskite absorber increased from 750 to 1,200 nm (the WBG perovskite thickness was kept at approximately 380 nm). Correspondingly, the PCE was increased from 25.0% for the 750-nm-thick NBG subcell to 26.4% for the 1.2-μm-thick NBG subcell. The higher J sc is due mainly to the higher spectral response (light absorption) in the back subcell, as shown in Fig.  4c  and Supplementary Fig.  15 . We fabricated 96 all-perovskite tandem solar cells (with aperture area of 0.049 cm 2 ) with 1.2-μm-thick NBG subcells; the devices had an average PCE of 25.6 ± 0.5% (Extended Data Fig.  8a ).

The CF3-PA and control tandem devices had initial PCEs of 25.6% and 24.3% measured under a two-lamp simulator, respectively.

 Characterization of Pb-Sn perovskites To understand the improvement of device performance by passivating agents, we performed structural and optoelectronic characterization of Pb-Sn perovskite films. We first investigated the effect of passivating agents on the morphology and crystal structure of Pb-Sn perovskite films. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that introducing the passivator additives did not notably affect the surface morphology (Fig.  3a , b and Supplementary Fig.  6  and Extended Data Fig.  5a, b ). The presence of passivating agents (for example, CF3-PA) in the perovskite films is indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (Extended Data Fig.  5c ). The spatial distribution of the CF3-PA cations within the perovskite film was investigated using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS, Extended Data Fig.  5d ). This revealed that passivators were anchored on the top and bottom film surfaces as well as at the grain boundaries within the film. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the control and the films modified by the passivating agent exhibited a single three-dimensional (3D) perovskite phase without a 2D (reduced-dimensional) phase and without non-perovskite phases (Fig.  3c  and Supplementary Fig.  7 ). We found no diffraction peaks relating to 2D layered perovskites even when a large amount of CF3-PA (for example, 20 mol%) was added to the precursor solution (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig.  8 ). The absence of 2D perovskite is beneficial for charge transport and extraction throughout the thick Pb-Sn perovskite absorber in solar cells. We also extended the structural characterization to different thicknesses of Pb-Sn perovskite films (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 9-11). The above results indicate that the introduction of a trace amount of passivating agent is not likely to change the film formation. To examine the extent of surface Sn 2+ oxidation, we performed angle-dependent XPS measurements (Extended Data Fig.  6a ). Spectra were recorded at electron take-off angles of 0 o , 45 o and 75 o , with the probing depth varying from approximately 6-8 nm at 0 o to 1.5-2 nm at 75 o (ref.  28  ). The XPS spectra for the control film only show a Sn 4+ peak for the most surface sensitive angle at 75 o (Extended Data Fig.  6b ), which indicates that Sn 4+ primarily forms on the surface  28  . Surface Sn 2+ oxidation was successfully suppressed after anchoring of CF3-PA on the grain surfaces (Extended Data Fig.  6f ), indicating that passivation of surface defects (for example, undercoordinated Sn atoms and Sn vacancies) could retard the Sn 2+ oxidation  21, 30  . The three passivators were then assessed using steady-state photoluminescence (PL). The PL intensity was increased noticeably with the CF3-PA passivating agent (Fig.  3d ), implying suppressed non-radiative charge recombination through the defects. An enhanced PL intensity was also observed in perovskite films passivated with PEA and PA, but it was not as strong as that with CF3-PA. In addition, we carried out time-resolved PL to study the charge-carrier dynamics (Fig.  3e ). The perovskite films with passivating agents exhibited effective carrier lifetimes (CF3-PA, τ = 966 ns; PA, τ = 437 ns; PEA, τ = 365 ns) that were much longer than that of the non-passivated control film (τ = 159 ns). The longer charge-carrier recombination lifetime with CF3-PA was also confirmed by transient photovoltage decay measurements (Supplementary Fig.  12 ). We further performed femtosecond-resolved optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy to obtain the carrier mobility of Pb-Sn perovskite films  [35] [36] [37]  . The control and CF3-PA films exhibited similar effective d.c. charge-carrier mobilities (μ d.c. ) of approximately 80 cm 2 V -1 s -1 , where μ d.c. is the sum of the electron and hole mobilities (μ d.c. = μ e + μ h , Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig.  13 ). Although it is challenging to obtain directly the exact mobility of electrons versus holes, we found the mobility of the limiting carrier (μ e,h ) to be 11.7 ± 1.5 and 8.2 ± 1.2 cm 2 V -1 s -1 for the CF3-PA and control Pb-Sn perovskite films, respectively (see details in Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig.  14 ). Because of the longer carrier lifetimes, the diffusion length (L d ) of the CF3-PA passivated films was increased threefold when compared to that of the control films (5.4 μm versus 1.8 μm) (Fig.  3f ).

 Femtosecond-resolved optical-pump-terahertz probe spectroscopy A commercial Ti:Sapphire amplified laser (Libra, Coherent) with a pulse duration of 90 fs, centre wavelength of 800 nm and repetition rate of 1 kHz was used to generate terahertz radiation by optical rectification in a 0.5-mm-thick ZnTe(110) nonlinear single crystal. The radiation was detected using free-space electro-optic sampling in a 0.5-mm-thick ZnTe(110) crystal. Perovskite thin films deposited on z-cut quartz substrates were photoexcited at 800 nm with fluences in the range of 1.5-50 μJ cm -2 . The change in terahertz amplitude was monitored as a function of the time delay between the 800 nm optical pump pulse and the terahertz probe pulse using a translation stage. All measurements were carried out in a nitrogen-purged environment to avoid potential degradation of the perovskite films in ambient air. 
 Optical simulation of tandem solar cells A validated optical model GenPro4 as developed by Delft University of Technology was used for the optical modelling of the tandem solar cells  49  . The complex refractive index of each layer was measured by a spectroscopic ellipsometer ( J.A. Woollam). The implied photocurrent density of each subcell can be calculated using GenPro4 by assuming that the individual absorptances of the front and back cells are equivalent to the EQE of the two cells, respectively. The current density of the tandem cell is determined by taking the lower value between the two subcells. Other characterizations SEM images were obtained using a TESCAN microscope with an accelerating voltage of 2 kV. XRD patterns were collected using a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 diffractometer equipped with a NaI scintillation counter and using monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (wavelength λ = 1.5406 Å). The grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering data were recorded using an Xeuss 2.0 system with an X-ray beam size of 100 × 100 μm 2 . The photon energy was 8 keV (λ = 1.54 Å) and the incident angle was 0.05° (relative to the top surface of the perovskite films) or 0.5°. The diffracted X-rays were collected by a Pilatus 300k detector at a distance of 160 cm. XPS analysis was carried out using a Thermo Scientific Al K-Alpha XPS system with energy steps of 0.1 eV. Angle-dependent XPS characterizations were performed with a PHI 5600 ultrahigh vacuum system with a hemispherical electron energy analyser, an Al Kα source (1,486.6 eV, PHI 04-548 dual anode X-ray source) for excitation and a pass energy of 23.5 eV for XPS acquisition  28  . Optical absorption measurements were carried out on a Lambda 950 UV/Vis spectrophotometer. Transient photovoltage decays were measured on a home-made system. A 540 nm green LED was used to modulate V oc with a constant light bias and the repetition rate was set to 2,000 Hz. A white LED was illuminated on the active area of the solar cell under study for constant light bias. The intensity of the pulsed illumination was set in such a way that the modulated V oc was approximately 10 mV, to ensure a perturbation regime. The open circuit voltage transient, induced by the light perturbation, was measured with a digital oscilloscope set to an input impedance of 1 MΩ. The charge recombination lifetime was fitted by a single exponential decay. Steady-state PL and time-resolved PL were measured using a Horiba Fluorolog time-correlated single-photon-counting system with photomultiplier tube detectors. The light was illuminated onto the top surface of the perovskite film. For steady-state PL measurements, the excitation source was a monochromated Xe lamp (peak wavelength at 520 nm with a line width of 2 nm). For time-resolved PL, the excitation source was a green laser diode (λ = 510 nm) with an excitation power density of 5 mW cm -2 . The PL decay curves were fitted with biexponential components to obtain fast and slow decay lifetimes. The mean carrier lifetimes τ for the biexponential fit were calculated by the weighted average method. ToF-SIMS was performed using ToF-SIMS6 from IONTOF GmbH. Samples were analysed in the dual-beam profiling mode. All profiles were performed in the non-interlaced mode. Spectral data were acquired in the high mass-resolution mode. The primary ion for analysis was 30 keV Bi 3+ at 0.3 pA (with Bi liquid metal ion source). This ion beam was applied over a 50 × 50 μm 2 area at the centre of the sputter crater. The sputter ion was 1 keV Ar + at 120 nA (with Ar electron impact ion source). A 200 × 200 μm 2 sputter crater was used. During the sputtering process, the mass spectra in the same layer were consistent and different layers had well-defined profiles, which means that beam damage was not observed. The MA cation, FA cation, CF3-PA cation, Pb + and Sn + were identified based on masses of 32.0483 amu, 45.0430 amu, 162.0551 amu, 207.9715 amu and 119.8997 amu, respectively. The EQE values of CF3-PA device are substantially higher than those of previous works at wavelengths above 800 nm, mainly due to the use of thicker absorber while maintaining sufficient carrier transport. It is noted that such a high J sc value is obtained herein together with high V oc and FF even when using a 1,200 nm absorber. b, Reverse and forward J-V curves of the champion CF3-PA mixed Pb-Sn solar cell. c, The steady-state PCE of the champion CF3-PA device.

This agrees with the finding that no obvious improvement was observed in regular thinner devices after we added the CF3-PA passivating agent.

 Extended Data Fig. 1 | 1 Optical simulation of all-perovskite tandem solar cells. The implied photocurrent density ( J sc ) of tandems was calculated as function of wide-bandgap and narrow-bandgap perovskite layer thicknesses. Extended Data Fig. 2 | PCEs of mixed Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells with various concentrations of passivating agents. a, PEA; b, PA; c, CF3-PA. The absorber layer thickness is ~1,200 nm. Extended Data Fig. 3 | Performance of control and CF3-PA mixed Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells with various absorber thicknesses. For regular thinner Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells (thicknesses of 750 and 900 nm), the diffusion lengths are sufficiently long to ensure charge transport within devices. This agrees with the finding that no obvious improvement was observed in regular thinner devices after we added the CF3-PA passivating agent. The abrupt drop in performance at the thickness of 1.45 μm comes because the precursor solution fails to form high-quality films, a result of finite solubility of metal halides in DMF/DMSO solvent.
