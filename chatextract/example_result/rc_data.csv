"A review of catalytic performance of metallic glasses in wastewater treatment: Recent progress and prospects. In comparison, the atomic packing structure of MGs seems like a “frozen” state in a short/medium-range ordered and a long-range disordered structure. The first MG with the atomic composition of Au75Si25 was produced by fast quenching technique to freeze the metallic liquid at a very high critical cooling rate of 10^(5)–10^(6) K/s in 1960 [144].","The first MG with the atomic composition of Au75Si25 was produced by fast quenching technique to freeze the metallic liquid at a very high critical cooling rate of 10^(5)–10^(6) K/s in 1960 [144].","10.1016/j.pmatsci.2019.100576"
"Metallic Glasses. Clean processing methods include incorporating the melt as a component of an emulsion, fluxing the melt, droplet levitation, and solidification in free fall (in a drop-tube) (Cahn and Greer 1996). The critical cooling rate for glass formation in a given alloy can be used to characterize its glass-forming ability (GFA), for which many attempts at analysis have been made (Cahn and Greer 1996).","The critical cooling rate for glass formation in a given alloy can be used to characterize its glass-forming ability (GFA), for which many attempts at analysis have been made (Cahn and Greer 1996).","10.1016/B0-08-043152-6/00967-0"
"Abnormal devitrification behavior and mechanical response of cold-rolled Mg-rich Mg-Cu-Gd metallic glasses. This has been explained in terms of chemical short-range ordering (CSRO) and topological short-range ordering (TSRO), respectively. However, such a sharp separation between TSRO and CSRO, criticized by Gibbs and Sinning [27] and Khonik et al. [28], is probably too simple to explain such a complex phenomenon, because CSRO is unlikely without an accompanying TSRO.","However, such a sharp separation between TSRO and CSRO, criticized by Gibbs and Sinning [27] and Khonik et al.

"Compressive ductility and fracture resistance in CuZr-based shape-memory metallic-glass composites. The enlarged view of the framed region in Fig. 5i-l shows the corresponding surface relief (SR) patterns, which are characteristic of the strain generated by the martensitic transformation. As noted in Fig. 5e, when the particle size exceeds a critical value, large cracks can be observed inside the crystalline particles, as shown in Fig. 5d, e, h. Such behavior of cracks initiating from inside CuZr particles has been previously reported for uniaxial compression (Jiang et al., 2007) and in situ tension testing (Sun et al., 2018) of CuZr glass composites.","As noted in Fig. 5e, when the particle size exceeds a critical value, large cracks can be observed inside the crystalline particles, as shown in Fig. 5d, e, h.

"Glass formation and crystallization behavior in Mg65Cu25Y10−x Gd x (x=0, 5 and 10) alloys. For Mg65Cu25Y10-x Gd x alloy system, T rg increases slightly from 0.54 to 0.55 with the increase of x from 0 to 5 and then again decreases to 0.54 with further increasing x to 10, i.e. the Mg65Cu25Gd10 and Mg65Cu25Y10 alloys have almost same value of T rg, although there is a much difference in GFA.

"Enthalpy relaxation and its relation to the thermodynamics and crystallization of the Zr58.5Cu15.6Ni12.8Al10.3Nb2.8 bulk metallic glass-forming alloy. The entropy of fusion and the critical cooling rate of V106a are 8.03J/g-atom/K and 1.75K/s, respectively, which are comparable to the values of about 8.8J/g-atom/K and 1K/s for Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10.0Be22.5 (Vit1) [10].
