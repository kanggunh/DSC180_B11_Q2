"All-perovskite tandem solar cells with improved grain surface passivation
A thick mixed Pb-Sn narrow-bandgap subcell is needed to achieve high photocurrent density in tandem solar cells 6 , yet this is challenging owing to the short carrier diffusion length within Pb-Sn perovskitesHere we develop ammonium-cation-passivated Pb-Sn perovskites with long diffusion lengths, enabling subcells that have an absorber thickness of approximately 1.2 Î¼m",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04372-8,Ammonium-cation-passivated Pb-Sn perovskites,None,None,1,0,0
"All-perovskite tandem solar cells with improved grain surface passivation
We reason that this is due to the short carrier diffusion length of polycrystalline Pb-Sn perovskite thin films: the carrier diffusion length should be several times the absorber thickness to ensure sufficient charge transport and good PV performance in PSCs  16, 17  Grain surface passivation is a promising route to increase the carrier diffusion length of perovskite films  13, 18  , given that grain surfaces (film surface and grain boundaries) exhibit a trap density one to several orders of magnitude higher than that within the grain  [19] [20] [21] [22]  ",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04372-8,None,None,None,0,0,0
