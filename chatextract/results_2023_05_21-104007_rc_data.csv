Enthalpy relaxation and its relation to the thermodynamics and crystallization of the Zr58.5Cu15.6Ni12.8Al10.3Nb2.8 bulk metallic glass-forming alloy. The entropy of fusion and the critical cooling rate of V106a are 8.03J/g-atom/K and 1.75K/s, respectively, which are comparable to the values of about 8.8J/g-atom/K and 1K/s for Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10.0Be22.5 (Vit1) [10]. These values are relatively small if compared with those of the ternary Mg64Cu25Y10 (about 11J/g-atom/K and 50K/s) [9], and those of the binary Zr62Ni38, which is known of having critical cooling rates of 10^(4) K/s [9,22]."
