All-perovskite tandem solar cells hold the promise of surpassing the efficiency limits of single-junction solar cells  [1] [2] [3]  ; however, until now, the best-performing all-perovskite tandem solar cells have exhibited lower certified efficiency than have single-junction perovskite solar cells  4, 5  "

A thick mixed Pb-Sn narrow-bandgap subcell is needed to achieve high photocurrent density in tandem solar cells 6 , yet this is challenging owing to the short carrier diffusion length within Pb-Sn perovskites"

The passivator adsorption is predicted to be enhanced using 4-trifluoromethyl-phenylammonium (CF3-PA), which exhibits a stronger perovskite surface-passivator interaction than does phenethylammonium"

By adding a small amount of CF3-PA into the precursor solution, we increase the carrier diffusion length within Pb-Sn perovskites twofold, to over 5 μm, and increase the efficiency of Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells to over 22%"
