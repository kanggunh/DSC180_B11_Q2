All-perovskite tandem solar cells hold the promise of surpassing the efficiency limits of single-junction solar cells  [1] [2] [3]  ; however, until now, the best-performing all-perovskite tandem solar cells have exhibited lower certified efficiency than have single-junction perovskite solar cells  4, 5  . A thick mixed Pb-Sn narrow-bandgap subcell is needed to achieve high photocurrent density in tandem solar cells 6 , yet this is challenging owing to the short carrier diffusion length within Pb-Sn perovskites. Here we develop ammonium-cation-passivated Pb-Sn perovskites with long diffusion lengths, enabling subcells that have an absorber thickness of approximately 1.2 μm. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that widely used phenethylammonium cations are only partially adsorbed on the surface defective sites at perovskite crystallization temperatures. The passivator adsorption is predicted to be enhanced using 4-trifluoromethyl-phenylammonium (CF3-PA), which exhibits a stronger perovskite surface-passivator interaction than does phenethylammonium. By adding a small amount of CF3-PA into the precursor solution, we increase the carrier diffusion length within Pb-Sn perovskites twofold, to over 5 μm, and increase the efficiency of Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells to over 22%. We report a certified efficiency of 26.4% in all-perovskite tandem solar cells, which exceeds that of the best-performing single-junction perovskite solar cells. Encapsulated tandem devices retain more than 90% of their initial performance after 600 h of operation at the maximum power point under 1 Sun illumination in ambient conditions.

Metal-halide perovskites are emerging photovoltaic (PV) materials that are suitable for tandem solar cell applications: their bandgaps can be tuned from approximately 1.2 eV to 3.0 eV through compositional engineering  2  . An all-perovskite tandem solar cell is constructed by stacking a mixed bromide/iodide wide-bandgap (WBG, approximately 1.8 eV) perovskite front cell and a mixed lead-tin (Pb-Sn) narrow-bandgap (NBG, approximately 1.2 eV) perovskite back cell  4, 7  . All-perovskite tandem solar cells unite low-cost solution processing with the prospect of high efficiency  8  . Despite this promise, the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all-perovskite tandem solar cells has yet to surpass that of single-junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) (which have a highest certified PCE of 25.5%)  9  , a limitation that is dominated by the low photocurrent density (below 16 mA cm -2 ) seen in all-perovskite tandem solar cells to date  4, [10] [11] [12] [13]  . Considering the current-matching condition, high photocurrent densities will require a Pb-Sn perovskite active layer more than 1 μm thick in the bottom subcell (Extended Data Fig.  1 ). However, efficient (>20%) Pb-Sn PSCs have so far only been demonstrated using an active-layer thickness of less than 1 μm (refs.  6, 10, 11, [13] [14] [15]  ). We reason that this is due to the short carrier diffusion length of polycrystalline Pb-Sn perovskite thin films: the carrier diffusion length should be several times the absorber thickness to ensure sufficient charge transport and good PV performance in PSCs  16, 17  . Grain surface passivation is a promising route to increase the carrier diffusion length of perovskite films  13, 18  , given that grain surfaces (film surface and grain boundaries) exhibit a trap density one to several orders of magnitude higher than that within the grain  [19] [20] [21] [22]  . Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites, Lewis bases/acids  23  and zwitterions  10  have been used for the passivation of Pb-Sn perovskites, all of which are approaches that address deep traps and reduce Sn 2+ oxidation  [24] [25] [26]  . However, until now, the absorber thickness of grain-surface-passivated Pb-Sn PSCs has been limited to less than 1 μm in optimized devices  10, 11, 15, 27  . This we attribute to insufficient defect passivation: a certain amount of surface area remains unpassivated, due to the incomplete adsorption of passivating agent into the defective sites during film formation  28  . We posit that enhancing the adsorption of passivating agents during perovskite film formation-in effect, increasing the completeness of the coverage using passivators, ensuring that they fully interact with the defective sites on the grain surfaces-could further improve passivation and thus increase the diffusion length in thick Pb-Sn perovskite films. This will enable thicker absorber layers in Pb-Sn PSCs and thus higher matched photocurrent densities in all-perovskite tandem solar cells. We note that this requires further progress to be made in the rational molecular design of passivators. Previous works have designed passivating molecules based on a static picture of the interaction between passivators and perovskite surfaces  29  ; here we instead explore the dynamic process of passivator adsorption on grain surfaces using ab initio molecular dynamic simulations, an approach that guided our experimental design.

All-perovskite tandem solar cells with improved grain surface passivation
All-perovskite tandem solar cells hold the promise of surpassing the efficiency limits of single-junction solar cells  [1] [2] [3]  ; however, until now, the best-performing all-perovskite tandem solar cells have exhibited lower certified efficiency than have single-junction perovskite solar cells  4, 5  . A thick mixed Pb-Sn narrow-bandgap subcell is needed to achieve high photocurrent density in tandem solar cells 6 , yet this is challenging owing to the short carrier diffusion length within Pb-Sn perovskites. Here we develop ammonium-cation-passivated Pb-Sn perovskites with long diffusion lengths, enabling subcells that have an absorber thickness of approximately 1.2 μm. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that widely used phenethylammonium cations are only partially adsorbed on the surface defective sites at perovskite crystallization temperatures. The passivator adsorption is predicted to be enhanced using 4-trifluoromethyl-phenylammonium (CF3-PA), which exhibits a stronger perovskite surface-passivator interaction than does phenethylammonium. By adding a small amount of CF3-PA into the precursor solution, we increase the carrier diffusion length within Pb-Sn perovskites twofold, to over 5 μm, and increase the efficiency of Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells to over 22%. We report a certified efficiency of 26.4% in all-perovskite tandem solar cells, which exceeds that of the best-performing single-junction perovskite solar cells. Encapsulated tandem devices retain more than 90% of their initial performance after 600 h of operation at the maximum power point under 1 Sun illumination in ambient conditions.
Metal-halide perovskites are emerging photovoltaic (PV) materials that are suitable for tandem solar cell applications: their bandgaps can be tuned from approximately 1.2 eV to 3.0 eV through compositional engineering  2  . An all-perovskite tandem solar cell is constructed by stacking a mixed bromide/iodide wide-bandgap (WBG, approximately 1.8 eV) perovskite front cell and a mixed lead-tin (Pb-Sn) narrow-bandgap (NBG, approximately 1.2 eV) perovskite back cell  4, 7  . All-perovskite tandem solar cells unite low-cost solution processing with the prospect of high efficiency  8  . Despite this promise, the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all-perovskite tandem solar cells has yet to surpass that of single-junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) (which have a highest certified PCE of 25.5%)  9  , a limitation that is dominated by the low photocurrent density (below 16 mA cm -2 ) seen in all-perovskite tandem solar cells to date  4, [10] [11] [12] [13]  . Considering the current-matching condition, high photocurrent densities will require a Pb-Sn perovskite active layer more than 1 μm thick in the bottom subcell (Extended Data Fig.  1 ). However, efficient (>20%) Pb-Sn PSCs have so far only been demonstrated using an active-layer thickness of less than 1 μm (refs.  6, 10, 11, [13] [14] [15]  ). We reason that this is due to the short carrier diffusion length of polycrystalline Pb-Sn perovskite thin films: the carrier diffusion length should be several times the absorber thickness to ensure sufficient charge transport and good PV performance in PSCs  16, 17  . Grain surface passivation is a promising route to increase the carrier diffusion length of perovskite films  13, 18  , given that grain surfaces (film surface and grain boundaries) exhibit a trap density one to several orders of magnitude higher than that within the grain  [19] [20] [21] [22]  . Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites, Lewis bases/acids  23  and zwitterions  10  have been used for the passivation of Pb-Sn perovskites, all of which are approaches that address deep traps and reduce Sn 2+ oxidation  [24] [25] [26]  . However, until now, the absorber thickness of grain-surface-passivated Pb-Sn PSCs has been limited to less than 1 μm in optimized devices  10, 11, 15, 27  . This we attribute to insufficient defect passivation: a certain amount of surface area remains unpassivated, due to the incomplete adsorption of passivating agent into the defective sites during film formation  28  . We posit that enhancing the adsorption of passivating agents during perovskite film formation-in effect, increasing the completeness of the coverage using passivators, ensuring that they fully interact with the defective sites on the grain surfaces-could further improve passivation and thus increase the diffusion length in thick Pb-Sn perovskite films. This will enable thicker absorber layers in Pb-Sn PSCs and thus higher matched photocurrent densities in all-perovskite tandem solar cells.

 Density functional theory studies Here we investigated the passivation capability of ammonium cations for mixed Pb-Sn perovskite surfaces  [30] [31] [32]  . Three aromatic ammonium cations, phenethylammonium (PEA), phenylammonium (PA) and 4-trifluoromethyl-phenylammonium (CF3-PA), were selected to study how the molecular properties influence the adsorption and binding on mixed Pb-Sn perovskite surfaces (Fig.  1a ). The electrostatic potentials (φ max ) at the -NH 3 + side are different for the three passivators: φ max,PEA < φ max,PA < φ max,CF3-PA (Fig.  1a ). We posited that this electrostatic potential difference could affect the surface adsorption of ammonium cations  33  . We carried out density functional theory (DFT) simulations to study the surface adsorption and defect passivation for the three ammonium cations (see details in the Methods). As illustrated in Fig.  1b , the three passivators interact with acceptor-like defects at the Pb-Sn perovskite surfaces through ionic bonding and hydrogen bonding, and are therefore anchored on the surfaces. We note that this mechanism of passivator adsorption is distinct from that of Lewis base molecules  18  . The passivator adsorption is a dynamic process that occurs during perovskite crystallization at elevated temperatures. We first investigated, using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the dynamic process of passivator adsorption on the grain surface (see details in the Methods and Supplementary Fig.  1 ). CF3-PA has the strongest tendency to anchor on the perovskite surface during film formation (at a temperature of approximately 400 K), with all 16 cations adsorbed completely on the surface (Fig.  1c, d ). In comparison, one PA cation and three PEA cations are not adsorbed into the A-site vacancies. Iodide ions are also seen to escape from the surface at 400 K in the PA and PEA cases (Fig.  1c ), which indicates that CF3-PA not only increases the probability of adsorbed ammonium cations on the perovskite grain surface but also suppresses the formation of iodine vacancies on the surface at elevated temperatures. Reduced iodide desorption may also suppress the formation of iodine interstitial (I i ) defects  34  . The binding energies (E b ) shown in Fig.  1e  indicate that CF3-PA has the strongest binding with acceptor-type defects on the perovskite grain surface. The highly electronegative fluorine atom in CF3-PA withdraws electron density strongly from the neighbouring atoms, leaving a higher electropositivity at the NH 3 + side, thus enhancing the binding with the negatively charged defects. Looking at the electronic structures, one can see that the deep in-gap states from the I Sn and I Pb antisite defects are eliminated (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). In addition, CF3-PA passivation is predicted to increase the defect formation energy of the Sn vacancy (V Sn ), reducing the numbers of vacancies (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). CF3-PA passivation also reduces the formation of donor-type defects (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Figs.  4  and 5 ).
