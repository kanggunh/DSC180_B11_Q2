      <text>Impressive progress in halide perovskite solar cells motivates further work to improve operating stability. It is known that ion-migration-driven decomposition represents a degradation pathway in perovskite solar cells and that it can occur within the perovskite material even in well-encapsulated devices. Here we find that quasi-two-dimensional (2.5D) perovskites suppress this ionmigration-induced degradation. Using TOF-SIMS, we confirm that iodide migration occurs in bulk perovskite photovoltaic devices operating at their maximum power point (MPP). We observe that iodine ions migrate across the spiro-OMeTAD layer to the spiro/ gold contact interface, oxidizing and deteriorating the gold at the interface. In contrast, we find that large ⟨n⟩ 2.5D perovskites exhibit a significantly reduced rate of ion migration compared to 3D devices and exhibit less than 1% relative PCE loss in over 80 h of continuous operation at MPP, whereas the PCE of 3D devices diminishes by more than 50% within the first 24 h.</text>

      <text>T oday's perovskite solar cells (PSCs) require additional effort on stability, especially under maximum power point (MPP) operating conditions.  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  Perovskites have two main decomposition pathways at room temperature: one arises due to moisture and oxygen-induced hydration and oxidization of the perovskite and another is ion-migrationdriven decomposition.  [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]  The first process can be addressed by encapsulants such as those employed in commercial solar cell modules.  [12] [13] [14] [15]  The second process, ion migration, is associated with the low formation energy of the perovskite lattice and involves the movement of ions especially under solar cell working conditions. This can occur even in encapsulated devices. It leads to the formation of vacancies or undesirable complexes.  10, [16] [17] [18] [19]  It has been shown that ion migration can cause the formation of PbI 2 belts in MAPbI 3 under a high applied bias, which is believed detrimental to long-term performance.  10  This behavior needs to be addressed through improvements to the perovskite active layer itself. Recently, PSCs with active layers composed of mixeddimensional perovskites (also known as Ruddlesden-Popper or quasi-two-dimensional (2.5D) perovskites) have shown indications of promising stability compared to analogous 3D PSCs.  [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26]  Lower-dimensional perovskites are formed through the addition of bulky ammonium cation ligands (typically phenethylammonium, PEA, or butylammonium, BTA), which can substitute A-site cations (e.g., methylammonium, formadinium, or cesium) (FA = HC(NH 2 ) 2 + , MA = CH 3 NH 3 + ) and form a layer of protective hydrophobic organic molecules that terminate the perovskite lattice. Hydrophobic terminating organic layers help prevent water from penetrating into the material.  20, 21, 27  Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have shown that the removal of these bulky cations from the lattice requires significantly higher energies than does the removal of smaller A-site cations like MA or FA, indicating another basis of improved stability.  27  The relationship between perovskite dimensionality and ion migration remains underexplored. Temperature-dependent conductivity studies have revealed that the activation energy for ion migration in low-n 2.5D perovskites (⟨n⟩ = 3) exceeds that in bulk perovskites.  28  These studies focused on the active material itself rather than full devices, and the identity of migrating species was not reported. Additionally, solar cells with active layers composed of strongly confined, lowdimensional 2.5D perovskites (typically n ≤ 5) typically exhibit low PCEs and are therefore not suitable for applications in highly efficient photovoltaics.  20, 27  Studies of 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures have shown improved long-term stability but do not directly address the challenge of ion migration within the 3D layer and have been seen to suffer an initial loss of PCE (termed a fast burn-in).  29  Ion migration in 2.5D perovskites with higher average quantum well widths (n ≥ 20) has not been thoroughly examined nor has the relationship between 2.5D perovskites and device operating (AM1.5 at MPP) stability, as distinct from ambient stability (shelf life). Here we study vertical ion migration and investigate how this affects performance degradation in planar n-i-p PSCs under ambient working conditions, comparing the use of 2.5D vs 3D active layers. We find that 2.5D perovskites (n = 40) that employ the ligand allylammonium (ALA) provide improved operating stability compared to their 3D counterparts. With the aid of time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS), we report that the main species undergoing vertical ion migration is iodine. We observe that iodine migrates through the organic hole transport layer (HTL) to the metal contact atop the device, deteriorating the HTL and HTL/metal interface. Comparing the TOF-SIMS profiles of 2.5D and 3D perovskites in the same device architectures and aging conditions, we find 75% less Au 2 I signal at the HTL/ metal interface and 60% lower change in iodine signal in the HTL for the 2.5D device, indicating that 2.5D perovskites exhibit significantly slower vertical iodine migration in planar n-i-p devices. We further analyze the impact of ion migration on device stability, finding that iodide migration is deleterious to MPP stability and that the suppressed migration in 2.5D devices helps MPP stability under inert conditions. With this suppressed ion migration, we achieved a 19.9% PCE 2.5D photovoltaic device with no observable PCE decrease after operating under MPP tracking conditions for 80 h, whereas the 3D device degraded by more than 50% following the first 24 h of MPP operation. To study the impact of ion migration on the long-term operation of PSCs, we fabricated control devices using the planar n-i-p structure ITO/TiO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMe-TAD/Au. The perovskite layer has a triple cation/anion composition of Cs 0.05 FA 0.8 MA 0.15 PbI 2.88 Br 0.04 Cl 0.08 . To synthesize the 2.5D perovskite active layers, we substituted 5% (molar ratio) of the A-site cations with the organic ligand molecule ALA in the precursor solution. This corresponds to an average of n = 40 layers per grain (n = number of monolayers in perovskite). We selected ALA as the ligand because, compared to other bulky organic ligand molecules such as PEA and BTA, ALA provides a smaller population of lower-n perovskite quantum wells.  30  This provides a smoother energy landscape within the film and at the same time offers similar dark stability to that provided by PEA and BTA.  27, 30  The device structure is shown in Figure  1a . We first looked for morphological differences correlated with ALA incorporation. In Figure  1b ,c, we show scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the 3D and 2.5D perovskite films. The pristine 3D perovskite film shows a pinhole-free surface, which indicates no shunt in the perovskite layer. The 2.5D perovskite is similar to the 3D perovskite film, with some flake-like stacking structures corresponding to the 2.5D perovskite.  21   To provide an initial stability comparison between 3D and 2.5D perovskite, we aged the devices under a N 2 atmosphere at room temperature to exclude oxygen. This also allowed us to exclude moisture and heat-induced degradation of the perovskites. We then compared X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns before and after aging (Figure  1d ). Even in inert conditions, the 3D devices show a significant increase in PbI 2 after aging. For 3D perovskites, the PbI 2 /perovskite XRD peak ratio increased over 20% after aging compared to fresh 3D samples, whereas for 2.5D perovskite, the PbI 2 /perovskite ratio stayed the same (Table  1 ). We note that the PbI 2 peak in XRD is very sensitive to the film composition, and even a few percent excess of PbI 2 can give rise to a large PbI 2 signal in XRD.  30, 31  This sensitivity enables us to report a signal related to the degradation of perovskite in a N 2 atmosphere, but we point out that the peak area represents a relative change in the amount of PbI 2 before vs after aging. We also looked for changes in carrier dynamics related to the incorporation of ALA. Figure  2a ,b shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of the 3D and 2.5D perovskites. The samples are encapsulated using poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to avoid degradation from oxygen and moisture.  31, 32  We observe that the PL peak position shows no notable difference between 2.5D and 3D perovskites, a result of the high ⟨n⟩ value in the 2.5D case: the quantum confinement of the n = 40 grains is too small to be spectrally resolved, in agreement with previous observations.  33  Figure  2c  shows the change of PL intensity versus time for the 3D and 2.5D perovskite films. The PL intensity of 3D perovskite quickly decreases while the 2.5D perovskite remains stable: for the 2.5D perovskite, its change compared to its initial value is less than 20% relative as a result of 10 h of aging under photoexcitation.  34  To characterize any ion migration and to determine the identity of moving species in working devices, we carried out TOF-SIMS measurements on fresh vs MPP-operated devices. We operated both the 3D and 2.5D perovskite devices under AM1.5 conditions at MPP in nitrogen at room temperature. We first measured the depth profile of fresh and aged 3D and 2.5D devices (Figures  S1  and S2 ) and compared all major ion species. As the I -and FA + counts in the perovskite layer saturated the detector, we also provide depth-dependent traces for I 2 -and 13 C-FA in Figures  S1, S2 , and S4. The Pb, FA, MA, and Cs ions show no major difference (Figures  S3-S6 ) before and after aging for both 3D and 2.5D perovskites. However, in the 3D perovskite, the iodine signal shows prominent changes, especially at the interface between the gold and spiro-OMeTAD (hereafter referred to just as spiro) layers (Figure  S2 ), while the 2.5D device shows little change (Figure  S1 ). We conclude that I -is the dominant species migrating during these experiments and that the n = 40 2.5D perovskite suppresses this migration (Figure  3a ). Figure  S7  shows the 3D tomography reconstruction from the TOF-SIMS experiments, and it indicates the uniformity and low concentration of I -in the spiro layer in the fresh device. We conclude that in the present study the I -signal away from the perovskite layer is a result of migration and not due to permeation of ions through large pinholes.  35  We also identified a significant amount of Au 2 I -signal in the TOF-SIMS spectra. We note that this signal does not directly confirm the existence of such a complex at the interface; it is possible that this complex forms following the sputtering pulse in our TOF-SIMS experiments before being swept into the detector (i.e., the sputtering of two gold atoms and one iodine atom leads to the formation of a singly charged secondary ion complex shortly upon entering the vacuum after being sputtered from the sample). It does, however, confirm the presence of iodine at this interface. The depth profile shows that the Au 2 I -signal has increased significantly in aged 3D perovskite devices compared to fresh devices (Figure  3b ). In contrast, in the case of the 2.5D perovskite, the Au 2 I -signal is unchanged before and after aging (Figure  3c ). These findings suggest that in 3D devices, I -migrates from the perovskite layer through the spiro layer and all the way to the spiro/gold interface in MPP operating devices even at room temperature in a nitrogen atmosphere. In n = 40 2.5D perovskite devices, this migration is greatly suppressed: comparing the ratio of Au 2 I -signal at the gold/spiro interface before and after aging, we see that this signal increases roughly    ×5 for the 3D devices, whereas the increase is only about ×1.25 for the 2.5D devices. We performed additional TOF-SIMS experiments with slower sputtering rates in order better to resolve ion migration within the Au and spiro layers of the device. Plots of Au -, I -, and C 5 N -versus sputtering depth are shown in Figure  4  for the 3D (Figure  4a ) and 2.5D (Figure  4c ) devices. Because these devices are aged at room temperature, Au does not penetrate through the spiro layer but exists only in the surface layer.  36  Figure  4b ,d presents enlarged figures that show the I - distribution in the spiro layer for fresh and MPP aged 3D and 2.5D devices, respectively. The MPP-operated 3D perovskite device exhibits a 60% higher I -signal than fresh devices throughout the spiro layer, while the 2.5D perovskite shows a much smaller change following the same duration of AM1.5 MPP operation. This directly proves the iodine migration throughout the spiro and gold layers in the 3D device and the suppression of iodine migration in the 2.5D perovskite device. </text>

      <text> ACS Energy Letters Letter To investigate further iodine migration in 3D perovskites, we carried out sputtering X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of full devices, sputtering from the top of the gold layer through to the gold/spiro interface and further into the spiro layer, keeping track of the elements Au, I, and N at the various sputter depths (Figure  S8 ). We observed that the Au counts decrease significantly at line scan 5, corresponding to the Au/ spiro interface. Upon reaching this interface, in the aged sample, a shoulder peak with higher binding energy appears in the Au 4f spectrum: the binding energy of Au 4f 7/2 for Au 0 is ∼84.2 eV, whereas oxidized gold Au + has a binding energy of ∼85.6 eV.  37  These values are consistent with the peak positions we see in our Au 4f spectra, indicating oxidation of Au near the spiro/gold interface. No such peak is observed in fresh samples. This suggests that gold forms complexes with iodine that have migrated to this interface as this is observed to be the dominant species migrating during device operation. We note that these oxidized peaks do not appear as a result of damage to the material during the sputtering process because mostly Au 0 peaks are again obtained after sputtering deeper into the material, and no extra peaks are observed in the fresh samples that are sputtered under identical conditions. From these experiments, we conclude that iodide ions are activated within the perovskite active layer under MPP conditions and that they migrate within the active layer but also through the spiro layer before they reach the spiro/gold interface. This study identifies that at room temperature the moving species are indeed I -ions rather than metal ions.  36, 38  This migration and the subsequent deterioration of the Au/ spiro interface is much more severe in the 3D device compared to that in the 2.5D device, and this agrees with the ability of 2.5D perovskites to suppress iodide ion migration in MPP conditions. To examine the influence of this ion migration on photovoltaic performance, we studied the MPP stability of PSCs based on 3D and 2.5D devices. The current-voltage (J-V) characteristics of champion devices are given in Figure  5a , and the performance metrics are summarized in Table  2 . The external quantum efficiency (EQE) is shown in Figure  5c . The stable output at MPP gives 20% PCE for the 3D device and 19% for the 2.5D device (Figure  5b ), demonstrating that high average n value 2.5D perovskites provide a similar performance to 3D devices.  27  When the devices are operated at MPP in a nitrogen atmosphere, the 3D devices degrade rapidly, losing more than 50% of their initial PCE within 24 h of operation. In contrast, the 2.5D device shows no change in performance following 80 h of continuous AM1.5 MPP operation (Figure  5d ). In contrast with other reports of MPP stability for 2.5D perovskites, we do not observe an initial burn-in.  21, 22  Because the MPP tests are performed at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere, oxygen-and water-induced degradation pathways can be ruled out. We conclude that the main degradation of these devices comes from ion migration, consistent with the observed iodide migration in 3D perovskite devices and suppressed migration in 2.5D perovskite devices. To further evaluate how the ALA molecules suppress ion migration and stabilize the perovskite, we also tested the stability of ALA-post-treated devices under the same operating conditions. We found that post-treated devices do not show an appreciable difference in stability compared to the pure 3D device (Figure  S9 ). Covering the surface of the perovskite with ligands is thus not sufficient to suppress ion migration: we offer that the formation of 2.5D structured grains, with their more negative (more favorable) formation energy, is key to stabilization. To conclude, this work investigated degradation processes within n-i-p planar PSCs in inert photovoltaic working conditions. By comparing fresh and MPP aged devices operating in an inert atmosphere, we correlate vertical ion migration in a planar n-i-p device with degradation of operating performance. The studies are designed such that they exclude external factors such as oxygen and moisture. We also identified iodide ions to be the dominant migrating species. We are the first to report that iodide ions are sufficiently activated under standard working conditions to migrate within the perovskite active layer, penetrate through the spiro layer, and reach the spiro/Au interface, where they possibly form an iodine-gold complex. We saw that forming 2.5D perovskites by adding ALA ligands suppresses this migration and allows for significantly enhanced stability. The 2.5D PSC has an initial PCE of 19.9% that shows no degradation (including no initial drop in efficiency due to burn-in) following 80 h of continuous AM1.5 operation at MPP, whereas PSCs with 3D active layers show an initial PCE of 20% that degrades to an AM1.5 PCE of less than 10% within 24 h of operation. This work offers insights into the degradation mechanisms in PSCs in inert MPP conditions and highlights how 2.5D perovskites can contribute to increased stability in PSCs, in addition to their effects of protecting against moisture-and oxygen-induced degradation. To retard further the migration of other atoms, other layers can be modified. For example, gold migration can occur at 70 °C, and adding Cr can suppress this process.  36  Such modifications, along with the use of 2.5D perovskites, can be expected to improve stability further.
