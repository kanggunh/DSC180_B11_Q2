      <text>The film stress can be calculated according to the relationship between 2θ and sin 2 φ as the following equation  [8]  ： σ = - E 2(1+υ) π 180 cot θ 0 ∂ (2θ ) ∂ sin 2 φ (1) where E and υ are Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the perovskite film, respectively. θ0 is the diffraction peak for strain-free perovskite crystal plane and θ is the diffraction peak for the measured perovskite films. φ is the angle of diffraction vector with respect to the sample normal direction. Here, the values of E and υ are 10200 MPa and 0.3, respectively. By fitting the 2θ as a function of sin 2 φ, we can calculate perovskite film strain from formula (1), and the slope of the fitted line stands for the scale of the residual strain, the negative slope indicates the films bear tension strain. It is found that the δ-phase formed in the 0% DBSO sample was completely transformed into α-phase perovskite within approximately 30 s, but after annealing, the formed α-phase perovskite possesses lower diffraction peak intensity and larger halfpeak width (Supplementary Figure  11 ). By contrast, the intermediate phase in the 10% DBSO sample disappeared within approximately 10 s, while the fully annealed film shows much stronger α-phase diffraction peaks with smaller half-peak widths. This comparison highlights the important role of DBSO additive in promoting perovskite αphase crystal growth. For XRD measurement, we prepared perovskite precursor film samples in N2 glove box and put it into a sealed chamber. Then, the samples were quickly transferred for XRD testing (The XRD instrument is in the lab on the next floor of the device fabrication lab). When annealing, the perovskite film was kept in a N2 filled small chamber and placed on a temperature controlled hotplate for different time. The annealing hotplate was placed nearby the XRD instrument. When testing, the annealed sample was quickly taken out for XRD measurement. nature energy  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01288-7   </text>

      <text> Article Reduction of bulk and surface defects in inverted methylammonium-and bromide-free formamidinium perovskite solar cells Rui Chen 1 , Jianan Wang      Power conversion efficiencies of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on methylammonium-and bromide-free formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) perovskites still lag behind PSCs with a regular configuration. Here we improve the quality of both the bulk and surface of FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 perovskite films to reduce the efficiency gap. First, we use dibutyl sulfoxide, a Lewis base additive, to improve the crystallinity and reduce the defect density and internal residual stress of the perovskite bulk. Then, we treat the surface of the perovskite film with trifluorocarbon-modified phenethylammonium iodide to optimize the energy levels, passivate defects and protect the film against moisture. The inverted PSCs simultaneously achieve 25.1% efficiency (24.5% from the reverse current-voltage scan measured by a third-party institution) and improved stability. The devices maintained 97.4% and 98.2% of their initial power conversion efficiencies after operating under continuous 1-sun air mass 1.5 G illumination for 1,800 h and under damp heat conditions (85 °C and 85% relative humidity) for 1,000 h, respectively.  </text>

      <text> Modulation of perovskite films crystal growth First, we optimized the preparation process of FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 -based perovskite films; a small amount of caesium is introduced to stabilize the black phase of FAPbI 3 -based perovskite  11  . We found that it is easier to prepare pin-hole free FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 -based films with DMF/NMP solvent mixture rather not the commonly used DMF/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in a N 2 -filled glove box (Supplementary Fig.  1 ), which is similar to the results reported in ref. 22. Starting from the DMF/NMP solvent, we further modified it by adding DBSO (longer-chain analogue of DMSO) as a coordination agent to modulate the perovskite growth (Supplementary Tables  2  and 3 ). The longer alkyl chains incorporated in DBSO result in its higher boiling point (250 °C versus 189 °C) and stronger electron donating power (Gutmann donor number, 31.0 versus 29.8) as compared with DMSO, which enables more stable coordination with PbI 2 than the DMSO case and also NMP case (donor number of 27.3) as demonstrated below. Such properties play an important role in control of perovskite crystal growth and defects concentration in the resultant FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 films. The effects of different DBSO additive contents (0%, 5%, 10% and 20%, molar ratio to PbI 2 ) on the morphology and crystal size of perovskite films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig.  1a , the average grain size in the perovskite films gradually increases from 260 to 378 and 466 nm following the increase in the DBSO content from 0% to 5% and then to 10%. When the DBSO content further increases to 20%, the average crystal size slightly decreases to 432 nm (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). When the amount of DBSO further increases to 40%, many micron-level cracks are observed in the resultant perovskite films (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), which may be due to DBSO residue caused by excessive addition (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). Therefore, using an appropriate amount of DBSO is the key factor to improving the film quality. Figure  1b ,c shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite films before and after annealing with different DBSO content. As can be seen, the non-annealed precursor film with 0% DBSO exhibits a δ-phase diffraction peak at 11.8°, while the addition of DBSO inhibits the formation of δ-phase in the non-annealed films thus leading to the increased amount of α-phase perovskite with the main peak at 14.0° and a new phase with the main peak at 6.3°. Furthermore, increase in the content of DBSO from 5% to 10% and then to 20% is accompanied by the gradual increase in the XRD peak intensity of the new phase, while the peaks of α-phase perovskite gradually decay. These findings indicate that DBSO induces the formation of a new crystalline intermediate phase facilitating the formation of α-phase perovskite. The diffraction peak at 6.3° is attributed to the formation of DBSO•PbI 2 intermediate phase similar to other Lewis base-PbI 2 intermediate phases  10, 23  (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). The interactions between DBSO, PbI 2 and formamidinium iodide (FAI) are confirmed by comparing the Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectra of the DBSO, DBSO•PbI 2 , FAI and FAI•PbI 2 •DBSO samples (Fig.  1d , Supplementary Fig.  6  and Supplementary Table  4 ). The sulfoxide S=O bond stretching vibration peak of DBSO located at 1,028 cm -1 shifted to 968 cm -1 in the DBSO•PbI 2 sample, which is owing to the formation of dative bond by sharing the lone pair electrons in oxygen with Pb 2+ . And the C=N double bond stretching vibration peak of FAI at 1,697 cm -1 shifted to 1,712 cm -1 in the FAI•PbI 2 •DBSO sample. This phenomenon is similar to the peak shift induced by coordination between other Lewis bases to PbI 2 and FAI  22, 24  . Although it has been widely reported that many Lewis bases can lead to the formation of intermediate phases (for example, DMSO•PbI 2 and NMP•PbI 2 ) in the perovskite precursor films, it is noteworthy that the specific DBSO•PbI 2 intermediate phase is much more stable than NMP•PbI 2 , so it could resist the instantaneous anti-solvent extraction process (Supplementary Figs.  7 8 9 ). Note that the amount of NMP in our solvent system is large, but the amount of the NMP•PbI 2 intermediate phase in the obtained non-annealed films is negligibly low after the anti-solvent washing process. Based Therefore, it is particularly urgent to improve the efficiency of inverted PSCs at the current stage. Screening the performance optimization strategies reported for high-efficiency (&gt;25%) regular PSCs 2-6 reveals that methylammonium (MA + )-and bromide (Br -)-free formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 )-based perovskites are commonly employed because of their ideal bandgap close to the Shockley-Queisser optimum. The resultant devices typically simultaneously demonstrate high short-circuit current density (J SC ) of ~26 mA cm  -2  , and high open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.17-1.19 V (Supplementary Table  1 ). The high-efficiency (&gt;24%) inverted PSCs  [11] [12] [13] [14]  usually incorporated FAPbI 3 as the main component with small amounts of MA + and Br -as additives, which may be beneficial for achieving higher V OC , but also lead to a slight sacrifice of J SC (Supplementary Table  1 ) due to the optical loss caused by blue-shifted absorbance. Li  with a lower V OC of 1.095 V. In addition, the introduction of MA + and Br -to FAPbI 3 could raise risk to induce problems such as low thermal stability caused by the existence of MA, phase separation caused by the presence of mixed halides, and reduced photon absorption and current density cause by Br -incorporation  [15] [16] [17]  . Although some recent literature reported controversal results that the incorporation of small portions of MA + , Br -in hybrid perovskites is benefit for stability improvement  18, 19  . FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 has been widely recognized as the most attractive material for PSCs exhibiting both high efficiencies and good thermal stability  20  . Until now, the highest certified efficiency of inverted PSCs based on MA + -and Br --free formamidinium cesium perovskite is only 23.5% with V OC of 1.14 V (ref. 11). Thus, it is desirable to further optimize inverted PSCs based on the MA + -and Br --free formamidinium cesium perovskites. So far, key strategies implemented in those high-efficiency inverted PSCs mainly focused on optimizing interfacial materials and surface passivation of perovskite absorber films  [11] [12] [13] [14] 21  . Beyond these strategies, the management of the bulk and surface defects in perovskite films is of equal importance to achieve an efficient and stable inverted PSCs. In this Article, we report an optimization strategy to simultaneously manage the bulk and surface defects in FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 perovskite films to enable high-performance inverted PSCs. Firstly, a low-volatile dibutyl sulfoxide (DBSO) Lewis base additive with a strong coordination ability was introduced into the N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent system, thus leading to the formation of a stable intermediate phase of DBSO•PbI 2 in the precursor film even after anti-solvent extraction. Such intermediate phase can suppress the formation of undesirable δ-phase FA-perovskite and modulate perovskite crystal growth. The proposed improved film fabrication strategy leads to perovskite films with larger grain size and reduced internal film stress and bulk defects. In addition, 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) phenethylammonium iodide (denoted as 2CF 3 -PEAI) was introduced as an interface passivator designed to simultaneously adjust interfacial energy levels, passivate surface defects of the perovskite films and stabilize the films against moisture with help from the presence of hydrophobic CF 3 groups. As a result, the devices demonstrated impressive PCEs of up to 25.1% (24.5% from reverse scan was measured by a third-party institution) owing to the use of the high-quality FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 films. Moreover, the encapsulated devices showed stable operation in air under continuous 1-sun air mass (AM) 1.5 G illumination for up to 1,800 h without notable efficiency decay and also pass the damp heat test (85 °C and 85% relative humidity (RH)) according to the international standards for mature photovoltaics (IEC61215). on the molecular structures of NMP, DBSO and PbI 2 octahedral, we used density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the interaction energy between PbI 2 and the two coordination molecules (Fig.  1e, f ). The interaction energy between PbI 2 and DBSO (-1.42 eV) is much higher than that between PbI 2 and NMP (-1.03 eV), and also higher than the interaction energy between PbI 2 and DMSO (-1.01 eV; Supplementary Fig.  10 ) due to the stronger electron donating of DBSO than the other two Lewis bases. This difference could explain why the   </text>

      <text> Characterization of the perovskite film's quality XRD patterns of the annealed perovskite films made from different precursor solutions show that all the films transform into α-phase FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 perovskite after annealing at 150 °C for 20 min (Fig.  1c ). With the increasing content of DBSO loading from 0% to 5% and then to 10%, the XRD peak intensity gradually increases, thus indicating the enhancement of the perovskite crystallinity. This is consistent with the increased grain size upon DBSO addition as observed by SEM. The perovskite crystal growth mechanisms can be explained by two different pathways as described in Fig.  1g . In the case of 0% DBSO sample, the δ-phase transition to α-phase occurs directly during annealing; while in the 10% DBSO sample a molecular exchange between DBSO•PbI 2 intermediate phase and FAI is controlling the α-phase crystal growth upon annealing. It has been widely reported that the intermediate phase or molecular exchange dominated crystal growth could reduce the activation energy of the perovskite crystal formation, which normally leads to larger crystalline grain size in the as-fabricated perovskite films  23, 25  . We also conducted XRD characterization to monitor the crystal structure evolution from the as-coated films to fully crystallized perovskite films during annealing (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). The obtained results further confirm the important role of the DBSO•PbI 2 intermediate phase in promoting the crystallinity of the obtained α-phase FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 films. When the DBSO content further increases to 20%, the XRD diffraction peak intensity becomes slightly lower, which is also consistent with the SEM data discussed above. It is well known that the internal residual stress in perovskite films can promote the formation of atomic vacancies, increase non-radiative recombination, reduce carrier mobility and structural stability, and thus deteriorate the photovoltaic performance of devices  [26] [27] [28] [29]  . We employed grazing incident XRD to test the residual stress at the 50 nm and 200 nm depth regions of the perovskite films obtained using different DBSO content (Supplementary Tables  5  and 6 ). The results show that the tensile stress at 200 nm (Fig.  2a  and Supplementary Fig.  12 ) and 50 nm (Fig.  2b  and Supplementary Fig.  13 ) gradually release with the increasing DBSO content from 0% to 5% and then to 10%. In addition, Williamson-Hall analysis also confirmed that the introduction of DBSO can relax the lattice strain (Supplementary Fig.  14 ). This phenomenon may be related to the following two reasons  30  : first, when DBSO•PbI 2 reacts with FAI to form perovskite, the formation energy of α-phase perovskite can be significantly reduced, thereby avoiding the formation of δ-phase nuclei in the precursor film. Thus, the tensile stress caused by cell volume shrinkage during the transformation of δ-phase to α-phase in the case of the 0% DBSO samples could be avoided (Supplementary Fig.  15a, b ). Second, the tensile stress remaining at the grain boundaries due to the lattice expansion during high-temperature annealing of perovskite could be further released by reducing the number of grain boundaries when using optimal concentrations of DBSO additive (Supplementary Fig.  15c ). Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) (Fig.  2c ) and transient PL spectroscopy (Fig.  2d  and Supplementary Fig.  16 ) were used to evaluate the non-radiative carrier recombination behaviour of the perovskite films made from different DBSO additive content. The results show that the addition of DBSO, especially for 10% content, could effectively suppress the fast non-radiative decay component. As can be seen, benefitted from strain relaxation, the fitted carrier lifetime increases from 423 ns (0% DBSO) to 613 ns (5% DBSO) and finally to 708 ns (10% DBSO). The 20% DBSO sample has a shorter PL lifetime (525 ns), which is consistent with its reduced crystallinity (Fig.  1c ). Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy was further used to analyse the carrier dynamics in the perovskite films with and without DBSO addition (Fig.  2e, f ). It can be seen that the attenuation rate of ground-state bleaching of perovskite film decreases significantly when DBSO is added, and the single exponential kinetic model delivered the lifetimes of 9.89 ns (0% DBSO) and 32.56 ns (10% DBSO) (Supplementary Fig.  17 )  31, 32  , which again verified the decrease in defect density within the DBSO-based films. The above results consistently show that using appropriate DBSO loading can effectively release residual stress within the film and reduce defect density due to the ability of this additive to modulate the perovskite crystal growth. These effects inhibit the non-radiative recombination of charge carriers and improve the carrier lifetime. To optimize the content of DBSO, we prepared inverted PSCs with the ITO/p-PY/FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 /PCBM/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag configuration; the typical cross-sectional SEM image of the device is shown in Supplementary Fig.  18 . p-PY is an efficient and stable hole transport material incorporating pyridine core functionalized with poly(triarylamine) units as we reported recently  33, 34  . Supplementary Fig.  19  shows the current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the devices based on the perovskite films with different DBSO content. It can be seen that PCE reaches the highest values when DBSO content is close to 10% (Supplementary Fig.  20 ). As compared with the reference 0% DBSO samples, J SC of the 10% DBSO device increases from 24.88 mA cm -2 to 25.68 mA cm -2 , V OC increases from 1.024 V to 1.091 V, fill factor (FF) increases from 0.792 to 0.805, and PCE increases from 20.2% to 22.6% (Supplementary Table  7 ). The improved device performance is assigned to the reduced defect density and improved carrier lifetimes caused by the use of DBSO additive. </text>

      <text> Effect of the surface passivation In addition to the reduction of bulk defects within the perovskite films by using DBSO additive engineering, we designed phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) derivatives containing different fluorocarbon (CF 3 ) functional groups as surface modification reagents to further passivate the defects in the perovskite films. Molecular structures of the PEAI derivatives CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI are shown in Fig.  3a . Top-view SEM images revealed that the surface morphology of the perovskite films after modifications with PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI did not change significantly (Supplementary Fig.  21 ), which is consistent with the recent report  35  . To further identify the states of above passivators on the perovskite, we performed TA spectroscopy of the perovskite films treated with PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI to accurately identify whether 2D phase perovskites were formed in the corresponding perovskite films (Supplementary Fig.  22 ). Both perovskite films showed the characteristic peaks at about 580 nm belonging to n = 2 low-dimensional perovskites  21  , which could block minority carriers from the interface/surface  36  . From the viewpoint of molecular engineering, the CF 3 electron-withdrawing groups could adjust the passivators' molecular dipole moment and hydrophobicity, whereas the size difference among the PEA + , CF 3 -PEA + and 2CF 3 -PEA + cations may also influence their diffusion depths into the bulk of perovskite films. To study this point, we conducted time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurements on the films (based on F signals; Fig.  3e ). We also used F-PEA + to substitute PEA + by deliberately introducing F element but not significantly affect the size of organic cation. It is found that 2CF 3 -PEA + cations show the shallowest diffusion depth and F-PEA + cations show the deepest diffusion depth. This observation is due to the 2CF 3 -PEA + cation having the largest steric hindrance effect, impeding its inward diffusion. This was also confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiles (Supplementary Fig.  23 ). The distribution of passivator is considered to affect the surface electrical properties and chemical stability of the films. To study the surface electrical properties of perovskite films with different passivator, the electrostatic potentials (φ max ) of PEA, CF 3 -PEA and 2CF 3 -PEA were characterized, which were determined to be 183.39, 187.19 and 189.42 kcal mol -1 , respectively. 2CF 3 -PEA has the largest electrostatic potential, that is, the highest dipole moment Article  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01288-7   among the three molecules due to the presence of two CF 3 groups with strong electron-withdrawing ability. The electric field generated by the interfacial dipole can change the vacuum energy level and work function of the adjacent material  [37] [38] [39]  . We further studied this issue by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Supplementary Fig.  24 ) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig.  25 ) measurements. Work functions of the pristine perovskite films and the films treated with PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI or 2CF 3 -PEAI are estimated as 4.83, 4.69, 4.61 and 4.58 eV, respectively (Fig.  3b ). This is almost consistent with the evolution of the film surface potentials measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) for the above four conditions (Supplementary Fig.  26 ). The energy level of PCBM was obtained according to previous report  40  . The introduction of an extra back-surface field is an effective way to improve device's V OC , which is widely applied in crystalline silicon solar cells and has recently been demonstrated in high-efficiency PSCs  11, 37  . The extra back electric field caused by the stronger dipole moment of the surface modifiers may be an important factor enabling the device's higher V OC in this work. According to previous reports  41, 42  , the terminal group of CF 3 has a strong electron-withdrawing ability, making CF 3 capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the amino group in FA + and reducing the generation of A-site vacancies, thus improving the performance of the device. In addition, the surface passivation of the perovskite absorber films with PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI can bring additional functions such as compensation of the loss of I -ions during the annealing process and chelation of the exposed undercoordinated Pb 2+ ions  43, 44  . The effect of passivators on the carrier dynamic of perovskite films was further studied. Transient PL (Fig.  3c  and Supplementary Fig.  27 ) and steady-state PL (Supplementary Fig.  28 ) spectra show that the non-radiative recombination becomes further inhibited and the fitted PL lifetime is increased from 0.7 (pristine) to 1.1 (PEAI), 1.4 (CF 3 -PEAI) and 1.6 µs (2CF 3 -PEAI), respectively, after the corresponding surface  passivation. This tendency indicates that 2CF 3 -PEAI enables the best surface passivation effect among the three studied passivators. The transient PL lifetime (Fig.  3d  and Supplementary Fig.  29 ) of the perovskite/PCBM stacks reflects the difference in interfacial charge transfer rate after the surface passivation. In principle, the Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime as extracted from the slower decay (τ 2 ) is related to the important interfacial recombination  45  . The 2CF 3 -PEAI-treated perovskite films show longer lifetime at the same excitation condition, which indicates that 2CF 3 -PEAI enables the best surface passivation effect among the three studied passivators. The obtained results show that the PL lifetime is increased from 21.3 (pristine) to 38.9 (PEAI), 34.6 (CF 3 -PEAI) and finally to 23.5 ns (2CF 3 -PEAI). In comparison with their strongly positive effect on carrier lifetimes within the perovskite absorber films, the modification has negligible impact on the resultant devices' J SC 37 . The lowest 2D perovskite signals in 2CF 3 -PEAI sample indicates that the introduction of two CF 3 groups could suppress the formation of 2D perovskite, which may be helpful for defect passivation. The above results confirm that 2CF 3 -PEAI possesses the best surface defects passivation capability, which might be related to its shallowest diffusion depth as compared with other studied organic cations  46  . The loss of iodine caused by thermal annealing mainly happens at the surface of the perovskite film. Thus, 2CF 3 -PEAI with its low diffusion depth could enrich the perovskite surface with iodide thus leading to efficient defect passivation. The large size of 2CF 3 -PEAI also prevents its deep diffusion into the interior of the film, which could destroy the ideal three-dimensional (3D) perovskite lattice.  </text>

      <text> Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01288-7   Figure  3f  shows the external quantum efficiencies of electroluminescence (EQE-EL) of PSCs based on the perovskite films with different passivators. It is well known that V OC of a solar cell is directly related to its internal luminescence efficiency  44  . In this case, when the injection current density is set to the value equal to J SC under solar illumination, EQE-EL of the pristine device is 0.2%. EQE-EL of the PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI surface passivated devices were shown to be 0.8%, 1.5% and 5.2%, respectively. Based on the formula ΔV OC = k B T/qln(EQE passivation / EQE pristine )  44  , it can be estimated that the V OC improvement after surface passivation with PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI are 36, 52 and 84 mV, respectively. The tendency is well consistent with the experimentally observed V OC variation in the devices discussed below. To quantify the V OC potential for every individual stack, we calculated the internal electron-hole quasi-Fermi level splitting from PLQY results (Supplementary Figs.  30  and 31 ) according to previous method  47, 48  , which indicated effectively suppressing non-radiative recombination by interface passivation. </text>

      <text> Performance and stability of PSCs Figure  4a  shows the J-V curves of the p-i-n PSCs without and with different surface passivation. It was observed that J SC does not change significantly and the enhancement of PCE associated with the surface passivation is mainly due to the increase in V OC and FF (Supplementary Table  8 ). The champion PCE reached for the 2CF 3 -PEAI passivated device was 25.1%, with a J SC of 25.88 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.176 V and an FF of 0.825, while the hysteresis effect was negligible (Supplementary Fig.  32 ). The steady-state PCE of the device was 25.0% (Supplementary Fig.  33 ), which is very close to the PCE obtained from the reverse voltage sweep J-V curve. EQE spectrum of the corresponding device is shown in Supplementary Fig.  34 . The integral short circuit current density calculated from the EQE spectrum is 25.74 mA cm -2 , which is nearly identical to the J SC value extracted from J-V measurements. We also sent one of the best devices to a credible third-party organization and got a certified efficiency of 24.5%, with J SC of 25.75 mA cm -2 , V OC of 1.167 V and FF of 0.815 (Supplementary Fig.  35 ). Furthermore, the device performance was very well reproducible (Fig.  4b  and Supplementary Fig.  36 ). Although the efficiency of the fabricated devices is still a little bit lower than that of the best regular PSCs, the measured operation lifetime of our inverted PSCs is much longer. This indicates the potential advantage of inverted PSCs in simultaneously achieving high efficiency and long-term operational stability. Besides the impact on photovoltaic performance, defects also considerably affect device operational stability because defect sites disrupt the original lattice arrangement and thus change the thermodynamic energy of the perovskite decomposition and phase change  49  . To study the influence of our defects management strategy on the device stability, we monitored the long-term ageing behaviour of the encapsulated devices based on different passivators using maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under continuous AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm -2 illumination in ambient air (cell temperature 50 ± 5 °C, 50 ± 5% RH) (Fig.  4c ). The device based on pristine perovskite films (initial PCE 21.4%) degraded to 67.2% of its initial PCE after 780 h. The PEAI and CF 3 -PEAI passivated devices (initial PCEs of 22.3% and 23.6%, respectively) degraded correspondingly to 72.3% and 82.1% of their initial PCEs after 1,800 h. The 2CF 3 -PEAI passivated device (initial PCE 24.5%) still retained 97.4% of the initial PCE after 1,800 h; the screen capture image demonstrating its continuous power output within almost the entire testing time is shown in Supplementary Fig.  37 . Since the defects at surface and grain boundaries are the active sites where perovskites have loose chemical binding, which facilitate severe ion migration and degradation, the most effective passivation of 2CF 3 -PEAI and the highest surface hydrophobicity (Fig.  4c ) are considered as the main reason for operational stability improvement. This is further supported by the highest activation energy of perovskite degradation of 2CF 3 -PEAI passivation versus the other passivator (Supplementary Figs.  38  and 39 ). The higher hydrophobicity of the 2CF 3 -PEAI modified samples could minimize the effect of the absorbed water and oxygen on the stability of encapsulated PSCs. The highest stability of the 2CF 3 -PEAI passivated perovskite films can be further proved by the in situ PL measurements combined with laser light ageing (Supplementary Fig.  40 ). It should be emphasized that other important factor enabling that improved device operational stability is the elimination of MA + cations and Br -anions from the perovskite absorber composition as discussed above. Indeed, comparing the stability of the PSCs based on conventional MAPbI 3 and Cs 0.15 FA 0.85 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 perovskite films and the introduced here FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 absorber formulations processed using 0% or 5% DBSO additive with 2CF 3 -PEAI passivation features the importance of several complementary parameters required to reach long operational lifetimes (Supplementary Figs.  41 42 43 ). Thus, the superior operational stability of the PSCs reported here is the result of multifactorial comprehensive optimization involving the proper selection of univalent cations (FA + and Cs + ), halide anions (I -only systems), solvent and intermediate phase engineering as well as designing efficient passivation coatings. In addition to the enhanced operational lifetime, the damp heat stability of the devices has also been tested in accordance with IEC61215 standard. The 2CF 3 -PEAI treated devices (average initial PCE of 24.8%) could retain 98.2% of their initial performance after ageing at 85 °C/85% RH for 1,000 h (Fig.  4d  and Supplementary Fig.  44 ). Meanwhile, the devices based on pristine perovskite films and the films with PEAI and CF 3 -PEAI passivation coatings degraded under the same ageing conditions to 71.3%, 87.2% and 91.1% of their initial PCEs, respectively. These results further confirm the notable impact of a close-to-ideal perovskite film with the lowest defect density, reduced internal residue stress and higher surface hydrophobicity on the device's stability. </text>

      <text> Conclusions In summary, we report the strategy to improve the quality of both bulk and surface of FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 perovskite films to enable high-performance inverted PSCs. First, we use a low-volatile DBSO Lewis base additive with a strong coordination ability to improve the crystallinity, reduce the defect density and internal residual stress of the perovskite bulk. Then, 2CF 3 -PEAI was introduced as an interface passivator designed to optimize the energy levels, passivate defects and protect the film against moisture. The inverted PSCs achieve 25.1% efficiency and improved stability. The devices maintained 97.4% and 98.2% of their initial PCEs after operating under continuous 1-sun AM 1.5 G illumination for 1,800 h and under the damp heat conditions (85 °C and 85% RH) for 1,000 h. This work not only provides a novel avenue to engineer efficient and stable inverted PSCs, but also deepens the understanding of the correlation between the device performance to the MA + -and Br --free perovskite bulk and surface properties. </text>

To prepare the precursor solutions with DBSO (5-20 mol% with respect to PbI 2 ), the additive was added to the DMF: NMP precursor solution. Then the perovskite solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 5,000 r.p.m. for 60 s. At the 12th second of spinning, 500 µl of ethyl acetate was dripped onto the substrate centre. The as-coated precursor films were subsequently annealed on a hotplate at 150 °C for 20 min. Then 100 µl of PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI or 2CF 3 -PEAI (1 mg ml -1 in IPA) were spin-coated onto the as-prepared perovskite films at a speed of 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s; the films were subsequently dried at 100 °C for 5 min. Then a chlorobenzene solution of PCBM (20 mg ml -1 ) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite films (passivated or not) at the rotation speed of 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s and heated at 70 °C for 10 min.

      <text> Computational details The calculation model is to calculate the adsorption energy of DBSO, NMP and DMSO on the surface of PbI 2 to characterize the interaction strength between different molecules and PbI 2 . Specifically, the adsorption energy can be obtained by using the following formula: The first-principles calculations were carried out by using the projector-augmented wave representations with DFT as implemented in the Vienna ab-initio simulation package  [51] [52] [53]  . The exchange and correlation energy were approximated by the spin-polarized generalize-gradient-approximation with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof formula  54  . Wave functions were expanded in plane waves up to a kinetic energy cut-off of 500 eV. Γ-centred k-meshes grids of 2 × 2 × 1 was used for slab calculations. To treat the van der Waals interactions, DFT-D3 correction method of Grimme was used  55  . All structures were fully relaxed until the force on each atom was smaller than 0.01 eV/Å. △E = E PbI 2 ⋅DBSO -E PbI 2 The electrostatic potentials (φ) of the passivators were calculated using the Gaussian 09 package at the B3LYP/def2TZVP level with DFT-D3 (ref. 56). The maximum φ (φ max ) of the NH 3 + terminal group in these passivators was obtained with the help of Multiwfn code. </text>

      <text> Characterizations KPFM measurements were conducted using a dimension icon scanning probe microscope (Asylum Research, MFP-3D-Stand Alone) in the tapping mode. KPFM measurements were carried out using an atomic force microscopy under ambient conditions, using a gold-coated Si tip. The KPFM measurement was implemented using a two-path method at a scan rate of 0.5 Hz, where the first pass in every scan line was used to determine the topography and the following second pass was used to measure the contact potential difference between the tip and the sample. The second pass was scanned by raising the tip at a fixed 20 nm height above the sample following the topography. Each set of samples was arranged in proximity on a common substrate and was measured using the same tip and scanning parameters. SEM images were obtained using a Nova NanoSEM 450 scanning electron microscope (FEI). An XPS system (Thermo ESCALAB 250XI) was used to acquire the XPS spectra. UPS spectra were acquired using a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI instrument equipped with a 1 He ultraviolet radiation source (21.22 eV). The both UPS and KPFM are surface-sensitive measurements. The crystal structure of the films was characterized using XRD with an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (PANalytical B.V.). The UV-vis spectra of perovskite films were obtained using a Lambda 950 UV-vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer). The steady-state PL spectra were recorded using an Edinburgh FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh) with an excitation source wavelength of 532 nm. The transient fluorescence spectroscopy (TRPL) measurements were conducted using a fluorescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 478 nm (DeltaFlex, Horiba), and the excitation pulse has a repetition rate of 100 kHz with a spot size of 100 µm. The applied excitation fluences were varied between 8.9 nJ cm -2 and 56.3 nJ cm -2 by using neutral density filters. the TRPL profiles were fitted by a bi-exponential decay rate model according to the following function: y = A 1 exp(-t/τ 1 ) + A 2 exp(-t/τ 2 ) + y 0, where τ 1 and τ 2 are the lifetimes for the fast and slow decays, respectively. The femtosecond transient absorption measurements were performed on a Helios spectrometer (Ultrafast Systems) pumped by a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (Legend Elite, Coherent) operating at 5 kHz with fundamental wavelength of 800 nm and pulse width of ~40 fs. Briefly, the 800 nm output pulse by a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier was split in two parts. One part was used to pump a TOPAS Optical Parametric Amplifier (Light Conversion), which generates a wavelength-tunable laser pulse from 250 nm to 2.5 µm as pump beam. Another part was attenuated with a neutral density filter and focused into sapphire window to generate a white light continuum (420 nm to 840 nm) used for probe beam. The delay between the pump and probe pulses was controlled by a motorized delay stage. The pump pulses were chopped by a synchronized chopper at 500 Hz, and the absorbance change was calculated with two adjacent probe pulses (pump-blocked and pump-unblocked). All experiments were performed at room temperature. The transient absorption test of perovskite films without DBSO and with 10% DBSO is performed with incident wavelength of 520 nm and incident light excitation power of 0.3 µW. The repetition rate of the TA system is 5,000 Hz, and the diameter of the pump beam spot is 100 µm. Considering that the perovskite film has a high absorption coefficient, to detect the transmitted light more clearly, in all the transient absorption tests, we dilute the perovskite solution to 0.75 M to prepare samples. When we are using 0.3 µW excitation power, we did not observe the signal of 2D perovskite phase due to the small excitation power. To demonstrate the formation of 2D perovskite phase on the surface of perovskite. Keeping other test conditions unchanged, we increased the power to 15 µW to observe that the perovskite films were modified with PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI. Photovoltaic measurements were carried out using a black mask with an aperture area of 0.09 cm 2 under standard AM 1.5 G simulated illumination (Oriel, model 9119), and the simulated light intensity was calibrated with a silicon photodiode (KG3, Enlitech). The PLQY was carried out via exciting the corresponding samples by a 405 nm laser inside an integrated sphere. The laser intensity was adjusted to 1 sun equivalent intensity using a PSC to obtain a current density at 0 V equal to its J SC . TOF-SIMS measurements were performed using a TOF-SIMS V instrument (IONTOF GmbH, 170 Cameca IMS 4F). The EQE spectra were obtained with EQE system (Saifan) using monochromatic light of 1 × 10 16 photons cm -2 in direct current mode. The EQE-EL spectra were recorded by a light emitting diode PL quantum-yield measurement system (Shenzhen Puyan Internet Technology) equipped with Keithley 2400 Source Measurement Unit. </text>

      <text> Federal Research Center for Problems of Chemical Physics and Medicinal Chemistry of Russian Academy of Sciences, Chernogolovka, Russia. The certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the regular (n-i-p) structure has reached 25.7% (ref. 1), approaching that of the mature mono-crystalline silicon solar cells. The regular PSCs with high certified efficiencies of &gt;25% are mainly based on organic hole transport material such as doped 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) 2-6 . However, commonly used spiro-OMeTAD with lithium salt dopants Received: 7 October 2022 Accepted: 1 June 2023 Published online: 3 July 2023 Check for updates 1 Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. 2 Optics Valley Laboratory, Hubei, could raise additional stability issues of PSCs beyond perovskite absorb-ers themselves 7,8 . Meanwhile, inverted (p-i-n) structure PSCs based on dopant-free interfacial materials such as p-type NiO, poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine], n-type [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and C 60 tend to present better stability than the regular devices under the same conditions 9,10 . However, up to now, inverted PSCs with efficiencies of &gt;24% have rarely been reported 11-14 . China. 3 Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01288-7 </text>
