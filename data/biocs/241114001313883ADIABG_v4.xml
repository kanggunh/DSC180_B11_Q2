      <text> Synthesis of thiophene-based cations A desired concentrated aqueous solution of HI (1.1 eq) was added dropwise to a stirred 1.0 mol/L ethanol solution of the corresponding thiophenealkylamine (1.0 eq) at 0°C. The mixture was allowed to gradually reach room temperature and then it was poured into an excess of diethyl ether (Et 2 O). The formed precipitate was collected and washed thoroughly with Et 2 O. The salts were recrystallized from EtOH-Et 2 O mixtures, providing with crystalline solids (yields ≈70 %). Preparation of 2D/3D perovskite films and device fabrication FTO-coated glass (Nippon sheet glass) foot_0  was chemically etched using zinc powder and HCl solution, followed by cleaning using Hellmanex, water, acetone, and 2-propanol. A 30 nm thick compact TiO 2 layer as electron transporting layer was deposited by spray pyrolysis using a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in 2-propanol (1:15 v/v) at 450 °C. On top of the compact layer, a 100 nm thick mesoporous layer of TiO 2 was deposited by spin coating TiO 2 paste (GreatCellSolar, 30NR-D) diluted in ethanol (1:8 w/v) at 5000 rpm for 20 s followed by heating at 125 °C for 10 min and sintering at 500 °C for 20 min. A thin layer of passivating tin oxide of ≈20 nm was spin-coated by using tin (IV) chloride (Acros) solution (12 µL diluted in 988 µL water) at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min and 190 °C for 1 h.  </text>

      <text> X-ray Diffraction (XRD) XRD measurements were performed at room temperature with Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer and non-monochromated Cu radiation. For the 2D-3D films, the XRD patterns were obtained using grazing incident diffraction (GID) geometry with Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer and non-monochromated Cu radiation at the incident angle of 2.0°. In situ Xray diffraction was performed at 50°C in ambient atmosphere and using a custom-made hightemperature cell (temperature stability +/-1 K), in Bragg Brentano geometry, with a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer and non-monochromated Cu radiation. The data acquisition time for the entire pattern between 2 and 16° 2θ was approx. 15 minutes, in order to allow for comparison from PL experiments. </text>

      <text> Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements GIWAXS measurements were carried out in reflection geometry at the CMS beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS II), a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) office of the Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office of Science by Brookhaven National Laboratory. Samples were measured at a detector distance of 0.153 m using X-ray wavelength of 1.24 Å, at 0.16° angle of incidence with respect to the substrate plane. Scattering intensity was detected by a PILATUS 300K detector. Nika foot_1  software package was used to sector average the 2D GIWAXS images. Data plotting was done in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR, USA). </text>

      <text> Device characterization The current density-voltage (J-V) curves were measured under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5G) by xenon lamp solar simulator (450 W, Oriel Sol3A, AAA class). The J-V measurements were carried out under ambient condition and room temperature. The light intensity was calibrated to 1 sun by using a Si reference equipped with an IR-cutoff (KG5) filter. An external voltage bias was applied and the current responses were measured at the same time using a digital source meter (Keithley 2400). An active area of 0.16 cm 2 was determined by a metal mask with aperture of 0.16 cm 2 . The J-V curves were scanned with the rate of 50 mV s -1 without any preconditioning, such as light soaking or pre-biasing for a long time. For the light intensity dependent measurement, the J-V characteristics were obtained using a VeraSol LED solar simulator (Newport) under various light intensity. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement was carried out by using IQE200B (Oriel).            Figure S1 . S1 Figure S1.

      <text> The prepared substrates were treated with PbI 2 (TCI), and PbBr 2 (TCI) in DMF and DMSO (0.78:0.22 v/v). For the 2D perovskite n=1 (R 2 PbI 4 , R is the corresponding thiophene alkylammonium cation), the perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving thiophene alkylammonium cation and PbI 2 with the molar ratio of 2:1 in mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (0.78:0.22 v/v). For the quasi 2D perovskite n=2 (R 2 MAPb 2 I 7 ), the perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving thiophene alkylammonium cation, methylammonium iodide (MAI, GreatCellSolar), and PbI 2 with the molar ratio of 2:1:2 in mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (0.78:0.22 v/v). The prepared perovskite precursor was then spin-coated on the prepared at 2000 rpm for 12 s and 5000 rpm UV-ozone for 15 min before perovskite deposition. A 1.3 mol/L [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.87 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.13 ] 0.92 (CsPbI 3 ) 0.08 perovskite solution with excess PbI 2 (PbI 2 :FAI = 1.05:1) was prepared by mixing FAI (GreatCellSolar), MABr (GreatCellSolar), CsI (ABCR), for 30 s. Chlorobenzene was added as an anti-solvent at 15 s before the end of spin coating process. The films were subsequently annealed at 100 °C for 60 min. After cooling down to room temperature, 0.06 mol/L of thiophene alkyl ammonium iodide cations in 2-propanol was spin-coated dynamically by adding the solution during spinning at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 6 min. Spiro OMeTAD was used as the hole-transporting materials (HTM). The HTM layer was prepared by dissolving 78.2 mg spiro-OMeTAD (Merck) in 1 mL chlorobenzene doped with 31.28 µL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (Sigma-Aldrich), 18.57 µL of Libis (trifluoromethanesulphonyl) imide (Aldrich) from the stock solution (196 mg in 379 µL acetonitrile), 13.69 µL of FK 209 Co(III) TFSI (GreatCellSolar) from the stock solution (99 mg in 263 µL acetonitrile). The doped spiro-OMeTAD solution was then deposited by spincoating at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 70 nm-thick gold counter electrode was thermally evaporated on top of HTM layer. </text>
