The peaks in 13 C NMR have been assigned to two groups, which indicate the co-crystals are mixtures of trans-and cis-PEAMAI isomers. However, the isomer peaks in 1 H NMR are overlapped and hard to separate, resulting in multiple splitting. The weak peaks of 1 H NMR at 4.04, 1.99 and 1.17 ppm are assigned to EtOAc, which is a solvent used in recrystallization process. The peaks in 13 C NMR can be clearly separated into two groups due to the trans-and cis-isomers. PEAMA + 2 FA + + PEAMA + 2 FA + a b Supplementary Figure 9. Mass spectrum of PEAMAI.

      <text>The following ALERTS were generated. Each ALERT has the format test-name_ALERT_alert-type_alert-level. Click on the hyperlinks for more details of the test. It is advisable to attempt to resolve as many as possible of the alerts in all categories. Often the minor alerts point to easily fixed oversights, errors and omissions in your CIF or refinement strategy, so attention to these fine details can be worthwhile. In order to resolve some of the more serious problems it may be necessary to carry out additional measurements or structure refinements. However, the purpose of your study may justify the reported deviations and the more serious of these should normally be commented upon in the discussion or experimental section of a paper or in the "special_details" fields of the CIF. checkCIF was carefully designed to identify outliers and unusual parameters, but every test has its limitations and alerts that are not important in a particular case may appear. Conversely, the absence of alerts does not guarantee there are no aspects of the results needing attention. It is up to the individual to critically assess their own results and, if necessary, seek expert advice. </text>

Phenethylammonium (PEA + ) and butylammonium (BA + ) are widely used in three-dimensional (3D) perovskites to form two-dimensional perovskites at film surfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) for defect passivation and performance enhancement. Here we show that these cations are unstable with 3D formamidinium (FA + )-containing perovskites under high-temperature light soaking. PEA + and BA + are found to deprotonate to amines, which then react with FA + to produce (phenethylamino) methaniminium (PEAMA + ) and (butylamino)methaniminium (BAMA + ), respectively, severely limiting device high-temperature photostability. Removing these cations greatly improves the photostability but compromises device efficiency by leaving non-fully passivated surfaces and GBs. Ammonium cations with a high acid dissociation constant (pK a ), including PEAMA + (pK a = 12.0) and BAMA + (pK a = 12.0), can replace PEA + or BA + for passivation and are stable with FA-based perovskites due to their resistance to further deprotonation. P-i-n structure solar cells with PEAMA + additive maintained over 90% of their initial efficiency after light soaking at open circuit and 90 °C for 1,500 hours. Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites have many interesting physical properties due to confinement effects that three-dimensional (3D) perovskites do not have, including exciton dynamics, spin dynamics and electron-phonon coupling  [1] [2] [3]  . Generally, 2D perovskites are considered to be much more stable than their 3D counterparts due to better moisture resistance of the hydrophobic organic cation  4, 5  , larger energy barrier to ion migration  6, 7  and increased tolerance to structural stress  8, 9  . As a result, they have been widely applied in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to improve device efficiency and stability in various ways  4, [10] [11] [12]  . To overcome their poor carrier transport along the out-of-plane direction, a thin layer of 2D perovskite can be stacked on top of 3D perovskites via sequential deposition, which not only protects but also passivates the 3D perovskite surface  10, 13  . They can also be incorporated into the grain boundaries (GBs) of 3D perovskites by adding the large organic cations into the precursor solution  14  . The much larger size of these organic cations causes them to be excluded form the 3D lattice to GBs which, in return, stablizes the GBs  5, 15  . Additionally, high layer number (n) phase-pure quasi-2D perovskites have been developed to retain both the advantages of 3D perovskites-such as good charge transport and carrier lifetimes-and 2D perovskites, such as good stability, but neither their efficiency nor stability have reached the parity of other multi-dimensional perovskites  16, 17  . </text>

FAH 2 PO 2 and FACl were added to enlarge the grain size of perovskite films and passivate the non-radiative recombination defects  30  . PEACl was added to passivate the surface and grain boundaries by formation of 2D perovskite and suppress the halide ion migration  32  . ZnCl 2 was added to increase device efficiency by optimizing the perovskite morphology and decrease trap density  33  . Excess CsI was added to compensate iodide vacancies and suppress ion migration and defect generation during long-term illumination  29  . We speculated that some additive(s) may induce the quick degradation observed at high temperatures. To verify this, additives were removed one by one from the perovskite precursor solutions, PSCs were fabricated and then the same high-temperature photostability study was conducted (Supplementary Fig.  3g-h ). Results showed that the PSCs became much more stable after the PEACl additive was removed from the perovskite precursor solution. As shown in Fig.  1b  and Supplementary Fig.  3h , devices without PEACl retained 90% of their initial efficiency over 750 hours at 85 °C under 1 sun light illumination but started with a lower efficiency of ~20%. This suggests that PEA + cations were the main reason for the poor photostability of FACs-perovskites at high temperatures; note that chloride was excluded using control studies where chloride was replaced by iodide (Supplementary Fig.  3i ). Additionally, to evaluate whether the location of phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) makes a difference, we removed PEAI in the precursor and instead applied PEAI as surface treatment to the perovskite films. A poor stability was again observed for these PSCs with PEAI surface treatment (Supplementary Fig.  3i ). This shows that the PEA + cations cause poor high-temperature photostability, regardless of how PEA + is introduced into the FACs-perovskites. The impact of PEA + on FACs-perovskite intrinsic stability was manifested by the perovskite morphology and crystallinity evolution after light soaking at 85 °C for different durations. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results shown in Supplementary Fig.  4  revealed that the crystallinity of FACs-perovskite films with PEA + quickly decreased after testing for 260 hours, while FACs-perovskite films without PEA + experienced a slower degradation in crystallinity and retained the majority of their initial crystallinity over 860 hours of testing. This is evidenced by a slower decrease in XRD peak intensity and smaller changes in full-width half maximum values of the (001) plane peak. Additionally, cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that voids formed along grain boundaries during the stability measurement for films containing PEA + (Fig.  1c ). This can be explained by the PEA + ions that accumulated at the GBs, which damaged the 3D perovskites during the high-temperature light soaking testing. In contrast, devices without PEA + did not develop voids even after testing for 860 hours (Fig.  1d ). Electron beam induced current (EBIC) measurements were conducted to further research the stability of PSCs with and without PEACl. For this measurement, devices with thinner electrodes (30 nm) were deposited so that an electron beam with an energy of 5-15 keV could penetrate through the electrode and electron transport layer (ETL), depositing its energy into the perovskite layer. Monte Carlo simulations of the electron trajectories indicate that 75% of the beam energy was deposited within the ETL and the first 10 s of nanometers (nms) of the perovskite (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). EBIC results in Fig.  1e  reveal that PEA + incorporation results in a lower and less uniform current that further decreases over device ageing, in contrast to PSCs without PEA + . As can be seen in Fig.  1f , the pristine PSCs without PEA + show an average EBIC current of ~3.0 nA. PSCs with PEACl show both a more heterogenous and lower average current collection of ~2.2 nA. Because the devices with PEACl have a larger photocurrent under 1 sun light, we interpret the smaller and more heterogenous EBIC by the faster degradation of the device with PEACl under electron beam. After the devices light soaked under 85 °C 1 sun for 250 hours, the mean current extraction from the device with PEACl decreased to ~1.1 nA. In contrast, the device without PEACl showed a modest increase in current to ~3.7 nA The ability of 2D perovskites to enhance the efficiency of perovskite solar cells as additive or surface capping layer is very evident  4, 12, 13, [18] [19] [20]  . Among the numerous organic cations reported for 2D perovskites, phenethylammonium (PEA + ) and butylammonium (BA + ) are the most frequently used ammonium cations. Additionally, they have yielded many certified record power conversion efficiencies  12, 13, 21  . Encouraging shelf lifetime or even operational stability under light has also been frequently reported  22, 23  . Nevertheless, almost all previous studies were conducted at relatively low temperatures. Because the operational lifetime of perovskite solar cells are reaching several thousand hours, higher temperatures are needed to accelerate the operational stability test, as demonstrated by several recent studies  22, 23  . Some recent studies have shown poor stability of 2D:3D mixed perovskites and 2D/3D stacking structure at a high temperature of 85 °C, despite their promising stability at a lower temperature of 55 °C  [24] [25] [26] [27]  , which raises concerns about whether 2D:3D mixture structure or stacking structure is viable for long-term stability. The underlying mechanism of 2D:3D interfacial instability is still unclear. In this manuscript, we show that several commonly used ammonium cations, including PEA + and BA + , are not stable with formamidinium (FA)-containing perovskites at 85 °C under illumination. We identify the easy deprotonation of PEA + and BA + cations as the underlying chemistry for the observed instability. New ammonium cations with high pK a , a parameter characterizing the resistance to deprotonation  28  , were used to replace PEA + and BA + cations. These devices based on formamidinium caesium (FACs) perovskites not only retain the high efficiencies but also dramatically enhanced the high-temperature photostability of perovskite solar cells. </text>

      <text> PEA + induced worse high-temperature photostability PSCs with a structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA)/FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 /C 60 /bathocuproine (BCP)/copper (Cu) (Supplementary Fig.  1a ) were fabricated via blade coating. A methylammonium (MA + )-free perovskite composition with a slight excess of FAI or caesium iodide (CsI) (0.25 mol%) was used to achieve high intrinsic stability  29  . Additionally, 0.25 mol% phenethylammonium chloride (PEACl) (relative to Pb 2+ ) and several other additives were added to the perovskite precursor solution to passivate defects at grain boundaries and film surfaces, which has been widely shown to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs at relatively low testing temperatures  [29] [30] [31]  . The optimized PSCs yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.3% (Supplementary Fig.  1b ). Additionally, they showed remarkably good operational stability when soaked under open circuit condition beneath a white light emitting diode (LED) lamp at 1 sun intensity with a spectrum as shown in Supplementary Fig.  2a . The lamp also heated the devices to a temperature of 55 ± 5 °C. These devices maintained 90% of their initial efficiency after 3,200 hours on operational stability test, as shown in Fig.  1a . However, when the temperature was raised to 85 °C using the testing setup shown in Supplementary Fig.  2b  with the actual temperature of perovskites of 90 °C as shown in Supplementary Fig.  2d , the PSCs showed dramatically faster degradation. The efficiencies of the PSCs reduced to 90% of their initial value within ~150 hours (Fig.  1b ). Stability data from additional devices is displayed in Supplementary Fig.  3a-d . All photovoltaic parameters, including short-circuit current (J SC ), open circuit voltage (V OC ) and fill factor (FF), rapidly declined. Furthermore, when elevating the measurement temperature to 100 °C, the average T 90 lifetime (T 90 : the time it takes for device efficiency to drop to 90% of initial value) of the devices decreased to ~80 hours. The quick degradation of PSCs at high temperature and under light is not sensitive to encapsulation methods. The PSCs encapsulated with epoxy, polyisobutylene and atomic layer deposition SnO 2 all showed quick degradation (Supplementary Fig.  3e ). The perovskite precursor solutions in this study had several additives to improve device efficiency, including phenethylammonium  </text>

      <text> The mechanism for PEA + induced instability To further understand how PEA + cations damage FACs-perovskites, we increased the amount of PEA + cations in the FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 films by directly mixing PEA 2 PbI 4 and FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 solutions at molar ratios of 2:1 and 1:2 so that the 2D perovskites could be clearly observed in XRD. These mixed films, pure PEA 2 PbI 4 and FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 were encapsulated by an inert poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) layer with &gt;1 μm thickness and stressed under 1 sun illumination at 120 °C for a further accelerated photostability test. As shown by the XRD patterns in Fig.  2 , pure PEA 2 PbI 4 remained unchanged after testing for 260 hours while FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 decomposed slightly to PbI 2 , showing the better intrinsic stability of PEA 2 PbI 4 than FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . For the fresh PEA 2 PbI 4 : FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 mixture films, only 2D phases with n = 1 and/or n = 2 showed up in the XRD patterns. After testing for 130 hours, the mixture films quickly degraded, and a new set of XRD peaks appears at 7.1° and 14.2° that do not belong to any known low-dimensional perovskites of PEA + . This suggests that a chemical reaction occurred between the PEA + and FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 during testing. It has been established that amines with lone pairs of electrons can easily attack the electrophilic imine bond in FA + cations, even at room temperature  34, 35  . We thus hypothesize that PEA + and FA + ions react via deprotonation of PEA + to PEA 0 followed by a quick condensation reaction between PEA 0 and FA + to form (phenethylamino)methaniminium (PEAMA + ), as shown by the scheme in Fig.  3a . To provide further evidence for this, we verified that the same reaction product could be produced from the reactions of (1) PEA 0 with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 and (2) PEAI with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . In this study, both PEAI and PEA 0 were spun onto FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 films, followed by annealing at 120 °C for 0, 130 and 260 hours under 1 sun illumination. The PEAI-treated samples showed the formation of the PEA + -based 2D perovskites with n = 1 and n = 2 in the fresh films. These PEA + -based 2D perovskites transferred from lower n 2D phases to a higher n 2D phase (n = 3) after annealing at 120 °C for 130 hours, as shown in Fig.  2e , indicating loss of PEA + in the films. Meanwhile, the XRD peak at 7.1° emerged. This new material  </text>

      <text> Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01362-0  was denoted as PEAMA product hereinafter and could be a lead iodide octahedral-based low-dimensional perovskite. This result resembles that of directly mixing PEAI with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 , indicating that the PEA + -based 2D perovskites reacted with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . The same PEAMA product was observed from the reaction of PEA 0 with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 as shown by the 7.1° peak in the XRD pattern in Fig.  2f . This indicates the reaction of PEAI with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 goes through a deprotonation process to generate PEA 0 . To understand why PEA + easily deprotonates at high temperature, we examined its acid dissociation constant (pK a ), which represents a cation's deprotonation capacity: pKa (A + ) = -log 10 [A 0 ] [H + ] [A + ] in which [A 0 ], [H + ], [A + ] represent the concentrations of A 0 , H + and A + , respectively. The lower the pK a of a cation, the greater its ability to deprotonate. pK a is also temperature dependent based on Van't Hoff equation  36  : dln (Ka) dT = ΔH RT 2 Because the acid dissociation is an endothermic reaction, the reaction enthalpy change ∆H is positive. R and T indicate the ideal gas constant and temperature, respectively. Thus pK a increases with temperature, and deprotonation accelerates at higher temperatures. Figure  3b  shows the pK a values of common A-site cations. pK a of MA + , ethylammonium (EA + ), dimethylammonium (DMA + ) and BA + have similar values between 10.6 and 10.8 (ref. 37), which are much smaller than those of FA + (11.5-13) and guanidinium (GA + ) (13.6) (refs. 38-40). The chemical structures of these cations are shown in Fig.  3c . FA + and GA + differ from other ammonium cations by their conjugated structure with better stabilized electrons, which results in more stable interaction with the proton and thus makes deprotonation more difficult. Among all these cations, PEA + has the smallest pK a of 9.8 (ref. 38), explaining its quick deprotonation to PEA 0 and the resultant device degradation under high-temperature photostability study. It is noted that BA + , the other most widely used cation for 2D perovskites in perovskite solar cells, also has a small pK a of 10.8. We thus followed the same process to evaluate the protonation and chemical reaction of BA + with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . As shown in the XRD patterns in Supplementary Fig.  6 , the reactions of BAI or BA 2 PbI 4 and FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 were also observed under high-temperature photostability tests, regardless of whether BAI was mixed directly into or deposited onto the surface of FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . Similarly, the reaction generated a new phase with XRD peaks at 7.9° and 15.7°, resembling the reaction of BA 0 with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . The pK a table also predicts that GA + cations should be more stable with FA + . To verify this, we introduced 0.2 mol% GAI in PSCs and conducted high-temperature photostability measurements. As illustrated in Supplementary Fig.  7 , the addition of GAI did not accelerate the degradation, as evidenced by the retention of 90% of the initial efficiency after a light soaking stability test at 85 °C for 600 hours, in striking contrast to PEA + . These results suggest that pK a is a reliable parameter for evaluating the high-temperature photostability of various ammonium cations with FA + . However, oversized GA + incorporation into FACs-perovskites The rapid degradation of FACsPbI 3 with PEA + can be explained by the generated ammonia (NH 3 ) by the reaction of PEA 0 and FA + . NH 3 has a strong coordination with FACsPbI 3 and can dissolve it  34  , which can accelerate the decomposition of FACsPbI 3 into yellow phases. It also explains the observed void formation at the GBs in the devices with PEA + (Fig.  1c ), considering that PEA + cations are generally excluded to GBs during the crystallization process. The reaction of amines (including PEA 0 ) with FA + in solution has been reported to be as fast as seconds at room temperature  34, 42  , which was also confirmed in this study. Thus we can reasonably infer that the reaction rate between PEA + and FA + ions is limited by the PEA + deprotonation process. Because light also enhances the mobility of proton, light should also accelerate the deprotonation of PEA + in the photostability test. </text>

      <text> Passivation additives with high pK a Although completely removing PEA + ions from the precursor solution improves the high-temperature photostability of the devices, it also reduces the device efficiency because of the exposed unpassivated film surfaces and GBs. A passivator is still needed to enhance the device efficiency. The passivator needs to meet three criteria: (1) it should have a suitable terminal size to fit into A-site vacancy at the perovskite surfaces and GBs; (2) it should have a high pK a to resist deprotonation; (3) it should not react with FA + itself. Fortunately, we found that the reaction product of PEA 0 and FA + , that is, PEAMA + , perfectly meets these criteria. It terminates with an amidinium group with the same size as FA + , it keeps delocalized electron structure of FA + , making it difficult to deprotonate, and its lack of deprotonation prevents further reactions with FA + . We calculated the pK a of PEAMA + to be 12.0, which is higher than the PEA + benchmark. To better understand this cation, we synthesized PEAMAI by the reaction of PEA 0 with FAI, generating white powders. The single crystals of this salt can be formed by the recrystallization process, with a photograph of the crystal shown in Fig.  3d . The crystal structure obtained from single-crystal XRD confirmed the crystal is PEAMAI co-crystallized with two FAI (Supplementary Table  1 ). The bond lengths of C1-N1 and C1-N2 in PEAMAI are 1.30 Å, which is same as in FAI, indicating the resonance stabilization as we expected (Supplementary Table  2 ). The 1 H,  13  C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in Supplementary Figs.  8  and 9  confirmed the chemical structure of the obtained salt. The BAMAI was synthesized by the reaction of BA 0 and FAI confirmed by the 1 H,  13  C NMR in Supplementary Figs.  10  and 11 . The BAMA + showed a similar pK a value of 12.0 with PEAMA + . In addition, the synthesized co-crystal was mixed with PbI 2 in dimethylformamide (DMF) to fabricate films by spin coating. The XRD pattern in Supplementary Fig.  12  verified that PEAMAI-FAI reacted with PbI 2 to form a low-dimensional perovskite phase with XRD peaks at 7.1° and 14.2°, and BAMAI-FAI reacted with PbI 2 to form a low-dimensional perovskite phase with XRD peaks at 7.9° and 15.7°. To evaluate if PEAMAI is capable of passivating FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 , we used PEAMAI as a surface treatment for FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . Different from using PEAMAI as additive, using PEAMAI as a surface treatment avoids a perovskite morphology change as shown by the SEM included in Supplementary Fig.  13 . The optimized surface treatment using PEAMAI resulted in a 57% increase of steady-state photoluminescence (PL) intensity, accompanied by a small blue shift of the PL peak (Fig.  4a ).

      <text> Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01362-0  Furthermore, the carrier lifetime increased from 390 ns to 496 ns (Fig.  4b ), confirming that PEAMAI passivates traps on the perovskite surface. To passivate perovskite GBs, we added 0.2 mol% PEAMAI as an additive in the perovskite precursor solution. The samples with and without PEAMAI are referred to as PEAMA + device and control device. We blade coated perovskite films with or without PEAMA + on glass substrates and checked material morphology and passivation effect. Adding PEAMAI increased the steady-state PL intensity by 56% (Fig.  4c ) and increased the carrier lifetime from 384 ns to 497 ns (Fig.  4d ), indicating a reduced density of deep traps. Direct defect density measurement by thermal admittance spectroscopy shows that the trap density of states (tDOS) in PEAMA + devices is much lower within the trap band III (Fig.  4f ). A previous study indicates that this trap band is caused by the amorphous phase in the perovskite material  43  . Therefore, it appears the PEAMAI additive does change the crystallization process and slightly changes the morphology of perovskite film. This is consistent with PEAMA + films showing better crystallinity with stronger and sharper XRD peaks (Fig.  4e ). We estimated the mobile ion concentration in these devices by applying a 1.5 V forward bias for about 30 s to perturb the ion distribution and then measuring the current induced by the back diffusion of ions at zero bias. The measurements were performed in the dark. As shown in Fig.  4g , the mobile ions in the control devices required a much longer time (~5 s) to reach the steady state compared to the mobile ions in the PEAMA + -devices (~1 s). Additionally, the mobile ion concentration in the PEAMA + devices is three times smaller than the  </text>

      <text> Device efficiency and high-temperature photostability The impact of PEAMA + on the performance of FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 PSCs was investigated. Figure  5a  shows typical current density (J)-voltage (V) curves of PSCs with and without PEAMA + under both forward and reverse scans. The control PSCs had a PCE of 21.2% with a J SC of 24.7 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.07 V and a fill factor (FF) of 80.2%. PEAMA + -PSCs had a PCE of 24.1% with a J SC of 25.8 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.14 V, and a FF of 82.1%. The statistical distributions of the V OC , J SC , FF and PCE are shown in Fig.  5b . The steady-state PCEs of the devices with and without PEAMA + under AM 1.5 illumination are 20.9% and 23.8%, respectively (Fig.  5c ). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices are shown in Fig.  5d . PEAMA + primarily increased the EQE in the long wavelength range, consistent with a longer carrier diffusion length due to reduced non-radiative charge recombination. The calculated J SC from EQE agrees well with the measured J SC . Figure  5e  shows the PCE of unencapsulated control devices and PEAMA + devices as a function of measurement duration under 85 °C 1 sun illumination under V OC condition in N 2 .

The J-V curves of the PSCs with PEAMA + after operational measurement for different durations were exhibited in Supplementary Fig.  14c . Furthermore, the high-temperature light stability of PEAMA + devices was also evaluated at 100 °C under 1 sun illumination. As illustrated in Supplementary Fig.  14d, e , the average T 90 of PEAMA + devices was approximately 500 h, notably surpassing that of the control devices. The improved high-temperature stability of PSCs is attributed to the increased crystallinity and passivation induced by PEAMA + in perovskite films. Supplementary Fig.  14f ,g displayed the cross-sectional SEM images and XRD patterns of PSCs before and after 1,400 hours of 1 sun illumination at 85 °C and the V OC condition. The cross-sectional SEM images of the stressed PSCs showed no voids, in striking contrast to the PEA + containing FACs-perovskite devices, which showed voids along the GBs. It demonstrates the excellent high-temperature photostability of PEAMA + with FACs-perovskites. The XRD patterns revealed that the PEAMA + devices had a relatively slower crystallinity degradation compared to PSCs with PEA + after the initial crystallization process induced by heat. </text>

      <text> Conclusion In conclusion, we found the widely used organic cations PEA + and BA + for 2D perovskites are unstable in FA + -containing perovskites when the films or devices were subject to high-temperature light soaking. The PEA + and BA + deprotonate to amines, which further react quickly with FA + to produce PEAMA + and BAMA + , respectively. This process also generates ammonia, which causes damage to perovskite interfaces and grain boundaries, severely limiting the high-temperature photostability of perovskite solar cells. Removing PEA + or BA + cations from precursors or using ammonium cations with high pK a , including PEAMA + and BAMA + can improve the high-temperature photostability due to the difficulty of deprotonation. </text>

      <text> Synthesis of PEAMAI A colourless solution of 7.74 g (45 mmol) FAI in 50 ml absolute ethanol (EtOH) was stirred with an ice bath and added dropwise into a solution of 0.5 ml (4.5 mmol) phenylethylamine in 50 ml absolute ethanol. After the addition finished, the reaction was stirring for another 2 h and then worked up by evaporating the solvent. The crude product was washed out by 30 ml ethyl acetate two times to remove excess FAI. The eluate was concentrated by rotary evaporation resulting in light yellow oil. Recrystallization from 30 ml EtOAc/EtOH/IPA under -18 °C yielded 0.879 g (1.4 mmol, 31.1%) white solid, which is a co-crystal of PEAMAI and 2 FAI.

      <text> Preparation of PSCs The ITO glass was cleaned with acetone and isopropanol using ultrasonic cleaning for 15 minutes, followed by 15 minutes of ultraviolet ozone treatment before blade coating the hole transport layer (HTL) layer using 2.2 mg ml -1 PTAA in toluene with a 200 μm blade gap. To fabricate high-quality FACsPbI 3 films with PEACl, a mixture of 0.9 M FAPbI 3 (in 2-ME solution) and 0.1 M CsPbI3 (in DMSO solution) was prepared with a molar percentage of DMSO to Pb around 56% in precursor solutions. 2.5% FACl, 1.0% FAH 2 PO 2 , 0.25% PEACl, 0.5% ZnCl 2 and 0.25% CsI were added to the perovskite precursor solution. The FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 films were blade coated on PTAA/ITO substrates at room temperature with a gap of 300 μm and N 2 blowing at 20 pound per square inch (psi), followed by annealing at 150 °C for 3 min to obtain the perovskite phase. The humidity and temperature of the air is ~30% and 21 °C, respectively. We removed each of the additives from the perovskite precursor to fabricate perovskite solar cells and evaluated their effect on the high-temperature photostability of PSCs. For instance, in FACsPbI 3 films without PEACl, a mixture of 0.9 M FAPbI 3 (in 2-ME solution) and 0.1 M CsPbI 3 (in DMSO solution) was used with a molar percentage of DMSO to Pb around 56% in precursor solutions. To produce high-quality perovskite films, the perovskite precursor solution was supplemented with 2.5% FACl, 1.0% FAH 2 PO 2 , 0.5% ZnCl 2 and 0.25% CsI, too. In addition, we replaced PEACl with PEAI in the precursor solution, adding 0.25% PEAI while retaining the other additives, including 2.5% FACl, 1.0% FAH 2 PO 2 , 0.5% ZnCl 2 and 0.25% CsI in the perovskite precursor solution. To check PEAI surface treatment effect on stability of PSCs at high-temperature light soaking condition, 1 mg ml -1 PEAI solution was prepared in IPA. The solution was spin coated onto perovskite films without PEACl at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. To check the passivation effect of PEAMAI, 1 mg ml -1 PEAMAI solution was prepared in IPA. The solution was spin coated onto perovskite films without PEACl at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. For FACsPbI 3 films with PEAMAI, 0.2% PEAMAI was added to the FACs-perovskite solution along with 2.5% FACl, 1.0% FAH 2 PO 2 , 0.5% ZnCl 2 and 0.25% CsI in the perovskite precursor solution. To prepare FACsPbI 3 with PEAMAI, we used 0.9 M FA 0.99 PbI 3 (in 2-ME solution) and 0.1 M CsPbI 3 (in DMSO solution), as the synthesized PEAMAI lattice contains FAI. The precursor solution was blade coated with a 300 μm blade gap and N 2 blowing at 20 psi, followed by immediate annealing at 150 °C for 3 minutes. To assemble PSCs, we first evaporated 30 nm of C 60 onto the perovskite films at a vacuum pressure of 10 -6 Pa. We then evaporated 6 nm of BCP onto the sample substrates, which had been heated to approximately 80 °C before BCP deposition. Finally, we thermally evaporated Cu electrodes with 150 nm thickness. The area of shadow masks used in this work is 0.08 cm 2 . </text>

Then we mixed the PEA 2 PbI 4 and FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 solutions at a ratio of 1:0, 2:1, 1:2 and 0:1. Subsequently, 40 μl perovskite solution was spin coated onto glass substrates at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s in a glovebox, followed by the addition of 130 μl TL after ~12 s and annealing at 120 °C for 15 minutes. The 3D films were prepared by spin coating FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 solution onto glass substrates at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s in a glovebox, followed by the addition of 130 μl TL as antisolvent after ~6 s and annealing at 150 °C for 15 minutes. A PMMA solution in TL was dropped onto the prepared films and annealed at 100 °C for 1 minute to form a PMMA layer with a thickness &gt;1 μm to cover on perovskite films. The BA + and FA + mixed perovskite films were fabricated by mixing 1 M BA 2 PbI 4 precursor solution and 1 M FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 using same way to the PEA + and FA + mixed perovskite film fabrication. </text>

EBIC and a SEM image were collected concurrently in an FEI Scios DualBeam FIB/SEM from Thermo Fisher Scientific. In this study, EBIC was measured at a short-circuit condition. To collect an EBIC scan, first the electron beam was focused on the edge of the device area at low magnification, then moved along the edge to a fresh area to focus on a higher magnification. Once the desired magnification was achieved, the beam was moved towards the centre of the device in one direction to take EBIC measurements on unscanned fresh areas. Five EBIC scans in fresh regions were collected on each active device area. </text>

      <text> Stability characterization Photostability measurement was conducted at 55 ± 5 °C; before conducting photostability measurements, the PSCs were encapsulated by epoxy and glass. The encapsulated PSCs were then exposed to white LED irradiation at an intensity of 1 sun, which was calibrated using a Si reference solar cell with a KG-5 filter. The spectral distribution of the lamp used was depicted in Supplementary Fig.  2a . The PSCs were measured under V oc conditions without temperature controlling. Due to the light exposure, the sample temperature rose to 50-60 °C. High-temperature photostability measurement: to prevent the release of toxic gas into the air due to the instability of the epoxy under high temperature and light, the PSCs were not encapsulated during high temperature photostability measurements. Instead, the measurements were conducted in an N 2 glovebox to maintain an inert atmosphere. The arrangement used for the high-temperature photostability measurement is illustrated in Supplementary Fig.  2b , wherein unencapsulated PSCs were placed on a hot plate set at a temperature of 85 °C or 100 °C. The PSCs were then exposed to white LED irradiation from above. The uniformity of the hot plate, as displayed in Supplementary Fig. was verified using a thermometer. In addition, the actual temperatures of perovskite under different set temperatures and 1 sun LED light were monitored by sticking a temperature sensor directly onto the Cu electrode layer. As shown in Supplementary Fig.  2d , the actual temperature of perovskites was about 90 °C when the set hot plate temperature was 85 °C. After continuous illumination at high temperature for 48 or 72 hours, unencapsulated devices were taken out from the N 2 glovebox for the J-V measurement. The J-V measurement was conducted in air with humidity of 30-60% without temperature control. An anti-refection coating was used during measurement. Flack test results are ambiguous.
