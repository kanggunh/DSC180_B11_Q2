      <text>Supplementary The paper by Yang et al. describing the preparation of EDTA-complexed SnO2 represents an interesting and obviously very high-performance perovskite solar cell electron transport layer. However, due to numerous issues with the paper, detailed below, I recommend that this paper be rejected from Nature Communications pending major revisions by the authors. First some general comments. • The authors consistently use hyperbolic language in this manuscript. They describe -even in the title -the solar cells as "without hysteresis" and say that hysteresis is "completely eliminated" in their devices. I agree that the devices have very low hysteresis for perovskite solar cells. This is clearly shown in Fig.  S11 . Nevertheless, the hysteresis is not eliminated: eliminated is simply too strong of a word. There are differences in the forward and reverse JV scans. While these differences are slight they are clearly visible. Fig.  6  shows the FF changes from 0.792 to 0.783 with scan direction. This is hysteresis. The authors should modify the language of the paper in this respect. Hysteresis is reduced, it is perhaps even negligible, but it is certainly still present and is not "eliminated". • The English throughout the paper requires significant improvement to improve the readability of the manuscript. This is particularly true of the methods section. In fact, it is in places difficult to understand the methods being used due to inconsistent grammar. Improving readability would greatly improve the impact of this work. • The authors use a variety of device configurations to measure material properties such as defect density, mobility, and others. While I don't necessarily disagree or refute the results as presented, there are complicating factors associated with these measurements and device architectures. The authors should be clear about the caveats associated with their measurements and why they believe these can be neglected in this case. This will give the reader a fairer picture of the measurements undertaken and the conclusions of the work. More specific comments. • The authors' description of the crystallization with respect to the Gibbs free energy is unclear. What do the authors mean that the "hydrophilicity of the E-SnO2 surface… decreases the Gibbs barrier during perovskite growth" and how do the authors envision this resulting in "improved quality of perovskite film"? What Gibbs barrier is being reduced? Are the authors merely expecting more uniform nucleation of perovskite crystals on the E-SnO2 surface? It isn't clear from the discussion of this in the text what exactly is meant and how this would affect trap densities in the perovskite layer. Also, it looks like these Nt measurements are conducted with FAPbI3. Is this a different active layer than the FACsPbI3 layers used in the rest of this work? If so, why? • The authors state that hysteresis is more severe in planar-type architecures (see pg 3). This is not universally a true statement • On page 4 the authors comment on the high annealing temperature necessary for TiO2. Contrary to this assertion, TiO2 ETLs which can be processed at low temperature with high performance have been widely shown. Including some with similar high performance to the current study. See DOI: 10.1126/science.aai9081 • The E-SnO2 solution is said to be stable. Can the authors provide device data or something else to actually confirm this? A photograph of the solution does not confirm if the solution is actually stable or not. • The authors say the obtain their XPS data from films on quartz substrates. What effects from charging do the authors see with this? I would expect very significant charging in these samples which could greatly shift the observed binding energies. • The FTIR spectra of the control SnO2 is missing. The authors show the O-O stretch at ~1000 cm-1, is this related to the SnO2 itself exposed to O2 (as described in the reference cited) or is it a result of the EDTA bound to the SnO2 surface? The authors report a success strategy in eliminating hysteresis and at the same time attaining record-efficiency in planar-type perovskite solar cells by using EDTA-complexed SnO2 (E-SnO2) electron transport layers (ETL). Statistical analysis seems sounds as well as expertiments carried out for improving understanding. I thus recommend publication after addressing these minor but useful points below. "Even though ETL free planar-type PSCs have been reported, their performances are poor compared to those with ETL": Please quantify the PCE of these ETL-free devices. "ii) suitable energy level with the perovskite materials to reduce the energy barrier for electron transport" On one hand you want to eliminate an energy barrier for electron injection, on the other you don't want the conduction band to be too much lower that that of the perovoskite otherwise it would lower the Voc. Please explain this better. "However, the PCE of the planar-type PSCs is still lower than that of the mesoporous-type devices because there exists significant energy barrier between SnO2 ETL and perovskite absorber, leading to energy loss." In fact some referenced have used both SnO2 compact layer and either a compact layer ( https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024817300  65X) or a mesoporous TiO2 layer ( https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12274-017-1896-5 ) over the top to improve the efficiency confirming what the authors say. Other groups have doped the SnO2 for improved performance ( https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/cf6b/9a40dcdb8a82887d20b2335469  7dd873e7b4.pdf). I would recommend adding this further discussion and references in the introduction for the state of the art. On page 7 "The reduced energy barrier is also believed to enhance charge transfer from the perovskite to the ETL" . This is not an energy barrier because the conduction band of the SnO2 is lower than that of the perovskite. The electron in the solar cells is injected from the perovskite into the SnO2 during solar cell operation (this is different from IV curves in the dark where electrons are injected from the SnO2 into the perovoksite). Why should the transfer be better if the jump is lower? The Voc should be higher because the conduction band of the SnO2 is closer to that of the perovskite. Please review this explanation as well as the caption of S5. The authiors partly explain the higher crystallinity of the perovskite films using contact angle measruements, where larger grain sizes are correlated with lower contact angels. However, there is literature where investigators say that non wetting surfaces lead to higher grain size. Can the authors discuss this matter in more depth using the literature and provide a clearer or more definitive explanation of the literature on this matter? Again on page 11 when discussing why pholtoluminescence times are shorter, the explanation of higher mobility seems correct, but the reduced energy barrier does not (it is a jump). It may be that the interface or adhesion is better at the interface. Same when discussing hysteriss at the end of page 16 "meaning no energy barrier for electron transfer (Fig.  S5 ), that is expected to facilitate electron extraction from the perovskite to the ETL." The explanation must be another. Maybe less traps? Better initial growth on the E-SnO2? On page 17 the authors use a bending radius of 7mm 4. As known, in the conventional structure of PSC, the instability is mainly due to the perovskite layer and spiro-OMeTAD HTL. As the author did not change the perovskite layer and HTL, why the device without encapsulation could show better stability in air with 35% humidity for a so long time of 3000 h? The author should clarify it. </text>

Response: Thank you very much for your suggestion. We agree with your comment and have revised all relevant sections accordingly. • The English throughout the paper requires significant improvement to improve the readability of the manuscript. This is particularly true of the methods section. In fact, it is in places difficult to understand the methods being used due to inconsistent grammar. Improving readability would greatly improve the impact of this work. Response: Thanks for the suggestion! Revised version has been reviewed by a native English speaker for grammar. • The authors use a variety of device configurations to measure material properties such as defect density, mobility, and others. While I don't necessarily disagree or refute the results as presented, there are complicating factors associated with these measurements and device architectures. The authors should be clear about the caveats associated with their measurements and why they believe these can be neglected in this case. This will give the reader a fairer picture of the measurements undertaken and the conclusions of the work. Response: Thank you very much for the comments! Per your request, we have revised the sections with proper analyses and discussion, as shown on pages 10 and 22. To gain insights into the charge transport, we have measured electron mobility using different electron transport layers (ETLs) in the same device structure. Specifically, the electrononly device was designed and fabricated using structure ITO/Al/ETL/Al, as shown in the inset in Likewise, the trap state density (N t ) of the perovskite films are estimated using the device structure ITO/ETL/perovskite/PCBM/Ag, similar to previously reported results (Energy Environ. Sci., 2017, 10, 2570-2578; Adv. Mater., 2016, 28, 5206-5213; Energy Environ. Sci., 2017, 10, 2095-2102, etc.), R3-R5 The device architecture is shown in Fig.  3a  with the dark condition I-V curves. The linear correlation in the I-V curve reveals an ohmic-type device response in the low bias voltage range. The current is quickly increased nonlinearly when the bias voltage exceeds the trap-filled limit voltage (V TFL ) located at the kink point, indicating that the traps are completely filled. Hence, the trap density of the perovskite film can be calculated using V TFL through equation (  2 ) presented in the manuscript. More details are provided in the manuscript on page 10. More specific comments. • The authors' description of the crystallization with respect to the Gibbs free energy is unclear. What do the authors mean that the "hydrophilicity of the E-SnO Response: According to the established model for nucleation and growth of thin films, R6,R7 the perovskite formation process can be divided into four steps: i) formation of crystal nucleus, ii) evolution of nuclei's into island structure, iii) formation of networked microstructure and iv) growth of networks into continuous film. The Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation in the first step can be expressed as: △G heterogeneous = △G homogeneous × f(θ), wherein f(θ) = (2 -3cosθ + cos 3 θ)/4, and θ is contact angle of the precursor solution. Since the magnitude of θ varies in the range of [0, π/2], the larger the is θ the smaller is the magnitude of cosθ, and therefore larger is the parameter f(θ) ϵ [0, 1]. In other words, a smaller contact angle results in reduced Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation, thereby, assisting the nucleation process. Higher nucleation density will promote the film densification process.  R7  Compared to EDTA and SnO 2 , E-SnO 2 shows the smallest contact angle (20.67°, Fig.  S6 ), which is further expected to improve the wettability between the E-SnO 2 and the perovskite layer. R8-R10 Thus, the perovskite coated on the E-SnO 2 exhibits better crystallinity (Fig.  S7 ) and full surface coverage (Fig.  2c ). In addition, the small contact angle of substrate provides the low surface energy,  R11  leading to increased grain size during the growth of the networked structure as observed in the SEM measurements. R7 This explanation has been added in the manuscript (page 9-10). The N t measurements are conducted with FA 0.95 Cs 0.05 PbI 3 , the same active layer used in the rest of this work. We are really sorry for the error label in Fig.  3a . It has been corrected. • The authors state that hysteresis is more severe in planar-type architectures (see pg 3). This is not universally a true statement. Generally p-i-n structures have very low hysteresis. Moreover, Response: Thank you for your question! Fig.  S2  compares the FTIR spectra of the E-SnO 2 solution measured in the freshly prepared condition and again after it was stored in ambient for 2 months. It is clear that there is no obvious difference between the two solutions indicating the high stability. We have added this measurement in the Supplementary Information (Fig.  S2 ). • The authors say the obtain their XPS data from films on quartz substrates. What effects from charging do the authors see with this? I would expect very significant charging in these samples which could greatly shift the observed binding energies. </text>

      <text> Response: The XPS of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 films deposited on quartz substrates were measured again. In order to reduce the charging effect, the exposed surface of the quartz substrate was coated with a conductive silver paint and connected to the ground. We calibrated the binding energy scale for all XPS measurements to the carbon 1s line at 284.8 eV. It is clear from these measurements that SnO 2 shows only peaks attributed to Sn and O. After the EDTA treatment, the E-SnO 2 film shows an additional peak located at ca. 400 eV, ascribed to N. Meanwhile, the Sn 3d peaks from E-SnO 2 are shifted by ca. 0.16 eV in contrast to the pristine SnO 2 (Fig.  S3 ), indicating that EDTA is bound to the SnO 2 . These results have been described in the manuscript (page 6, Fig.  1a ) and the Supplementary Information (Fig.  S3 ). </text>

      <text> • The FTIR spectra of the control SnO 2 is missing. The authors show the O-O stretch at ~1000 cm  -1  , is this related to the SnO 2 itself exposed to O 2 (as described in the reference cited) or is it a result of the EDTA bound to the SnO 2 surface? Response: We have measured the FTIR spectra again from 3600 cm -1 to 500 cm -1 for all three samples EDTA, SnO 2 and E-SnO 2 . As shown in Fig.  1b , the peaks around 2895 cm -1 and 1673 cm -1 belong to C-H and C=O stretching vibration in the EDTA, respectively. The characteristic peaks of SnO 2 observed at ca. 701 cm -1 and 549 cm -1 are due to O-Sn-O stretch and the Sn-O vibration, respectively.  R12  In addition, the peak at 1040 cm -1 in the SnO 2 film is attributed to O-O stretching vibration due to oxygen adsorption on the SnO 2 surface.  R13  For the E-SnO 2 sample, the characteristic peaks of SnO 2 shift to 713 cm -1 and 563 cm -1 , and the C-H and C=O stretching vibration peaks shift to 2913 cm -1 and 1624 cm -1 , further demonstrating that the EDTA is indeed complexed with SnO 2 . We have added this additional analysis in the manuscript (page 6, Fig.  1b ). </text>

      <text> • The PL lifetimes in Fig 3c are very fast! lifetimes of less than 1 ns for good perovskite films indicate either something really strange going on or nonlinear behavior. The assignment to interface quenching and trap recombination is complicated by this. Is the lifetime excitation intensity dependent? Typical lifetimes are more in the 50-1000 ns range. Related to this, how much does ITO quench the emission? Response: Thank you for your insightful question. We measured the lifetime of the perovskite films deposited on various substrates using different excitation intensity. The TRPL spectra and fitting data are shown in Fig.  S8  and Table  S1 . Generally, the slow decay component (τ 1 ) is attributed to the radiative recombination of free charge carriers due to traps in the bulk, and the fast decay component (τ 2 ) is originated from the quenching of charge carriers at interface.  R14  The glass/perovskite sample shows the longest lifetime under excitation intensity of 3 μJ/cm 2 . For perovskite coated on the ITO substrate, the lifetime is decreased more than half due to the charge transfer from perovskite into ITO. For EDTA/perovskite and SnO 2 /perovskite samples, both the fast and slow decay lifetimes are very similar, and τ 1 dominates the PL decay for both samples, indicating severe recombination before they were extracted. When the perovskite is deposited on E-SnO 2 , both τ 1 and τ 2 were shortened to 14.16 ns and 0.97 ns, with a proportion of 45.32% and 54.68%, respectively. Meanwhile, τ 2 appears to dominate the PL decay, indicating that electrons are effectively extracted from the perovskite layer to the E-SnO 2 with minimal recombination loss. Even under smaller excitation intensity (0.5μJ/cm 2 ), the acceleration of the lifetime for E-SnO 2 /perovskite is observed. The lifetime increases with reduced excitation intensity (Fig.  S8  and Table  S1 ), in agreement with previous report.  R15  The electron transport yield (Ф tr ) of different ETLs with different excitation intensity can be estimated using equation, Ф tr = 1τ p /τ glass , where τ p is the average lifetime for perovskite deposited on different substrates, and τ glass is the average lifetime for glass/perovskite. With the excitation intensity of 3 μJ/cm 2 , the electron transport yields of ITO, EDTA, SnO 2 and E-SnO 2 are 49.72%, 67.58%, 68.31% and 81.50%, respectively. When the excitation intensity reduces to 0.5μJ/cm 2 , the electron transport yields of ITO, EDTA, SnO 2 and E-SnO 2 are increased to 60.37%, 74.46%, 80.65% and 90.82%, respectively. It is clear that the excitation intensity can significantly increase the electron transport yield. These results further indicate that the E-SnO 2 is a good electron extraction layer for planar-type perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We have added the details in the manuscript (page  12 ) and the Supplementary Information (Fig.  S8  and Table  S1 ).  Response: We are sorry for the typo. This sentence should have been: "the high electron mobility of E-SnO 2 would enhance electron transport from perovskite to E-SnO 2 ETL," We have made the correction in revised manuscript (page 18). </text>

This is a typo, and we have corrected it as "dimethyl sulfoxide" in the manuscript. • Is the SnO 2 /water solution 2.5 wt%? Response: Yes, this is the weight concentration. The SnO 2 aqueous colloidal dispersion (15 wt%, purchased from Alfa Aesar) was diluted using deionized water to the concentration of 2.5 wt%.

      <text> • Are the SnO 2 layers annealed at all? Response: The ETLs including EDTA, SnO 2 and E-SnO 2 were kept at 60 ℃ in a vacuum oven after spin-coating. The system was evacuated to ca. 5 Pa for 30 min to remove residual solvent, as described in the Methods Section (page 21). • How are the control SnO 2 layers and the control EDTA layers fabricated? Response: We have added details on fabrication process for the SnO 2 and the EDTA layers in the Methods Section (page 21): The 0.2 mg EDTA was dissolved in 1 mL deionized water, and the SnO 2 aqueous colloidal dispersion (15 wt%) was diluted using deionized water to the concentration of 2.5 wt%. These solutions were stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. The SnO 2 and EDTA layers were fabricated by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 60 s using the corresponding solution, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C under ca. 5 Pa for 30 min to remove residual solvent.

      <text> Response: We have briefly summarized the PCE of ETL-free PSCs in the manuscript: "Even though ETL free planar-type PSCs have been reported,  30, 31  their highest PCE is only 14.14%, significantly lower than that of the cells with ETL, demonstrating the importance of the ETL in this configuration of PSCs." We have added these comments in the manuscript (page 3). ii) suitable energy level with the perovskite materials to reduce the energy barrier for electron transport" On one hand you want to eliminate an energy barrier for electron injection, on the other you don't want the conduction band to be too much lower than that of the perovskite otherwise it would lower the V oc . Please explain this better. Response: Thanks for the comment and excellent question. The PSCs using the E-SnO 2 ETL show higher J sc due to the high electron mobility of E-SnO 2 . Further, they show larger V oc due to the energy level match between the Fermi level of E-SnO 2 and the conduction band of the perovskite. This information has been added in the manuscript (page 3). " Response: Thanks for these suggestions. We have incorporated this information in the introduction (page 4): "The SnO 2 -TiO 2 (planar and mesoporous) composite layers were developed to enhance the performance of the PSCs.  37, 38  It is noteworthy to that Al 3+doped SnO 2 provides even better performance.  39  ". All these literatures have been cited as No. 37-39 in the Reference Section. On page 7 "The reduced energy barrier is also believed to enhance charge transfer from the perovskite to the ETL". This is not an energy barrier because the conduction band of the SnO 2 is lower than that of the perovskite. The electron in the solar cells is injected from the perovskite into the SnO 2 during solar cell operation (this is different from I-V curves in the dark where electrons are injected from the SnO 2 into the perovskite). Why should the transfer be better if the jump is lower? The V oc should be higher because the conduction band of the SnO 2 is closer to that of the perovskite. Please review this explanation as well as the caption of S5. Response: Thank you very much for your suggestion. The effective electron injection is attributed to the high electron mobility of E-SnO 2 while the larger V oc (Fig.  4a  and Table  1 ) results from the smaller energy level difference between E-SnO 2 and the perovskite layer. We have revised the explanation in the manuscript (page 8) as "The Fermi level of E-SnO 2 is very close to the conduction band of perovskite, which is beneficial for enhancing V oc ." In addition, we have revised the caption of Fig.  S5  as "In order to examine electron transport capability of the E-SnO 2 film, the glass/ITO/ETL/perovskite/PCBM/Al devices were fabricated. When a voltage is applied to the top ITO electrode, electrons are injected to ETL from the perovskite. The J-V curve of the E-SnO 2 -based device exhibits lower response voltage than that of the SnO 2 -based device (Fig.  S5a ), indicating that the electron injection from the perovskite to the E-SnO 2 is easier than to the SnO 2 , due to the higher electron mobility of E-SnO 2 . In addition, Fig.  S5b  and S5c illustrate the energy level alignment for the devices based on the SnO 2 and E-SnO 2 ETLs. It is clear that the Fermi level of the E-SnO 2 shows a better match to the conduction band of the perovskite than that obtained for the SnO 2 . This provides enhancement in the observed V oc (Fig.  4a  and Table  1 )." The authors partly explain the higher crystallinity of the perovskite films using contact angle Can the authors discuss this matter in more depth using the literature and provide a clearer or more definitive explanation of the literature on this matter? Response: Thank you very much for your suggestions! According to the established model for nucleation and growth of thin films, R6,R7 the perovskite formation process can be divided into four steps: i) formation of crystal nucleus, ii) evolution of nuclei's into island structure, iii) formation of networked microstructure and iv) growth of networks into continuous film. The Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation in the first step can be expressed as: △G heterogeneous = △G homogeneous × f(θ), wherein f(θ) = (2 -3cosθ + cos 3 θ)/4, and θ is contact angle of the precursor solution. Since the magnitude of θ varies in the range of [0, π/2], the larger the is θ the smaller is the magnitude of cosθ, and therefore larger is the parameter f(θ) ϵ [0, 1]. In other words, a smaller contact angle results in reduced Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation, thereby, assisting the nucleation process. Higher nucleation density will promote the film densification process.  R7  Compared to EDTA and SnO 2 , E-SnO 2 shows the smallest contact angle (20.67°, Fig.  S6 ), which is further expected to improve the wettability between the E-SnO 2 and the perovskite layer. R8-R10 Thus, the perovskite coated on the E-SnO 2 exhibits better crystallinity (Fig.  S7 ) and full surface coverage (Fig.  2c ). In addition, the small contact angle of substrate provides the low surface energy,  R11  leading to increased grain size during the growth of the networked structure as observed in the SEM measurements. R7 This explanation has been added in the manuscript (page 9-10), and the relevant literatures have been cited in the Reference Section. Again on page 11 when discussing why photoluminescence times are shorter, the explanation of higher mobility seems correct, but the reduced energy barrier does not (it is a jump). It may be that the interface or adhesion is better at the interface. Same when discussing hysteresis at the end of page 16 "meaning no energy barrier for electron transfer (Fig.  S5 ), that is expected to facilitate electron extraction from the perovskite to the ETL."

      <text> Maybe less traps? Better initial growth on the E-SnO 2 ? Response: Thank you very much for your suggestions. The perovskite deposited on E-SnO 2 substrate shows the shortest lifetime (Fig.  3c  and Table  S1 ), which is attributed to its high electron mobility. The short lifetime indicates that the carriers can be effectively extracted into E-SnO 2 with minimal recombination loss. We have revised this explanation in the manuscript (page 12). Generally, the hysteresis of PSCs is ascribed to ion migration, high trap density, and unbalanced charge transport within the perovskite device. The trap density of the perovskite film is significantly reduced when deposited on the E-SnO 2 , which is one reason for reduced hysteresis in the PSCs. In addition, the electron mobility of E-SnO 2 ETL is 2.27 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s - 1 (Fig.  1f ), comparable to the hole mobility of the doped spiro-OMeTAD (~10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) HTL. Thus, the electron flux (F e ) is essentially equal to the hole flux (F h ) because the interface area of the ETL/perovskite is the same as that of the perovskite/HTL (Fig.  S13b ). Therefore, there is no significant charge accumulation, and consequently, the devices based on the E-SnO 2 exhibit negligible hysteresis. We have added these explanations in the manuscript and the Supplementary Information (page 18, Fig.  S13 ). On page 17 the authors use a bending radius of 7mm. Why was this chosen? It is where ITO cracks? Please provide some references. Response: According to a previous report,  R16  it is safe for ITO to be bended to a radius of 14 mm, and when the bending radius is smaller than 14 mm, the ITO layer starts to crack, leading to significant degradation in conductivity. In order to examine the intrinsic mechanical stability of the flexible PSCs, we therefore adopted the bending radius of 7 mm, half of that suggested in literature, to test the flexible device.

      <text> Introductory comment: In this work, the authors introduced an ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-complexed SnO 2 as the electron transport layer (ETL) for planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to realize a certified efficiency of 21.5% with eliminated hysteresis and enhanced stability. However, similar concept has been already reported in a previous work (Chem. Mater., 2017, 29, 4176-4180)   besides the improved efficiency for PSCs. I thus felt the novelty of this work is not impressive and not suitable to publish in Nature Communications as considering its high standard. I would recommend the publication of this work in the other specific journal. </text>

      <text> Response to introductory comment: We thank the Referee for helpful feedback and comments. It was pointed out that our approach is similar to that reported by Li et al. (Chem. Mater., 2017, 29, 4176-4180). In this reference, EDTA was used to modify ZnO to form a hybrid interface in organic solar cells. However, the EDTA-ZnO does not work in the PSCs because when the perovskite film is deposited onto the EDTA-ZnO surface, it shows severe degradation due to the hydroxyl groups or acetate ligands on the ZnO surface, and proton transfer reactions at the perovskite/ZnO interface.  R17  In our work we have used EDTA to modify the SnO 2 . It is demonstrated that the efficiency of PSCs is increased to record high 21.60% (certified efficiency at 21.52% by Newport) with negligible hysteresis, the highest efficiency reported so far for the planar-type PSCs. In addition, the solar cells show significantly improved stability. We provide systematic fundamental analysis to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for this improved enhancement. Thus, we truly believe that our work advances the state-of-the-art and provides a promising pathway for obtaining high performance of planar-type PSCs. Hope the reviewer will find our explanations to his/her comments satisfactory. </text>

      <text> Response: The hysteresis of PSCs is ascribed to interfacial capacitance caused by charge accumulation at the interface, which originates from ion migration, high trap density, and unbalanced charge transport within the perovskite device.  R18-R20  It is found that the trap density of the perovskite film is significantly reduced when it is deposited on the E-SnO 2 , one of the primary reasons for reduced hysteresis. In addition, the electron mobility of the SnO 2 ETL is only 9.92 × 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 s -1 (Fig.  1f ), about an order of magnitude slower than the hole mobility of the doped spiro-OMeTAD (~10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) HTL. Thus, the electron flux (F e ) is ca. 10 times smaller than the hole flux (F h ) because the interface area of the ETL/perovskite is the same as that of the perovskite/HTL, leading to accumulated charge or capacitance at the SnO 2 /perovskite interface, as shown in Fig.  S13a . The accumulated charge will cause hysteresis in the solar cells (Fig.  6c ). When the high electron mobility E-SnO 2 (2.27 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) is employed as the ETL, the F e is comparable to the F h of the spiro-OMeTAD HTL (Fig.  S13b ), resulting in equivalent charge transport at both electrodes. Therefore, there is no significant charge accumulation or capacitance and thus reduced hysteresis in the PSCs. We have added these discussions in the manuscript and the Supplementary Information (page 18, Fig.  S13 ).  </text>

      <text> Response: The instability of PSC is mainly caused by degradation of perovskite film and spiro-OMeTAD HTL. In the present work, all devices used the same spiro-OMeTAD HTL, therefore the degradation from the HTL should be same for all the devices. It is found that the grain size of perovskite film is increased by 3 times when it is deposited on E-SnO 2 in comparison to that on the pristine SnO 2 (Fig.  2 ). The larger grain size can effectively suppress the moisture permeation at grain boundaries,  R21  resulting in improved environmental stability for the PSCs based on the E-SnO 2 ETLs. These explanations have been added in the manuscript (page 17). </text>

The paper is now both more complete and more easily understandable. I think it will be an influential paper in the field. I therefore recommend publication of the manuscript in Nature Communications. Response: We really thank the referee for recommending publication in Nature Communications. Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author): Am satisfied with the answers. Two minor things: 1) Where the electron goes down in energy, I would not use the term "barrier" but "offset" Response: Thanks for your suggestion. We completely agree with this point that "offset" is more accurate than "barrier" to describe the electron goes down in energy, therefore we have revised the expression in the manuscript. 2) The important thing is that the main text has been improved by incorporating the answers in the manuscript. The only answer which has not been incorporated in the text is the one below so I suggest incorporating in the main text to help any reader, not just me, understand why such a radius was used for the bending tests. </text>

      <text> As shown in Fig 1e, the overall transmittance of all the SnO 2 -based ETLs is below 90 % across the wavelengths from 400-800 nm. Why does the EQE of the EDTA-SnO 2 -based device (Fig.  4b ) can exceed 90%? Response: We characterized the reflection of ITO/E-SnO 2 and ITO/E-SnO 2 /perovskite samples, as shown in Fig.  R1 . It can be seen that the average reflection value of ITO/E-SnO 2 is 12.21% in the wavelength range of 400-800 nm. However, when the perovskite absorber layer is deposited onto the ITO/E-SnO 2 substrate, the average reflection is significantly reduced to 6.88%. The reduced optical loss of the ITO/E-SnO 2 /perovskite is often seen for multilayer coatings for the antireflection effect due to the difference refractive index between E-SnO 2 (~2.3) and perovskite (~2.9) (J. Sci. Techno., 2012, 4, 61-72; J. Phys.: Condens. Matter, 2017, 29, 245702). The smaller reflection leads to higher IPCE of the perovskite solar cells based on E-SnO 2 ETLs in the wavelengths from 400 nm to 800 nm. The results have been added in the manuscript and the Supplementary Information (page 14 and Fig.  S11 ).   </text>

      <text> ARTICLE High efficiency planar-type perovskite solar cells with negligible hysteresis using EDTA-complexed SnO 2 Even though the mesoporous-type perovskite solar cell (PSC) is known for high efficiency, its planar-type counterpart exhibits lower efficiency and hysteretic response. Herein, we report success in suppressing hysteresis and record efficiency for planar-type devices using EDTAcomplexed tin oxide (SnO O wing to the singular properties, including tuned band gap, small exciton energy, excellent bipolar carrier transport, long charge diffusion length, and amazingly high tolerance to defects  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]  , organometal halide perovskites have been projected to be promising candidates for a multitude of optoelectronic applications, including photovoltaics, light emission, photodetectors, X-ray imaging, lasers, gamma-ray detection, subwavelength photonic devices in a long-wavelength region, etc.  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]  . The rapid increase efficiency in a solar cell based on organometal halide perovskites validates its promise in photovoltaics. In the last few years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of mesoporous-type perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has increased to 23.3% by optimizing thin-film growth, interface, and absorber materials  [15] [16] [17]  . As of today, almost all PSCs with high PCE are based on mesoporous-type PSCs that often require high temperature to sinter the mesoporous layer for the best performance, compromising its low-cost advantage and limiting its application in flexible and tandem devices  16, 17  . In order to overcome this issue, planar-type PSC comprising of stacked planar thin films has been developed  18, 19  using low-temperature and low-cost synthesis processes  [20] [21] [22]  since the long charge diffusion length and bipolar carrier properties of perovskites  23, 24  . However, compared to the mesoporous-type PSC, its planar-type counterpart suffers from significant lower certified PCE  18, 25  . In a typical planar-type PSC, the perovskite absorber usually inserts between the electron-transport layer (ETL) and the holetransport layer (HTL) to achieve inverted p-i-n or regular n-i-p configuration  21  . Generally, the inverted device structure utilizing fullerene ETL displays very low hysteresis, however, it usually yields lower PCE, not to mention that fullerene is very expensive  26, 27  . Therefore, research has focused on n-i-p architecture to provide low cost and high efficiency  28, 29  . Even though ETL-free planar-type PSCs have been reported  30, 31  , their highest PCE is only 14.14%, significantly lower than that of the cells with ETL, demonstrating the importance of the ETL in this configuration of PSCs. A suitable ETL should meet some basic requirements for high device efficiency  32  . For instance, decent optical transmittance to ensure enough light is transmitted into the perovskite absorber, matched energy level with the perovskite materials to produce the expected open-circuit voltage (V oc ), and high electron mobility to extract carriers from the active layer effectively in order to avoid charge recombination, etc. Fast carrier extraction is desired to restrict charge accumulation at the interface due to ion migration for reduced hysteresis in the planar-type PSCs. Thus, emphasis has been on developing highquality ETLs with suitable energy level and high electron mobility for high PCE devices. Thus far, TiO 2 is still the most widely used ETL in highefficiency n-i-p planar-type PSCs due to its excellent photoelectric properties  33  . However, the electron mobility of TiO 2 ETL is too low (ca. 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) to match with high hole mobility of commonly used HTLs (ca. 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ), leading to charge accumulation at the TiO 2 /perovskite interface that causes hysteresis and reduced efficiency  34  . There have been extensive efforts in developing low-temperature TiO 2 ETL, such as exploring low-temperature synthesis processes through doping and chemical engineering. The results shown by Tan et al. demonstrate that use of chlorine to modify the TiO 2 microstructure at low temperatures provides promising PCE of 20.1%  35  . Recently, SnO 2 has been demonstrated as an alternative ETL to replace TiO 2 , owing to its more suitable energy level relative to perovskite and higher electron mobility. Ke et al. first used SnO 2 thin film as an ETL in regular planar-type PSCs and demonstrated a PCE of 16.02% with improved hysteresis  36  . Later, the SnO 2 -TiO 2 (planar and mesoporous) composite layers were developed to enhance the performance of the PSCs  37, 38  . It is noteworthy to mention that Al 3+ -doped SnO 2 provides even better performance  39  . Subsequently, a variety of methods, such as solution deposition, atomic layer deposition, chemical bath deposition, etc.  [40] [41] [42]  have been developed for synthesizing SnO 2 thin film to improve the performance of planar-type PSCs  43  . Recently, Jiang et al. developed the SnO 2 nanoparticles as the ETL and demonstrated a certified efficiency as high as 19.9% with very low hysteresis  21  . However, the PCE of the planar-type PSCs is still lower than that of the mesoporous-type devices likely due to charge accumulation at the ETL/perovskite interface caused by relatively low electron mobility of the ETL  44  . It is expected that better PSC performance will be achieved by increasing electron mobility of the ETLs. Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) provides excellent modification of ETLs in organic solar cells owing to its strong chelation function. Li et al. have employed EDTA to passivate ZnO-based ETL and demonstrated improved performance of the organic solar cells  45  . However, when the EDTA-ZnO layer is used in the present perovskite cells, the hydroxyl groups or acetate ligands on the ZnO surface react with the perovskite and proton transfer reactions occur at the perovskite/ZnO interface, leading to poor device performance  46  . In the present work, we realize an EDTA-complexed SnO 2 (E-SnO 2 ) ETLs by complexing EDTA with SnO 2 in planar-type PSCs to attain PCE as high as 21.60%, and certified PCE reaches to 21.52%, the highest reported value to date for the planar-type PSCs. Owing to the low-temperature processing for E-SnO 2 , we fabricate flexible PSCs, and the PCE reaches to 18.28%. Besides, the PSCs based on E-SnO 2 show negligible hysteresis because of the eliminated charge accumulation at the perovskite/ETL interface. We find that the electron mobility of E-SnO 2 increases by about three times compared to that of SnO 2 , leading to negligible current density-voltage (J-V) hysteresis due to improved electron extraction from the perovskite absorber  21  . Furthermore, we find that SnO 2 surface becomes more hydrophilic upon EDTA treatment, which decreases the Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation, resulting in high quality of the perovskite film. </text>

      <text> Results Fabrication and characterization of E-SnO 2 . It is well known that EDTA can react with transition metal oxide to form a complex, because it can provide its lone-pair electrons to the vacant d-orbital of the transition metal atom  47  . Thus, EDTA was chosen to modify the SnO 2 to improve its performance. Supplementary Fig.  1a  describes the chemical reaction that occurred when the SnO 2 was treated using the EDTA aqueous solution, resulting in the formation of a five-membered ring chelate. The images of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 samples are shown in Supplementary Fig.  1b . It is apparent that the unmodified EDTA and SnO 2 samples are transparent, while EDTA-treated SnO 2 turned into milky white. Supplementary Fig.  2  compares the Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of the E-SnO 2 solution measured in the freshly prepared condition and again after it was stored in an ambient atmosphere for 2 months. It is clear that there is no obvious difference between the two solutions indicating the high stability. Figure  1a  shows the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) for EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 films deposited on quartz substrates. In order to reduce the charging effect, the exposed surface of the quartz substrate was coated with a conductive silver paint and connected to the ground. We calibrated the binding energy scale for all XPS measurements to the carbon 1s line at 284.8 eV. It is clear from these measurements that SnO 2 shows only peaks attributed to Sn and O. After the EDTA treatment, the E-SnO 2 film shows an additional peak located at ca. 400 eV, ascribed to N. Meanwhile, the Sn 3d peaks from E-SnO 2 are shifted by ca. 0.16 eV in contrast to the pristine SnO 2 (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), indicating that EDTA is bound to the SnO 2 . FTIR was used to study the interaction between SnO 2 and EDTA. As shown in Fig.  1b , the peaks around 2895 cm -1 and 1673 cm -1 belong to C-H and C=O stretching vibration in the EDTA, respectively. The characteristic peaks of SnO 2 observed at ca. 701 cm -1 and 549 cm -1 are due to O-Sn-O stretch and the Sn-O vibration, respectively  48  . In addition, the peak at 1040 cm -1 in the SnO 2 film is attributed to O-O stretching vibration due to oxygen adsorption on the SnO 2 surface  49  . For the E-SnO 2 sample, the characteristic peaks of SnO 2 shift to 713 cm -1 and 563 cm -1 , and the C-H and C=O stretching vibration peaks shift to 2913 cm -1 and 1624 cm -1 , further demonstrating that the EDTA is indeed complexed with SnO 2 . Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 films deposited on the ITO substrates are shown in Fig.  1c . The data reveal that the E-SnO 2 film shows the smallest root-mean-square roughness of 2.88 nm, a key figure-of-merit for the PSCs  50  . We also measured their Fermi level by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), with the surface potential images shown in Supplementary Fig.  4 , and the calculated details are described in Supplementary Note 1. Figure  1d  provides energy band alignment between perovskites and different ETLs. The Fermi level of E-SnO 2 is very close to the conduction band of perovskite, which is beneficial for enhancing V oc  51  . )  Figure  1e  shows the optical transmission spectra of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 films coated on ITO. All these samples display high average transmittance in the visible region, demonstrating good optical quality. In addition, the electron mobility of various ETLs was measured using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method  20  , as shown in Fig.  1f . It is found that electron mobility of E-SnO 2 is 2.27 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 , significantly larger than those of the EDTA (3.56 × 10 -5 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) and the SnO 2 (9.92 × 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ). It is known that the electron mobility is a key figure-of-merit for ETLs in PSCs. Supplementary Fig.  5  shows the electron injection models for ITO/SnO 2 or E-SnO 2 /perovskite/PCBM/Al structures, with their corresponding J-V curves, and the details are described in Supplementary Note 2. It is apparent that the high electron mobility effectively promotes electron transfer in the PSCs, reduces charge accumulation at the ETL/perovskite interface, improves efficiency, and suppresses hysteresis for the PSCs  21  .

The quality of the perovskite films, including grain size, crystallinity, surface coverage, etc., is very important for high-performance PSCs. For a consistent microstructure, a solution deposition technique was used to fabricate perovskite films on EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 substrates. Figure  2a-c  shows the morphology of the perovskite films deposited on different ETLs. It is clear from these images that continuous pinhole-free films with full surface coverage were obtained. Figure  2d  shows the distribution diagram with an average grain size of about 309 nm for the perovskite coated on SnO 2 . The grain size increased to about 518 nm for the EDTA sample. Surprisingly, the average perovskite grain size is further enhanced to as much as about 828 nm (Fig.  2c, d ) for the E-SnO 2 substrates. According to the established model for nucleation and growth of thin films  52, 53  , the perovskite formation process can be divided into four steps: (i) formation of a crystal nucleus, (ii) evolution of nuclei into an island structure, (iii) formation of a networked microstructure, and (iv) growth of networks into a continuous film. The Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation in the first step can be expressed as Eq. (  1 ) 4G heterogeneous ¼ 4G homogeneous f θ ð Þ ð1Þ wherein f(θ) = (2-3 cos θ + cos 3 θ)/4  54  , and θ is the contact angle of the precursor solution. Since the magnitude of θ varies in the range of [0, π/2], the larger the θ is, the smaller is the magnitude of cos θ, and therefore larger is the parameter f(θ) ϵ [0, 1]. In other words, a smaller contact angle results in reduced Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation, thereby assisting the nucleation process. Higher nucleation density will promote the film densification process  53  . Compared to EDTA and SnO 2 , E-SnO 2 shows the smallest contact angle (20.67°, Supplementary Fig.  6 ), resulting in the wettability interface for the perovskite  55- 57  . Thus, the perovskite coated on the E-SnO 2 exhibits better crystallinity (Supplementary Fig.  7 ) and full surface coverage (Fig.  2c ). In addition, the small contact angle of the substrate provides the low surface energy  58  , leading to increased grain size during the growth of the networked structure  53  , as observed in the SEM measurements. Charge transfer dynamics. The electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/ETL/perovskite/PCBM/Ag were fabricated to evaluate the trap density of perovskite deposited on different substrates. Figure  3a  shows the dark current-voltage (I-V) curves of the electron-only devices. The linear correlation (dark yellow line) reveals an ohmic-type response at low bias voltage, when the bias voltage is above the kink point, which defines as the trapfilled limit voltage (V TFL ), the current nonlinearly increases (cyan line), indicating that the traps are completely filled. The trap density (N t ) can be obtained using Eq. (  2 ) N t ¼ 2ε 0 εV TFT eL 2 ð2Þ EDTA/perovskite where ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε is the relative dielectric constant of FA 0.95 Cs 0.05 PbI 3 (ε = 62.23)  59  , e is the electron charge, and L is the thickness of the film. The trap densities of the perovskite film coated on SnO 2 and EDTA substrates are 1.93 × 10 16 and 1.27 × 10 16 cm -3 , respectively. Interestingly, the trap density is reduced to as low as 8.97 × 10 15 cm -3 for the film deposited on E-SnO 2 . The significantly lower trap density is related to low grain boundary density in the perovskite film (Fig.  2 ). Figure  3b  shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite deposited on different substrates. Compared with other samples, significant PL quench is observed in the ITO/E-SnO 2 /perovskite, demonstrating that the E-SnO 2 has the most appealing merits as the highest electron mobility (Fig.  1f ). Figure  3c  shows the normalized time-resolved PL (TRPL) for perovskite coated on various ETLs. The lifetime and the corresponding amplitudes are listed in Supplementary Table  1 . Generally, the slow decay component (τ 1 ) is attributed to the radiative recombination of free charge carriers due to traps in the bulk, and the fast decay component (τ 2 ) is originated from the quenching of charge carriers at the interface  60  . The glass/ perovskite sample shows the longest lifetime under excitation intensity of 3 μJ cm -2 . For perovskite coated on the ITO substrate, the lifetime is decreased to more than half due to the charge transfer from perovskite into ITO. For EDTA/perovskite and SnO 2 /perovskite samples, both the fast and slow decay lifetimes are very similar, and τ 1 dominates the PL decay for both samples, indicating severe recombination before they were extracted. When the perovskite is deposited on E-SnO 2 , both τ 1 and τ 2 were shortened to 14.16 ns and 0.97 ns, with a proportion of 45.32% and 54.68%, respectively. Meanwhile, τ 2 appears to dominate the PL decay, indicating that electrons are effectively extracted from the perovskite layer to the E-SnO 2 with minimal recombination loss. Even under smaller excitation intensity (0.5 μJ cm -2 ), the acceleration of the lifetime for E-SnO 2 /perovskite is observed. The lifetime increases with reduced excitation intensity (Supplementary Fig.  8  and Supplementary Table  1 ), in agreement with a previous report  61  . The electron-transport yield (Ф tr ) of different ETLs with different excitation intensities can be estimated using equation, Ф tr = 1 -τ p /τ glass , where τ p is the average lifetime for perovskite deposited on different substrates, and τ glass is the average lifetime for glass/perovskite. With the excitation intensity of 3 μJ cm -2 , the electron-transport yields of ITO, EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 are 49.72%, 67.58%, 68.31%, and 81.50%, respectively. When the excitation intensity reduces to 0.5 μJ cm -2 , the electron-transport yields of ITO, EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 are increased to 60.37%, 74.46%, 80.65%, and 90.82%, respectively. It is clear that the excitation intensity can significantly increase the electron-transport yield. These results further indicate that the E-SnO 2 is a good electron extraction layer for planar-type PSCs. The performance of PSCs. With the superior optoelectronic properties discussed above, it is expected that the E-SnO 2 would make a better ETL in the PSCs than the SnO 2 . Planar-type PSCs are therefore designed and fabricated based on different ETLs with the device structure shown in Fig.  4a  inset. FAPbI 3 was used as the active absorber for its proper band gap, with a small amount of Cs doping to improve its phase stability  62, 63  . Supplementary Fig.  9  presents the cross-sectional SEM images for the complete device structure. The thickness of the perovskite film is controlled at ca. 420 nm for all devices. While the perovskite grains are not large enough to penetrate through the film thickness when the SnO 2 is used as the substrate, the grains are significantly larger when deposited on EDTA and E-SnO 2 with the grains grown across the film thickness, which is consistent with top-view SEM results (Fig.  2 ). Figure  4a  shows the J-V curves of planar-type PSCs using different ETLs, with the key parameters, including short-circuit current density (J sc ), V oc , fill factor (FF), and PCE summarized in Table  1 . The device based on EDTA gives a PCE of 16.42% with J sc = 22.10 mA cm -2 , V oc = 1.08 V, and FF = 0.687. The device based on SnO 2 substrate shows a PCE of 18.93% with J sc = 22.79 mA cm -2 , V oc = 1.10 V, and FF = 0.755. Interestingly, when the E-SnO 2 is employed as ETL, the J sc , FF, and V oc are increased to 24.55 mA cm -2 , 0.792, and 1.11 V, yielding a PCE up to 21.60%, (the certified efficiency is 21.52%, and the certificated document is shown in Supplementary Fig.  10 ), the highest efficiency reported to date for the planar-type PSCs. The low device performance for the EDTA is caused by small J sc and FF, which is related to low electron mobility and high resistance  47  , and the low V oc results from the small offset of Fermi energy between the EDTA and HTL (Fig.  1d )  64  . In comparison, the planar-type PSCs with E-SnO 2 ETLs exhibit the best performance. The higher J sc and FF are Fig.  3  The charge transfer between perovskite and different ETLs. a Dark I-V curves of the electron-only devices with the V TFL kink points. The inset shows the structure of the electron-only device. b Steady-state PL and c TRPL spectra with an excitation intensity of 3 μJ cm -2 of perovskite films deposited on different substrates attributed to the high electron mobility that promotes effective electron extraction, and the larger V oc due to the closer energy level between E-SnO 2 and perovskite  65  . Figure  4b  shows the incidentphoton-to-charge conversion efficiency (IPCE) and the integrated current of the PSCs based on different ETLs. The integrated current values calculated by the IPCE spectra for the devices using EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 are 21.22, 21.58, and 24.15 mA cm -2 , respectively, very close to the J-V results. It is apparent that the device based on the E-SnO 2 shows significantly higher IPCE due to less optical loss when perovskite is deposited on E-SnO 2 ETL (Supplementary Fig.  11 ), consistent with the J-V measurement. To further demonstrate the device characteristics, photocurrent density of the champion devices from each group based on EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 was measured when the devices were biased at 0.85, 0.89, and 0.92 V, respectively. Figure  4c  shows the corresponding curves at the maximum power point (V mp ) in the J-V plots. The PCEs of the champion devices using the EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 stabilize at 16.34%, 18.67%, and 21.67% with photocurrent densities of 19.22, 20.98, and 23.55 mA cm -2 , respectively, very close to the values measured from the J-V curves. Next, we fabricated and measured 30 individual devices for each ETL to study repeatability. Figure  4d  shows the PCE distribution histogram for devices with different ETLs, with the statistics listed in Supplementary Tables  2 3 4 . Amazingly, the devices based on E-SnO 2 exhibit excellent repeatability with a very small standard deviation in contrast to the devices based on EDTA and SnO 2 , indicating that the E-SnO 2 is an excellent ETL in the planar-type PSC.  In order to gain further insight into the charge transport mechanism, the charge transfer processes in the perovskite devices were studied in detail. The carrier recombination rate in the PSCs was evaluated by the V oc decay measurements. Figure  5a  shows the V oc decay curves of the PSCs based on different ETLs. It is apparent that the planar-type PSC based on E-SnO 2 exhibits the slowest V oc decay time compared to the devices based on EDTA and SnO 2 , indicating that the devices with E-SnO 2 have the lowest charge recombination rate and the longest carrier lifetime, consistent with the highest V oc for the device based on E-SnO 2 by J-V measurements. Figure  5b  shows J sc versus light intensity of the PSCs using various ETLs. It appears that all devices show a linear correlation with the slopes very close to 1, indicating that the bimolecular recombination in the devices is negligible  66  . Figure  5c  shows that V oc changes linearly with the light intensity. Prior studies have indicated that the deviation between the slope and the value of (kT/q) reflects the trap-assisted recombination  20  . In the present case, the device using the E-SnO 2 shows the smallest slope, indicating the least trap-assisted recombination, which is in excellent agreement with the result showing the lowest trap density when the perovskite is deposited on E-SnO 2 (Fig.  3a ). In fact, the slope is as small as 1.02 kT/q, implying that the trap-assisted recombination is almost negligible. The electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to extract transfer resistance in the solar cells. Figure  5d  shows the Nyquist plots of the devices using different ETLs measured at V oc under dark conditions, with the equivalent circuit shown in Supplementary Fig.  12 . It is known that in the EIS analysis, the high-frequency component is the signature of the transfer resistance (R tr ) and the low-frequency one for the recombination resistance (R rec )  67  . In the present study, because the perovskite/ HTL interface is identical for all devices, the only variable affecting R tr is the perovskite/ETL interface. The numerical fitting gives the device parameters, as listed in Supplementary Table  5 . Apparently, compared to PSCs based on EDTA and SnO 2 , the device with E-SnO 2 shows the smallest R tr of 14.8 Ω and the largest R rec of 443.3 Ω. The small R tr is beneficial for electron extraction, and the large R rec effectively resists charge recombination, which is in agreement with the observations discussed above. Combined, all the results confirm that E-SnO 2 is the most effective ETL for the planar-type PSC. Stability and hysteresis. Stability and hysteresis are two key characteristics for the PSCs. Figure  6a  shows normalized PCE measured as a function of storage time, with more detailed J-V parameters summarized in Supplementary Table  6 . It is clear that while the device based on E-SnO 2 maintains 92% of its initial efficiency exposed to an ambient atmosphere after 2880 h in the dark, the device using SnO 2 only provides 74% of its initial efficiency under the same storage condition. The PSCs were also tested under continuous irradiation at 100 mW cm -2 . Figure  6b  shows the normalized PCE changes as a function of test time, with more detailed J-V parameters provided in Supplementary Table  7 . It is clear that after 120 h of illumination, the device using the E-SnO 2 maintains 86% of its initial efficiency, while for the same test duration, the device using SnO 2 remains only 38% relative to its initial efficiency. It is apparent that the device fabricated on E-SnO 2 shows excellent stability under both the dark and continuous irradiation. The instability of PSC is mainly caused by degradation of the perovskite film and spiro-OMeTAD HTL. In the present work, all devices used the same spiro-OMeTAD HTL, therefore, the degradation from the HTL should be the same for all the devices. It is found that the grain size of the perovskite film is increased by three times when it is deposited on E-SnO 2 in comparison to that on the pristine SnO 2 (Fig.  2 ). The larger grain size can effectively suppress the moisture permeation at grain boundaries  68  , resulting in improved environmental stability for the PSCs based on the E-SnO 2 ETLs. For the hysteresis test, Fig.  6c  and d  show the J-V curves measured under both reverse-and forward-scan directions. It is found that the device with E-SnO 2 has almost identical J-V curves with negligible hysteresis, even when it is measured using different scan rates from 0.01 to 0.5 V s -1 . Supplementary Fig.  13  presents J-V curves measured for the device based on E-SnO 2 at different scan rates. It is apparent that the J-V curves almost remain the same, regardless of scan rate and direction, demonstrating that the hysteresis is negligible. Generally, the hysteresis of PSCs is ascribed to interfacial capacitance caused by charge accumulation at the interface, which originates from ion migration, high trap density, and unbalanced charge transport within the perovskite device  [69] [70] [71]  . It is found that the trap density of the perovskite film is significantly reduced when it is deposited on the E-SnO 2 , one of the primary reasons for reduced hysteresis. In addition, the electron mobility of the SnO 2 ETL is only 9.92 × 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 s -1 (Fig.  1f ), about an order of magnitude slower than the hole mobility of the doped spiro-OMeTAD (ca. 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) HTL. Thus, the electron flux (F e ) is ca. 10 times smaller than the hole flux (F h ) due to the same interface area of the ETL/perovskite and perovskite/HTL, that leads to charge accumulation at the SnO 2 /perovskite interface, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  14a . The accumulated charge would cause hysteresis in the solar cells (Fig.  6c ). When the high electron mobility E-SnO 2 (2.27 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) is employed as the ETL, the F e is comparable to the F h of the spiro-OMeTAD HTL (Supplementary Fig.  14b ), resulting in equivalent charge transport at both electrodes. Therefore, the high electron mobility of E-SnO 2 would enhance electron transport from perovskite to E-SnO 2 ETL, leading to no significant charge accumulation, and consequently, the devices based on the E-SnO 2 exhibit negligible hysteresis. High-efficiency flexible PSCs. Given the advantage of lowtemperature preparation, we applied the E-SnO 2 ETL in flexible PSCs. Figure  7a  shows J-V curves of flexible PSCs using the poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET)/ITO substrates, with key J-V parameters summarized in Table  1 . The champion flexible device exhibits PCE of 18.28% (J sc = 23.42 mA cm -2 , V oc = 1.09 V, and FF = 0.716). The lower J sc of the flexible device is caused by the lower transparency of the PET/ITO substrate compared to the glass/ITO used for the rigid device (Supplementary Fig.  15 ). The lower V oc and FF are likely due to higher sheet resistance of the PET/ITO substrate  67  . Figure  7c  shows the IPCE and integral current density of the flexible device. It is clear that the integral current is 23.12 mA cm -2 , in perfect agreement with the J-V results. For the reproducibility test, 30 individual cells were fabricated with the PCE distribution histogram shown in Fig.  7d  and detailed parameters are summarized in Supplementary Table  8 , both confirming very good reproducibility. The mechanical stability is an important quality indicator for the flexible solar cells. According to a previous report  72  , it is safe ) Voltage (V) for ITO to be bended to a radius of 14 mm, and when the bending radius is smaller than 14 mm, the ITO layer starts to crack, leading to significant degradation in conductivity. In order to examine the mechanical stability of the flexible PSCs, we therefore adopted the bending radii of 14 mm, 12 mm, and 7 mm to test the flexible device. Figure  7a  shows device performance of the flexible solar cells measured after flexing for 500 times with different curvature radii, and the test procedure is shown in Fig.  7b . It shows that after flexing for 500 times at a bending radius of 14 mm, the J-V curve and the associated parameters remain the same without obvious degradation. However, when the bending radius is decreased to 12 mm and 7 mm, the PCE degraded to 17.82% and 16.84%, respectively, attributing to the conductivity degradation of ITO  72  .

      <text> Discussion An effective E-SnO 2 ETL has been developed, and the PCE of planar-type PSCs is increased to 21.60% with negligible hysteresis, and the certified efficiency is 21.52%, this is the highest reported value for planar-type PSCs so far. By taking advantage of lowtemperature processing for E-SnO 2 ETLs, flexible devices with high PCE of 18.28% are also fabricated. The significant performance of the planar-type PSCs is attributed to the superior advantages when perovskite is deposited on E-SnO 2 ETLs, including larger grain size, lower trap density, and good crystallinity. The higher electron mobility facilitates electron transfer for suppressed charge accumulation at the interface, leading to high efficiency with negligible J-V hysteresis. Furthermore, the longterm stability is significantly enhanced since the large grain size that suppressed perovskite degradation at grain boundaries. This work provides a promising direction toward developing highquality ETLs, and we believe that the present work will facilitate transition of perovskite photovoltaics. </text>

      <text> Methods Materials. NH 2 CHNH 2 I (FAI) was synthesized and purified according to a reported procedure  45  . The SnO 2 solution was purchased from Alfa Aesar (tin (IV) oxide, 15 wt% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion). PbI 2 (purity &gt; 99.9985%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. EDTA (purity &gt; 99.995%), CsI (purity &gt; 99.999%), dimethylformamide (DMF, purity &gt; 99%), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, purity &gt; 99%) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. In total, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-pmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) was bought from Yingkou OPV Tech Co., Ltd. All of the other solvents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich without any purification. Fabrication of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 films. The 0.2-mg EDTA was dissolved in 1 mL of deionized water, and the SnO 2 aqueous colloidal dispersion (15 wt%) was diluted using deionized water to the concentration of 2.5 wt%. These solutions were stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The SnO 2 and EDTA layers were fabricated by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 60 s using the corresponding solution, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C under ca. 5 Pa for 30 min to remove residual solvent. The EDTA and SnO 2 solution were mixed with a volume ratio of 1:1, then put on a hot plate at 80 °C for 5 h under stirring conditions, and the milky-white E-SnO 2 colloidal solution (Supplementary Fig.  1b ) was obtained. The E-SnO 2 colloidal solution was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 60 s, and then transferred the samples into a vacuum oven at 60 °C under ca. 5 Pa for 30 min to remove the residual solvent. Finally, the E-SnO 2 films were obtained. Electron mobility of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 films. To gain insights into the charge transport, we have measured electron mobility using different ETLs in the same device structure. Specifically, the electron-only device was designed and fabricated using ITO/Al/ETL/Al structure, as shown in the inset in Fig.  1f . In this analysis, we assumed that the current is only related to electrons. When the effects of diffusion and the electric field are neglected, the current density can be determined by the SCLC  73  . The thickness of 80-nm Al was deposited on ITO substrates by thermal evaporation, and then the different ETLs were spin-coated on ITO/Al. Finally, 80-nm-thick Al was deposited on ITO/Al/ETL samples. The dark J-V curves of the devices were performed on a Keithley 2400 source at ambient conditions. The electron mobility (μ e ) is extracted by fitting the J-V curves using the Mott-Gurney law (  3 ) μ e ¼ 8JL 3 9ε 0 ε V app À V r À V bi 2 ð3Þ where J is the current density, L the thickness of different ETLs, ε 0 the vacuum permittivity, ε r the dielectric permittivity of various ETLs, V app the applied voltage, V r the voltage loss due to radiative recombination, and V bi the built-in voltage owing to the different work function between the anode and cathode. Fabrication of solar cells. The perovskite absorbers were deposited on different ETL substrates using one-step solution processed. In total, 240.8 mg of FAI, 646.8 mg of PbI 2 , and 18.2 mg of CsI were dissolved in 1 mL of DMF and DMSO (4:1, volume/volume), with stirring at 60 °C for 2 h. The precursor solution was spincoated on the EDTA, SnO 2 and E-SnO 2 substrates. The spin-coated process was divided by a consecutive two-step process, the spin rate of the first step is 1000 rpm for 15 s with accelerated speed of 200 rpm, and the spin rate of the second step is 4000 rpm for 45 s with accelerated speed of 1000 rpm. During the second step end of 15 s, 200 μL of chlorobenzene was drop-coated to treat the perovskite films, and then the perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 30 min in a glovebox. After cooling down to room temperature, the spiro-OMeTAD solution was coated on perovskite films at 5000 rpm for 30 s with accelerated speed of 3000 rpm. The 1-mL HTL chlorobenzene solution contains 90 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 36 μL of 4-tertbutylpyridine, and 22 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide of 520 mg mL -1 in acetonitrile. The samples were retained in a desiccator overnight to oxidate the spiro-OMeTAD. Finally, 100-nm-thick Au was deposited using thermal evaporation. The device area of 0.1134 cm 2 was determined by a metal mask. Characterization. The J-V curves of the PSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 source under ambient conditions at room temperature. The light source was a 450-W xenon lamp (Oriel solar simulator) with a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter (Praezisions Glas &amp; Optik GmbH) to match AM1.5 G. The light intensity was 100 mW cm -2 calibrated by a NREL-traceable KG5-filtered silicon reference cell. The active area of 0.1017 cm 2 was defined by a black metal aperture to avoid light scattering into the device, and the aperture area was determined by the MICRO VUE sol 161 instrument. The J-V curves for PSCs were tested both at reverse scan (from 2 to -0.1 V, step 0.02 V) and forward scan (from -0.1 to 2 V, step 0.02 V), and the scan rate was selected from 0.01 to 0.5 V s -1 . There was no preconditioning before the test. The IPCE was implemented on the QTest Station 2000ADI system (Crowntech. Inc., USA). AFM height images were attained by a Bruker Multimode 8 in tapping mode. KPFM was carried out on Bruker Metrology Nanoscope VIII AFM in an ambient atmosphere. The TRPL spectra were performed on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer. SEM images were gained by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SU8020) under an accelerating voltage of 2 kV. XPS measurements were performed on an AXISULTRA X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The optical transmission was acquired by a Hitachi U-3900 spectrophotometer. Fig. 1f . 1f Fig. 1f.

      <text> ) obtained from KPFM is totally different from the value of CB band, and the energy diagram in figure 1(d) is misleading. Response: Thank you very much for the comment. The Fermi level obtained from KPFM is indeed different from the value of CB band. We are really sorry for the inappropriate label used in Fig. 1b, and it is corrected in the revised manuscript. In present work, we used the KPFM to test surface potential of different ETLs, and the images are shown in Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Information. The Fermi level (FL) of different samples can be calculated using the equation: FL = 4.6 + e(SP HOPG -SP sample ),where e is the elementary charge of the electron, SP HOPG and SP sample are surface potential of HOPG and the sample, respectively. Thus we can obtain the values of FL for EDTA, SnO 2 and E-SnO 2 . More details are provided in the Supplementary Information (page S3, Fig.S4). </text>

Typical lifetimes are more in the 50-1000 ns range. Related to this, how much does ITO quench the emission? • On page 17 the authors state that the "electron mobility of E-SnO2 would enhance electron transfer," do the authors mean transport? • The authors write dimethyl sulfide in the materials and methods, is this a typo of dimethyl sulfoxide or is this correct? • Is the SnO2/water solution 2.5 wt%? • Are the SnO2 layers annealed at all? • How are the control SnO2 layers and the control EDTA layers fabricated?

      <text> . Why was this chosen? It is where ITO cracks? Please provide some references. Reviewer #3: Remarks to the Author: In this work, the authors introduced an ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-complexed SnO2 as the electron transport layer (ETL) for planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to realize a certified efficiency of 21.5% with eliminated hysteresis and enhanced stability. However, similar concept has been already reported in a previous work (Chem. Mater., 2017, 29, 4176-4180) besides the improved efficiency for PSCs. I thus felt the novelty of this work is not impressive and not suitable to publish in Nature Communications as considering its high standard. I would recommend the publication of this work in the other specific journal. Some remarks / questions follow: 1. The author should refer the mentioned reference (Chem. Mater., 2017, 29, 4176-4180) in the manuscript. 2. The surface potential (Fermi level) obtained from KPFM is totally different from the value of CB band, and the energy diagram in figure 1(d ) is misleading. 3. What is the real mechanism for the eliminated hysteresis by using EDTA-SnO2? The author should clarify it. </text>
