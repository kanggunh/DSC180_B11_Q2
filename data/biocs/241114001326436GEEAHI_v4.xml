      <text> Impact of Electrode Materials on Process Environmental Stability of Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells We employ a mesoporous BaSnO 3 electron transport layer to satisfy both solar-cell performance and stability as an alternative to conventional Li-doped TiO 2 . Both BaSnO 3 and Li-doped TiO 2 show considerable power conversion efficiency exceeding 21% and 20%, respectively, under 10% relative humidity. However, in 40% relative humidity, PSCs using Li-doped TiO 2 are dramatically deteriorated within 24 h while PSCs with BaSnO 3 exhibit excellent processing stability.  </text>

      <text> INTRODUCTION Organometal-halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received considerable attention because of their low-cost fabrication process and remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE), recently exceeding 22%.  1  Most highly efficient PSCs utilize a bilayered device architecture of a mesoporous scaffold, which is infiltrated by a formamidinium (FA)-cation-based perovskite and an overlayer of the perovskite.  2  Mesoporous (mp) TiO 2 has been commonly used for high-surface-area electrodes, but it exhibits low electron mobility ($1 cm 2 V À1 s À1 ).  3, 4  Therefore, the use of substitutional dopants such as Li salt has been necessary for facilitating electron injection and transport in the mesoporous TiO 2 .  5, 6  A number of problems with PSCs should be resolved before expanding from a lab scale to actual mass production, including homogeneity over a large area and the throughput and yield of the process with quality and the stability of large-area devices. One further major issue is the processing stability of the perovskites, which are sensitive to atmospheric conditions with uncontrolled humidity. With respect to processing costs, it is not ideal to establish a 100% nitrogen environment or a dry air atmosphere with less than 10% relative humidity (RH) for a mass production line. On the other hand, humidity higher than 40%$50% should be avoided for the perfect conversion of the precursors into the perovskite film. Thus, high processing stability of all of the incorporated materials is essential for practical fabrication under a broad window of humidity (with an upper limit of 40%$50%). Efforts to address the aforementioned limitations include incorporating 2D perovskites into 3D perovskites or introducing an inorganic cation (such as Cs or Rb) into the perovskites.  [7] [8] [9] [10]  To protect the perovskite layer from the ingress of moisture, the perovskite film can be covered with a hydrophobic polymer layer.  11  For better stability, the use of hole transport materials (HTMs) without a hygroscopic dopant such as lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSi) has also been explored.  12  Finally, device stability against humidity has been obtained by applying encapsulation.  13  Nevertheless, all the layers of the device during the fabrication and aging process in a practical mass production line could be exposed to ambient humid air before encapsulation of the device. </text>

      <text> Context &amp; Scale For the aforementioned reasons, many researchers have conducted research to enhance the stability of the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL) against humidity.  14, 15  However, to date, little research has been performed on the humidity stability of the metal-oxide layer of the device. As explained, facile doping of Li salt into mesoporous TiO 2 could lead to improved electron conductance, but the stability issue has still not been addressed. Furthermore, high reactivity of the intercalated Li ions with any moisture may produce undesirable byproducts such as Li 2 O and LiOH, which can degrade device performance.  16, 17  Therefore, in finding an alternative to Li-doped mp-TiO 2 , the development of an electron transport layer (ETL) that exhibits better mobility and superior moisture stability in humid air is also critical for attaining processing stability during practical mass production. BaSnO 3 (BSO) is an n-type semiconductor that is induced by oxygen vacancies in the lattice with a wide band gap of 3.1 eV. It has high mobility because the conduction band (CB) minimum originating from the Sn 5s-O 2p orbital interaction gives rise to a large CB dispersion and thus a low effective mass. Recently, our group and Seok reported a highly efficient and stable planar PSC with a device configuration of a fluorine-doped SnO 2 (FTO)/thin layer of nanoparticle La-BaSnO 3 (NP-BSO)/MAPbI 3 / polytriarylamine polymer (PTAA)/Au.  18  This planar PSC based on a BSO-MAPbI 3 heterojunction showed excellent device performance of 21% and better photostability compared to that obtained with the use of a thin layer of its TiO 2 counterpart. However, thus far, there have been no reports on employing BSO nanoparticles in a mesoporous scaffold or in a heterojunction with FA-based mixed perovskites. In this work, we propose a strategy for improving the process stability by incorporating a BSO mesoporous layer into a state-of-the-art PSC architecture of a bilayered device, including FA-based mixed perovskites. From the resultant device, we achieved stabilized efficiency of 21.7% (reverse scan: 22%) with a certified efficiency of 21.3%, which is the highest efficiency among non-TiO 2 -based PSCs. The mp-BSObased device exhibited excellent processing stability during the fabrication and aging processes under a broad window of humidity in a range up to $40% RH. In contrast, the device using Li-doped mp-TiO 2 showed relatively poor stability under a similar humid atmosphere. Furthermore, the mp-BSO-based PSCs exhibited good long-term stability under dark and light illumination for 500 h. </text>

      <text> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION BSO may be the best candidate as an ETL for commercializing PSCs because it has excellent conductivity with no additional process compared to its TiO 2 counterpart. But, a previous report shows the TiO 2 /BSO-based PSCs have a large hysteresis in current-voltage (J-V) curves.  18  Surprisingly, during the optimization process, we found that the introduction of SnO 2 nanoparticle layer onto the spray-deposited TiO 2 reduces the hysteresis in J-V curves (Figure  S1 ). For this reason, we employed a TiO 2 /SnO 2 bilayer as a blocking layer for mp-BSO-based PSCs. To maximize the device performance of mp-BSO-based PSCs, we adopted a state-of-the-art PSC architecture consisting of an FTO/ blocking layer (bl-TiO 2 and SnO 2 bilayer)/mesoporous layer/FA-based mixed perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au (Figure  1A ). For fabricating best-performing devices, all processes were carried out under optimum condition, i.e., 10% RH. From a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Figure  1A ), all the layers are discernible; the mesoporous BSO layer is deposited with a thickness of 140 nm, and a uniform perovskite layer on top of BSO is fabricated with a thickness of 450 nm by using our solvent engineering technique. From this resultant device, we obtained a reverse PCE of 22% with a stabilized PCE of 21.7% (Figure  1B ) and a certified average PCE of 21.3% (Figure  S2 ). As displayed in Figure  S3 , hysteresis behavior is clearly observed but is considerably suppressed in the mesoporous scaffold based on FA-based mixed perovskites, as compared to a previous study using La-doped BSO/MAPbI 3 planar PSCs.  18  A histogram of the solar-cell PCEs for 43 cells is shown in Figure  1C  and Table  S1 . Surprisingly, over 30 cells have a PCE of more than 21% (an average PCE of 21.45% G 0.61%), which is comparable to that of Li-doped mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs (hereafter, denoted as mp-TiO 2 ) (20.74% G 0.58%) (Figure  1C ). In addition to a highly efficient performance, practical processing stability in a production line is required until the device is encapsulated since moisture cannot be perfectly excluded in the processing environment, in contrast with the inert atmosphere of a laboratory (e.g., a glove box filled with nitrogen or dry air). We investigated the processing stability of an mp-BSO-based device fabricated and aged under controlled humidity (i.e., low humidity [$10% RH] and high humidity [$40% RH]). For comparison, we also prepared an mp-TiO 2 -based device under the same conditions. It should be noted that it is usually difficult to prepare a high-quality perovskite film with a dense and uniform morphology under humidity higher than 40% RH. Thus, we adjusted the humidity up to 40% RH. As shown in Figure  S4 , at 10% RH, we could not detect any degradation in either device even after 1 week, and the performance was enhanced from 19.4% and 19.2% to 20.1% and 21.3% for the mp-TiO 2 -based PSC and mp-BSO-based PSC, respectively, owing to the aging effect. However, at 40% RH, we found a significant difference in the device stability between mp-BSO and mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs. Figure  2A  shows the evolution of the average photovoltaic parameters over 24 h for non-encapsulated mp-BSO-and mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs aged at controlled 40% RH. Surprisingly, the mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs show serious degradation at 40% RH in the early stage of the first 3 h because of abrupt decreases in the fill factor (FF) and open circuit voltage (V OC ), and their performance diminishes to approximately 50% of the initial efficiency over 24 h (Figure  2A ). Conversely, the mp-BSO-based PSCs exhibit good stability at 40% RH for 24 h. The FF and short circuit current (J SC ) values stay constant for the first 3 h, while the V OC increases slightly because of the aging effect (similar to the result at 10% RH), resulting in an improvement in the PCE (Figure  2A ). Even after 24 h, only a slight decrease in the PCE is observed for the mp-BSO-based devices. For detailed information, a histogram of PCEs (Figure  S5 ), and full photovoltaic parameters (Tables  S2  and S3 ) for mp-BSO-and mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs processed and aged at 40% RH for 0 and 24 h are further shown. Consequently, it can be concluded that the mp-BSO is an ideal candidate for the ETL in a highly efficient PSC with good processing stability. To elucidate the degradation pathway by the humidity effect on both PSCs, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed at a V OC under 1 sun illumination. Figure  2B  presents the Nyquist plots of mp-TiO 2 -and mp-BSObased PSCs at different humidity conditions. The Nyquist plots show a typical semicircle in a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. The semicircle in the high-frequency region is caused by the selective contact or the interface of this contact and is related to the series resistance (R series ).  19  For a BSO-based PSC, the R series is negligibly affected by humidity, while the diameter of the semicircle for the mp-TiO 2 -based PSC in high-frequency regions increases significantly at higher humidity (40% RH), i.e., the increase in R series , which reduces the FF and thus decreases the PCE of the device. This is in agreement with R series trends extracted from the J-V curves. This increase in the R series can be attributed to the reduced electrical property of Li doped mp-TiO 2 film because all layers in the PSCs are identical except for the n-type mesoporous layer. Because the measured electron concentration for BSO and TiO 2 film also is the same (Figure  S6 ), the reduced electrical property may be ascribed to low mobility of TiO 2 film. Furthermore, the dark J-V curves show a clear difference between mp-BSO-and mp-TiO 2 -based devices, depending on humidity (Figure  2C ). The dark current of mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs is significantly reduced at high humidity ($40% RH) compared to mp-BSO-based PSC, although at low humidity ($10%), they exhibit similar dark J-V curves. In general, the reduction of dark current has a positive effect on devices, suggesting a decrease in defects and hence a reduction of recombination. However, an abnormally greater reduction of dark current may be due to a large drop in electrical properties of the ETL or the ETL/perovskite interface, i.e., an increase in the resistance of the ETL or the ETL/perovskite interface, which increases the R series , as shown in EIS analysis.  19  We further performed transient photocurrent (TPC) and photovoltage (TPV) analysis for devices aged at 40% RH (Figures  2D  and S7 ). It is observed that the mp-BSO-based PSC shows faster decay in TPC and slower decay in TPV than that of the mp-TiO 2 -based PSC, respectively. Additionally, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) result exhibits that the BSO/perovskite sample has a faster charge transfer compared to TiO 2 /perovskite (Figure  S8 ). Based on these results, we can conclude that mp-BSO-based PSCs fabricated and aged at 40 % RH have superior charge extraction capability than mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs fabricated and aged at 40% RH. Therefore, it can be assumed that a high-humidity condition can inhibit electron transport or transfer at the interface between oxide particles or at the interface between the perovskite and the ETL, thereby increasing the resistance of the ETL, which in turn can significantly decrease the FF and PCE of the device with mp-TiO 2 -treated Li salt. To reveal the exact reason for the increase in the resistance of the device, various analyses for mesoporous films under different humidity conditions were performed. First, we carried out X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figures  3A  and S9 ). Figure  3A  displays XPS O 1s spectra of BSO and mp-TiO 2 films with different humidity conditions. The spectra of the BSO films are almost identical regardless of the humidity, indicating that BSO is almost unaffected by humidity, whereas the spectra of the TiO 2 film show clear differences at different humidity conditions. A peak deconvolution process shows that the O 1s spectrum of the samples consists of two peaks at 529.4 and 531.4 eV. The peak with low binding energy is generally associated with the contribution of O 2 À ions in the anatase anionic network, while that with higher binding energy is attributed to the oxygen atoms in the OH species and/or the adsorbed oxygen species on the surface.  20, 21  At a high-humidity condition ($40% RH), the shoulder peak at 531.4 eV is diminished compared with the TiO 2 film at a low-humidity condition, indicating a decrease in the OH species on TiO 2 . Generally, the reduction of OH species may originate from the formation of a new oxide layer (e.g., oxide shell) on the surface of TiO 2 nanoparticles. To support this speculation, we performed a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis (Figure  3B ). Comparing the FTIR spectra of pristine TiO 2 and Li-doped TiO 2 , we found that Li doping inevitably produces lithium oxide (e.g., 625 and 716 cm À1 ; Li-O stretching) on TiO 2 films regardless of the humidity level.  22  Interestingly, the peaks for 625 and 716 cm À1 become stronger at higher humidity, although the peak at 832 cm À1 (Ti-O-Ti stretching) becomes weaker. This indicates that the moisture can accelerate the formation of lithium oxides in TiO 2 . As reported, some types of lithium compounds are critically sensitive to moisture in the air. Water can easily penetrate crystal structures or porous films and react with lithium in the lattice or surface, which can produce Li 2 O.  16  Furthermore, we directly confirmed the formation of an oxide layer on TiO 2 nanoparticles via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). Figures  3C  and 3D  compare HR-TEM images of Li-doped TiO 2 nanoparticles prepared under different humidity (10% or 40% RH). At low humidity (10% RH), the surface of the TiO 2 nanoparticles is smooth. Although we detected Li-O stretching on TiO 2 under low humidity through an FTIR analysis, we could not directly observe a noticeable layer on the TiO 2 surface in the TEM image. This can imply that Li x O can be partially or very thinly formed at a low-humidity condition. However, at high humidity (40% RH), we distinctly observed a non-uniform thin amorphous layer (&lt;5 nm) on the surface of the TiO 2 nanoparticles. Therefore, it can be concluded that the formation of a lithium oxide layer on the surface of TiO 2 nanoparticles is one of the key factors responsible for deterioration of the device under high humidity.  Along with outstanding device performance, the durability of PSCs is another major factor for the commercialization of PSCs. We therefore investigated the long-term stability of BSO-based PSCs under dark storage, as well as under continuous illumination. First, devices were tested without any encapsulation in an ambient environment (25 C and $25% humidity). Figure  5A  shows a normalized PCE of the non-encapsulated FTO/ BSO/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au device as a function of storage time. The resulting device exhibits substantially excellent storage stability for 500 h, retaining almost 100% of the original PCE. Second, we performed a light stability test using two representative HTMs, i.e., Spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA, in a nitrogen-filled chamber at a constant temperature of $25 C under AM 1.5 G illumination using a xenon lamp. Figure  5B  displays the normalized PCE of the encapsulated FTO/BSO/(FAPbI 3 ) 0.93 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.07 (FAMA)/ Spiro-OMeTAD/Au device as a function of testing time under constant air mass (AM) 1.5 G illumination. The PCE of the BSO-based PSC degrades to 67% of its original value within the first 50 h, followed by retention over the next 450 h. Figure  5C  shows the normalized PCE of the encapsulated FTO/BSO/FAMA/PTAA/Au device as a function of testing time under constant AM 1.5 G illumination. The BSO-based PSCs using PTAA exhibit excellent photostability under light illumination, including UV without a drop in the PCE over 500 h, showing superior light stability to a Spiro-OMeTAD-based device. Based on these results, including successful elimination of the problems originating from the TiO 2 ETL, the n-type BSO ETL is a good candidate as an ETL for PSC commercialization. In conclusion, through systematic analyses, we demonstrated that a BSO ETL is an excellent alternative to TiO 2 for commercialization of PSCs. With the state-of-the-art PSC using mp-BSO ETL, we achieved a certified efficiency of 21.3% (reverse scan: 22%; and forward scan: 20.6%) with a stabilized efficiency of 21.7%. These values are comparable to those of the top-performing PSCs based on Li-doped TiO 2 and are the highest efficiencies among non-TiO 2 -based PSCs. By establishing a humid environment similar to that of an actual production line (i.e., high humidity over 40%), we have verified that the BSO ETL would be beneficial to the actual process because of its superior resistance to moisture relative to TiO 2 ETL. In addition, we confirmed that the mp-BSO-based PSCs exhibit superior long-term stability in a humid environment (25%-30% RH) and under light illumination, including UV. We believe that the introduction of mesoscopic BSO will enable a wide processing window in an actual production line, where it is difficult to remove moisture or control humidity, and it can move us a step closer to PSC commercialization. </text>

      <text> Organometal-halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as very promising next-generation solar cells owing to their low fabrication cost and remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 24%. With improving the PCE, stability issues have been raised for commercialization. Recently, much effort has been made to enhance the stability of the perovskite layer and the hole transporting layer, which has successfully improved the durability of the device. However, little research has been done on the humidity stability of the metaloxide layer, especially conventional Li-doped TiO 2 . This issue is very important because moisture cannot be perfectly excluded in an actual production line. Herein, we provide deeper understanding of the degradation mechanism for Li-doped TiO 2based PSC under a humid environment and propose a new metal-oxide (BaSnO 3 ) ETL to improve both device performance and processing stability under a humid environment. </text>

      <text> Figure 4 4 Figure4shows a schematic illustration of electron transport in typical bilayered devices employing mp-TiO 2 and mp-BSO as an ETL. As mentioned above, moisture in the air can induce Li x O on the TiO 2 surface by reacting with Li ions, regardless of the humidity level. In a low-humidity environment (Figure4A), even if Li x O is partially or very thinly formed on the TiO 2 surface, it does not have a significant effect on electron transport, thus maintaining excellent device performance. However, a high-humidity condition can promote the formation of Li x O on the TiO 2 surface, which can operate as a barrier layer for electron transport in TiO 2 (Figure4B). Such suppression of electron transport increases the resistance of the TiO 2 ETL, thereby deteriorating the device performance. Even with no additional doping of Li, BSO nanoparticles have intrinsic properties of high electron conductance and good chemical stability against moisture. Therefore, we could realize a highly efficient and stable PSC fabricated under a broad window of humidity (up to $40% RH) by incorporating BSO nanoparticles as an ETL in a typical bilayered architecture comprising an FA-based mixed perovskite and a mesoporous scaffold. </text>
