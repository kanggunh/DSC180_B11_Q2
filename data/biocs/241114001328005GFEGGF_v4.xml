      <text>Inorganic-organic hybrid lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received tremendous attention owing to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE),  [1] [2] [3] [4]  which exceeds that of thin film solar cells  [5]  such as CdTe and CIGS fabricated from expensive equipment. Initially, the rapid improvement in PCE was achieved by optimizing the device architecture, uniform thin film deposition process, and material composition of halide</text>

      <text>DOI: 10.1002/aenm.201902740 perovskites. Because perovskite is fabricated as a crystalline thin film by nucleation and growth that occurs as the solvent is evaporated from the precursor solution dissolved in the solvent,  [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]  there may be many defects at the grain boundary or on the thin film surface, which can potentially limit the performance.  [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17]  Thus, subsequent efficiency improvements have been made, which mainly involve defect passivation of the interface and surface of the perovskite layer using various agents such as small molecules, polymers, and alkylammonium halide. To commercialize solar cells, it is important to ensure long-term stability as well as high efficiency. However, PSCs based on 3D perovskites have high efficiency but suffer from low stability.  [18, 19]  On the other hand, there have been many reports that 2D PSCs exhibit much better environmental sustainability than 3D PSCs.  [20] [21] [22] [23]  However, mixed perovskites comprising 3D and 2D PSCs have been actively studied, because PSCs based solely on a 2D structure have relatively low efficiency.  [2, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37]  Several groups have attempted to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs by using a 3D/2D graded structure.  [2, 28, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] 37]  The main advantages of 2D on 3D are defect passivation on the surface of the perovskite and increase in hydrophobicity by alkylammonium cations constituting the 2D layer. PSCs have sandwiched structure with an n-type electron transport layer (ETL) and hole transport layer (HTL).  [38, 39]  Perovskite used as an absorber is close to neutral, but it is usually considered as slightly P-type.  [40] [41] [42]  Silicon solar cells have a PN junction structure. The charge depletion occurring at the PN junction separates hole and electron. Carriers that move by drift have higher mobility and lifetime than those moving by diffusion. In the case of PSCs, the ETL/perovskite/HTL junction is an NIP junction because perovskite behaves as an insulator with low intrinsic carrier concentration. Nevertheless, a high electric field is biased at the ETL/perovskite junction and a low electric field is biased at the HTL/perovskite junction. In this regard, the presence of a highly dielectric 2D layer between HTL and perovskite will affect the bilateral electric field, which can improve charge transport and suppress carrier Recently, two-dimensional (2D) structure on three-dimensional (3D) perovskites (graded 2D/3D) has been reported to be effective in significantly improving both efficiency and stability. However, the electrical properties of the 2D structure as a passivation layer on the 3D perovskite thin film and resistance to the penetration of moisture may vary depending on the length of the alkyl chain. In addition, the surface defects of the 2D itself on the 3D layer may also be affected by the correlation between the 2D structure and the hole conductive material. Therefore, systematic interfacial study with the alkyl chain length of long-chained alkylammonium iodide forming a 2D structure is necessary. Herein, the 2D interfacial layers formed are compared with butylammonium iodide (BAI), octylammonium iodide (OAI), and dodecylammonium iodide (DAI) iodide on a 3D (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 perovskite thin film in terms of the PCE and humidity stability. As the length of the alkyl chain increased from BA to OA to DA, the electron-blocking ability and humidity resistance increase significantly, but the difference between OA and DA is not large. The PSC post-treated with OAI has slightly higher PCE than those treated with BAI and DAI, achieving a certified stabilized efficiency of 22.9%. </text>

      <text> (2 of 8) recombination. Therefore, although defect passivation of the 3D surface depending on the alkyl type of the alkylammonium cation forming the 2D layer is expected to be similar, it is believed that there will be a change in the electric field through the change in electrical properties caused by the difference in the dipole moment. Eventually, the type of alkylammonium cation constituting the 2D layer on the 3D surface may lead to differences in humidity stability, charge separation and transport in addition to the defect passivation. In this study, power conversion efficiency (PCE) and humidity stability of the 3D perovskite [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MA PbBr 3 ) 0.05 ] post-treated with butylammonium iodide (BAI), octylammonium iodide (OAI), and dodecylammonium iodide (DAI) with alkylammonium of different chain lengths were compared. Moreover, the influence of the electrical properties of the 2D layer on the PCE of the 3D/2D bilateral structure was also compared by device simulation. As the length of the alkyl chain increased from BA to OA to DA, the difference in electron blocking and resistance to humidity increased significantly for BA and OA, but the corresponding difference in the case of DA was not large. The PSC post-treated with OAI showed slightly higher than those with BAI and DAI, achieving a certified stabilized efficiency of 22.9%. 3D perovskite thin films were deposited on a 150 nm thick nanostructured TiO 2 electrode (ns-TiO 2 ) by the solvent engineering process reported by us previously.  [39]  Post-treatment of the as-deposited perovskite layer was performed by pouring the solutions of BAI, OAI, and DAI in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) on the perovskite thin film, followed by heat treatment at 100 °C for 5 min. Figure  1a  shows the electron microscope image of the surface before and after the surface treatment. It can be seen that there is little change in the morphology of the surface even after post-treating the perovskite layer with BAI, OAI, and DAI. This suggests that the surface treatment in this study does not alter the surface morphology of the underlying perovskite or form a secondary phase with a new shape. Therefore, small amounts of BA, OA, and DA may be incorporated into the perovskite 3D structure. Figure  1b  shows the UV-vis absorbance, which demonstrates that the perovskite surface treatment does not change the optical properties of the perovskite except at the shoulder, where the absorbance increases in the region of ≈560 nm. As can be seen from the inset in Figure  1b , the absorbance of the shoulder is more clearly observed in the case of OAI or DAI than BAI. This means that the surface treatment causes the formation of 3D/2D mixture or a 3D/2D bilayer with new light absorption properties on top of or inside the perovskite layer. Organic ammonium cations with alkyl chain lengths longer than the ionic size that can be spatially coordinated with PbI 6 octahedrons, such as methylammonium (MA) or formamidinium (FA) cations, are well known to form 2D perovskite structures. In this regard, BA, OA, and DA will form a 2D perovskite structure, and it is clear that the absorption shoulders shown in the UV-vis spectra are related to this. Perovskite surface treatment with BA, OA, and DA was also studied by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), which confirmed the formation of 2D structures. In Figure  1c , the addition of BA, OA, and DA reveals a new diffraction spot in the inner circle of the GIWAXS, indicating the formation of an out-of-plane 2D structure at low angles, which appears clearer. Some of the already structured 3D perovskite can be easily converted into 2D by post-treatment of long alkylammonium, resulting in higher formation energy of the 2D structure than that of the 3D. In fact, there have been many reports that mixing a certain amount of long alkyl ammonium halides in a perovskite precursor solution easily creates a 3D/2D mixed hybrid structure.  [12] [13] [14]  Similarly, a quasi-2D structure expressed by the general formulae A′ 2 A n-1 B n X 3n+1 (〈n〉 = 1 to ∞) can also be formed.  [23, 43]  The 〈n〉 value represents the number of [BX 6 ] 4-octahedra layers stacked between two organic spacers; the thickness of the inorganic layers can be tuned by carefully adjusting the stoichiometric ratio of A′ and A organic cation in the precursor solution. In contrast, the amount of this 2D structure in the 3D/2D hybrid increases with the amount added, but adding more than the critical amount will cause the 3D perovskite to be oriented in a particular direction. In particular, it is interesting that the smallest amount that cause the 3D perovskite to be oriented depends on the type of alkylammonium added to the precursor solution. It is also known that the 2D perovskite is distributed mainly near the grain boundaries rather than being uniformly distributed in the perovskite films.  [14, 44, 45]  Figure  1d  shows the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images of perovskite post-treated with OA. The 2D structure on the surface of the perovskite shows the diffraction spots from the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) due to the crystalline phase, although the thickness of the 2D layer on 3D is thin that clear indexing is not easy. Thus, although both addition of alkylammonium halides to the precursor solution and post-treatment of the perovskite layers result in a 3D/2D mixed structure, only post-treatment results in an out-of-plane 2D structure. The presence of an out-of-plane 2D structure may be undesirable because the charge generated by the light transfers in a direction perpendicular to the perovskite film. However, it would be desirable if the 2D structure, which is chemically more stable than the 3D structure, exists parallel to the thin film to effectively block the penetration of external corrosion factors. The properties of the 2D structure present on the perovskite surface depend on the type of alkyl ammonium halide, which is expected to affect the performance and stability of the PSCs owing to the differences among BA, OA, and DA as spacers. As several studies have already reported, the post-treatment of long-alkylammonium halide on the perovskite layer reduces the charge recombination owing to the passivation effect of defects on the surface of the perovskite. In this work, we compared the passivation ability of different alkylammonium iodides by surveying the photoexcited charge dynamics using time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL).

      <text> (4 of 8) post-treatment with BAI, OAI, and DAI. Typically, the TRPL curves are analyzed by fitting the decay curves of the PL transients using the two exponential functions in Equation (  1 ) and then extracting the associated lifetimes  [2, 4, 11, 30, 32, 33, 36, 46]  = + τ τ - - y A e Ae t t 1 / 2 / 1 2 (1) where τ 1 and τ 2 represent fast and slow decay time constants and are associated with radiative recombination and trap-assisted nonradiative recombination. The long lifetime reflects the high quality of the perovskite film. The lifetimes due to nonradiative recombination in pristine perovskite and perovskites posttreated with BA, OA, and DA are 0.49, 0.92, 1.08, and 1.15 µs, respectively. As expected, the steady-state PL of the posttreated samples also shows a stronger PL intensity (Figure  S1 , Supporting Information). We found in the TRPL that the post-treatment of the pure perovskite layer resulted in a significant improvement in the carrier life, especially with longer alkyl lengths of alkylammonium iodide. This is consistent with the result that post-treatment with alkyl ammonium exceeding the size of the organic cations that make up the 3D perovskite effectively passivates the defects on the 3D surface, creating a 2D structure on the surface. The fact that the post-treatment of perovskite thin films with alkyl ammonium iodide increases carrier life owing to the reduction of defects is also supported by evaluating the space charge limit current (SCLC) region in the I-V measurements. The onset voltage for the trap-filled limit (V TFL ) of SCLC is linearly proportional to the density of the trap states. As shown in Figure  S2  (Supporting Information), the post-treatment of perovskite layers by alkylammonium iodides resulted in slight decrease in V TFL , which indicated a reduction in trap concentration. Thus, posttreatment of the perovskite thin films with alkylammonium iodides is expected to improve the efficiency of the device. Figure  2b  shows the I-V characteristics of devices fabricated by depositing a perovskite thin layer on a ns-TiO 2 ETL, followed by post-treatment with BAI, OAI, and DAI, and coating of the Au metal electrodes. The device with only Au metal electrodes without post-treatment of the perovskite thin layer with alkylammonium iodide works well, as we reported earlier, but it has very low efficiency.  [38]  On the other hand, when perovskite is post-treated with alkyl ammonium iodide, the efficiency of the device is greatly increased to 10.5, 13.4, and 15.1% for BAI, OAI, and DAI, respectively. In particular, it can be seen that the efficiency of the device post-treated with DA is almost three times higher than that (5.9%) of the pristine device. Interestingly, the value of the short-circuit current density (J sc ) is almost constant and the increase in efficiency is only caused by the simultaneous increase in the opencircuit voltage (V oc ) and fill factor (FF). The almost identical J sc indicates that the post-treatment of the perovskite layers by alkyl ammonium iodide has little effect on the extraction and transfer of charges generated by light absorption of the perovskite. This result suggests that 2D perovskites with a wider bandgap than the 3D perovskite have little interference in the hole transfer. More specifically, it can be considered that the 2D structure on the 3D perovskite surface (illustrated in Figure  1 ), obtained after post-treatment of the perovskite layer by alkylammonium iodide, functions as a barrier layer for electrons without disturbing the hole transport. In this respect, the electron-blocking properties of the 2D structure are believed to be more effective with regard to increasing the bandgap of the 2D structure along the length of the alkyl ammonium group. Considering the effective defect passivation observed in the PL testing and the electron-blocking ability, the post-treatment of alkyl ammonium iodide is expected to be most effective in the case of DA, which has relatively long alkyl chains. We compared the I-V characteristics of the full devices fabricated with N2,N2′,N7,N7′-tetrakis(9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-N2,N2′,N7,N7′-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9′-spirobi[fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetraamine) (DM)  [4]  as the HTL on top of the perovskite post-treated with BA, OA, and DA. As shown in Figure  2c  (the inset table), and Figure  S3  (Supporting Information), the PCE values obtained from the average J-V curves for the BA, OA, and DA-treated perovskites reveal that although the difference between the photovoltaic characteristics of the devices is very small, the device post-treated with OAI has the highest PCE. In terms of defect passivation and electron blocking, it is expected that the efficiency of the device will be the highest in the PSC post-treated with DAI, but it is very interesting that the highest efficiency is actually observed in the device treated with OAI. Indeed, the overall PCE is the sum of all the factors affecting the efficiency. To gain a better understanding of the microscopic effect of the 2D structures formed with BAI, OAI, and DAI on the overall performance, we investigated the recombination process electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measured at a bias of 0.9 V under dark condition. To properly interpret or analyze the impedance spectrum of the PSCs, the experimental data must be fitted using a suitable equivalent circuit model based on the continuity equation. However, there is yet to be an agreement on the exact equations governing PSCs owing to their complex electronic and ionic conductivities. The Nyquist (Z′-Z″) plots in Figure  2d  show a semicircle corresponding to a parallel RC circuit against frequency. At low frequencies, the impedance of the capacitor is infinite because the complex impedance of the capacitor C follows the relation ZC = -j/wC. At high frequencies, the capacitor acts as a short circuit, and Z is zero across the origin. At medium frequencies, the RC circuit has a maximum peak point, which generally corresponds to the time constant t during charging and discharging. Therefore, the radii of the impedance semicircle relate to the internal resistance for recombination rate of the PSC.  [10, 17, 47]  As shown in Figure  2d , the semicircle radii of the PSCs post-treated with BAI and OAI are significantly larger and then decreased in DAI. The behavior is consistent with the increase of carrier lifetime observed in TRPL and the V oc of PSCs post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI. Although the highest V oc occurs in the DAI-treated PSC, the corresponding PCE is not the highest, owing to a slight decrease in FF, which is 81.8% for OAI and 81.0% for DAI. This indicates that the internal resistance for recombination rate of the devices containing a HTL is the highest in the case of OAI, which means that the interface between 2D/HTL should be taken into account depending on the type of alkylammonium. Here, note that all devices are fabricated by the same process except for the alkylammonium iodide used in the process, and the interfacial resistance in the charge transfer dynamics of the PSCs is associated with the charge recombination resistance (R rec ). Accordingly, we deduce from time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) and EIS that perovskites post-treated with longer alkylammonium chain lengths have more effective defect passivation, but the interface between the 2D structure and the HTL also affects the charge transfer dynamics. As discussed previously, DA, which has alkyl groups longer than those of OA and BA, enhances the electron-blocking effect by increasing the bandgap of the 2D structure. However, it also increases the series resistance by increasing the distance between the 2D interlayers from the comparison of the series resistance from the high-frequency region (≈1 MHz) of the Nyquist plot, although the difference in values is very small. Furthermore, this may be due to the increasing mismatch of energy levels by 2D located between the 3D perovskite and the HTM, because longer alkyl chains in the alkylammonium iodide on the 3D perovskite resulted in lower HOMO levels, as can be seen from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information). Consequently, PSCs based on perovskite layers post-treated with the alkylammonium iodides have simultaneously higher shunt and series resistances, as the chain length of the alkyl group increases in addition to passivation of the surface defects. This may be related to the wider bandgap of the 2D phase produced by the post-treatment of alkyl ammonium iodide in comparison with the 3D phase; the longer the alkyl chain, the larger is the bandgap. It can be deduced from the above that the energy level of the 2D phase produced by posttreatment with alkylammonium iodide does not significantly interfere with hole transport or block electron leakage, but it can affect the efficiency of full devices containing an HTL. In addition to the changes in the energy levels, attention was paid to the effect of the changes in the dielectric properties of the 2D phase generated over the 3D phase along the length of the alkyl group.  [48] [49] [50]  The 2D structure formed with larger alkylammonium ions will have higher dielectric properties owing to the longer alkyl chain, as longer alkyl groups have higher partial charge and related dipole moments. We simulated the carrier movement using finite element analysis to understand the effect of the dielectric properties of the 2D structure present on top of the 3D structure on the efficiency. SILVACO ATLAS  [51]  was used as the simulation software. The parameters in Table  1  were used as the input data for the simulation. In addition, the lifetime due to Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination and the doping concentration of the HTL (Spiro-OMeTAD) were adjusted by using the V oc and FF of the PSC fabricated with pristine perovskite, and then used for the simulation of PSCs post-treated with alkylammonium iodide. Figure  3a  shows the change in the recombination rate with increasing electron density at perovskite/HTL interface. The x-axis was set according to the thickness of the device. The interface between the ETL and perovskite of the studied device was close to 0.05 µm and the interface between perovskite and HTL was close to 0.4 µm. The red line representing the highest recombination rate corresponds to the negative charge density of 3 × 10 9 cm -2 at the interface. The values toward the bottom are the result of the recombination rate when the electron density is 3 × 10 11 and 3 × 10 12 cm -2 . The more the electrons donated from the 2D layer, the lower is the recombination rate. Perovskite being an insulator, the charge carriers can move out of the constraint of an atom when they receive energy from the outside. Carriers excited by the absorption of light travel by the mechanism of diffusion or drift. At the band-bending ETL/ perovskite interface, electrons move rapidly due to differences in the energy levels as well as diffusion and drift (in addition to diffusion and drift, band bending causes the movement of electrons to move quickly at the ETL/perovskite interface). In a real device, the effect of drift will decrease as the carrier moves away from the ETL/perovskite junction, whereas the diffusion caused by the carrier density difference will increase. In particular, as the dielectric constant of the 2D structure on the 3D structure is increased, the electron density increases, and the diffusion in the ETL direction is more active. At the red line (Figure  3a ), most of the electrons in the HTL interface will recombine without spreading fast enough.  [57]  On the other hand, the recombination rate at the interface decreases when sufficient electrons are supplied to the 2D perovskite. In turn, the overall recombination is reduced if the difference in the electron density increases across the device depths. The resulting J sc , V oc , FF, and final PCE are shown in Figure  3b, c . As can be seen in Figure  3b , J sc showed a slight increase by electron donation, but there was no significant change in its value. As expected from the reduction in the recombination rate, both V oc and FF significantly increased (Figure  3c ). Note that we only assumed an increase in the negative charge density of the interface without considering the increase in the series resistance by the 2D layer because the physical properties of the 2D structure formed with BA, OA, and DA are not yet understood clearly. In this simulation, we believe that if the 2D layer over the 3D layer functions as an electron donor, the FF can be maintained even if the series resistance by the 2D layer increases slightly; this can be used as a strategy for achieving higher FF in the future. Although longer alkyl groups in alkyl ammonium cations act as electron donors to increase the negative charge density, the difference in V oc and FF obtained in the simulation is only possible at high dielectric constants of the 2D/3D layers. In other words, materials with low dielectric properties are not expected to reduce the Electron/hole mobility [cm 2 V -1 s -1 ] 0.02 11.8/12.5  [53] [54] [55]  0.0002 SRH lifetime, τ e = τ h [s] 6 × 10 -10 6.5 × 10 -7  [56, 57]  6.5 × 10 -7 Auger recombination coefficient [cm 6 s -1 ] 0 8.8 × 10 -30  [56, 57]  0 1902740 (6 of 8) recombination even if sufficient carriers are supplied at the interface. To obtain accurate boundary conditions, the relative electrical permittivity of the present perovskite was measured by EIS. As shown in Figure  S5  (Supporting Information), the relative dielectric constant has a value of ≈70 in the range of 100-10 000 Hz, and becomes large at low frequencies.  [58]  This is consistent with the reported results. Therefore, it is expected that the dielectric properties of the alkyl group constituting the 2D layer sensitively affect the efficiency of the device under the DC condition in which the solar cell operates. Figure  3d  shows the I-V curves measured in the reverse and forward modes for one of the best-performing devices fabricated by post-treatment with OAI on perovskite thin film. The PCE is 23.3% with short-circuit current (J sc ) of 24.99 mA cm -2 and V oc of 1.13 V, and the FF is 82.75% in the reverse mode. The equivalent values in the forward mode are efficiency of 22.04% with J sc of 24.87 mA cm -2 and V oc of 1.10 V, and 80.77% FF. As is well known, the two measurement modes have a difference in efficiency, called hysteresis, which is mainly caused by the difference between V oc and FF rather than J sc . Recently, the stabilized method, that is, ≈10-point IV sweep configuration, wherein the bias voltage is held constant until the measured current attains a constant value, has been applied for determining the efficiency with higher accuracy. Thus, one of the efficient devices was certified by an accredited testing laboratory (Newport Corporation Technology and Application Center Photovoltaic Lab). As shown in Figure  S6  (Supporting Information), the efficiency under full sun was 22.91%, which is more close to the value measured in the reverse mode. Finally, the stability of the PSCs under humid conditions was investigated. In our experiments, all PSCs without encapsulation were stored in a humidity control box at room temperature (RT) with 85% relative humidity (RH), and 65 °C with 65% RH. The humidity resistance of perovskite thin films post-treated with different lengths of alkyl ammonium halides can be highly dependent on the length of the alkyl chain. Indeed, the comparison of hydrophobicity of the surface of perovskite post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI shows an increase in hydrophobicity owing to the increase in the length of the alkyl chain, as shown in Figure  S7  (Supporting Information). The surface of the pristine perovskite has a contact angle of 52.91°. On the other hand, the surfaces post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI have contact angles of 56.25°, 61. 5°, and 85.78°, respectively; in particular, the surface treated with DAI exhibits a very high contact angle. Therefore, the humidity stability of devices fabricated with perovskite post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI is expected to show a large difference depending on the length of the alkyl chain. To more accurately understand the dependence of the resistance to moisture on the length of the alkyl chain, the change in PL over time at 65 °C under 65% relative humidity was monitored after post-treating with alkylammonium iodide perovskites deposited on ns-TiO 2 electrode. As expected, it can be seen that with increase in time under the test conditions, the difference in the PL intensity, which was initially small, becomes larger. As shown in Figure  4a , the PL intensities of the perovskite thin films post-treated with BA, OA, and DA are different. Therefore, the PL intensity measured for each thin film was compared with the normalized value. This is consistent with the tendency of increasing hydrophobicity with increasing  chain length of the alkyl ammonium used in post-treatment of the perovskite, which indicates that long alkyl chains are effective in protecting the perovskite. Figure  4b  shows the change in efficiency measured with 100 h of exposure at 65 °C under 65% humidity for devices fabricated with perovskite layers posttreated with BAI, OAI, and DAI. The efficiencies of pristine and BAI-treated perovskite drop to ≈20% of the initial efficiency after 100 h of exposure under the experimental condition; therefore, BA has very low humidity resistance. On the other hand, perovskite devices treated with OAI and DAI showed no significant degradation; especially, DAI maintained 80% of its initial efficiency without encapsulation. At low temperatures under high humidity (Figure  4c ), the degradation behavior along the alkyl chain length is the same, even at 85% relative humidity, and the device post-treated with DAI maintains more than 90% of its initial efficiency after 100 h of exposure. Interestingly, as shown in Figure  4d , the full devices, including organic HTL, which can act as an additional protective layer against moisture, show more severe degradation at 25 °C temperature and 85% humidity. This may be due to the effect of hygroscopic additives such as tert-butylpyridine and Li-salt added to increase the hole conductivity of DM used as the HTL. Therefore, considering the long-term stability of PSCs, especially humidity stability, it is very important that the alkyl group of alkyl ammonium and the HTL should be selected such that they do not significantly impair the efficiency. In summary, we investigated the PCE and humidity stability of PSCs fabricated from 3D perovskite post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI. The performance of the PSCs was compared by device simulation by considering the electrical properties of the 2D layer in the 3D/2D bilateral structure. The electron-blocking ability and moisture resistance increased with increasing length of the alkyl chain, but the highest PCE was obtained in the OAI-treated PSC, which showed a certified stabilized efficiency of 22.9%. 1:1 molar ratio of synthesized MABr and PbBr 2 (Aldrich) in 6 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF).

The resulting solution was coated onto the ns-TiO 2 layer by a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1,000 and 5,000 rpm for 10 and 20 s, respectively. During the second step, the substrate was treated with drop casting of diethyl ether. The substrate was dried on a hot plate at 150 ℃ for 10 min and then at 100 ℃ for 10 min to produce (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 mixed halide perovskite thin film. The heat-treated film was coated with 3 mg/1 mL OAI (BAI, DAI)/IPA (11.7 mM) solution. OAI (BAI, DAI) solution (100 µL) was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 5,000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 100 ℃ for 5 min to remove any residual solvent. The annealed film was dried at RT in a vacuum oven for 24 h. The dried film was spin-coated by HTM/chlorobenzene (28.6 mg/1 mL) solution with additives of 20 µL of pure tBP, and 20 µL of Li       Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1. a) Surface scanning electron microscope images of control, and perovskite post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI (scale bars: 1 µm). b) UV-vis absorption spectra of perovskite layers post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI. c) GIWAXS images of perovskite layers post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI. d) Cross-section TEM image of perovskite layer post-treated with OAI.
