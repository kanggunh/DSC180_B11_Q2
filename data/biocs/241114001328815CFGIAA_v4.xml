      <text>The inorganic metal oxides (IMOs), including titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) and tin dioxide (SnO 2 ), inevitably induce decomposition of perovskite under UV illumination owing to their photocatalytic activity, and the use of a UV filter will add extra cost and reduce the effective power output. Here, we first reveal that the weak Pb-I bond in I-based perovskite is prone to breakage under UV photocatalysis, leading to serious degradation of the SnO 2 /perovskite interface. We introduced a chlorine-rich mixed-halide perovskite interlayer (ClMPI), which possesses an excellent tolerance to photocatalysis owing to the strong Pb-Cl bond, between the SnO 2 and I-based perovskite. The ClMPI-based device achieves an enhanced efficiency of up to 21.01% (certified 20.17%). Most importantly, the resultant devices can maintain &gt;94% of their initial performance after 180 h under outdoor solar irradiation, &gt;80% after 500 h under UV irradiation, and 500 h under continuous full spectrum illumination at their maximum power points.</text>

      <text>INTRODUCTION Organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites have attracted extensive attention as solution-processed and lowcost photovoltaic materials owing to their excellent properties, such as strong light absorption, high charge carrier mobility, long intrinsic carrier lifetime, and low-temperature processability  (Kojima et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2014; Bi et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2019) . The highest certification efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been achieved up to 25.2% (National Renewable Energy  Laboratory, n.d.) , which can keep up with that of present commercial solar cells, such as silicon solar panels, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS). Unfortunately, the device stability is still far from industrial standards, which generally require that the solar cell can deliver greater than 25 years of outdoor operation  (Wang et al., 2017b) . The elements in organic-inorganic halide perovskite materials, such as halogen (I, Br, Cl), methylammonium (MA + ), and Pb 2+ , are mostly mobile, polarized, and unstable  (Wang et al., 2019) ; thus the PSCs are vulnerable under various aging stresses such as oxygen  (Aristidou et al., 2015; Pearson et al., 2016) , moisture  (Pearson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017c; Xie et al., 2016) , and high temperature  (Misra et al., 2015) . By encapsulation, the device lifetime can be prolonged by excluding most of these external environmental factors  (Han et al., 2015) . At present, the inorganic metal oxides (IMOs), including titanium dioxide (TiO 2 )  (Yang et al., 2017; Jeon et al., 2018)  and tin dioxide (SnO 2 )  (Jiang et al., 2017a; Turren-Cruz et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2019) , are generally used as electron transport layers (ETLs) in the conventional device architecture PSCs to achieve high performance and stability. However, the PSCs stability suffers accelerating degradation owing to the wellknown intrinsic photocatalysis of IMOs under the exposure of UV light  (Leijtens et al., 2013; Ito et al., 2014) . Such instability cannot be avoided during device operation, even if they are well encapsulated. Previous reports have shown that the degradation is most prone to occur at the interface between IMOs and perovskite  (Lira-Cantu Â´, 2017; Li et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2019) . For example, the MAPbI 3 layer can be decomposed to PbI 2 with losing CH 3 NH 2 and HI at the TiO 2 /MAPbI 3 interface  (Ito et al., 2014) . To eliminate the UV effect, various methods have been reported to improve the photo-stability, such as inserting an interfacial layers  (Ito et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016a Zhang et al., , 2016b)) , using inferior UV photocatalysis materials as ETLs  (Luo et al., 2017; Shin et al., 2017) , and introducing a down-converting layer  (Bella et al., 2016; Q. Wang et al., 2017; S. H. Wang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017d) . It is worthy to note that most of the reported top-level photo-stability of PSCs is always carried out by completely eliminating the UV light using a UV filter or adopting a white LED illumination light without UV range  (Jeon et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2017) . These additional processes either damage the device performance or increase the cost, which hinders the commercialization of PSCs  (Leijtens et al., 2013) . Thus, improving the intrinsic stability of perovskite active layer against UV photocatalysis is an essential approach to achieve low-cost and photo-stable PSCs. Here, we first demonstrate that the serious degradation of I-based perovskite under UV photocatalysis is mainly caused by the breakage of weak Pb-I bonds, whereas the Cl-based perovskite possesses the best tolerance for the photocatalysis compared with the Br-based and I-based perovskite owing to the strong Pb-Cl bonds. We introduced a chlorine-rich mixed-halide perovskite (MAPbI X Cl 3-X ) interlayer (ClMPI) between the SnO 2 and I-based perovskite layer through halide exchange to improve the interfacial contact and protect the I-based perovskite layer from damage by the SnO 2 photocatalysis. Such ClMPI could largely mitigate the interfacial recombination, and thus our device achieves an enhanced efficiency of up to 21.01% (certified 20.17%) with reduced hysteresis phenomenon. More importantly, without using any UV filter, the ClMPI-based PSCs show greatly enhanced photo-stability compared with the control ones under different conditions, including outdoor solar irradiation, high-intensity UV irradiation, and 1-sun full spectrum illumination (including UV light). Our work reveals the intrinsic mechanism for the performance degradation in I-based PSCs under UV photocatalysis and provides a fundamental approach for achieving UV-filter-free, photostable, and low-cost PSCs. </text>

      <text> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In this work, the planar N-I-P PSCs with a structure of ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au were adopted; the SnO 2 was used as an ETL owing to its high electron mobility, wide band gap, and low-temperature preparation  (Xie et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017a; Baena et al., 2015) . Although the SnO 2 is considered as a material with less photocatalytic activity compared with conventional TiO 2 , it indeed seriously degrades the perovskite under the UV illumination (see later discussion)  (Roose et al., 2016) . To investigate the tolerance of perovskite for photocatalysis generated by SnO 2 , we grew three types of high-quality perovskite single crystals, including MAPbI 3 , MAPbBr 3 , and MAPbCl 3 , as shown in Figure  1A . After grinding the perovskite single crystals into powder, we uniformly mixed these powder and SnO 2 nanoparticles with a molar ratio of 1:1 together and then exposed these mixtures to continuous UV illumination for several days. All the operations were carried out in a N 2 glove box, ruling out the effects of moisture and O 2 . As shown in Figure  1A , the MAPbI 3 :SnO 2 mixtures gradually turned from black to yellow in 48 h and finally became gray within 120 h, whereas the bare perovskite powder remained black at the same condition (Figure  S1 ). It illustrates that SnO 2 indeed induces the accelerated degradation of MAPbI 3 under UV illumination. In comparison, the MAPbBr 3 :SnO 2 mixtures remained red with little gray products and the MAPbCl 3 :SnO 2 mixtures showed no obvious change at the same UV illumination time. The components of these samples were traced by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, as shown in Figures 1B-1D and S2. In the MAP-bI 3 :SnO 2 case, the perovskite peak was largely reduced and a strong PbI 2 (12.7 ) characteristic peak appeared in the spectrum after 120 h UV illumination, whereas there was no PbI 2 peak in the case of pure MAPbI 3 (Figure  S2 )  (Jo et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016a Zhang et al., , 2016b)) . In comparison, the MAPbBr 3 :SnO 2 showed a weak PbBr 2 characteristic peak after 72 h UV exposure and it further increased after 120 h aging (Figures  1C  and S2 ), whereas the PbCl 2 characteristic peak appeared until UV aging for 120 h (Figures  1D  and S2 ). Furthermore, we performed the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis to elucidate the effect of photocatalysis for the stability of different type perovskite. As shown in Figure  S3 , the binding energy (BE) at around 142.8 and 137.9 eV is assigned to 4f 5/2 , 4f 7/2 of divalent Pb 2+ , respectively, and another two peaks at around 141.3 and 136.4 eV are associated with metallic Pb 0  (Wang et al., 2019; Raga et al., 2015) . It was observed that the Pb 0 peak in MAPbI 3 :SnO 2 case increased much faster than those in MAPbBr 3 :SnO 2 and MAPbCl 3 :SnO 2 cases. We calculated the intensity ratio of DPb 0 /Pb sum (Pb sum = Pb 0 + Pb 2+ ) for three mixture samples based on different type perovskite after exposure to 0, 24, 48, 72, and 120 h UV illumination, as shown in Figure  1E . The DPb 0 /Pb sum in the MAPbI 3 /SnO 2 showed a rapid increase and reached 5.42% after exposure to 120 h UV illumination. The gray one we observed corresponds to the color of Pb metal as a decomposition product of MAPbI 3 . At the same condition, the DPb 0 /Pb sum in MAPbBr 3 /SnO 2 and MAPbCl 3 /SnO 2 reached 2.86% and 0.98%, respectively. Based on these findings, we propose the degradation procedure of MAPbI 3 under SnO 2 photocatalysis expressed as the following:  1 ) CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 / CH 3 NH 3 I + PbI 2 (Equation PbI 2 / Pb 0 + I 2 (Equation 2) In the first stage of degradation (Equation  1 ), the moderate PbI 2 product might not be harmful for the stability and efficiency of solar cells. Instead, many reports show that excess PbI 2 at the grain boundary or ETL/perovskite interface can be beneficial to the PSCs performance  (Jiang et al., 2017b; Matsui et al., 2017; Jacobsson et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2019) . However, as the decomposed products of PbI 2 , both Pb 0 and I 2 severely degrade the performance of PSCs, as well as their long-term photo-stability  (Wang et al., 2017a (Wang et al., , 2019;; Adinolfi et al., 2016) . As the decomposed product of MAPbI 3 , PbI 2 is thermodynamically stable since it has a negative standard molar Gibbs formation energy (D f G Éµ ) of Ã173.6 kJ/mol  (Macdonald and Lide, 2003) , as shown in Figure  1F . However, actually, the PbI 2 can be decomposed through interfacial redox reactions of electron-hole pairs, which are generated upon band gap excitation when SnO 2 is exposed to UV light. The schematic diagram of a possible reaction process is shown in Figure  1F . Owing to the stronger bond strength of Pb-Cl (301 kJ/mol) and Pb-Br (248 kJ/mol) than that of Pb-I (194 kJ/mol)  (Luo, 2017) , the D f G Éµ of PbCl 2 and PbBr 2 are Ã314.1 and Ã261.9 kJ/mol  (Macdonald and Lide, 2003) , respectively, both much more negative than that of PbI 2 (Ã173.6 kJ/mol). The standard redox potentials of the decomposition reactions of PbI 2 , PbBr 2 , and PbCl 2 are Ã1.8, Ã2.7, and Ã3.3 V, respectively, according to the Nernst equation  (Rubi and Kjelstrup, 2003) . It means that much bigger thermodynamic barriers need to be overcome for decomposing the PbCl 2 compared with PbBr 2 and PbI 2 . Thus, we systematically studied the tolerance of PbX 2 (I, Br, Cl) for photocatalysis and the operations were similar to the pervious MAPbX 3 :SnO 2 cases (Figure  S4 ). As shown in Figure  1G , it was observed that the Pb 0 peak in the PbI 2 :SnO 2 case was more notable than those in the PbBr 2 :SnO 2 and PbCl 2 :SnO 2 cases after UV illumination. Furthermore, combining the color change and XRD measurements of the samples, we confirmed that the PbCl 2 is much more stable than PbBr 2 and PbI 2 under photocatalysis, which is consistent with the thermodynamic analysis (Figures  S4  and S5 ). The above-mentioned results illustrate that the strong Pb-Cl bond leads to the suppression of the decomposition of MAPbCl 3 and PbCl 2 under SnO 2 photocatalysis. DG Éµ = ÃnFE Éµ (DG Éµ = ÃD f G Éµ ) Although the MAPbCl 3 shows the best tolerance for the photocatalysis, it is not suitable to be used as a light absorption layer for the efficient PSCs owing to its broad band gap. Then, we devised a means to achieve efficient and UV-stable I-based PSC through preparing a ClMPI between the MAPbI 3 and SnO 2 against the photocatalysis. The procedure includes two steps: (1) the preparation of a uniform NH 4 Cl film on the SnO 2 through precipitation and (2) the formation of a ClMPI at the MAPbI 3 /SnO 2 interface through halide exchange between MAPbI 3 and NH 4 Cl, as shown in Figure  2A . We give the detailed process as following. First, we added a small amount of ammonium hydroxide (NH 4 OH) into SnCl 2 precursor solution and then spin coated the prepared precursor on the ITO substrate. After treating the films at a temperature of 180 C in air, it is expected that the NH 4 Cl can be separated out during the annealing and homogeneously distributed on the surface of the SnO 2 . The NH 4 Cl can be generated according to reaction (3):  3 ) 2SnCl 2 + 4NH 4 OH = 4NH 4 Cl + SnO 2 + 2H 2 O (Equation From the surface top view atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Figure  2B ), we found that the modified SnO 2 (M-SnO 2 ) surface was covered by a uniform NH 4 Cl layer. Thus, the root-mean-square roughness of the M-SnO 2 surface is 3.3 nm, which is much smaller than that of bare SnO 2 (26.1 nm). As shown in Figure  2C , it was found that a spectral peak of N 1s appears at around 401.8 eV for the M-SnO 2 film, whereas the peak of N 1s is lacked for the bare SnO 2 film. The strong spectral peaks of Cl 2p can be also found in the M-SnO 2 film, whereas a very weak signal of Cl 2p that appeared in the bare SnO 2 film might be due to the incomplete oxidation of SnCl 2 (Figure  2D ). Figure  S6  gives the surface top view EDS mappings of the M-SnO 2 , showing that the NH 4 Cl was uniformly distributed on the surface of M-SnO 2 . To clarify the existence of NH 4 Cl, Raman spectra of pure NH 4 Cl, SnO 2 , M-SnO 2 films were conducted. As shown in Figure  2E , the sharpest peak at around 3,051 cm Ã1 corresponding to the characteristic peak of ammonium chloride can be observed in the M-SnO 2 but cannot be found in the bare SnO 2 . Furthermore, another Raman spectra measurement shows that the NH 4 Cl on the surface of SnO 2 can be well retained after treatment by the DMF/DMSO mixed solvent (Figure  2E ). The MAPbI 3 film was deposited on the M-SnO 2 surface through spin coating and then annealed at 100 C for 10 min. During the annealing, it is expected that the ClMPI will be formed through halide exchange between MAPbI 3 and NH 4 Cl, which can be described as:  4 ) MAPbI 3 + 3NH 4 Cl / MAPbCl 3 + 3NH 4 I (Equation However, as shown in Figure  2F , it is hard to detect the MAPbCl 3 phase by XRD measurement in ClMPIbased sample mostly because of the trace amounts of Cl and the weakened signal by the thick MAPbI 3 films. Thus, we spin-coated the diluted perovskite solution on a thicker NH 4 Cl film; after annealing, an obvious peak at around 15.6 corresponding to MAPbCl 3 perovskite (100) appeared in the XRD spectra (Figure  S7 ) of perovskite film (for detailed information see the experimental section). In a double-checked test, we mixed the single-crystal MAPbI 3 and NH 4 Cl powder uniformly and then treated the mixtures at 100 C for 1 h in inert atmosphere. The color of the MAPbI 3 /NH 4 Cl mixture turned from black to a bit gray after annealing, whereas the color of bare MAPbI 3 showed no obvious change under the same conditions, as shown in Figure  S8 . The XRD results show that the diffraction peaks at 15.6 ascribed to the MAPbCl 3 perovskite also appeared after annealing, confirming that the halide exchange between MAPbI 3 and NH 4 Cl indeed exists (Figure  S9 ). To investigate the distribution of ClMPI in the device, we performed time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) to probe the chemical composition throughout the ITO/M-SnO 2 /perovskite film, as shown in Figure  2G . The result shows that the Cl is mainly accumulated at the perovskite/SnO 2 interface in ClMPI-based sample. In addition, the distribution of I and Cl at the SnO 2 side indicates that the ClMPI could be considered a mixed component of MAPbI X Cl 3-X (X = 0-3); we suggest that the concentration of Cl will gradually decrease from the SnO 2 surface toward the MAPbI 3 active layer. As shown in Figures  2F  and S10 , the ClMPI perovskite film achieves an enhanced crystal quality and increased grain size, which will be beneficial to improve the performance of the device. It could be related to the facilitation effect of the trace amounts of product NH 4 I on perovskite crystallization, which can be supported by previous reports  (Si et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018) .  </text>

      <text> Performance of Devices The cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the optimized device is displayed in Figure  3A , which determined the thickness of $500 nm for the ClMPI-based perovskite layer. Although it is hard to distinguish the ClMPI in SEM, its thickness can be estimated at 10 nm according to the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of Sn_O 2Ã and Cl Ã in ToF-SIMS (Figure  2G ) and the thickness of SnO 2 (around 25 nm, Figure  3A ). We systematically optimized the processing parameters for the ClMPI-based devices, and the best photovoltaic performance was attained with a molar ratio of 1:4 for NH 4 OH:SnCl 2, as shown in Figure  S11 . Figure  3B  gives the J-V curves of the champion devices with and without ClMPI. It can be found that overall photovoltaic parameters have been improved for the ClMPI-based devices and the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices increases from 18.08% to 21.01%, with obvious reduction of hysteresis. This is consistent with a rapid increase in stabilized power efficiency to a value of 20.9%, compared with a slower increase to 18% for the control one (Figure  3C  and Table  1 ). As presented in Figure  3D , the histogram with GaussAmp fitting of over 20 devices exhibits an average PCE of 20.2% for the ClMPI-based devices compared with 16.45% for the control devices. The integrated current densities extracted from the typical EQE spectra of ClMPI-based and control devices (Figure  S12 ) are 21.15 and 22.35 mA.cm Ã2 , respectively, which are closed to the measured values. To verify our device efficiency measurements, we sent one of our unsealed devices to the National Institute of Metrology, China, for independent certification and obtained a PCE of 20.17% (V OC = 1.13 V, J SC = 23.2 mA cm Ã2 , and FF = 77%), as shown in Figure  S13 . The perovskite layer based on M-SnO 2 exhibits stronger photoluminescence (PL) quenching and faster time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) compared with that based on SnO 2 , indicating the better charge extraction from perovskite to ETLs (Figure  S14  and Table  S1 ). In addition, the lower R S in the ClMPI device also indicates better charge transfer through the ClMPI layer under operation conditions and accounts for the enhanced fill factor, as shown in Figure  S15 . We attribute the better charge extraction at interface to the improved crystal quality and higher carrier concentration of M-SnO 2 (Figures  S16  and S17 ), which are beneficial to the improvement of conductivity. Previous reports demonstrated that the weak alkaline solution is more favorable to the crystallization of SnO 2  (Hiratsuka et al., 1990; Jin et al., 2015; Lupan et al., 2009) . The band alignment between M-SnO 2 (or SnO 2 ) and ClMPI-based perovskite (or perovskite) was determined from UV photoelectron spectroscopy and absorption measurements (Figures  S18  and S19 ). The better match in conduction band between M-SnO 2 and perovskite allowed larger quasi-Fermi level splitting, which is helpful to improve the V OC of the device (Figure  S20 ). The trap density (n t ) is evaluated through space-charge-limited current measurement based on a device structure of ITO/SnO 2 /MAPbI 3 or ClMPIbased MAPbI 3 /PCBM/Ag. As shown in Figure  3E , it can be attained that n t decreases from 3.98310 15 to 3.29310 15 cm Ã3 after the introduction of ClMPI according to Equation S1. Figure  3F  gives the Mott-Schottky plots 1/C 2 versus voltage attained by EIS measurements for the control and ClMPI-based device. By fitting the voltage dependence of the 1/C 2 curves, we found that the slope of the ClMPI-based device is larger than that of the control device, indicating the reduced interfacial charge density. In addition, these details also demonstrate the higher flat-band potential of the ClMPI-based device compared with the control device, which is related to an improvement in V OC . Owing to the easy breakage of weak Pb-I bond at interface, the undercoordinated Pb and I vacancies will generate in perovskite materials during the device preparation and aging process  (Wang et al., 2019) . Encouragingly, in the ClMPI device, Cl at the interface can result in a stronger binding at the SnO 2 /perovskite interface for PbCl 2 -terminated perovskite. Thus, we attribute the improved interface contact (or reduced interface defects) at SnO 2 /perovskite to the introduction of ClMPI, which possesses a strong Pb-Cl bond and results in the suppression of formation of defects. </text>

      <text> Photo-Stability Test To explore the effect of UV filters on the efficiency, we give the J-V of an efficient ClMPI-based device before and after using a UV filter, as shown in Figure  4A . The results show that the PCE is reduced from 20.03% to 16.01% mainly owing to the serious decrease of J SC (from 23.23 to 19.02 mA/cm 2 ). It can be confirmed by the stabilized power efficiency of 19.88% for the device without eliminating UV, compared with just 16.26% when a 420-nm UV filter is added, showing around 20% efficiency loss (Figure  4B ). The image in the inset is the transmittances of ITO/M-SnO 2 with and without a UV filter, showing that the UV filter not only absorbs all the light of UV region (&lt;420 nm), but also leads to $10% transmittances loss of visible light from 420 nm to 800 nm. These results show that the application of UV filter not only increases the additional cost, but also seriously reduces the effective output when the device is in operation. We tested the devices stabilities under different conditions without using any UV filter. The first test was designed to verify the stability of the devices under real outdoor atmospheric conditions, where the UV light was really encountered. It is known that UV radiation is present in sunlight and contributes about 3% of the total light output of the Sun at ground level. Several encapsulated devices (to exclude the damage of moisture and oxygen) were exposed on the roof of our laboratory building in Zhejiang University, Hangzhou city, China. These PSCs were subjected to sunlight without UV filters; we provided the statistics of solar irradiation hours during 2 months from November to December 2018, and the stabilities of devices are shown in Figure  4C . The ClMPI-based devices remarkably retained 94% of their initial PCE after 180 h. However, the control device was almost completely degraded within 168 h. In the second test, we exposed the control and ClMPI-based devices to 365-nm UV light with a high power of 100 mW/cm 2 for 500 h (Figure  4D ). The results show that the PCE of the control device showed a constant drop during the UV-induced aging test and reduced to &lt;10% of its original value within 100 h. Encouragingly, the ClMPI-based device still retained over 82% of the original highest value after 500 h. In actual applications, the PSCs should continuously be operated at their maximum power point (MPP) for a long time. Thus, in our last test, the unencapsulated device stability was measured under AM1.5 G Sun illumination at MPP tracking in a N 2 glove box (Figure  4E ). Here, we confirm that our simulator of solar  To better exhibit the effect of UV light on the stability of PSCs, a 420-nm UV filter was used within the initial 200 h illumination (the first test stage) and then we removed the UV filter in the next 500 h illumination (the second test stage). We found that the control and ClMPI-based devices had a similar stability in the first test stage: the control and ClMPI-based device can maintain 90% and 95% of their initial photovoltaic performances, respectively. Such stabilities can be comparable with those of previous works under UVfree test condition  (Turren-Cruz et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2017; Jung et al., 2019) . However, after removing the UV filter, the stability of the control device showed a rapid drop and the PCE decreases to &lt;50% of its original value within only 10 h. In comparison, the ClMPI-based device can maintain &gt;90% of the original PCE after 200 h continuous 1-sun illumination and &gt;80% after 500 h. By calculation, the SPO t 80 lifetime of the ClMPI-based device was 500 h, showing two orders of magnitude improvement compared with the control devices with an SPO t 80 lifetime of only 4 h. The resultant stability of our devices is among the best results reported so far in IMOs-based PSCs under similar test conditions (without a UV filter)  (Bai et al., 2019; Shin et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017c; Li et al., 2018) . We measured the elements distribution of the aged ClMPI device by ToF-SIMS (Figure  S22 ), confirming that the ClMPI still presented. In addition, we directly compared the stability of the control device using a UV filter with that of ClMPI device without UV filter (Figure  S23 ). The ClMPI and control devices showed near linear loss of PCE with relative Ã0.31% per 10 h and Ã0.29% per 10 h, respectively, illustrating that our strategy can prevent the PSCs degradation well under UV light. </text>

      <text> Conclusion In summary, we reveal that the weak Pb-I bond in I-based perovskite is prone to breakage under photocatalysis, leading to serious degradation of the SnO 2 /perovskite interface. It has been demonstrated that the chlorine-based perovskite possesses the best tolerance for photocatalysis compared with the brominebased and iodine-based perovskite owing to the strong Pb-Cl bond. We introduced a ClMPI between the SnO 2 and I-based perovskite, which not only improved the interface contact but also protected the I-based perovskite light absorption layer from damage by photocatalysis. As a result, the device with an enhanced PCE of up to 21.01% (certified 20.17%) with reduced hysteresis phenomenon is achieved. Most importantly, the ClMPI-based device shows enormous enhancement for the photo-stability compared with the control one under different conditions, including outdoor solar irradiation, high-intensity UV irradiation, and 1-sun full spectrum illumination (including UV light). Our work provides a simple and effective method for achieving UV-filter-free, efficient, and photo-stable PSCs. </text>

      <text> Limitations of the Study In this study, we proposed the degradation procedure of MAPbI 3 under SnO 2 photocatalysis, as expressed in Equations 1 and 2. However, we did not detect the MAI phase through XRD measurements. We are not sure whether the MAI will be decomposed further. More studies are needed to reveal the exact final product of MAPbI 3 under photocatalysis. </text>
