      <text>Organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have a great potential for commercialization owing to their low cost and superior performance.  [1]  Over the past decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has increased from 3.8%  [2]  to 25.2%,  [3]  approaching the record efficiency of 26.7% of crystalline silicon solar cells,  [4]  and becoming one of the most promising candidates for the nextgeneration efficient and low-cost photovoltaic devices.  [5]  For example, Seok and co-workers introduced additional iodide intoprecursor solutions, resulting in a certified PCE of 22.1%.  [6]  Recently, Kim et al. investigated the effects of methylammonium chloride (MACl) on the performance of perovskite films and fabricated a device that achieved a certified PCE of 23.5%.  [7]  It is important to note that all these efficient devices were fabricated with high-temperature-processed TiO 2 mesoporous structures, thus limiting their widespread application. Developing low-temperature-processed electron-transport layer (ETL)  [8]  for planar structure devices is of great importance.  [9]  Among them, TiO 2 ,  [10]  SnO 2 ,  [11]  and [6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)  [12]  are the most commonly used ones. The lower efficiency of devices based on planar structures is closely related to insufficient charge extraction  [13]  and imperfect interfacial band alignment.  [14]  The insufficient charge extraction between perovskite and ETL can result in charge accumulation, which negatively affects device performance.  [15]  Therefore, sufficient charge extraction is one of the most important contributors for device efficiency.  [16]  Recently, researchers have focused on the use of bilayer ETL,  [17]  and the bilayer stack structure has been demonstrated to be effective for improving device efficiency. As early as 2014,  [18]  Snaith and co-workers have shown that PSCs with C 60 -modified TiO 2 can significantly enhance electron transfer and result in a largely improved performance of 17.3% and a decrease in hysteretic behavior. Petrozza and co-workers demonstrated that insufficient charge extraction from the perovskite film to the ETL can be remedied using a TiO 2 /PCBM bilayer ETL, and a PCE of 17.9% was achieved.  [19]  Recently, Choi and co-workers achieved a PCE of 21.1% using SnO 2 @TiO 2 ETL,  [20]  and Kong and co-workers showed a PCE of 21.4% using the same type of ETL.  [21]  Numerous other efforts have been undertaken to enhance the performance of PSCs with bilayer ETLs, such as SnO 2 @TiO 2 ,  [22]  SnO 2 /PCBM,  [23]   SnO 2 /MgO,  [24]  TiO 2 /In 2 O 3 ,  [25]  MgO/TiO 2 ,  [17]  TiO 2 /ZnO,  [26]  and ZrO 2 /TiO 2 .  [27]  In contrast, the V OC of PSCs generally depends to a large extent on the energy level of the ETL for a specific bandgap material. Well-matched energy alignment between the ETL and perovskite films enhances charge transfer, and reduces interfacial recombination for efficient PSCs.  [28]  Therefore, controlling the energy level of the ETL is also beneficial for improving the performance of PSCs. However, planar devices are still less efficient than mesoporous devices. </text>

      <text> An electron-transport layer (ETL) with appropriate energy alignment and enhanced charge transfer is critical for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, interfacial energy level mismatch limits the electrical performance of PSCs, particularly the open-circuit voltage (V OC ). Herein, a simple low Here, we introduce a simple low-temperature solutionprocessed In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 bilayer ETL for efficient planar PSCs. We demonstrate that uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films can be obtained by the introduction of In 2 O 3 . The band energy alignment can be also tailored with increased built-in potential, resulting in an enhanced electric field for the separation of carriers and enhanced charge transfer, as well as reduced carrier recombination. The planar PSC utilizing In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 ETL demonstrated a higher efficiency of 23.24% with negligible hysteresis and 22.74% stable power output compared with a SnO 2based device that has an efficiency of 21.42%. In addition, the In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 -based PSC maintains 97.5% of its initial PCE after being stored under N 2 for 80 days without encapsulation and retain 91% of their initial PCE after 180 h under 1 sun continuous illumination.  contact with ITO, improving the electrical performance of resulting devices.  [29]  To further demonstrate the influence of In 2 O 3 , top-view SEM images of the perovskite films were examined. As shown in Figure  1e ,f, uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films with larger grain sizes can be obtained when deposited on the In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 ETL substrate than on SnO 2 ETL. The grain size of perovskite films is increased by an average of around 200 nm (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information) with the incorporation of In 2 O 3 . Pinholes on the surface of the films will reduce the shunt resistance and lead to recombination,  [30]  which are detrimental to the performance of devices. Moreover, the RMS roughness of corresponding films was significantly reduced from 44 to 33 nm (Figure  S5  Uniform and compact perovskite films lay the foundation for efficient PSCs. To better understand the variations in properties of the deposited perovskite films after introducing of In 2 O 3 , XRD was performed. Figure  2a  shows the XRD patterns of the films based on different ETLs. The strong intensity of the XRD peaks is related to better crystallization. So a better crystal film was obtained which is consistent with SEM results. The optical absorption spectra of these two films were measured by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. Figure  2b  shows that the presence of In 2 O 3 does not affect the absorption edge of perovskite films while slightly increasing the absorption intensity. The bandgap of both films extracted from Tauc plots shows an identical value of 1.53 eV (Figure  S7 , Supporting Information). In order to determine the dynamics of charge transfer and the extraction characteristics of different ETLs, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy were performed. As shown in Figure  2c  The radiative recombination rate from photoinduced carriers competing with nonradiative loss  [31]  plays a key role in the recombination process. In Figure  3b  shows the reverse and forward J-V scans of the devices. The device based on In 2 O 3 shows the lowest performance with a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 24.10 mA cm -2 , V OC of 1.10 V, fill factor (FF) of 72.52%, and PCE of 19.21%. SnO 2 ETL-based devices have a typical J SC of 24.26 mA cm -2 , V OC of 1.13 V, FF of 78.14%, and PCE of 21.42% (reverse scanning). By introducing In 2 O 3 , the performance of devices can be improved significantly. Further characterization shows that the optimum concentration of In 2 O 3 precursor solution is 0.05 m (Figure  S10  and Table  S1 , Supporting Information). Devices based on In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 ETL show a J SC of 24.53 mA cm -2 , V OC of 1.16 V, FF of 81.23%, and PCE of 23.07% with negligible hysteresis (Table  1 ). Therefore, our devices have good reproducibility. As shown in Figure  S11  (Supporting Information), 60 devices with different ETLs were fabricated. The PCEs of devices based on SnO 2 ETL range from 18.60% to 21.17%,    S12  (Supporting Information). The results discussed above reveal that device performance improvement is mainly due to the enhancement of FF and V OC . The hysteresis of the devices was also suppressed by the introduction of In 2 O 3 . Previous studies have demonstrated that hysteresis is mainly caused by ion migration  [32]  and charge transfer at the interface.  [4]  In order to further understand the effect of In 2 O 3 , the band structures of In 2 O 3 and SnO 2 were measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS; Figures  S13  and S14 , Supporting Information). The optical bandgap values of In 2 O 3 and SnO 2 determined by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy are 3.8 and 3.9 eV, respectively (Figure  S6a, d , Supporting Information). The calculated conduction band minimum (E CB ) is -4.55 eV for In 2 O 3 and -4.20 eV for SnO 2 (Figure  S14 , Supporting Information). According to previous studies, the E CB of ITO is about -4.7 eV.  [33]  The presence of In 2 O 3 with a deeper conduction band matches SnO 2 and ITO well, which is beneficial to a higher V OC (Figure  3c ). To further elucidate the possible mechanism responsible for the enhancement of V OC and FF, capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements were also taken. As shown in Figure  3d , the device based on the In 2 O 3 / SnO 2 bilayer has a smaller slope in the linear Mott-Schottky curve and the built-in potentials (V bi ) based on In 2 O 3 , SnO 2 , and In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 are â‰ˆ915, 935, and 985 mV, respectively. A higher V bi means stronger electric field in the perovskite which is beneficial for enhancing charge transfer,  [34]  resulting in suppressed hysteresis and more efficient devices.  [35]  The performance of PSCs is highly affected by the quality of perovskite films. Excellent contact between interfaces originating from uniform and compact films may be one of the reasons for the higher FF. In order to determine the origin of V OC and FF improvements, the trap density of prepared films with different ETLs was evaluated. So, electron-only devices with the ITO/ETL/perovskite/PCBM/bathocuproine (BCP)/Au structure were fabricated. As shown in Figure  3e , the current density reveals an Ohmic-type response at low bias. The cross point is defined as the trap-filled limit voltage (V TFL ), when the bias voltage is higher than the V TFL . The trap density can be determined by V TFL using the following equation n trap = 2ÎµÎµ 0 V TFL /eL 2 .  [31]  The trap density is proportional to V TFL . The results show that the trap density of film deposited on In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 is lower than that of the film deposited on SnO 2 . This is due to low nonradiative recombination and results in a higher V OC . In addition, the dark J-V curves (Figure  S15 , Supporting Information) of the devices based on SnO 2 and In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 indicate that the J 0 decreased with the presence of In 2 O 3 , which means low leakage current density. Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) determined the dynamics of charge transfer in PSCs.  [36]  It is well known that the high-frequency component represents the transfer resistance (R tr ) and the low-frequency component indicates the recombination resistance (R re ). Small R tr is beneficial to electron extraction, and large R re means less charge recombination.  [37]  Figure  3f  shows the Nyquist plots of cells with different ETLs under dark conditions, and the equivalent circuit diagram and specific parameters of devices based on SnO 2 and In 2 O 3 / SnO 2 are shown in Figure  S16  and Table  S2  in the Supporting Information, respectively. The R re of devices based on In 2 O 3 / SnO 2 is significantly larger than that of SnO 2 , meaning low recombination rates and resulting in enhanced FF and V OC . An optimized device with a PCE of 23.24% was successfully fabricated (Figure  4a ). Significantly, this device demonstrates a high voltage of 1.17 V with only 0.36 V loss in potential. This is one of the highest voltages demonstrated by an n-i-p planar structure (1.53 eV). Moreover, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 -based device was measured (Figure  4b ). The integrated current density is 24.34 mA cm -2 , matching well with the values from J-V characterization. The steady-state efficiency at maximum power point tracking (MPP) of the optimized PSC was also measured. The maximum voltage for the devices with In 2 O 3 is 0.98 V, and the maximum current density is 23.2 mA cm -2 . The corresponding steady-state output PCE was 22.74% (Figure  4c ). The best-performing device was sent to a PV calibration laboratory (Quality supervisionand Testing Center of Chemical and Physical Power Sources of Information Industry, China) for certification. A certified efficiency of 22.54% was demonstrated with a V OC of 1.16 V, J SC of 24.78 mA cm -2 , and FF of 78.23% (Figure  S17 , Supporting Information), making it one of the best planar PSCs. A performance comparison with previous devices based on bilayer ETLs can be found in Table  S3  (Supporting Information). The stability of PSCs is one of the most important criteria for commercialization.  [38]  The device stability was tested under a nitrogen environment (25 Â°C) without encapsulation, as shown in Figure  4d . After 80 days, the In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 -based PSC still maintains 97.5% of its initial PCE. Compared with SnO 2 -based PSCs which retain only 92.7% of their initial PCE, our results verify the enhanced stability of the new device. Figure  4e  shows the normalized PCE changes over time. It is obvious that after 180 h of continuous illumination, the device based on the In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 bilayer maintains â‰ˆ91% of its initial efficiency. While for the same conditions, the device based on SnO 2 maintains only 83% of its initial efficiency. The stability was also tested under ambient air (relative humidity (RH) 75%). After 120 h, the devices based on In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 maintain â‰ˆ80% of their initial efficiency and the devices based on SnO 2 only provide 71% of their initial efficiency under the same conditions (Figure  4f ). The same conclusion was also confirmed by thermal stability measurements (Figure  S18 , Supporting Information). The instability of PSCs is due to the decomposition of perovskite materials and organic hole transport layer (HTL). The grain size of perovskite films based on In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 is larger compared to that of SnO 2 (Figure  1 ). The larger grain size of perovskite films may partly suppress the permeation of water at grain boundaries and increase stability. We believe that the stability of perovksite solar cells can be improved further if new HTL materials  [39]  and/or encapsulation methods  [40]  are used. In summary, a simple and effective In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 bilayer ETL was developed for fabricating efficient low-temperature-processed planar PSCs. The presence of In 2 O 3 leads to low trap densities in perovskite films, better energy alignment, and enhanced charge transfer, which result in higher V OC and FF. Eventually, an optimized PCE of 23.24% (certified 22.54%) was obtained with negligible hysteresis. Moreover, the device based on In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 ETL retains 97.5% of its initial efficiency after 80 days in N 2 without encapsulation and maintain 91% of their initial efficiency after 180 h under 1 sun continuous illumination. This work demonstrates that a bilayer ETL can provide sufficient energy alignment and enhanced charge transfer for efficient and stable photovoltaic devices. The efficiency of PSCs can be further improved by optimizing the energy alignment between the interface layers. </text>

Formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium iodide (MAI), and methylammonium chloride (MACl), 2,2â€²,7,7â€²-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4methoxyphenylamine)-9,9â€²-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Indium nitrate pentahydrate and 2-methoxyethanol were purchased from Aladdin. Tin(IV) oxide colloid precursor was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Device Fabrication: First, the ITO substrates were cleaned by detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, respectively. The as-cleaned substrates were treated by UV-ozone for 10 min. Then, different concentrations of indium nitrate pentahydrate were spin-coated onto the ITO substrates at 8000 rpm for 30 s then annealed at 180 Â°C for 40 min in ambient air. After that, the annealed substrates were cleaned by UV-ozone for 10 min. Then, SnO 2 solution was spin-coated onto the substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 150 Â°C for 20 min. 1.3 m PbI 2 precursor solution was spin-coated onto SnO 2 at the speed of 1500 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 70 Â°C for 5 min. When the PbI 2 film was cooled down to room temperature, a mixture solution of organic salt (FAI:MAI:MACl = 60:6:6) was spin-coated onto the PbI 2 film at a speed of 1600 rpm for 30 s followed by annealing at 150 Â°C for 20 min in ambient air (about 40% humidity). Subsequently, Spiro-OMeTAD solution (72.3 mg mL -1 in CB and doped at a molar ratio of 3.3 with Li-TFSI and tBP) was spin-coated onto the perovskite film at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 80 nm of Au top electrode was thermally evaporated under vacuum with a shadow mask. The area of the cells was 0.12 cm 2 ; when measuring, a 0.0887 cm 2 mask was used to define the accurate aperture area for the cells. Device Characterizations: SEM (FEI NanoSEM650) was used to characterize the morphology of the In 2 O 3 , SnO 2 , and perovskite films and also the cross-sectional image of the fully device. The XRD patterns of the perovskite films were performed by Mini Flex 600 (Rigaku D/MAX-2500, Japan). The EQE spectra were conducted in air without encapsulate by the Enli Tec (Taiwan) measurement system. The currentvoltage characteristics of the devices were measured by a Keithley 2400 Source meter under AM 1.5G illumination with a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Enli. Tec., Taiwan). The intensity of the light was calibrated with a KG-5 filter Si photodiode. And the cells were measured with a metal mask (0.0887 cm 2 ) to reduce the influence of the scattered light. The measuring condition was forward scan (0-1.2 V, scan rate 20 mV s -1 , delay time 20 ms) and reverse scan (1.2-0 V, scan rate 20 mV s -1 , delay time 20 ms). The best PSCs were sent to an PV calibration laboratory (Quality supervision and Testing Center of Chemical and Physical Power Sources of Information Industry, China) for certification. The AFM images were characterized by atomic force microscopy (NanoNavi-SPA400, Japan). The PL and TRPL spectra were carried out via a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLS980, Edinburgh Instruments, UK). Figure S1 . S1 Figure S1.

      <text> -temperature-processed In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 bilayer ETL is developed and used for fabricating a new PSC device. The presence of In 2 O 3 results in uniform, compact, and low-trap-density perovskite films. Moreover, the conduction band of In 2 O 3 is shallower than that of Sn-doped In 2 O 3 (ITO), enhancing the charge transfer from perovskite to ETL, thus minimizing V OC loss at the perovskite and ETL interface. A planar PSC with a power conversion efficiency of 23.24% (certified efficiency of 22.54%) is obtained. A high V OC of 1.17 V is achieved with the potential loss at only 0.36 V. In contrast, devices based on single SnO 2 layers achieve 21.42% efficiency with a V OC of 1.13 V. In addition, the new device maintains 97.5% initial efficiency after 80 d in N 2 without encapsulation and retains 91% of its initial efficiency after 180 h under 1 sun continuous illumination. The results demonstrate and pave the way for the development of efficient photovoltaic devices. </text>

      <text> Figure 1a - 1a d shows the surface morphologies of ITO, ITO/ In 2 O 3 , ITO/SnO 2 , and ITO/In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 , respectively. Compared with bare ITO, the surface of ITO/In 2 O 3 is evidently much smoother. Moreover, ITO/In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 has an improved roughness and much better homogeneity than that of ITO/ SnO 2 . Atom force microscopy (AFM) was conducted to further investigate the roughness of the samples. As shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information), the root mean square (RMS) roughness of these four samples was reduced from 5.5 nm for ITO only to 2.2 nm after spin-coating In 2 O 3 . The roughness of SnO 2 spin-coated on bare ITO decreased from 2.2 to 1.4 nm when In 2 O 3 was introduced. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) verified the existence of the thin In 2 O 3 layer. As shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information), there are distinct diffraction peaks at 30.6Â°, 35.5Â°, and 51.0Â°, indicating the formation of pure In 2 O 3 crystals. The cross-sectional SEM image of the In 2 O 3 film further confirmed its thickness of â‰ˆ10 nm (Figure S3, Supporting Information). SnO 2 nanoparticles do not easily form dense films on rough ITO, but sol-gel-processed In 2 O 3 may enhance the physical </text>

      <text> , Supporting Information), which can be attributed to the smoother surface of SnO 2 when In 2 O 3 was introduced to the devices.In order to evaluate the influence of the In 2 O 3 underlayer on light utilization, we measured the optical transmission of the In 2 O 3 film on ITO, as shown in FigureS6(Supporting Information). Unexpectedly, the lowest transmittance is recorded by bare ITO. After depositing In 2 O 3 , SnO 2 , and In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 , the transmittance successively increases, which is due to the decrease of reflected light. </text>

      <text> , In 2 O 3 does not alter the peak luminescence position. The films based on SnO 2 and In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 ETL exhibited an emission at 800 and 799 nm, respectively. Compared with a glass substrate, both films show a strong quenching effect. The PL spectrum of perovskite film on In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 exhibits decreased intensity compared to the film on SnO 2 ETL, which means faster extraction of charges. </text>
