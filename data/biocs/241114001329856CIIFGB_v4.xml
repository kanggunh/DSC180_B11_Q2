      <text>Our simulations were performed using COMSOL Multiphysics v5.5. Electron and hole conduction is simulated using the conventional Shockley equations, and ionic charge is introduced as mobile charged species with a fixed number density. Interface charge transport is modelled after the thermionic emission model [1]. Non-radiative recombination is simulated using the generalized Shockley-Read Hall model [2]. J-V curves are simulated transiently at a sweep rate of 50 mV/s (in reverse direction), which captures ionic movement during the J-V curve. Further details of the relevant equations are available elsewhere [3,4].</text>

Owing to rapid development in their efficiency 1 and stability 2 , perovskite solar cells are at the forefront of emerging photovoltaic technologies. State-of-the-art cells exhibit voltage losses  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  approaching the theoretical minimum and near-unity internal quantum efficiency  [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]  , but conversion efficiencies are limited by the fill factor (&lt;83%, below the Shockley-Queisser limit of approximately 90%). This limitation results from non-ideal charge transport between the perovskite absorber and the cell's electrodes  5, 8, [13] [14] [15] [16]  . Reducing the electrical series resistance of charge transport layers is therefore crucial for improving efficiency. Here we introduce a reverse-doping process to fabricate nitrogen-doped titanium oxide electron transport layers with outstanding charge transport performance. By incorporating this charge transport material into perovskite solar cells, we demonstrate 1-cm 2 cells with fill factors of &gt;86%, and an average fill factor of 85.3%. We also report a certified steady-state efficiency of 22.6% for a 1-cm 2 cell (23.33% ± 0.58% from a reverse currentvoltage scan). Nitrogen-doped titanium oxide (titanium oxynitride, TiO x N y ) has been widely investigated for photocatalysis  17, 18  , but rarely in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). PSCs incorporating solution-processed TiO x N y have been reported, but device performances have not exceeded that of PSCs with standard TiO x electron transport layers (ETLs)  19, 20  , because the stoichiometric control required to optimize metal oxide transport layer properties is challenging with solution processing. Instead, we report here a reverse-doping method to produce high-quality TiO x N y films by oxidizing sputtered titanium nitride thin films using a controlled annealing temperature in an oxygen atmosphere (details are provided in the Methods). In addition to producing high-quality TiO x N y films, sputtering is already widely used in the photovoltaic and electronics industries and is therefore a promising deposition method for commercial fabrication of PSCs. </text>

      <text> TiO x N y film composition and morphology To understand the effect of the annealing process on the physical and electronic properties of TiO x N y , we prepared films (thickness ~50 nm) with seven different annealing conditions: as deposited (room temperature), 300 °C, 350 °C, 400 °C, 450 °C, 500 °C and 550 °C. There is no significant difference in the morphology of the resulting TiO x N y films (Extended Data Fig.  1 ), and they are similar to the bare fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrates. We next investigate the elemental composition of TiO x N y using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig.  1a , the Ti 2+ oxidation state  21  is present in the as-deposited TiN film as evidenced by the presence of O 1s (refs.  15, 22  ; Fig.  1b ) and O-Ti-N (refs.  18, 23, 24  ) XPS peaks (Fig.  1c ). The appearance of Ti 3+ and Ti 4+ states after annealing at 300 °C indicates partial oxidation of the TiN, and oxidation increases at higher temperatures. For samples annealed at 450 °C and above, only the highest Ti 4+ oxidation state is present  15, 21  . Meanwhile, the TiN (refs.  18, 23  ) peak weakens and eventually disappears at higher annealing temperatures, and two new N 1s core-level peaks (NO x (refs.  18, 23, 25  ) and γ-N 2 (refs.  23, 26  ) (chemisorbed N 2 )) are observed (Fig.  1c ). This further demonstrates that the chemical states of Ti and N within TiO x N y lattices continuously change as the oxidation temperature increases. More details of the XPS analysis can be found in the Methods. By combining the elements' relative peak areas and sensitivity factors (Extended Data Fig.  2 ), we calculate that the atomic ratio of O/Ti (N/Ti) is 0.58 (0.62) for the as-deposited film. The O/Ti atomic ratio increases with annealing temperature, reaching a peak of 2.24 at 500 °C before decreasing. In contrast, the N/Ti ratio decreases monotonically with annealing temperature. However, N atoms remain in the TiO x N y film at higher temperatures, with N/Ti ratios of 0.08 and 0.07 for samples annealed at 500 °C and 550 °C, respectively. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging (Extended Data Fig.  3a ) shows that the as-deposited film is not completely crystalline and features an amorphous contrast along with a distribution of crystalline particles with characteristic sizes ranging from 10 nm to 20 nm. A survey of the first two diffraction rings from the polycrystalline pattern in Fig.  2a  reveals diffracting planes corresponding to distances of d 1 = 2.45 ± 0.07 Å and d 2 = 2.12 ± 0.06 Å, which can be respectively assigned to the cubic phases of TiO (ref.  27  ) and TiN (ref.  27  ) (d (111),TiO = 2.411 Å, d (200),TiO = 2.088 Å; d (111),TiN = 2.445 Å, d (200),TiN = 2.117 Å). Detailed parameters for simulation are summarized in Supplementary Table  1 . Given the XPS result, which shows a large concentration of N relative to O, and the difficulty of differentiating the cubic TiO from the cubic TiN (Extended Data Fig.  2 ), we conclude that the observed crystalline phase has a composition of the type TiO x N y . Similar analysis of the films annealed at 300 °C, 350 °C and 400 °C indicates that these are also largely composed of the cubic TiO x N y phase (Fig.  2  and Extended Data Fig.  4 ). Note that there are two rings in the diffraction patterns of the sample annealed at 400 °C (Fig.  2c ), which can be allocated to the tetragonal anatase crystal phases of TiO x N y (ref.  28  ). The combined evidence of the XPS and TEM analysis shows that oxidation at low temperatures (&lt;400 °C) starts a restructuring process in which TiN and TiO crystals transform into amorphous TiO x N y , which then continues to form TiO x N y crystals under oxidation at high temperatures (&gt;450 °C). Compared with the as-deposited sample and those annealed at 300 °C, 350 °C and 400 °C, an increased crystalline fraction is observed for the TiO x N y film annealed at 450 °C and above (Extended Data Figs.  3  and 4 ). The diffraction patterns of the sample annealed at 450 °C are dominated by a combination of tetragonal anatase and rutile phases of TiO x N y (ref.  28  ), accompanied by the complete disappearance of the cubic TiO x N y phase (Extended Data Fig.  4d ). At the highest temperature investigated, the film annealed at 550 °C features large tetragonal crystals with sizes of greater than 20 nm with similar crystal phases to those of the film annealed at 500 °C (Fig.  2d  and Extended Data Fig.  4e, f ). </text>

      <text> Optoelectronic properties of TiO x N y film The as-deposited TiN film has a workfunction (WF) of ~4.32 eV (Fig.  3a ) and an optical bandgap (E g ) of ~3.25 eV (Extended Data Fig.  5 ), similar to literature values  29  . The WF values of the samples annealed at 300 °C, 350 °C, 400 °C, 450 °C, 500 °C and 550 °C are 4.32 eV, 4.29 eV, 4.14 eV, 4.08 eV, 4.16 eV, 4.14 eV and 4.28 eV, respectively, which are associated with the free-carrier density (or doping density) change and/or surface dipoles within the TiO x N y films. Figure  3b  shows the energy level distribution of TiO x N y films for different annealing temperatures, extracted by combining data from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra (Fig.  3a ) and E g measurements (Extended Data Fig.  5 ). In addition to the WF change, the energy difference (ΔE) between the Fermi level (E F ) and the conduction band minimum of TiO x N y increases with higher annealing temperatures. This indicates a reduction in free-carrier density (or doping density) of the n-type TiO x N y , which we quantify using Hall effect measurements (Fig.  3c ). The  As deposited density decreases steadily with increasing annealing temperatures up to 400 °C, followed by a drop of approximately three orders of magnitude between the samples annealed at 400 °C (5.1 × 10 20 cm -3 ) and 450 °C (5.0 × 10 17 cm -3 ). This coincides with the formation of the higher oxidation state of Ti, and loss of N from the TiO x N y lattice, as discussed previously. The carrier density decreases to 3.4 × 10 16 cm -3 for an annealing temperature of 550 °C. Consequently, the conductivity of the films exhibits a similar trend to the free-carrier density; the Hall mobility has an opposite trend (Fig.  3c ). For comparison, we note that a control film made from solution-processed pure TiO x (ref.  15  ) annealed at 500 °C has a much lower carrier density (4.5 × 10 14 cm -3 ) and conductivity (9.8 × 10 -5 S cm -1 ) than both the TiO x N y samples annealed at 500 °C and 550 °C. The detailed Hall effect results are summarized in Extended Data Table  1 .

Anatase is often the first TiO x crystal phase to form in many fabrication processes, owing to its low surface energy  33  , even though it is not an equilibrium phase for TiO x in terms of the lattice stability. It typically converts to rutile, a more thermally stable phase, at temperatures above 550 °C (ref.  33  ). However, studies suggest that the phase transition temperature strongly depends on impurities (or dopants) as well as on the morphology of the sample  [33] [34] [35]  . This may explain the formation of rutile TiO x N y phase in the sample annealed at 450 °C. at 400 °C and below exhibit low optical transmittance across the visible spectrum (Fig.  3d ), which we attribute to strong free-carrier absorption  30  . A substantial increase in transmittance for films annealed at temperatures of 450 °C and above coincides with the compositional, structural and electronic transition identified above. Thus, the combination of high conductivity and high optical transmittance for films annealed above 450 °C indicates that TiO x N y films produced in this way have potential as high-performance ETLs for PSCs. </text>

      <text> Solar cell characterization Having investigated the physical, electronic and optical properties of the TiO x N y films, we next investigate their use as ETLs in n-i-p PSCs. The devices studied here feature a structure of glass/FTO/TiO x N y (~40 nm)/meso-TiO 2 (~50 nm)/PMMA:PCBM/Cs 0.05 FA 0.9 MA 0.05 PbI 2.74 Br 0.26 (~500 nm)/PMMA/P3HT:CuPc (~65 nm)/Au (Fig.  4a  and Extended Data Fig.  6 ). Here meso-TiO 2 represents mesoporous TiO 2 , PMMA (ref.  5  ) and PMMA:PCBM (ref.  5  ) are ultrathin interface passivation layers consisting of poly(methyl-methacrylate) and PMMA:([6,6]-phenyl-C 61-butyric-acid-methyl-ester), respectively, and P3HT:CuPc (ref.  8  ) is a blended hole transport layer (HTL) consisting of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and copper phthalocyanine. Solution-processed compact TiO x (ref.  15  ) substitutes TiO x N y as the ETL in the control cells. As shown in Fig.  4a , our champion TiO x N y -based cell with an active area of 1-cm 2 yielded a PCE of 23.36% (23.38%) with V OC ~ 1.193 V (1.200 V), J SC ~ 22.80 mA cm -2 (22.89 mA cm -2 ) and fill factor (FF) ~ 0.859 (0.851) from reverse (forward) scan in-house measurements. The TiO x -based control cell exhibited a maximum PCE of 21.65% (V OC ~ 1.172 V, J SC ~ 22.75 mA cm -2 and FF ~ 0.812) and 21.22% (V OC ~ 1.171 V, J SC ~ 22.70 mA cm -2 and FF ~ 0.798) from reverse and forward scans, respectively. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and perovskite optical bandgap (E g ~ 1.57 eV) plots confirm the accuracy of the measured photocurrent as demonstrated by a discrepancy &lt;2% between the integrated J SC from the EQE spectra and the J SC measured from the J-V curve (Fig.  4b ). Another cell was submitted to an independent testing centre and achieved a certified efficiency of ~23.33% ± 0.58% with a FF of 86.68% ± 1.01% from a reverse J-V scan, and a steady-state efficiency of ~22.6% (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). This is, to our knowledge, the highest certified efficiency for 1-cm 2 PSCs 1 and the highest FF reported for a PSC of any size (Supplementary Tables  4  and 5 ). The J-V parameter distribution plots in Fig.  4c  and Extended Data Fig.  7a  illustrate the reproducibility of our 1-cm 2 PSCs. The average PCE of the TiO x N y -based cells is 23.09% ± 0.11% with an average FF ~ 0.853 ± 0.005, while that of the TiO x -based cells is 21.26% ± 0.33% (average FF ~ 0.793 ± 0.014). There is little difference in both V OC and J SC between the TiO x N y -and TiO x -based cells (Extended Data Fig.  7a ), so d c    2  and 3 , respectively. Nature | Vol 601 | 27 January 2022 | 577 the efficiency gains for TiO x N y -based cells are dominated by the higher FF that results from improved electron transport. A similar trend was also found between the TiO x N y -and TiO x -based PSCs fabricated with indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (see Supplementary Fig.  3  and discussion in the Methods). PSCs fabricated with TiO x N y ETLs annealed at 550 °C exhibited a lower average PCE of 21.42% ± 0.32% with substantial FF losses (Extended Data Fig.  7b, c ) compared to cells processed at 500 °C. This is due to the order-of-magnitude reduction in carrier density in the sample annealed at 550 °C compared to that annealed at 500 °C. We performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements to investigate the effect of ETL composition on subsequently deposited perovskite films. As seen in Supplementary Fig.  4 , we found no evidence of changes in the surface morphology (from SEM images), or in crystal structure, orientation or crystallinity (from X-ray diffraction measurements) of perovskite films deposited on the different substrates. There was also little difference in the time-resolved photoluminescence decay measurements, consistent with the experimental cell V OC values. This suggests that the very high FFs of the TiO x N y -based perovskite cells are derived from the improved electronic property of the TiO x N y film itself. To explain how TiO x N y can significantly increase FF, we employed numerical one-dimensional, multilayer ionic-electronic numerical device simulations. Our focus is on the electrostatics of the perovskite/ ETL/FTO layer structure. The empirical data suggest that increased dopant density is the only electronic factor that conclusively distinguishes TiO x N y from TiO x . Yet a simple analytical treatment based on ex situ conductivity of the ETL layers cannot explain the difference in FF. For 50-nm ETL layers, the optimum TiO x N y (N D = 3 × 10 17 cm -3 ) reduces the voltage losses relative to TiO x (N D = 5 × 10 14 cm -3 ) by only ~3 mV at the maximum power point (MPP) current of 22 mA cm -2 (where the electron mobility μ e = 0.5 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ). This is a small fraction of the experimental mean MPP voltage loss of approximately 80 mV. Instead, our model explains the resistance-related FF loss by showing that heavy doping of the ETL layer protects against electron depletion that can occur in The solid and dashed lines represent reverse and forward J-V scans, respectively; the TiO x N y -based cell device structure is shown in the inset. Note that the TiO x N y ETLs were fabricated at 500 °C and all J-V curves of the cells (effective area, 1.2 cm 2 ) were measured using an aperture mask (certified area, 1.0189 cm 2 ). Given that the meso-TiO 2 must be annealed at 500 °C to completely remove the organic compounds from the TiO 2 paste, the TiO regions of positive space charge at the perovskite/ETL and FTO/ETL heterojunctions. Equilibrium conditions in the perovskite/ETL/FTO structure deplete the ETL of electrons to concentrations that can be orders of magnitude below the fixed dopant density (Fig.  4d ). At the TiO x dopant density of 5 × 10 14 cm -3 , the equilibrium free-electron concentration can be closer to 10 13 cm -3 , introducing many tens of millivolts of voltage loss in the ETL at MPP currents (see Extended Data Fig.  8  for details). Our simulations suggest that although modifications of the WF alignment between these materials, and in particular the ETL and FTO layer, can mitigate the effect to some extent, high doping (⪆10 17 cm -3 ) in the ETL layer will, in general, be necessary (although not sufficient) to achieve PSC FFs above approximately 85%. We conclude this work by investigating the cell stability  31  . As seen in Extended Data Fig.  9a , the unencapsulated TiO x N y -based cell exhibited a steady-state PCE of ~22.82% after 250 h of MPP voltage (V MPP ) tracking under continuous 1 sun illumination in nitrogen, retaining ~98.7% of its initial efficiency (~23.12%). Similarly, the TiO x -based cell (~20.24%) retained ~96.5% of its initial efficiency (~20.97%), demonstrating no significant difference in light-soaking stability between the unencapsulated cells with different ETLs (Extended Data Fig.  9b ). Two cells of each type were also subjected to damp-heat exposure in the dark. For these tests, an additional MoO x (~10 nm)/indium zinc oxide (~40 nm) barrier layer was deposited between the HTL and the gold electrode resulting in a reduced FF relative to the unencapsulated cells reported above. All four individual cells retained &gt;90% of their initial efficiencies after 1,000 h. Time-dependent power output and J-V curves are presented in Supplementary Figs.  5  and 6  showing the cell performance evolution during the degradation tests. Although both the light-soaking and damp-heat stability tests show promising results, these are not sufficient to guarantee the stability of perovskite cells under real operating conditions where thermal, light and humidity stressors act simultaneously  31  . According to the literature  2, 32  , the combination of these conditions can accelerate degradation of the perovskite active layer, even in the presence of stable charge transport layers and encapsulation. As the perovskite used in this work was not optimized to withstand such conditions, a more stable composition such as those reported in refs.  2, 32  would be necessary to realize the full benefits of the TiO x N y ETL. </text>

      <text> Device fabrication For the ultrathin passivation layer deposition, ~100 µl PMMA:PCBM precursor solution was dropped onto the FTO/TiO x N y (or TiO x )/ meso-TiO 2 substrates and deposited by spin-coating at 5,000 r.p.m. with a ramp of 5,000 r.p.m. s -1 for 30 s, then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Cs 0.05 FA 0.88 MA 0.07 PbI 2.56 Br 0.44 thin films were then deposited on the passivated substrates by a two-step spin-coating programme: first at 2,000 r.p.m. with a ramp of 200 r.p.m. s -1 for 10 s, and then at 4,000 r.p.m. with a ramp of 1,000 r.p.m. s -1 for 20 s. The perovskite precursor film was immediately transferred into a custom-built vacuum flash  36  system where a two-step vacuum procedure was applied: first, the system was immediately pumped down to a low pressure of ~100 mtorr and held for 20 s; the pressure was then increased to ~1.2 torr and held for another 10 s. The pump valve was then turned off and left to return to atmospheric pressure. After the vacuum flash treatment, the perovskite sample was immediately annealed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 120 s. The sample was then returned to the spin-coater and cooled down by fast rotation at 5,000 r.p.m. with a ramp of 5,000 r.p.m. s -1 for 60 s. Next, the PMMA passivation treatment was applied: first, ~100 µl PMMA solution (0.25 mg ml -1 in chlorobenzene) was dropped onto the perovskite sample and left for 2 s; second, the sample was spin-coated for 15 s at 5,000 r.p.m with a ramp of 5,000 r.p.m. s -1 ; finally, the sample was annealed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 60 min. The P3HT:CuPc HTL was deposited via spin-coating at 2,000 r.p.m. with a ramp of 500 r.p.m. s -1 for 30 s. Finally, ~100 nm gold was deposited through a shadow mask (cell area 1.2 cm 2 ). All depositions were conducted in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. </text>

      <text> Solar cell characterization All devices were tested under 1 sun conditions (100 mW cm -2 , AM 1.5G) in a solar simulator system (Wavelab Inc.). The light intensity was calibrated using a certified Fraunhofer CalLab reference cell. All J-V curves were measured at a 20 mV s -1 scan rate with an aperture mask (certified area is ~1.0189 cm 2 ) in a custom-built measurement jig under nitrogen flow. Note that the reverse scan is from V OC to J SC (forward bias → short circuit, 1.2 V → -0.1 V), and the forward scan is from J SC to V OC (short circuit → forward bias, -0.1 V → 1.2 V). EQE was measured using the d.c. measurement module on a commercial EQE system (CEP-25ML, Bunkoukeiki). For the TiO x N y perovskite cell, the estimated spectrum mismatch correction is 98.36% based on the comparison between the integrated current density calculated from the EQE response and the current density measured under the solar simulator. No preconditioning protocol was applied before the characterization. The performance distribution of TiO x N y -based PSCs fabricated with ITO substrates is shown in Supplementary Fig.  3 . The average PCE of TiO x N y cells is 22.78% ± 0.17% (champion PCE ~ 23.09%) with FF ~ 0.842 ± 0.006 (champion FF ~ 0.849), while that of TiO x ('Control') cells is 21.03% ± 0.27% (champion PCE ~ 21.47%) with FF ~ 0.785 ± 0.012 (champion FF ~ 0.802). Note that the performance of ITO-based TiO x N y or TiO x cells is lower than that of the corresponding FTO-based TiO x N y or TiO x cells. This is because the sheet resistance of ITO substrates (initially 8-10 Ω sq -1 ) increases to ~26-30 Ω sq -1 when annealed at 500 °C for 30 min, while that of FTO substrates (~7 Ω sq -1 ) does not change. For this reason, the slightly decreased performance of ITO-based cells originates from the increased sheet resistance of the ITO substrates. </text>

      <text> Damp-heat test The damp-heat (85 °C, 85% relative humidity) tests under dark conditions were performed using a climate test chamber (Weiss Technik). When measuring the cells during the aging, samples were removed from the chamber and allowed to cool down to room temperature. Note that the perovskite cells used for the damp-heat tests included an additional barrier layer deposited on the HTL before the gold electrode. The barrier layer consisted of ~10 nm MoO x deposited by thermal evaporation followed by ~40 nm of indium zinc oxide deposited by sputtering. The function of the MoO x was to prevent sputtering damage to the underlying HTL. The rest of the cell fabrication was identical to the process described above. Cells were then encapsulated between two pieces of glass and the edges were sealed with polyisobutylene  37  . </text>

      <text> Film characterization The top morphology of bare FTO and FTO/TiO x N y samples was imaged with a non-contact tapping-mode atomic force microscope (Asylum Research). XPS and UPS measurements were carried out on an XPS machine (Escalab 250 Xi, Thermo Fisher), with a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.7 eV) X-ray source for XPS and a He i (21.2 eV) gas discharge lamp for UPS. The detailed XPS peak analysis is presented below. As shown in Fig.  1a , the Ti 2+ oxidation state is present in the as-deposited TiN film, with the Ti 2p peaks centred at binding energies of ~456.1 eV and ~461.6 eV (ref.  21  ). In addition, the O 1s XPS peak indicates the presence of a significant amount of O even in the as-deposited sample (Fig.  1b ). This might be caused by the natural oxidation of the TiN sputtering target during storage or by oxidation from residual oxygen in the chamber during the sputtering process. For the sample annealed at 300 °C, the Ti 2p core-level peaks are at binding energies of ~457.1 eV and ~458.6 eV/~464.4 eV, which can be respectively ascribed to Ti 3+ and Ti 4+ oxidation states  15, 21  , indicating that the TiN starts oxidizing at 300 °C under oxygen atmosphere. Both the TiN and Ti 2+ peaks vanish when annealed at 350 °C, while the Ti 3+ peaks reduce when the annealing temperature is increased from 350 °C to 400 °C. There is no evidence of Ti 3+ peaks in films annealed at 450 °C and above. For the O 1s XPS spectra (Fig.  1b ), the dominant peaks at all temperatures are centred at binding energies of ~530.1 eV to ~530.5 eV, which we attribute to titanium oxides  15, 22  (TiO x ), while the smaller peaks at higher binding energies of ~532.0 eV can be assigned to hydroxyl groups or O 2 (refs.  15, 22  ). As shown in Fig.  1c , the N 1s core-level peak of the as-deposited sample could be deconvoluted into three different N species. The peak centred at ~397.2-eV binding energy and its satellite are indicative of TiN (refs.  18, 23  ); while the smaller peak centred at a lower binding energy of ~396.5 eV can be allocated to O-Ti-N (refs.  18, 23, 24  ), suggesting that the oxidation state of Ti is present in the as-deposited TiN film. This oxidized TiN (that is, O-doped TiN y ) is the early stage of TiO x N y . The relative height of the O-Ti-N peak increases when oxidized at 300 °C and becomes the dominant N 1s peak at 350 °C. A new peak centred at a higher binding energy of ~402 eV is observed for the sample annealed at 350 °C, which we attribute to chemisorbed nitrogen, also denoted as γ-N 2 (refs.  23, 26  ). In addition, the TiN peak vanishes when annealed at 350 °C, consistent with the Ti 2p core-level peak analysis (Fig.  1a ). Therefore, the 350 °C oxidized film is dominated by N-doped TiO x (Extended Data Fig.  2 ). Note that the slight shift of the O-Ti-N peak to a lower binding energy of ~396.2 eV might be caused by the transition of the dominant chemical state of TiO x N y from O-doped TiN y to N-doped TiO x . For the sample annealed at 400 °C, a new peak is observed at a binding energy of ~400 eV, which can be ascribed to the NO x functional group  18, 23, 25  . For this sample, the peak intensity of O-Ti-N decreases and the γ-N 2 peak shifts to a slightly higher binding energy of ~403 eV. This is because the oxidation states of Ti within the sample annealed 400 °C at are dominated by Ti 4+ (Fig.  1a ), and O-rich N-doped TiO x lattices are formed after annealing at 400 °C (see Extended Data Fig.  2 ). Note that the O-Ti-N peak cannot be detected for TiO x N y films annealed at 450 °C and above. In general, for non-metal-doped TiO x , substitutional doping of the O lattice site is preferred in O-deficient conditions, while interstitial doping is favoured in O-rich conditions  18  . Here the O-Ti-N species in N 1s core-level peaks is associated with both O substitutional doping in TiN y or N substitutional doping in TiO x lattices, while the NO x peaks can be attributed to N interstitial doping in O-rich TiO x lattices  18, 23, 25  . The TiO x N y lattices will be eventually oxidized into pure TiO x lattices with further increasing the annealing temperature (&gt;550 °C) as the reaction of oxidation of TiN to TiO 2 is thermodynamically favourable  18, 34  , where the relevant chemical reaction equation is TiN + O 2 → TiO 2 + 1/2 N 2 . UV-Vis transmittance and absorption spectra UV-Vis transmittance and absorption spectra were measured using a PerkinElmer Lambda 1050 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer. An FEI Verios scanning electron microscope and a Helios Nanolab 600 FIB system were used to investigate the surface morphology and cross-sectional SEM images of the perovskite samples, respectively. The TEM measurements were performed in a JEOL 2100F operating at 200 keV. The simulation of the polycrystalline TEM diffraction patterns was performed using the JEMS  38    1 , 1 Heping Shen 1 , Teng Lu 5 , Frank Brink 2 , Dingyong Zhong 3 , Li Li 6 , Olivier Lee Cheong Lem 6 , Yun Liu 5 , Klaus J.
