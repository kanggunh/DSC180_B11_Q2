      <text>Daily temperature variations induce phase transitions and lattice strains in halide perovskites, challenging their stability in solar cells. We stabilized the perovskite black phase and improved solar cell performance using the ordered dipolar structure of b-poly(1,1-difluoroethylene) to control perovskite film crystallization and energy alignment. We demonstrated p-i-n perovskite solar cells with a record power conversion efficiency of 24.6% over 18 square millimeters and 23.1% over 1 square centimeter, which retained 96 and 88% of the efficiency after 1000 hours of 1-sun maximum power point tracking at 25°and 75°C, respectively. Devices under rapid thermal cycling between -60°and +80°C showed no sign of fatigue, demonstrating the impact of the ordered dipolar structure on the operational stability of perovskite solar cells. </text>

      <text>T he highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of &gt;25% reported for singlejunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) rely on regular n-i-p architectures  (1) . However, inverted p-i-n PSCs have several advantages, including low-temperature processability and long-term operational stability derived from non-doped hole-transporting materials  (2, 3) . Nonetheless, they have lower PCEs, with only a few certified values exceeding 23% and a bottleneck value of 24% over 10 square millimeter cells  (4) (5) (6) . This lower performance is mainly correlated with nonradiative recombination losses and reduced charge extraction that stem from the high density of defects in the perovskite bulk and interfacial contacts  (7, 8) . For practical applications, ambient temperature variations can limit PSC performance  (9)  because the perovskite can undergo severe ion migration, phase transition, and temperatureinduced strain, leading to lower PCE  (10) (11) (12) . Cycling over variable temperatures demands that the perovskite tolerate alternating tension and compression in the device structure  (13) . Thus, developing high-efficiency PSCs with thermal cycle stability is critical to advancing PSC application. We use polymer dipoles to optimize triple cation halide perovskite Cs 0.05 (FA 0.98 MA 0.02 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.98 Br 0.02 ) 3 films from bulk to the surface. The polymer dipole promoted the growth of a low-defect crystalline film by reducing the formation energy of the black photoactive phase. The formation of dipoles at the perovskite surface suppressed ion migration and facilitated interfacial charge extraction while enhancing hydrophobicity. We achieved a certified PCE of 24.2% over an active area of 9.6 mm 2 , and lab recorded PCEs of 24.6% over 18 mm 2 and 23.1% over 1 cm 2 . The high PCE was stable under severe thermal cycling (120 cycles, from -60°to +80°C), demonstrating the resiliency of the crystal structure to the temperatureinduced strains. </text>

      <text> Film formation and characterization The alternate symmetric hydro and fluorocarbon units along the polymeric backbone of b-poly(1,1-difluoroethylene) (b-pV2F) result in an ordered molecular dipole distribution. After screening a few molecular weights, 0.5 mg/mL b-pV2F of 180,000 molecular weight was used (figs. S1 and S2). The influence of b-pV2F on the film morphology and work function is shown in Fig.  1 . From the top view and cross sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) images (Fig.  1 , A to C), we can observe evident voids at the grain boundaries of the control perovskite film, with an average grain size of ~400 nm (fig.  S3A ). These defects can create shunting paths and nonradiative recombination centers  (14) . b-pV2F enabled a more compact perovskite film with an enlarged grain size of ~480 nm (Fig.  1 , D to F, and fig.  S3B ). A smaller full width at half maximum in the (001) peak of the x-ray diffraction support an enhanced crystallinity in the b-pV2F-treated perovskite film (fig.  S4 )  (15) . Furthermore, atomic force microscopy images showed that b-pV2F reduced the surface roughness from 54.4 to 41.1 nm (fig.  S5 ), which is expected to ameliorate coverage with charge-transporting layers  (16) . Because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the fluorine atoms, the neighboring hydrogen atoms have a partial positive charge density. Then, the all-trans planar zigzag conformation of b-pV2F makes it resemble a Lewis acid, which can interact with the surface of the perovskite  (17, 18) . Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that the -CH 2 stretching vibration peak shifted from 3025 cm -1 of b-pV2F to 3019 cm -1 in contact with the target perovskite (fig.  S6 ), suggesting a solid C-H•••X dipole interaction between -CH 2 moieties and halide ions of the [PbX 6 ] 4-frame. Such polar interaction with the precursors of the perovskite influences the crystallization during film formation and leads to an upward shift of the surface work function (WF) after film formation (Fig.  1G )  (17, 18) ; Fig.  1H  displays the increase in WF up to 300 meV for the target perovskite film, which facilitates the interfacial charge extraction and enhances the device's stability  (19) . The WF shift was near that of standard perovskite film treated with b-pV2F only at the surface, which indicated that as the crystal growth proceeded, b-pV2F was partially expelled from the bulk and assembled on the perovskite surface  (2, 20) . The fluorine-exposed surface arrangement induced hydrophobicity (figs. S7 and S8). We measured reduced nonradiative recombination and improved interfacial charge transfer in target perovskites (figs. S9 to S13)  (21) (22) (23) (24) . This scenario is expected to enhance the solar cells' efficiency and stability  (25, 26) . To acquire an in-depth perspective on the promoted perovskite crystallization kinetics, we performed synchrotron-based in situ grazing incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements to monitor the entire film formation process (several different stages are shown in Fig.  2, A  and B ). The initial t 1 stage (during the first 25 s) revealed the scattering halo at scattering vector q values from 8 to 8.5 nm -1 from the solvated colloidal sol precursor. The signal transition at t 2 (25 s) originated from dripping antisolvent, where the rapid solvent extraction caused the disappearance of the diffraction signal. Subsequently, the spin coating process was performed at stage t 3 , where supersaturated solvate intermediate emerges. The t 4 near 60 s represented annealing staging. Stage t 5 revealed the intermediate phase signal with annealing. Stage t 6 was the perovskite evolution process. Stage t 7 described the cessation of further crystal growth. Comparing GIWAXS patterns (Fig.  2 , A and B), the weakened diffraction signal in the initial 60 s suggested that the initial solvated phase of DMSO-DMF-PbX 2 -in which DMSO is dimethylsulfoxide, DMF is dimethylformamide, and X is a halide (I -, Br -)-was suppressed. This effect could be ascribed to the initial solvated phase isolated by the long-chain b-pV2F molecules  (27) . The intermediate phase concentration was lower in the target than in the control (fig.  S14 ). The scattering feature centered at q = ~10 nm -1 along the (001) crystal plane observed in the cast film indicated that the colloid had solidified and converted into a black phase. Notably, we found that the perovskite phase of the target emerged earlier than that of the control (Dt t &gt; Dt c ), which implied that b-pV2F promoted the conversion of the intermediate phase to the perovskite black phase. The fast phase inversions were 2 of 6   </text>

Moreover, the target ceased crystal growth sooner at 250 s than the control at 350 s. When the crystallization is completed (stage t 7 ), the signal is more intense in the target than in the control (Fig.  2C ). This result indicates that the target perovskite film is more ordered. The time-dependent in situ GIWAXS intensity profiles with other scattering vectors, such as q = ∼20 nm -1 corresponding to the (002) crystal plane (fig.  S15 ), showed the same phase transition trend. Thus, b-pV2F controls the perovskite crystallization kinetics by lowering the perovskite formation energy, promoting phase conversion, and enabling a more ordered crystal structure (fig.  S16 ). </text>

      <text> Photovoltaic performance The photovoltaic performance of inverted p-i-n PSCs with control and polymer-modified perovskite films is shown in Fig.  3 . The device architecture is glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/ self-assembled [2-(3,6-dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (MeO-2PACz)/ perovskite/  [6, 6] -phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC 61 BM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/silver (Ag) (fig.  S17 ). Typical current-voltage (J-V) curves for the PSCs (Fig.  3A ) were measured with a device area of 18 mm 2 . The control PSCs had a PCE of 22.3%, with short-circuit current den-sity (J sc ) of 24.7 mA/cm 2 , V oc of 1.13 V, and fill factor (FF) of 80.2%. With b-pV2F, the device performance improved with a V oc of 1.18 V, a J sc of 24.8 mA/cm 2 , and a FF of 84.3% for a PCE of 24.6%. The target PSCs' reverse-and forward-sweep J-V curves (fig.  S18 ) had negligible hysteresis. A PCE of 24.2% for an aperture area of 9.6 mm 2 was obtained from the independent accredited certification institute of Test and Calibration Center of New Energy Device and Module, Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology (SIMIT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (fig.  S19 ). We also recorded a PCE of 23.1% for devices with a working area of 1 cm 2 (Fig.  3B ). From the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig.  3C ), we calculated an integrated J sc of 24.3 and 24.4 mA/cm 2 for control and target devices, respectively, comparable to the values extracted from the J-V curves. The optical bandgaps of both perovskite absorbers determined by the x axis intercept of the EQE linear are shown in fig.  S20    (31, 32) . The statistical distribution of the device parameters collected from 38 devices shows an improved PV performance and increased reproducibility with b-pV2F (fig.  S21 )  (33) , which we explain with better charge extraction and reduced nonradiative recombination  (27) . The stabilized power outputs at the maximum power point (MPP) are plotted in Fig.  3D . The control device showed a persistent attenuation in efficiency under continuous 1 equivalent sun illumination for 400 s. By contrast, the tracked target device yielded highly stable power output and even progressively improved performance, which we attributed to the lightsoaking effect  (34) . The stability of unencapsulated devices under working conditions shows that target PSCs retain 96% of the initial PCE after continuous MPP tracking for 1000 hours. By contrast, control PSCs decay to 84% of their original PCE (Fig.  3E ). Device stability statistics (n = 12) are presented in fig.  S22 . After heating the device to 75°C, 88% PCE was retained in the target device in contrast to only 56% in the control (fig.  S23 ). We further evaluated device stability against temperature variations. The J-V curves in fig.  S24  show that the control device's PV parameters (J sc , FF, and V oc ) exhibited large fluctuations when tested at temperatures ranging from -60°to +80°C (table  S1 ). However, this variation was suppressed in the target device (fig.  S25  and table S2 ). Furthermore, compared with the control, the target device had reduced hysteresis and its hysteresis factor was relatively stable under temperature variations (fig.  S26 ). The statistical PCE distribution in Fig.  4,  A  and B , indicates that the b-pV2F stabilization effect is highly reproducible. All performance parameter evolution is reported in figs. S27 and S28. Subsequently, the unencapsulated devices were aged under rapid thermal cycling (TC) between -60°and +80°C, swept at a rate of 20°C per minute. As shown in Fig.  4 , C and D, the control device suffered a severe decline of 75.6% at +80°C and 63.0% at -60°C, whereas 3 of 6  </text>

      <text> Device film morphologies and structures during thermal cycling The difference in device performance stems from use of b-pV2F in the perovskite film. We characterized the morphology and crystal structure of perovskite films undergoing aging with thermal cycling to identify the impact of b-pV2F. The film aging followed the same device protocol: 120 rapid thermal cycles between -60°and +80°C at a rate of 20°C per minute. As observed from the SEM images in fig.  S29 , control films exhibited severe morphological degradation with enlarged grain boundaries and voids. Such degradation features were not detected in the aged target films (fig.  S30 ), which appeared nearly identical to the pristine film shown in Fig.  1E . This result indicates that the temperature-induced degradation of perovskite films is suppressed in target perovskites (fig.  S31 )  (35) . We observed additional GIWAXS peaks forming in the control perovskite after three thermal cycles (Fig.  5A ). Specifically, in the second cycle, the peak for PbI 2 , a degradation product, emerged at q = 9.2 nm -1 . During the third thermal cycle, additional peaks ~8.2 and 8.6 nm -1 formed, corresponding to the hexagonal photoinactive polytypes 4H and 6H from Cs 0.05 (FA 0.98 MA 0.02 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.98 Br 0.02 ) 3 perovskite (fig.  S32A )  (36, 37) . This result indicates that the control perovskite undergoes irreversible phase changes. The generation of these phases may originate from the lattice deformation at the grain boundaries caused by the mutual extrusion of unit cells from neighbored crystals of different orientations  (36) . Such phenomena were not observed in the target perovskite (Fig.  5B ), indicating high structural stability (fig.  S32B ). For q values from 16 to 19 nm -1 , we observed additional peaks in both control and target (figs. S33 and S34), corresponding to the tetragonal phase (b phase)  (10, 38) . The tetragonal phase was only retained in the cold temperature region. This suggests that the degradation products of perovskite under thermal cycling include irreversible PbI 2 , 4H, and 6H, and reversible tetragonal phase transition, jointly contributing to device performance degradation. Temperature-resolved azimuthally integrated intensity patterns (figs. S35 and S36) indicate that b-pV2F suppresses the phase transitions. We found that suppressing the phase transition also suppressed ion migration in the complete device under working conditions, i.e., lower hysteresis (fig.  S37 ). Because of differences in thermal expansion coefficients between the perovskite film and the substrate, temperature variation induces strain in the perovskite  (39, 40) . The control perovskite underwent substantial lattice strain evolution (-0.13 to 0.57%) during thermal cycling (Fig.  5C ). We observed that the perovskite strain drifted with temperature cycling, showing a constant lattice parameter change in perovskite. By contrast, the target perovskite exhibits stable strain cycling in a narrower range (-0.06 to 0.38%), corresponding to a recoverable crystal structure and releasable lattice strain (tables S3 to S5). We propose that a strain-buffering and lattice-stabilizing effect exists in target perovskite because b-pV2F creates a self-assembly polymeric layer that coats the crystals within the perovskite film reducing friction during thermal cycling (figs. S38 and S39)  (41) (42) (43) (44) . </text>

      <text> Conclusions Thermal stress experienced in normal working conditions induces phase transitions and lattice strains that hamper the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Coating the crystals comprising the perovskite film with polymer dipoles results in a strain-buffering and latticestabilizing effect that mitigates the impact of thermal stress. We selected the specific polymer dipole b-poly(1,1-difluoroethylene) (b-pV2F). The b-pV2F highly ordered dipolar structure interacts with specific perovskite components enabling control of perovskite film crystallization during the processing and energy alignment with the charge-selective contacts within the device. We reported b-pV2F devices with improved power conversion efficiency up to 24.6% on an active area of 18 mm 2 and 23.1% over a larger area of 1 cm 2 (certified PCE of 24.24% with an active area of 9.6 mm 2 from SIMIT). The b-pV2F strain-buffering effects enabled stable power output at temperatures as high as 75°C and rapid temperature variation between -60°and +80°C. Our work identifies a new strategy for making stable perovskite solar cells.  </text>

      <text> Device Fabrication Substrate Cleaning. Patterned indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates (25 mm x 25 mm, thickness of 80 nm) were firstly cleaned with 2% Mucasol solution dispersed in deionized water under ultrasonication for 15 min, followed by pure deionized water with 5 min ultrasonication. Subsequently, these substrates were sequentially cleaned by acetone and 2propanol under ultrasonication for 15 min. After that, ITO glass substrates were dried with N2 blowing and hot plate. Ultimately, we used UV-ozone to treat substrates for 30 min. Precursor Solution Preparation. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 1.5 M triple-cation halide salts according to a formula of Cs0.05(FA0.98MA0.02)0.95Pb(I0.98Br0.02)3 in the mixed solvent of DMF/DMSO (4:1 in v:v). Additionally, 0.5 mg/mL β-pV2F polymer molecule was dissolved in the DMF/DMSO solvent as the additive into the perovskite precursor. During this process, the mixed solutions were stirred overnight in a shaker with 60 °C. Resultant solutions were filtered through a 0.45 μm hydrophobic PTFE filter before use. Perovskite Solar Cell Fabrication. The inverted p-i-n architecture perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in a planar system were fabricated through the following procedure. Typically, 100 μL MeO-2PACz (0.335 mg/mL) dissolved in absolute ethanol, as a hole transport material, was spincoated on the ITO glass substrates using a speed of 3,000 rpm for 30 s with an acceleration of 500 rpm/s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for Subsequently, 100 μL perovskite precursor was applied into MeO-2PACz layer. The dispersed perovskite solution was spin-coated with 6000 rpm for 35 s with a ramp of 1000 rpm/s. At 10 s before the end of the procedure, 200 μL chlorobenzene as the antisolvent was dripped into the precast film surface. After that, the substrates were quickly transferred to a hot plate with 100 °C for 45 min annealing. Then, starting the program with 3000 rpm for 30 s with a ramp of 3000 rpm/s, 20 mg/mL PC61BM in chlorobenzene was spin-coated on the obtained perovskite layers after 3 s to acquire the electron selective contact. Sequentially, 8 nm BCP controlled by temperature and 100 nm Ag electrode via controlling power were thermally deposited on the PC61BM layer with a shadow mask, using a thin-film evaporation system under a high vacuum lower than 1x10 -6 mbar. Ultimately, the PSCs with defined areas of 18 mm 2 on each pixel were obtained. In addition, the device with defined working area of 1 cm 2 was also fabricated by covering the large-area mask. Notably, the whole device fabrication process was carried out in distraction-free N2-filled gloveboxes. </text>

      <text> Characterization Performance Measurement. Photocurrent-voltage (J-V) curves of PSCs under 1 sun equivalent illumination were recorded with a programmable Keithley 2400 source meter under a Wavelabs Sinus-70 LED class AAA sun simulator. The light intensity was calibrated using a filtered KG3 silicon reference solar cell from Fraunhofer-Institut für Solare Energiesysteme ISE. J-V scans were carried out with a step size of 0.02 V, monitored by a controllable measurement program written in LabView. Device performance metrics of Jsc, FF, Voc and PCE were collected from the J-V measurements. During the J-V measurements, PSCs employed defined device areas of 18 mm 2 and 1 cm 2 . Also, the stabilized power outputs at the maximum power points (MPP) was tracked under illumination, where the PSCs were biased at the MPP voltage. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra from 300 to 850 nm were collected by Oriel Instruments QEPVSI-b system integrated with Xenon arc lamp (Newport 300 W), which was controlled via TracQ-Basic software. The system was equipped with a chopper and the monochromatic light (Newport Cornerstone 260) for filtering the white light. Before measurements, the EQE setup was calibrated through a standard silicon photodetector with known spectral response. The operational stability of the unencapsulated devices is tested at the MPP tracking under simulated 1 sun illumination (LED solar simulator). The illumination intensity of the LED lamp is calibrated. There is an interval of 30 min for data collection. During the MPP tracking, the device is performed in an inert atmosphere at room temperature (25 °C). Thermal stability under elevated temperature is conducted at 75 °C in an inert atmosphere with continuous MPP tracking. The temperaturedependent test setup is mainly equipped with temperature and vacuum controllers, liquid nitrogen, vacuum pump, sample chamber, solar simulator. Specifically, temperature was controlled by hot and cold stage (HCP421V-PM), which is equipped with temperature controller (mK2000B), temperature control sensor (100 Ω Platinum RTD), liquid nitrogen cooling system, 3 L liquid nitrogen dewar (LN2-D3), water pump with heat exchanger, DC power supply, and temperature control software (Instec App). The inner sample chamber is cooled by the liquid nitrogen cooling accessory (INSTEC LN2-P). Setup temperature can range from -190 °C to 400 °C, with temperature stability of ±0.05 °C (&gt;25 °C), ±0.1 °C (&lt;25 °C). Maximum heating rate is +150 °C/min (at 37 °C), cooling rate is -50 °C/min (at 37 °C). Minimum heating and cooling rate is ±0.1 °C/h. During the operation, the device was placed in a chamber with controllable temperature and pressure. Liquid nitrogen was introduced to adjust the device temperature. During our thermal cycling, the temperature was controlled between -60 and +80 °C. For temperature ramps, we performed the WinTemp RAMP temperature (c) AT rate (°C/min) command to set up the ramp parameters in our experiments. The solar simulator with a 450 W xenon lamp (Sol3A Class AAA Solar Simulator, Oriel, USA) was used to record the device performance. Structure Characterization. Field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements were carried out on a Quanta 200 FEG (FESEM, FEI Co.) to investigate the morphology and thickness of perovskites by measuring top and cross-sectional views. Atomic force microscope (AFM) was employed to reveal the topographical features of perovskite films by a Park Systems NX12 equipment. AFM topographies were analyzed using the open-source software Gwyddion © . Kelvin probe (KP) was implemented to measure the contact potential difference (CPD). The KP setup was installed a vibrating gold mesh driven by a piezo electric crystal (Kelvin probe S and CPD controller from Besocke Delta Phi). X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was acquired by Panalytical Empyrean diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The synchrotron-based in situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was conducted by the BL14B1 beamline at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). Corresponding X-ray beam possesses the wavelength of 1.24 Å at a grazing incidence angle of 0.3° and uses an energy of 10 KeV. Two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns were collected from a MarCCD 225 detector with a distance of 330 mm between samples and detector. The FIT2D software was employed to parse 2D GIWAXS patterns. GIWAXS patterns were presented in scattering vector q coordinates based on the equation q = 4πsinθ/λ, where θ is the half of diffraction angle and λ is the incident wavelength. In the processing of the GIWAXS data, the vector q was calibrated by measuring XRD from a Lanthanum hexaboride reference sample. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra were recorded by a FT/IR-4100 (JASCO) spectrometer, equipped with a universal attenuated total reflectance module. The polymer powder sample was prepared by grinding with potassium bromide (KBr) to produce a pellet, where polymer powder was mixed with KBr. The sample with the applied layer was pressed to the surface of the attenuated total reflection diamond crystal of the spectrometer. The perovskite film on glass was prepared by being cut into a small piece, and then pressed to the surface of the attenuated total reflectance diamond crystal. Water contact angle measurements for perovskite films were analyzed using a JC000DI optical contact-measuring system. We also conducted damp tests on perovskite films by placing them in 50% humidity air for 18 h to examine the resilience of the perovskite against moisture degradation. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained from LabVIEW software with a lab-built PL setup, which was installed a reflectance probe and a fiber-optic spectrometer from Ocean Insight. The PL measurements were performed by entering an integrating sphere through optical fiber, where the integration time was 300 ms and a 532 nm pulsed laser was used as excitation source. The device operational stability under the thermal cycling condition was measured without any encapsulation. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurements were conducted using TOF-SIMS 5-100 produced by ION-TOF GmbH. The aged completed devices by thermal cycling used a 30 keV Bi+ ion beam as the primary ion beam to peel the samples with an analysis area of 80 × 80 μm 2 . For the sputtering, a Cs beam (500 eV) was performed to obtain the desired depth profile, where the sputtering areas were 230 × 230 μm 2 for devices measurement. During these measurements, negative ion mode was used.

      <text> Lattice Strain Calculation For assessing the strain index σ of perovskite lattices, we utilize the 2θ-sin 2 φ method associated with Bragg's Law and generalized Hooke's Law, as (equation 2)  (39, 46) .  2 ) 𝜎 = 𝐸 (1+𝑣)𝑠𝑖𝑛 2 𝜑 • ( 𝑑 𝜑 -𝑑 𝑛 𝑑 𝑛 ) (Equation where φ and n are the scattering vector angles, pertaining to the perovskite film surface normal direction. For the out-of-plane and in-plane directions, we obtain that out-of-plane φ = 90° (⊥) and in-plane n = 0° (∥). Then it can be calculated that sin 2 φ = 1, as shown in (equation 3).  3 ) 𝜎 = 𝐸 (1+𝑣) • ( 𝑑 ⊥ -𝑑 ∥ 𝑑 ∥ ) (Equation Due to q = 2π/d, we further convert (equation 3) to (equation 4) as follows.  4 ) 𝜎 = 𝐸 (1+𝑣) • ( 𝑞 ∥ -𝑞 ⊥ 𝑞 ∥ ) (Equation We introduce ∆q to represent the difference between 𝑞 ∥ and 𝑞 ⊥ (∆𝑞 = 𝑞 ∥ -𝑞 ⊥ ). Since the change in the denominator 𝑞 ⊥ is negligible compared to that in the numerator ∆q, we can use a constant value 𝑞 0 to represent, resulting as (equation 5). 𝜎 = 𝐸 𝑞 0 (1+𝑣) • ∆𝑞 (Equation  5 ) where E is Young's modulus and v is Poisson's ratio of the perovskite film, respectively. E and v are evaluated as 10 GPa and 0.3, respectively. Also, the scattering vector constant q0 = 10.12 nm -1 is available  (47) (48) (49) . From the resultant (equation 5), we can observe that σ is proportional to ∆q value. The ∆q is calculated by subtracting the out-of-plane scattering vector qz value from that (qy) of in-plane. </text>

From the synchrotron-based grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) results in Fig.  S2 , the 180,000 MW polymer-based perovskite has the strongest peak intensity and the smallest full width at half maximum (FWHM).  The introduction of β-pV2F does not show a noticeable peak shift in X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig.  S4A ), indicating that the β-pV2F molecules are not incorporated into the perovskite crystal lattice. The broadening of the XRD peak usually results from low crystalline quality, while the reduced FWHM extracted from Fig.  S4B  is observed in target perovskite, revealing an improved film quality  (15) . We employed atomic force microscope (AFM) to analyze the topographical features of perovskite films. </text>

      <text> Fig. S6. The FT-IR spectra with fingerprint region of control and target perovskite films. We conducted Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) measurements to verify the interaction between β-pV2F and perovskite. The FT-IR spectrum at the higher frequency region of 2900-3100 cm -1 shows the asymmetric (νas) and symmetric (νs) stretching vibrational bands of -CH2 groups in β-pV2F molecule (Fig.  S6A ). After that, we observe the position of νas band shifts from 3025 cm -1 to 3019 cm -1 for the perovskite film treated with β-pV2F compared to the pristine β-pV2F molecule (Fig.  S6B ). The result indicates an interaction between -CH2 dipoles of β-pV2F and halide ions of [PbX6] 4-frame via C-H•••X dipole bonding  (50, 51) . As the growth proceeds, the long-chain β-pV2F are partially expelled to the perovskite film surface, the enhanced hydrophobicity (Fig.  S7 ). Fig.  S8 . GIWAXS profiles for perovskite films before and after damp tests (50% humidity air for 18 h). Fig.  S8  shows that the control film exhibits a significant drop in the diffraction signal after being damp, while the target film retains the diffraction peaks close to its initial state. This result further confirms the enhanced film hydrophobicity against moisture degradation. Fig.  S9  shows the enhanced photoluminescence (PL) intensity after introducing β-pV2F into perovskite, corresponding to a reduced defect-induced nonradiative recombination. Prolonging the illumination time to 1200 s does not lead to a decrease in the PL intensity (Fig.  S10 ), suggesting that the β-pV2F-based perovskite films have excellent photostability for overcoming photoinduced defect generation. To find the cause for the reduced charge recombination, we carried out the dark current densityvoltage (J-V) curves measurements for control and target devices. As displayed in Fig.  S11 , the dark current density of the target device is over an order of magnitude lower than that of the control device. It shows that the functionalization of β-pV2F suppresses the leakage current and the photogenerated carriers are effectively separated during the photoelectric conversion process  (22, 52) . This scenario allows the increase of the Voc in devices  (25, 26) . The trap concentration is assessed by measuring space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) curves. It can be obtained that, from the dark J-V curves of electron-only devices in Fig.  S12A , the trapfilled limit voltages (VTFL) are 0.46 V for control and 0.39 V for target, respectively manifesting the lower electron trap density in target devices. Additionally, the less hole trap density for target devices is shown in Fig.  S12B . These results confirm that the β-pV2F molecular functionalisation can eliminate trap states in the perovskite bulk and facilitate interfacial charge transfer  (21, 23) .      The hysteresis factors of control and target PSCs are 4.9% and 2.0%, respectively (Fig.  S18 ), thanks to reduced bulk defects and surface traps for charge recombination loss (3). We obtained a certified PCE of 24.24% from SIMIT with Jsc of 24.84 mA/cm 2 , Voc of 1.174 V and FF of 83.21% under an aperture area of 9.58 mm 2 (Fig.  S19 ), further supporting our results.                 From ToF-SIMS ion species depth profiles in Fig.  S37 , we observe ion migration occurred in the control device and suppressed in the target device. In target PSCs, β-pV2F is mainly distributed on the interface between perovskite and PCBM (Fig.  S37B ), where the polymer interlayer contributes to cut off ion migration route in addition to stabilized crystal structure by optimizing crystallization. Fig.  S38 . The strain release mechanism in target perovskite with temperature changes. The positively charged -CH2 dipoles on the long-chain β-pV2F molecule bind the perovskite halogen, dominating the release of the perovskite lattice strain. As shown in Fig.  S38 , the longchain interfacial interaction can release the strain of the inorganic [PbI6] 4-octahedron skeleton by pulling during changing temperatures. Due to the reduced lattice strain, the perovskite phase stability is improved. Fig.  S39 . The strain as a function of stretching lengths. (The strain (%) is calculated by dividing the q difference (Δq) by the q value.) Reporting the strain as a function of stretching length (Fig.  S39 ), we can observe that the polymer's introduction reduces the strain generation of perovskites during stretching.
