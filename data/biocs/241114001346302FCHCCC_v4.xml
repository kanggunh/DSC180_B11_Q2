      <text>From ToF-SIMS results in Fig.  1a , Cl -anions showed similar distribution with CN -from spacer species (AI + ). It was inferred that most Cl -anions have been incorporated into 2D perovskite lattices. However, we cannot exclude that some Cl -anions were located at the grain boundaries of 3D perovskite films and passivated the defects there. Certainly, Cl -</text>

      <text>anions also played a critical role in modulating the crystallization of 3D perovskites and contributed to improved crystallinity and ameliorated morphology. In fact, it was extensively revealed that Cl - anions can effectively regulate the perovskite crystallization and passivate the defects at grain boundaries (JACS 2014, 136, 13249; Adv. Funct. Mater. 2014, 24, 7102; Joule 2019, 3, 2179; Adv. Mater. 2021, 33, 2007126). Supplementary Fig.  12 .

The main bottlenecks limiting the photovoltaic performance and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are trap-assisted non-radiative recombination losses and photochemical degradation at the interface between perovskite and charge-transport layers. We propose a strategy to manipulate the crystallization o f m et hy la mm on iu m-free perovskite by incorporating a small amount of 2-aminoindan hydrochloride into the precursor inks. This additive also modulates carrier recombination and extraction dynamics at the b ur ied i nt er face v i a t h e formation of a bottom-up two-dimensional/three-dimensional heterojunction. The resultant inverted PSC achieves a power conversion efficiency of 25.12% (certified 24.6%) at laboratory scale (0.09 cm 2 ) and 22.48% at a larger area (1 cm 2 ) with negligible hysteresis. More importantly, the resulting unencapsulated devices show superior operational stability, maintaining &gt;98% of their initial efficiency of &gt;24% after 1,500 hours of continuous maximum power point tracking under simulated AM1.5 illumination. Meanwhile, the encapsulated devices retain &gt;92% of initial performance for 1,200 hours under the damp-heat test (85 °C and 85% relative humidity). Inverted (p-i-n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently drawn intensive attention, owing to their merits of compatibility with different bottom cells for tandem solar cells  1, 2  , low-temperature processability  3, 4  and excellent stability  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]  . Researchers have carried out numerous studies to improve the performance and stability of inverted PSCs, such as compositional engineering  10  , additive engineering  11, 12  , processing methods  13  and interface engineering  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [14] [15] [16]  . Although the efficiency of inverted PSCs has increased substantially over the years  12  , methylammonium (MA + ) and bromide (Br -) are usually employed to modulate the crystal growth and stabilize the photoactive black phase of formamidinium lead triiodide (α-FAPbI 3 )  4, 12, 17, 18  . However, since MA + was certified to easily volatilize and escape from the perovskite crystal lattices, large amounts of MA + doping (≥10 mol%) would cause material degradation of α-FAPbI 3 at high temperatures and thus reduce thermal stability of the corresponding PSCs  19, 20  . In addition, mixed halide (I/Br) perovskites inevitably suffer from phase segregation, which is exacerbated under light illumination and thermal ageing  [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25]  . In the long run, MA-and Br-free perovskite is highly desirable for the fabrication of long-term </text>

      <text> Characterization of MA-free perovskite films We adopted a stable MA-and Br-free perovskite composition (Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 PbI 3 ) as light absorber to maximize the performance of inverted PSCs. The perovskite film was fabricated through a one-step method. To regulate the crystallization of Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 PbI 3 films, we added a small amount of AICl into the perovskite precursor inks to form a 2D/3D heterojunction at the bottom interface. The chemical structure of AICl is shown in Supplementary Fig.  1 . The perovskite films and the relevant devices made with incorporation of AICl are hereafter denoted as 'target'. To form 2D perovskite at the bottom interface, we designed a large indan aromatic tail with large π-conjugation, which was attached to an ammonium A-site cation (-NH 3 </text>

      <text> + ). Owing to the large size of the indan aromatic skeleton, the solubility of AICl molecules in DMF/DMSO mixed solvents is very low (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). Meanwhile, the interactions between AI + and PbI 2 are stronger than that of FA + , which leads to easier formation of 2D perovskites than 3D perovskites, as evidenced by  1  H NMR spectra (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). Considering the low solubility and stronger interaction towards PbI 2 , we infer that an AI-based 2D perovskite ((AI) 2 (FA) n-1 Pb n I 3n-1 Cl 2 ) nucleate could form in the precursor inks. To verify this, we conducted dynamic light scattering measurements to investigate the colloidal properties of the precursor inks. As depicted in Supplementary Fig.  4 , a large colloid with particle size over 1 µm appeared in the target precursor, which may be the prenucleation cluster caused by AI + . Therefore, we can infer that AI + can preferentially react with PbI 2 to form a 2D perovskite crystallite in the precursor solution. The precrystallized 2D crystallites will sediment at the bottom interface, act as a seed crystal and provide nucleation sites for manipulating the crystallization of 3D perovskite crystals, which contributes to improved film quality (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig.  5 ). Therefore, it is speculated that the 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction should be successfully constructed at the bottom interface by incorporating well-designed AICl into the precursor ink. In comparison to the control perovskite film, the target film showed an improved morphology with larger sized grain domain (Supplementary Fig.  6 ). As a result of the improved morphology, the carrier mobility was increased from 17 cm 2 V -1 s -1 to 28 cm 2 V -1 s -1 after modification (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). It is worth noting that the charge-carrier mobility could be reduced slightly with increase of excitation intensity, and charge-carrier lifetime was also reduced due to the increase in bimolecular recombination losses  [38] [39] [40] [41]  . The photoluminescence and UV-visible absorption spectra show that the band gap and light-harvesting properties of the target perovskite film with the addition of AICl were unchanged (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). Next, we investigated the vertical distribution and form of existence of AICl salts in the perovskite films. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurements show that the 2D spacer species (AI + and Cl -) were accumulated at the perovskite/HTL interface in the target sample (Fig.  1a  and Supplementary Fig.  9 ). We performed 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to further investigate the formation of 2D perovskite at the bottom interface (Fig.  1b ). As expected, the 2D perovskite signal can only be detected with high incidence angle, which indicates that 2D perovskite was mainly formed at the bottom of 3D perovskite films. The target films exhibited diffraction q z peaks at ~0.3 to ~0.4 A -1 , indicating the formation of 2D perovskite crystals. We also investigated the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the target films by measuring from the front and back direction. As shown in Fig.  1c , the emission peaks at ~640 nm of 2D perovskites can only be detected from the back side, which demonstrates that the 2D perovskites were only formed at the bottom interface in the target films. These emission peaks were redshifted with respect to the dominant emission peak at ~492 nm of n = 1 2D perovskite ((AI) 2 PbI 2 Cl 2 ) (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). From these data we inferred that 2D perovskites (n ≥ 2) were formed at the 3D perovskite GBs at the buried interface, which was further supported by the theoretical calculations (Supplementary Fig.  11  and Supplementary Note 2). operationally stable perovskite solar cells  26  . To overcome the above problems, caesium (Cs + ) cations have been widely adopted to prepare more stable mixed cation perovskites Cs x FA 1-x PbI 3 (refs. 27,28). While the doping of a small amount (≤5 mol%) of Cs + has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy for stabilizing the α-FAPbI 3 (refs. 4,29,30), without the incorporation of MA + and Br -, it is still challenging to manipulate the crystallization dynamics of Cs x FA 1-x PbI 3 on a planar substrate, such as the hydrophobic poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) films. Therefore, a facile modulation approach for preparing MA + -and Br --free perovskite film should be urgently developed to further enhance the performance of inverted PSCs. Interfacial non-radiative recombination poses a serious challenge for the further advancement of the photovoltaic performance of inverted PSCs  31  . Recently, great efforts have been made to manipulate the perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) interface  4, [6] [7] [8]  . For example, Zhu and coworkers employed an organometallic compound (FcTc 2 ) to modify the perovskite/C60 interface and achieved an attractive performance due to effective defect passivation and ameliorated interfacial electron transfer  8  . In contrast to the perovskite/ETL top interface, the buried perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interface receives less attention. Considering most interfacial modulation molecules are easy to dissolve in polar solvents, that is, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), while spin-coating perovskite precursor solution, it is much more difficult to modulate the HTL/ perovskite buried interface compared with the top interface. The HTL/ perovskite buried interface contains a high density of deep-level trap states, which is much larger than that within the perovskite film  32  . The NiO x /perovskite interface also suffers from poor photostability because of interfacial reactions  33, 34  . In addition, the energy barrier at the buried interface leads to imperfect interfacial hole extraction and thus low photovoltaic performance  35, 36  . Consequently, it is urgently needed to minimize non-radiative recombination losses at the HTL/perovskite buried interface and enhance interfacial stability in inverted PSCs by facile interface engineering. Interestingly, Wakamiya and coworkers  37  modified the HTL/perovskite buried interface by directly incorporating glycine hydrochloride into the perovskite precursor ink. They revealed that the head group (-NH 3 + ) of GlyH + can bind to the surface of perovskite crystallites, which prefer to sediment at the bottom interface. Finally, the -NH 3 + head was towards the perovskite layer, while the tail group (-COOH) was anchored to HTL, forming an interfacial dipole and thus electric field, which accelerated hole extraction and transfer. This indicates that appropriate ammonium salts would self-assemble at the buried interface when it is introduced into the precursor solution. Since two-dimensional (2D) perovskites have been widely employed to modify grain boundaries (GBs) and the surface of three-dimensional (3D) perovskites  6, 7  , constructing a bottom-up 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction is highly desirable through incorporating tailored organic ammonium salts into the precursor ink. Herein we manipulated the crystallization of MA-free perovskite film (for example, Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 PbI 3 ) and minimized the interfacial non-radiative recombination losses simultaneously by incorporating a small amount of 2-aminoindan hydrochloride (AICl) into the perovskite precursor inks. This strategy enabled high-quality MA-free perovskite films with improved crystallization, fewer trap states and enhanced interfacial hole extraction and transport, which stabilized this important interface and minimized non-radiative recombination losses. The resultant inverted device delivered a PCE of 25.12% (certified 24.6%) at laboratory scale (0.09 cm 2 ) and 22.48% at larger device area (1 cm 2 ) with negligible hysteresis. Moreover, the resulting unencapsulated device demonstrated excellent operational stability by maintaining &gt;98% of its initial efficiency after 1,500 hours of continuous maximum power point (MPP) tracking under simulated AM1.5 illumination. The outstanding damp-heat stability was confirmed for an encapsulated device, which retained &gt;92% of the initial PCE value after 1,200 hours ageing at 85 °C and 85% relative humidity (RH). The cross-section of the target device was characterized by highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS; Supplementary Fig.  12 ). Cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) was used to prepare the TEM specimen without damaging the inherent structures of the perovskite layer  42  . As shown in Fig.  1d  and Supplementary Fig.  13 , a thin layer of 2D perovskites ((AI) 2 (FA) n-1 Pb n I 3n-1 Cl 2 ) could be clearly discerned at the GBs of the 3D perovskite layer at the buried interface, which is consistent with the TOF-SIMS, PL and GIWAXS results. Meanwhile, the formation of this unique 2D/3D heterojunction is independent of the types of substrate (Supplementary Fig.  14 ). In a word, the addition of a small amount of AICl into the perovskite precursor solution resulted in spontaneous formation of a bottom-up 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction at the buried interface, as illustrated in Fig.  1e . </text>

      <text> Investigation of interfacial carrier dynamics We next investigated the effect of the bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at the buried interface on the charge-carrier transport and recombination in the perovskite layer. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the control and target perovskite films deposited on the glass substrates are shown in Fig.  2a . According to previous reports, the rapid decay of the first stage is determined by the initial hole transfer and carrier capture, and the decay of the second stage is only related to non-radiative recombination  43, 44  . To simulate the TRPL data, we used the kinetic model described in our previous study  5  . From the simulations, we find that the carrier lifetime of perovskite films was increased from 762 ns (k 1 = 6.6 × 10 5 s -1 ) to 1,119 ns (k 1 = 4.5 × 10 5 s -1 ) after addition of AICl, indicating reduced defect density in the modified perovskite films. Additionally, the space charge-limited current measurements (Supplementary Fig.  15 ) further confirmed the decreased defect density through the addition of the AI + 2D spacer. The reduced defect density should be responsible for increased carrier lifetimes and carrier mobility, which resulted in inhibited trap-assisted non-radiative recombination. We then deposited perovskite films on NiO x /glass substrate and used the quenched τ 1 lifetimes to compare charge extraction (Fig.  2b ). The quenched τ 1 lifetime of the control film was 64.5 ns. After constructing the bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at the buried interface, the quenched τ 1 lifetime of the target film was reduced to 29.4 ns, implying considerably improved charge extraction. Fits to the TRPL transients were used to compute the differential lifetime using the model of Krogmeier et al.  45  (Supplementary Fig.  16 ). The charge-transfer process at early times (~100 ns) led to a faster rise of differential lifetime in the target film than the control film. The occurrence of non-radiative first-order recombination is marked by a transition from an increasing carrier lifetime to a flat period, implying a fundamental end of charge transfer. To quantify how the TRPL lifetime is related to surface carrier extraction, we further investigated these films using transient reflection spectroscopy (TRS), from which carrier diffusivity (D) and surface extraction velocity (SEV) could be extracted  [46] [47] [48]    </text>

      <text> Photovoltaic performance and long-term stability Next, we fabricated inverted PSCs with a structure of ITO/NiO x /PTAA/ Al 2 O 3 /Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 PbI 3 /PCBM/BCP/Ag. The optimal concentration of AICl was determined by comparing the device photovoltaic performance (Supplementary Fig.  18 ). The relevant devices made from the addition of 1.5 mg ml -1 AICl are hereafter denoted as 'target'. The average PCE value was increased from 21.94 ± 0.70% for the control device to   Ref.  55  Ref.  4  Ref.  8  Ref.  12  Ref.  7  Ref.  4  Ref.  16  Ref.  15  Ref.  14  Ref.  6      19  and Supplementary Table  2 ). We attained a PCE of 25.12% for the best-performing target device (J sc of 26.22 mA cm -2 , V oc of 1.165 V and FF of 82.2%), along with negligible hysteresis and a stabilized PCE of 25.05% (Fig.  3b  and Supplementary Fig.  20 ). One of the best-performing devices was validated by an independent solar cell accredited laboratory (National Photovoltaic Product Quality Inspection and Testing Center, China) for certification, where a PCE of 24.60% (with J sc = 25.69 mA cm -2 , V oc = 1.173 V and FF = 81.63%) was confirmed (Supplementary Fig.  21 ), which is higher than the values reported for all inverted PSCs based on MA-free perovskite reported to date (Fig.  3c  and Supplementary Table  3 ). Corresponding external quantum efficiency spectra (Supplementary Fig.  22 ) yielded an integrated J sc of 24.88 mA cm -2 for the target device and 23.92 mA cm -2 for the control device, which was just slightly lower than the values obtained from J-V measurements. The addition of AICl thus showed a marked improvement in PCE, which is associated with an enhanced V oc and FF, as well as J sc . The Mott-Schottky plots demonstrated a higher flat-band potential for the target device compared with the control device (Supplementary Fig.  23 ), which is directly related to an increase in V oc . Moreover, we found that the target device has a smaller ideality factor (n id ) than the control device (Supplementary Fig.  24 ), indicating the improved interfacial charge transfer/transport and suppressed non-radiative recombination channels, which accounts for the enhanced V oc and FF. The increase in J sc is ascribed to improved interfacial energy band alignment and thus charge extraction due to the formation of stepped band alignment induced by the bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at the perovskite/HTL interface  49  . The addition of AICl also contributed to the improved uniformity of the large-area perovskite films with less density of defects. As a result, in comparison to the control devices, the large-area target device with aperture area of 1.0 cm 2 showed better performance (Fig.  3d  and Supplementary Fig.  25 ). A champion PCE of 22.48% was obtained for the large-area target device, which is also the highest value among all large-area inverted PSCs reported so far (Supplementary Table  4 ). Furthermore, AICl additive is universal for various perovskite compositions, as demonstrated by the systematic absolute PCE enhancement of 1.2 to 2.6% for device performance (Supplementary Figs. 26 and 27 and Supplementary Table  2 ). </text>

      <text> Perovskite As a comparison, we also predeposited different amounts of AICl salts on the indium tin oxide (ITO)/HTL substrates before 3D perovskite formation (Supplementary Fig.  28 ), which is expected to form bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunctions according to previous reports  16, 27  . As shown in Supplementary Fig.  29a , it is clear that a 2D perovskite layer was formed at the bottom of the 3D perovskite film. However, the fabricated inverted PSCs with the bottom-up 2D/3D perovskite films show poor photovoltaic performance compared to the control device (Supplementary Fig.  29b ). These results further prove the advantages of our strategy of incorporating the 2D perovskite spacer into precursor inks. Finally, we evaluated the stability of the high-efficiency inverted PSCs under accelerated ageing conditions according to the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols  50  . The long-term operational stability of the unencapsulated control and target PSCs was evaluated by MPP tracking under constant simulated AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm -2 ). Both the target devices maintained over 98% of their initial PCE of &gt;24% after 1,500 hours of continuous tests at 55 ± 5 °C, whereas the control device degraded to 78% of its initial PCE of 21.73% (Fig.  3e ). Additionally, we conducted damp-heat measurements for the encapsulated devices at 85 °C in the 85% relative humidity-controlled chamber. As shown in Fig.  3f , the target device exhibited a T 90 (the time over which the device efficiency reduces to 90%) of &gt;1,000 hours under the heating stress and thus successfully passed the main point of ISOS qualification for thermally accelerated ageing conditions (ISOS-T-1). The enhanced thermal and operational stability can be attributed to a lower concentration of defects and the suppressed ion migration at the HTL/perovskite interface caused by the construction of the bottom-up 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction  6, 7  . Taken together, these data indicate that inverted PSCs with tailored bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at the buried interface exhibited excellent efficiency and stability, and this work takes an important step towards the realization of commercial perovskite-based single-and multiple-junction solar cells. </text>

      <text> Device fabrication ITO-coated glass substrates were etched by laser. The etched ITO glass was ultrasonically cleaned for 15 min using detergent, deionized water (twice) and ethanol (twice), sequentially. ITO-coated glass substrates were treated by ultraviolet ozone (UVO) for 30 min. Then, the 25 mg ml -1 NiO x NP aqueous ink was prepared by dispersing as-prepared NiO x NPs into deionized water and then spin-coating onto ITO glass at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The NiO x films were annealed at 150 °C for 10 min under ambient conditions. Then, the obtained NiO x films were immediately transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. PTAA solution (1 mg ml -1 ) in CB was spin-coated onto NiO x films at 6,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. After that, Al 2 O 3 dispersion solution (0.4 wt% in IPA) was spin-coated onto PTAA films at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Perovskite films with different compositions were deposited by the spin-coating method (details presented below). Subsequently, the 23 mg ml -1 of PC 61 BM solution in CB was spin-coated onto the perovskite films at 2,500 r.p.m. for 40 s. Then, 5 mg BCP was added into 1 mL IPA and shaken for 5 min to prepare a supersaturated solution, which was filtered using a PTFE filter before use. Afterwards, the obtained saturated solution was spin-coated on PC 61 BM film at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm Ag electrode with an active area of 0.11 cm 2 and 1.10 cm 2 was deposited by thermal evaporation for small-area and large-area devices, respectively. For FA 0.95 Cs 0.05 PbI 3 perovskite films, 1.4 M perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 228.4 mg FAI, 18.2 mg CsI and 645.4 mg PbI 2 and AICl (0, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 mg ml -1 ) in mixed solvents of DMF and DMSO (v/v, 4/1). The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on glass/ITO/NiO x /PTAA/Al 2 O 3 substrate at 2,000 r.p.m. for 10 s and then at 4,000 r.p.m. for 40 s. During the second spin-coating step, 150 µl CB was dropped onto the perovskite film at 5 s before the end of the programme. The resultant wet perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. For (FA 0.85 MA 0.15 ) 0.95 Cs 0.05 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 triple-cation perovskite films, 1.5 M perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing CsI, FAI, MABr, PbI 2 , PbBr 2 and AICl (0, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 mg ml -1 ) in 1 ml mixed solvents of DMF:DMSO (v/v, 5/1), where excess 10 mol% of PbI 2 was added to improve the device performance. A 60 µl perovskite solution was spin-coated onto glass/ITO/NiO x /PTAA/Al 2 O 3 substrate at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s.

      <text> Characterization of the solar cells The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of the devices were measured in ambient air (relative humidity was 40-50%) using an AM 1.5G solar simulator equipped with 450 W xenon lamp (Newport-2612A) and a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter. Light intensity was adjusted to AM 1.5G one sun (100 mW cm -2 ) with an NIM calibrated standard Si solar cell. J-V curves were measured in forward scan (from -0.1 to 1.2 V) and reverse scan (from 1.2 to -0.1 V). The active area of cells was defined to be 0.09 cm 2 or 1 cm 2 by a black metal mask. For incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency measurement, a Newport Instruments system (Newport-74125) coupled with a lock-in amplifier and a 300 W xenon lamp was employed. </text>

      <text> Characterization of the device stability The operational stability measurement of the unencapsulated devices was conducted under a continuous one-sun illumination (a light-emitting diode (LED) lamp without UV filter) at 55 ± 5 °C at MPP by using a MPP trace system (YH-VMPP-16) in a N 2 -filled glovebox for 1,500 h. According to the ISOS-T-1 standard, the stability measurement of the encapsulated devices was conducted at 85 °C and 85% RH in the constant temperature and humidity test chamber (HS-408L) for 1,200 h. The devices were encapsulated by UV adhesive (LT-U001, Lumtec) and a glass on top. As for J-V characterization, the PSCs were cooled to room temperature and measured by a Newport solar simulator (100 mW cm -2 ; 94023 A Oriel Sol3A, Class AAA) at AM 1.5G (calibrated via a standard silicon cell (Hamamatsu S1133)) and a Keithley 2420 SourceMeter (scan rate was 0.1 V s -1 ) at different time intervals. The devices used for damp-heat stability test were encapsulated. The devices were encapsulated in an N 2 atmosphere via a top glass and edge encapsulation of UV adhesive (LT-U001, Lumtec). The light spectrum of the LED lamp (Kaiyingerdun, 50 W, 5,000 K) and xenon lamp (Newport 94023A Oriel Sol3A, Class AAA) were used for MPP tracking and damp-heat stability tests, respectively (Supplementary Fig.  30 ). The top glass on the device was fixed by a tweezer and aligned with the edge of the device. Then, about 200 µl of UV adhesive was applied at the edge gap between the glass and the device. Finally, the UV adhesive was solidified by a UV curing process (XY2008-GHX-1) for 2 min. </text>

      <text> Cryo-focused ion beam specimen preparation and STEM-EDS measurements The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) specimen preparations were performed on an FEI Helios 5 dual-beam microscope equipped with a cryogenic system  42  . The bulk sample was placed on the cryo-stage and gradually cooled to about -140 °C by supplying liquid N 2 . After curing the organometallic precursor to form a Pt-C protective layer, a prism-shaped specimen was cut and transferred to a TEM grid. The subsequent sectioning was by fine milling and specimen transfer processes. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), EDS mapping and integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC)-STEM measurements were performed on a double Cs-corrected electron microscope (FEI Spectra 300) operated at 300 kV. The convergence semi-angle in the iDPC-STEM was 10.0 mrad. The probe current was about 1 pA. The dwell time was 5 µs per pixel, and the collection angle was 4-15 mrad.

      <text> TRS measurements TRS measurements were performed by a pump-probe spectrometer (TA-100, Time-Tech Spectra). A Ti:sapphire amplifier (Astrella, Coherent) was used to generate 800 nm light at 1 kHz repetition rate. The fundamental pulse was split into two parts. One part was sent to an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS, light conversion) for the generation of various pump wavelengths at 1.65 eV, 2.1 eV and 2.6 eV. The pump was chopped at a frequency of 500 Hz and attenuated by neutral density filter wheels. The other part of the fundamental pulse was focused into a sapphire crystal to generate a visible continuum (450-810 nm) that was used as the probe. The probe pulses were delayed in time with respect to the pump pulses using a motorized translation stage mounted with a retroreflecting mirror. The pump and probe were spatially overlapped on the surface of the sample. For transient reflectance measurement, the incident angle for the pump was around 0° and for the probe was around 45°. The initial carrier density was of the order of 10 16 cm -3 . For transient reflection kinetics, the measured surface carrier kinetics can be modelled with a diffusion and surface recombination/ transfer model. The carriers are generated with the profile N(x, 0) = N 0 e -αx (1) where N 0 is the initial surface carrier density. If the traces are normalized, then N 0 is equal to 1. The values for the absorption coefficient at different pump-photon energies for samples are known. where N(x, t) is the carrier density as a function of depth (x) and time (t), D is the ambipolar diffusion coefficient and τ B is the bulk carrier lifetime. Generally, in perovskite material, τ B is of the order of hundreds of ns, and in the 5,000 ps probe window it can be neglected. The boundary condition can be described as follows. For the front surface, surface recombination/transfer will dominate (S F ). For the back surface, surface recombination/transfer happens with S L . For pure perovskites, the back surface and front surface can be assumed to have the same surface recombination velocity. For samples with HTL, the front surface transfer velocity is different from the back, where the back (S L ) takes the value of pure perovskites. L is the thickness of the film. </text>

      <text> Time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements For time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements, the perovskite film samples were deposited on glass and excited with a fast nanosecond laser pulse (LO-TIS TII Nd:YAG Laser System LS-2145-OPO), which generated a certain amount of carriers within the sample. Subsequently, we probed the samples with a microwave and the reflected microwave intensity was monitored as a function of time following photo-excitation with a microwave analyser (N9915A FieldFox, Keysight). To enhance the sensitivity, we introduced a high-Q microwave cavity, which has a resonance frequency of ~4.3 GHz. The source power of the microwave was set at 1 mW, and the excitation laser wavelength was 530 nm with a pulse length of ~5 ns, repetition rate of 10 Hz and excitation fluence of ~0.3-30 µJ cm -2 , corresponding to a carrier density of 7.5 × 10 15 -7.5 × 10 17 cm -3 . 2 )Fig. 30 . 230 SupplementaryThe light spectra of the LED lamp and Xenon lamp used for MPP tracking and damp-heat stability tests, respectively. </text>
