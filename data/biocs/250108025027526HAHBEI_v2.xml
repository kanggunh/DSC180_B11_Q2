      <text> Perovskite Samples In order to totally remove water, CsI, PbI2 and PbBr2 powders were dried 12 h in a vacuum oven at 60 ºC. 0.04, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mol/L perovskite precursor-solutions were prepared in extra N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) using CsI (Aldrich, 99.9%), PbI2 (Aldrich, 99%) and PbBr2 precursors mixed for the CsPbI3-xBrx target composition in the appropriate molar ratio. The yellow perovskite precursor-solutions of 0.04, 0.1 and 0.2 mol/L in DMF were filtered by a 0.45 μm PTFE filter and then spin-coated, in a nitrogen glove box, onto either glass or ITO/glass substrates at 1500 rpm for 30 s and 3000 rpm for 60 s. In order to get thicker perovskite films, a higher concentration of 0.4 mol/L was used (at the solubility limit for the solution) with a spin-coating speed of 600 and 300 rpm for 30 s each, both followed with 1000 rpm for 60 s. All films were then transferred onto a hotplate for annealing at 160 ºC for 60 s. All films used in the main text were developed using a concentration of 0.2 mol/L, unless otherwise specified. Bulk materials were similarly synthesized, whereby crystallization took place in a static environment on glass substrates (i.e. drop cast). &#13;</text>

      <text> LED Device Fabrication The LED device fabrication was on an indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate with a sheet resistivity of ~109 Ω cm. First, the coated glass substrates were cleaned following the same protocol that was previously described  (36, 37) . Then a perovskites precursor-DMF solution of 0.2 mol/L was spin coated onto the ITO glass substrate (inside glove box) at 1500 rpm for 30s and then at 3000 rpm for 60s with accelerated speed of 1000 rpm. In order to get a homogenous film, the annealing process was at 160 ºC for 1 minute and was extended for 30s at 310 ºC in a nitrogen atmosphere. Following this, the electron injection layer of 2,2′,2"-(1,3,5-Benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBi) (60 nm) and lithium fluoride (1 nm) were deposited by thermal evaporation with vacuum pressure below10 -4 pa. To finish, a 150 nm-thick aluminum electrode was vapor deposited on top of the electron transporting layer. Finally, the devices were sealed by ultraviolet-curable resin in a nitrogen-filled glove box before testing. The device electrical output characteristics were measured in ambient air. &#13;</text>

      <text> Synchrotron-based Grazing Incidence Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) The GIWAXS data were collected at two different synchrotron light sources, using comparable wavelengths. European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SERF): Data from BM01 (SNBL/ESRF in Grenoble, France) was recorded using the PILATUS@SNBL diffractometer  (38) . The monochromatic beam (λ = 0.95774 Å) and the parameters of the detector were calibrated on LaB6 powder using PyFAI  (39) . The obtained calibrations were implemented in Bubble for further azimuthal integration of 2D images. The resulting unit cell models were refined using the Le Bail method in Fullprof  (40) . The sample was positioned in parallel to the synchrotron beam and optimal angle with a pronounced diffraction pattern was fixed for further variable temperature measurements. Temperature of the sample was controlled using a heated nitrogen blower, calibrated using the dependence of silver unit cell parameters, measured at the sample position. ALBA Synchrotron: Data were recorded at NCD-SWEET beamline (ALBA synchrotron in Cerdanyola del Vallès, Spain) with a monochromatic (λ = 0.95764 Å) X-ray beam of 80 × 30 µm 2 [H × V], using a Si (111) channel cut monochromator. The scattered signal was recorded using a Rayonix LX255-HS area detector placed at 241.1 mm from the sample position. The reciprocal q-space and sample-to-detector distance were calculated using Cr2O3 as calibrant. An incident angle (αi) of 1° was chosen to ensure full penetration of the X-ray beam through the layer. Continuous N2 flow over the sample was employed during the measurements. Collected 2D images were azimuthally integrated using PyFAI  (39) . &#13;</text>

      <text> Computational Methods All density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the VASP software package  (41, 42)  using the SCAN XC functional. Based on convergence tests for the energy and forces, the cut-off energy was set at 600 eV and 4×4×3 (γ-phase) or 6×4×2 (δphase) k-points were chosen. This leads to approximately the same k-point density for both phases (~50000 Å 3 ). The considered valence electrons were 5s 2 5p 6 6s 1 for Cs, 4d 10 5s 2 5p 2 for Pb and 5s 2 5p 5 for I. The electronic convergence threshold for the energy was set to 10 -6 and the ionic convergence threshold was 10 times larger. To elucidate the role of strain in the stability of the different CsPbI3 phases, the energies of different strained structures were compared. However, a mathematically meaningful comparison of the strain-induced energy difference between the phases is complicated by their different symmetries and unit cells, preventing the definition of strain across both black and yellow phases with respect to a single reference state. As explained below, we therefore applied a phase-specific strain related to the expected volume change with respect to the 300°C black phase, a quantity which is highly reliable  (16) . Starting from a black CsPbI3 thin film atop a glass substrate at 300°C, the material undergoes a volume decrease when the temperature is cooled down to 100°C (volume expansion coefficient of black phase: 11.8×10 -5 K -1 ). An additional 5% volume decrease occurs when the black phase transforms to the yellow phase (based on 0 K DFT calculations). We assume anisotropic effects of these volume changes to be evened out due to the polycrystallinity of CsPbI3. The average linear reduction can therefore be derived from the volume changes and is about 1% for the black phase at 100°C (in the γ-phase) and for the yellow phase at 100°C an extra 2% is added. Whereas this situation correctly describes the free CsPbI3 material (see main manuscript, Fig.  3B , top), the thin film is clamped to the substrate, which does not alter its dimensions much as a function of temperature. It is thus hindered to change shape in the xy-plane (see main manuscript, Fig.  3B, bottom ). This will result in an in-plane strain that is equal to the expected linear reduction. Due to the polycrystallinity, the xy-plane may coincide with different crystallographic planes of the black and yellow phases. 12 different planes were considered: (100), (010), (001), (1-10), (10-1), (110), (012), (  102 ), (120), (013), (  103 ) and (130). In our calculations, we mimicked the CsPbI3 strained at the interface. A biaxial strain of +1% (+3%) in the (001) plane, for example, was achieved by multiplying the 𝑎𝑎 ⃗ and 𝑏𝑏 � ⃗ unit vectors by 1.01 (1.03) and fixing them, while the 𝑐𝑐 ⃗ unit vector and ionic positions were able to relax (user-modified VASP version). Biaxial strains in the (010) and (100) plane were handled similarly. For other planes, the conventional supercell was transformed such that the planes under investigation coincided with the (001), (010) or (100) plane of the transformed unit cell. Note that strain can decrease the symmetry of the unit cell, especially for lowsymmetry planes. Therefore, the geometry optimization for strain on the (012), (  102 ), (120), (013), (  103 ) and (130) planes was done for supercells that are 3 times larger than the unit cell of the γ and δ phases (see also Figure  S14 ). For the (110) plane of the γ phase a supercell twice the size of the unit cell was used which led to a better convergence of the energy. The effect of strain on the energy for each plane is equal to the calculated energy of the biaxially strained unit cell minus the energy of the unstrained unit cell. The full set of results for each plane, together with the average, are shown in Table  S1 . &#13;</text>

      <text> Fig. S1. SEM images of CsPbI3 and CsPbI2.7Br0.3 samples prepared by spin coating (thin films and NCs) and drop cast depositions (powders). The thin films exhibit NCs ranging from roughly 50 -200 nm, while the powders have a larger needle-like morphological arrangement, defined by the stacking of crystals which are relatively long (approximately ranging from 5 to 15 µm). The contrasting morphology arising here is expected  (29)  given the different synthesis processes employed, in that the crystallization of CsPb(I1-xBrx)3 occurs during the evaporation of the solvent; both liquid depositions have roughly the same surface area, but different volumes, resulting is a different nucleation and crystallization kinetics. As detailed in the main text, this morphological difference is important, as the relatively different surface energy contributions will influence the thermal phase relations. &#13;</text>

      <text> Fig. S2. Schematic illustration of the scattering geometry of synchrotron GIWAXS measurements (ESRF) performed on perovskite thin films. The incident X-ray beam (λ = 0.95774 Å) scatters from the sample under a grazing angle, projecting ring-shaped diffraction signals onto the larger-area imaging detector which can sample with a high temporal resolution (0.1 -0.4 s/frame). The sample temperature is controlled through its immersion at the center of a heated N2 gas flow which has been calibrated using a reference silver crystal. Depending on the polycrystalline texture and anisotropic (micro)structure (i.e. biaxial strain), the in-plane (qxy) and out-of-plane (qz) scattering vectors and intensities may differ, differences which are resolved by selectively evaluating the relevant scattering axes. Only 2θ scans derived from integrating over the whole image (i.e. qx,y,z) are used for modelling and structural refinements within the main text. Measurements made at ALBA synchrotron are performed in the same way using a similar wavelength (λ = 0.95764 Å), though with lower temporal resolution (5 -10 s/frame). &#13;</text>

A double Gaussian peak fit has been applied to the (110) intensity, showing bi-modal peaks nearing 45° and 135°, with a full width at half maxima of approximately 55°. Note that this width distribution directly reflects the texture distribution parameter, φ, described in the main text.  Spontaneous Strain Analysis: The change in shape of the unit cell due to the phase transition is expressed in terms of the spontaneous strain, which we have defined in terms of the lattice parameters reported by  Marronnier et al.(16)  This quantity is always measured relative to the undistorted cell. For the phase transitions outlined here, the components of the spontaneous strain are defined as: e1 = (a -a0)/a0, e2 = (b -a0)/a0 and e3 = (c-a0)/a0, where a, b and c are the lattice parameters of the orthorhombic phase and a0 is the extrapolated lattice parameter of the cubic phase at a given temperature. Transitioning from a high-symmetry cubic, the degenerate symmetry-breaking distortions are respectively divided into tetragonal (et) and orthorhombic (eo) strains by: eo = e1 -e2 and et = (2e3-e1-e2)/√3.     001 ) and (110) Bragg peaks arising from in-and out-of-plane scattering, respectively. The Δd⊥ value derived from the split peaks is 1.64%, being comparable to the films deposited atop of glass (see Fig.  S12 ). The comparable strain values arise because the expansion coefficients (αT) of both ITO and glass are similar, residing between 4 ×10 -6 to 9×10 -6 K -1 .

For the (010) plane the conventional unit cell can be used. For the (01-1) plane the shape of the unit cell is changed such that the (010) plane of the new unit cell corresponds with the (01-1) plane of the conventional unit cell. For the (012) plane the size of the unit cell is tripled and the shape is changed such that the (001) plane of the new unit cell corresponds with the (012) plane of the conventional unit cell.    S2 ) of high-temperature phase transitions in polymorphic NCs and powders of CsPb(I1-xBrx)3 (x = 0, 0.05 and 0.1). All DSC data were recorded using a 5 °C/min temperature ramp, by first heating samples from 25 °C to 350 °C, and then cooling back across the same temperature range. Powders: Being thermally inactive below roughly 300 °C, we see the CsPbI3 powder only experiences a narrow peak upon heating up to 320 °C, whereby it undergoes an endothermic δ to α phase transition. A relatively broad exothermic peak cantered near 270 °C is observed in CsPbI3 upon cooling, indicating the return back to the yellow phase. There is a large difference between the center positions of the exothermic and endothermic peaks coming from the CsPbI3 powder, manifesting via thermal hysteresis, which is reportedly sensitive to moisture  (14) . The powdered CsPbI3 exothermic feature is clearly asymmetric; a similar DSC lineshape was also identified by  Dastidar et al. (14) , caused by the presence of the transient phase(s) intermediating the α to δ transition (i.e. β and γ). Through the substitutional replacement of iodine sites with smaller bromine atoms, we see qualitatively similar behavior for the mixed halide powders. There are some important differences; upon heating, the narrow δ to α endothermic feature is shifted to lower temperatures with a rising Br concentration, in parallel to a reduction in the exothermic onset temperature and peak center. Notably, bromine doping asymmetrically broadens the exothermic feature, toward lower temperatures. Together, this signifies an energetic stabilization of the metastable black phases bridging the α to δ transition. Nanocrystals: The size-driven differences observed between the NCs (scraped free from the thin film substrate) and the powders are distinct. During the heating ramp the NCs exhibit a δ to α transition temperature which is close to their powdered counterparts, along with an exaggerated high-temperature tail, which we assign (via GIWAXS experiments; data not shown) to an intermediate low-symmetry black phase(s) which disrupt the nominal transformation pathway (i.e. direct transformation of δ to α). The exothermic transition of the NCs is further asymmetrically broadened and shifted to lower temperatures, relative to the bulk materials. For the CsPbI3 NCs, a second smaller peak appears closer to RT (inset data), to finalize an incomplete high-temperature transformation. For the free Br-doped NCs, it is significantly more stable than the bulk, transitioning from black to yellow just below 100 °C. Clearly the NCs formed during spin coating are far more stable that the bulk materials synthesized via drop casting, an observation in line with the energy calculation of Zhao et al.  (21) .

      <text> Plane The first relates to the volatility of organic cations in methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA) lead halide systems, which promotes material degradation  (7) (8) (9) . The second arises from their polymorphic nature, whereby a roomtemperature (RT) stable black perovskite structure is not guaranteed  (10) . Implementing Cs + cations (i.e., CsPbI3) has allowed for both high solar cell conversion efficiencies (above 17%  (11) ) and improved environmental stability  (12, 13) . However, regarding phase stability, single-cation FA/CsPbI3 systems form a thermodynamically stable yellow RT δ-phase (non-perovskite) before undergoing reversible high-temperature phase transitions to their optically active black perovskite phases; α (cubic), β (tetragonal) and γ (orthorhombic). The thermal phase relations for CsPbI3 is depicted in Fig.  1A , with the relative transitions shown in Fig.  1B . The term "black" is used to define collectively the (pseudo-)cubic phases, as they typically exhibit similar optoelectronic properties. At RT, the black phase is unstable  (14, 15) . As seen in Fig.  1A , the black α-CsPbI3 perovskite can, depending on conditions, pass through a variety of different restructuring paths. The thermodynamically preferred cooling path (path 2) (  16 ) is mediated by the series of structural distortions (Fig.  1B ). When the requisite sample preparation and cooling rates are used, a RT black phase can persist (paths 3 and 4 in Fig.  1A ) in the form of a pseudo-cubic phase. A metastable black phase will only survive at RT when the strong driving force to transform into the yellow phase (path 5) is successfully countered. For example, upon mild reheating (60 -100°C), the metastable black phase (path 6) will normally turn yellow  (14, 15, 17)  once its saddle point is energetically overcome. Thus, the problem is how to form a stable black CsPbI3 perovskite for near-RT device operation. Recent findings offer a range of solutions, each following at least one of three general approaches: (i) forming nanocrystals (18-21), (ii) surface functionalization  (22) , and (iii) compositional tuning  (23) (24) (25) . Interestingly, when forming of a perovskite-substrate heterojunction in thin-film device architectures, tensile strain was recently shown to manifest at RT because of the large mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients (αT) of the perovskite layer (~50×10 -6 K -1 for lead iodide-based perovskites) and typical optically transparent substrates (both ITO and glass reside between 4 ×10 -6 to 9×10 -6 K -1 ). By definition, strain will push the competing perovskite phases into a relative state of thermodynamic unequilibrium  (26) (27) (28) . Within this context, strain engineering can favor formation of a desired phase or can even lead to new phases  (29) . For example, the strain introduced into CsPbI3 nanocrystals processed with hydroiodic acid  (28)  has been connected to improved stability. 1 Centre for Surface Chemistry and Catalysis, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, Leuven, 3001, Belgium. 2 Department of Chemistry, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, Leuven, 3001, Belgium. 3 Swiss-Norwegian Beamlines at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, 71 Avenue des Martyrs, F-38000 Grenoble, France. 4 Department of Chemistry, Western Washington University, 516 High Street, Bellingham WA 98225, USA. 5 Center for Molecular Modeling (CMM), Ghent University, Technologiepark 46, 9052 Zwijnaarde, Belgium. 6 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, 35 St George Street, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A4, Canada. 7 Departamento de Química Física, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, 02071 Albacete, Spain. 8 NCD-SWEET Beamline, ALBA Synchrotron Light Source, 08290, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Barcelona, Spain. 9 Polymer Chemistry and Materials, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, Leuven, 3001, Belgium. 10  The high-temperature all-inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite black phase is metastable relative to its yellow nonperovskite phase, at room temperature. Since only the black phase is optically active, this represents an impediment for the use of CsPbI3 in optoelectronic devices. We report the use of substrate clamping and biaxial strain to render stable, at room temperature, black phase CsPbI3 thin films. We used synchrotronbased grazing incidence wide angle x-ray scattering to track the introduction of crystal distortions and strain-driven texture formation within black CsPbI3 thin films when they were cooled following annealing at 330°C. The thermal stability of black CsPbI3 thin films is vastly improved by the strained interface, a response verified by ab initio thermodynamic modelling. &#13;</text>

      <text> Thermal unequilibrium of strained black CsPbI 3 thin films We report the use of interfacial clamping and strain to form a RT stable black phase of functional CsPbI3-based thin films. A combination of synchrotron-based grazing incidence wide angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and ab initio thermodynamic modeling reveal that substrate clamping drives texture formation (preferential alignment of domains within a polycrystalline system) and can create large biaxial strain. Strain beneficially shifted the relative free energies of the competing phases at RT. We elucidate the stabilizing roles of Br doping (≤10%) and thin film formation [i.e., nanocrystal (NC) formation and substrate clamping], and find that strain is a key enabler in the design of stable optoelectronic devices. We grew CsPbI3 materials using a solution-processing method previously reported  (30) , with the black phase accessed through thermal annealing (see Methods). Three material types were considered: powders (drop cast), thin films (spin coat) and free nanocrystals (NCs) scraped from the thinfilm substrate. Figure  S1  presents scanning electron microscopy data showing their differing morphologies, where the thin films exhibited the formation of NC grains (50 to 200 nm) and the powders appear bulk-like. Synchrotron-based GIWAXS was used (see fig.  S2  for experimental scheme) to resolve the structural state of a CsPbI3 thin film before and after thermal annealing at 330°C, as well as following thermal quenching (i.e., kinetically trapping the black phase using a RT metal slab; path 3 in Fig.  1A ). Figure  S3  presents the structural refinements of a δ-CsPbI3 thin film at RT and its α-phase (330°C), in line with result of Trots and Myagkota  (31) . A black phase was obtained at RT by kinetically trapping the thin film, hinting toward the role of the interface for suppressing the α-to-δ phase transformation. In situ GIWAXS experiments showed that the strained black thin film remains vulnerable to moisture attack, quickly destabilizing and turning yellow when exposed (fig.  S4 ). Figure  2A  displays the GIWAXS image detected from a black γ-CsPbI3 thin film shortly after quenching, highlighting occurrences of anisotropic peak splitting in-(qx,y) and out-(qz) ofplane (fig.  S5  shows the full GIWAXS image). This feature is a signature of crystallographic texture (preferential crystallographic orientation with distribution φ; see fig.  S6 ) in the quenched thin film, a signature not observed before or after gradual cooling (fig.  S7 ). Figure  2B  illustrates how this split GIWAXS signal arises after cooling; the CsPbI3 lattice forming an interface is lengthened in-plane when clamped, corresponding to a relative lattice reduction out-of-plane. Figure  2C  shows analysis of the 2θ scattering intensities generated along directions qx,y, qz and qx,y,z. Compared to the cubic α-phase (fig.  S3 ), a reduction in crystal symmetry is evident from the more complex scattering pattern  (16, 32) . Refining the qx,y,z data (via the Le-Bail method) using a γ-CsPbI3 structure (  16 ) provided an agreeable fit and yielded unit cell parameters a=8.629 Å, b=8.955 Å and c= 12.636 Å (vol. = 976.509 Å 3 ). Analyzing the GIWAXS image pixel intensities in Fig.  2A  as a function of the azimuthal angle, we are able to quantify the degree of texturing (fig.  S8 ). We find the intensity of the γ(002)/(020) scattering peaks maximise in-plane, while the γ(200) peak is normal to this. The γ(110) peak exhibits an out-of-plane bi-modal distribution (two maxima separated by ~90°), with the full width at half maxima for both being near 55°, providing a measure of the orientational distribution, φ. An illustration of the crystal texture derived from this analysis is provided in fig.  S9 . The texture was imposed by the symmetry of the initial high-temperature cubic unit cell. Any phase transition that results from a reduction in symmetry (forming an anisotropic cell) is paralleled by the formation of domains, e.g., a transition from a cubic (α) a to lower symmetry tetragonal phase (β) gives three equally probably domains. In an isotropic bulk α-CsPbI3 system, the domains have the same energy upon cooling and are equally probable. However, the situation changes after the introduction of an anisotropic strain field at the interface that energetically favors some domains, causing the longer lattice b-and c-axes to remain in-plane (fig.  S8 ). Compared with the bulk γ-CsPbI3 structure refined by Marronnier et al.  (16) , our thin film γ-CsPbI3 crystal was heavily distorted (fig.  S10 ) -a result of clamping strain and rapidly cooling the material from 330°C down to RT on a glass substrate. In quantifying the extent of crystal deformation, we assessed distortions using the split low-angle peak(s) nearing 2θ = 9° (inset of Fig.  2C ). These peaks arose during the α-toγ transition through a relative doubling of the c-axis [i.e., α(001) becomes γ(002)] and a reduction in the unit cell symmetry, whereby the (110) spacing is no longer equal to (002) in the pseudo-cubic β-or γ-phases. Considering the distortions in-and out-of-plane relative to the parent cubic, we evaluate the degree of biaxial anisotropy as follows: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 110 , 001 Δ 1 z x y d q d d q ⊥ = - ( 1 ) Here d is the interplane spacing in the direction noted. Because of the relative transformation of the c-axis length during the α-to-γ transition, d(001) represents the normalized spacing. For a quenched RT black CsPbI3 thin film; Δd⊥ = 1.65%. Two different types of strain act to increase the size of Δd⊥: (i) spontaneous strain, introduced by a change in unit cell shape during the phase transition(s), and (ii) strain at the film/substrate interface, induced by the thermal expansion mismatch. Spontaneous strain can be decoupled from our measurement by using the temperature-dependent changes in the bulk CsPbI3 lattice parameters, data recently reported by Marronnier et al.  (16) . Analyzing their (  16 ) data (see fig.  S10 ), Δd⊥ jumped to 1.18% during the α-to-β tetragonal distortion, and ceased to increase after forming an orthorhombic γ-phase. The value Δd⊥ = 1.18% after the tetragonal distortion represents the spontaneous strain contribution of the RT γ-CsPbI3 system, with an additional 0.47% arising in our thin film from substrate clamping. Thus, the effect of the interface is an out-of-plane structural relaxation of the same nature driven by the phase transitions (Fig.  1B ), leading to texture formation and a continuation of the spontaneous strain and anisotropy. To investigate whether the concept of strain-induced stabilization was a more general one, we explored the development of strain in the solution-processed thin films as a function of film thickness. With increasing thickness, the relative volume of the perovskite film that is subject to strain will decrease. The films studied in Fig.  2  are approximately 270 nm thick; so we varied the solution precursor concentration to prepare CsPbI3 thin films with thicknesses ranging from 135 nm up to nearly 1 μm (an upper limit constrained by solubility of precursor) and evaluated the structural state of their kinetically trapped RT black phase using GIWAXS (fig.  S11 ). The strain profile and texture properties are consistent across the film thickness range studied. Further, Δd⊥ retains a value close to 1.65%, though did decrease slightly to 1.62% for the thickest films (fig.  S12 ). For devices based on solution-processed perovskite thin films, this suggests substrate clamping and the formation biaxial strain to be centrally important. In a second stage, the properties of the thermodynamically preferred δ-phase material formation were investigated. A slowly cooled CsPbI3 thin film (-5°C/min) was tracked in situ in Fig.  1D  through an α-to-δ phase transition with GIWAXS time-temperature (t-T) profiling. The black-to-yellow phase change was identified by the introduction of δ peaks near 270°C and the fading of the black phase peak(s), which turn asymmetric with reduced crystallographic symmetry. The signals recorded in the qx,y,z and qz directions are compared in Fig.  2E  at the selected t-T values shown in Fig.  2D . Again, both strain and texture were established in the black phase during cooling, as seen by the distinct absence of γ(110) scattering in qx,y. Before the black phase disappeared, Δd⊥ increased throughout the phase change toward the expected spontaneous strain limit (~1.2% for purely spontaneous strain; see fig.  S10 ). The introduction of the yellow phase in Fig.  2E  underwent a contrasting evolution; the growth of δ-phase peaks upon cooling was paralleled by the loss of texture and strain within the polycrystalline thin film (fig.  S7 ). This result indicates that a sharp and clamped interface was lost once transformed to the yellow phase through strain release (i.e., plastic deformation), facilitated by the near-equilibrium transformation kinetics above 200°C. The constraint of the perovskite atoms at the interface was the cause for this; if the atoms were to remain affixed during a δ-phase restructuring, there would be an increased energy penalty for its formation. The blackto-yellow phase conversion involved a dramatic shift in the crystal volume  (16)  (per unit formula) and a total repositioning of atomic coordinates. The in situ XRD findings of Frolova et al.  (15)  visualized this directly, where their [001]oriented black films (grown by vapor deposition) became disordered after a transition to the yellow phase. They also assigned the results to the large mismatch in the structure of different crystal phase layers relative to the substrate. To investigate the influence of the strained interface on the relative stability of the α and δ phases, we monitored the local phase of a CsPbI3 thin film that was partly scraped (forming free NCs), as it is thermally quenched from 330°C (Fig.  3A ). From the optical images recorded in situ during the cooling ramp, the material that was still attached to the substrate became kinetically trapped at RT in the black phase, whereas the free NCs readily turned yellow below 230°C. This result confirmed the stabilizing role of the interface and its generated strain. To check whether the perovskite films respond in a similar way when clamped to other common interfaces, we evaluated the GIWAXS and phase behavior of CsPbI3 thin films deposited on ITO-coated glass substrates (possessing a similar αT value; see fig.  S13 ). The root mean squared (RMS) roughness of the ITO (3.1 nm) is far larger than the bare glass (1.1 nm), yet the strain profile, crystal texture properties and clamping-induced phase properties of thin films on the ITO surface are all comparable (fig.  S13 ). This extends the influence of substrate clamping and improved black phase stability across substrates possessing different roughness and chemical natures, suggesting such parameters to be unimportant in establishing a strained interface or a stable black thin film. To understand the strain-induced shifts in the energetic stability of the competing phases, periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations of strained and unstrained γ-and δ-CsPbI3 structures were performed (Fig.  3, B  and C ). Our approach (see Methods) first considered the average unstrained linear reduction ( ΔL ) of the CsPbI3 crystal when it was cooled to 100°C (where the black and yellow phases strongly compete energetically), which resulted in different degrees of relative contraction for γ and δ (16) (Fig.  3B ). Our experiments revealed that the interface in the RT black phase prevented shrinking along the in-plane direction, heavily distorting the crystal. As a result, cooling from 300° to 100°C introduced an in-plane biaxial strain of ~ 1%. Our DFT calculations using the SCAN functional (at 0 K) moreover showed that the equilibrium volume per formula unit of δ-CsPbI3 (229 Å 3 ) was substantially less than the γ-CsPbI3 (241 Å 3 ), forcing the strain to grow to ~3% if the material underwent a γ-to-δ phase transition, while remaining clamped. The quenched γ-CsPbI3 thin film was polycrystalline and expressed texture, whereas the crystallographic alignment was lost in the film upon transforming to the yellow phase. To account for this, 12 different crystal orientations were considered, resulting in 12 different strained interfacial planes, with the lower symmetry planes forming supercells (fig.  S14 ). Their energy increase upon straining is listed in table S1 and varied only slightly across the different surface orientations. The average relative energies determined from periodic DFT simulations are shown in Fig.  3C , showing that the unstrained yellow phase is strongly favored over the unstrained black phase; driving the γ-to-δ phase transition in free-standing crystals. However, the introduction of biaxial strain led to different energy penalties for the two phases. Importantly, there was a strong relative destabilization of the strained yellow phase with respect to the strained black phase. Thus, the energy difference promoting the γ-to-δ transition was reduced, explaining in part the stabilizing influence of substrate clamping we saw experimentally. An additional energy penalty may be present if release of the surface clamping is required, as suggested by the kinetic trapping of the CsPbI3 thin film. We never formed a RT black phase CsPbI3 thin film without kinetic trapping, with the limited lifetime of the black phase during slow cooling (Fig.  2D ) preventing a detailed study of the strain-induced restructuring. For this, we used relatively light Br halide mixing to better access the temperature-dependent black phase evolution, i.e., CsPb(I1-xBrx)3, x ≤ 0.1. Note that these materials retain both a band gap energy useful for solar cells (fig.  S15 ) and comparable material morphologies (fig.  S1 ). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies of CsPb(I1-xBrx)3 powders and NCs (fig.  S16 ) provided two pertinent types of data. First, size-driven effects are likely making the NCs formed during spin coating more stable than the bulk materials. A disparity in the surface energy between γ-CsPbI3 (0.13 J/m 2 ) and δ-CsPbI3 (2.57 J/m 2 ) is predicted  (21)  to reverse the relative magnitudes of their Gibbs free energies at crystal volumes approaching a ~100 nm 3 . The size of nanograins making up our thin films (fig.  S1 ) was near this regime. Second, although Br doping helped stabilize the black phase, the calculated enthalpies (table  S2 ) of the reversible yellow-to-black phase transitions were comparable (13 kJ/mol) and steady across the Br mixing explored. This result suggests that the phase transitions in our mixed halide samples closely followed the thermodynamics of the parent CsPbI3 system. Figure  4A  shows the GIWAXS t-T profile and strain state in a CsPbI2.7Br0.3 thin film through multiple phase transitions imposed during thermal cycling. The changes therein can be tracked following the successive phase transitions, whereas the emergence of texture induced by anisotropic strain results in azimuthal splitting; the latter effect can only be seen with a large area detector. Starting from δ-CsPbI2.7Br0.3, we saw the high-temperature formation of the α-phase (1), followed by β (2) and γ (3) distortion during cooling, which were reversed (2' and 3′) upon reheating. After an initial yellow-to-black transition, a thermodynamically stable black thin film with a strained interface is realized thereafter. This contrasts the unstable free NCs studied via DSC in fig.  S16 , which do not benefit from the stabilizing strained interface. For completeness, the sequence described above for thin film CsPbI2.7Br0.3 is compared to the nominal thermal phase relations of CsPbI3 in Fig.  1A . The textured GIWAXS signal (full image shown in fig.  S17 ) and the crystal structure of the RT γ-CsPbI2.7Br0.3 thin film is analogous to the quenched black CsPbI3 thin film (fig.  S4 ). The magnitude of Δd⊥ in the γ-CsPbI2.7Br0.3 thin film at RT reached 1.64% and reheating caused the strain-driven texture to be undone, reforming randomly distributed α-phase domains (see fig.  S18 ). Thus, besides hindering a decay to the δ-phase (fig.  S16 ), kinetically trapping a black CsPbI3 thin film incurred no additional structural modification. A temperature-domain structural analysis of the black CsPbI2.7Br0.3 thin film (Fig.  4B ) showed no considerable hysteresis between the different restructuring pathways (fig.  S19 ). We thus evaluate these data together; as the temperature difference (ΔT) increased, the interplanar distances d shifted relative to d0(ΔT = 0) by: d = d0(1 + αT×ΔT). Linear fits yielded the αT values shown in Fig.  4B  using high-temperature d0 values. Upon cooling the black film from 300°C, the lattice a-axis contracted smoothly with an expansion rate comparable  (31)  to the high temperature α-CsPbI3 (αT=4.0×10 -5 K -1 ). Near 200°C the cubic structure underwent a tetragonal distortion and the introduction of Δd⊥ through spontaneous strain formation. The in-plane (001) lattice underwent negative thermal expansion, reverting this in-plane lattice closer to the linear expansion rate of glass. The negative thermal expansion of the c-axis in this temperature range agreed well with the complex bulk structural evolution detailed by Marronnier et al.  (16)  (see fig.  S10  for full analysis), and underpinned the subsequent texture direction. Cooling through point 3 in Fig.  4B , the out-of-plane lattice continued its relatively fast reduction, whereas the in-plane spacing of the orthorhombic structure assumed positive thermal expansion [compensated by negative thermal expansion of the baxis  (16) ; see fig.  S10 ]. After the β-to-γ transition, Δd⊥ should not increase in a non-strained system. In our clamped thin film Δd⊥ grew rapidly and overshot spontaneous strain contributions, being driven solely by the strained interface. With rising strain, the relative destabilization of the yellow phase was only expected to continue. The small divergence of the in-plane CsPbI3 lattice parameter (crystal c-axis) from the expected linear contraction of the glass suggests that the perovskite/substrate interface resulted from the adaptable nature of the perovskite crystal, rather than covalent bonding. This is supported by our studies of strained films deposited on ITO-covered glass (S13). The strong mirroring of the structural evolutions during thermal cycling signified high elastic recovery. Together, clamping and interfacial strain combined as key driving forces in defining both the structural texture and the improved thermal phase relations of the black phase. Thus, once a δ-CsPbI2.7Br0.3 thin film was annealed at high temperatures, it became thermodynamically trapped in an optically active black phase (Fig.  1A ). Such thermal stability is highly desirable within optoelectronic devices; for instance, the energy provided by an LED driving current can readily destabilize the black phase  (33) . As a conceptual demonstrator, we fabricated and characterized a functioning LED device using a strained CsPbI2.7Br0.3 active layer (see fig.  S20  for full details). Without any optimization, the result is a working LED device with a visibly bright (luminance of 20 cd/m 2 at 9 V) and high color purity (CIE coordinates: 0.72, 0.28) emission.     S1 ). Note that the relative saddle point depth is undefined. The high-temperature, all-inorganic CsPbI 3 perovskite black phase is metastable relative to its yellow, nonperovskite phase at room temperature. Because only the black phase is optically active, this represents an impediment for the use of CsPbI 3 in optoelectronic devices. We report the use of substrate clamping and biaxial strain to render black-phase CsPbI 3 thin films stable at room temperature. We used synchrotron-based, grazing incidence, wide-angle x-ray scattering to track the introduction of crystal distortions and strain-driven texture formation within black CsPbI 3 thin films when they were cooled after annealing at 330°C. The thermal stability of black CsPbI 3 thin films is vastly improved by the strained interface, a response verified by ab initio thermodynamic modeling. T he use of solution-processed, organicinorganic metal halide perovskites for solar cells (1-5) is still limited by their instability within real-world devices (6) for two reasons. The first relates to the volatility of organic cations in methylammonium and formamidinium (FA) lead halide systems, which promotes material degradation  (7) (8) (9) . The second arises from their polymorphic nature, whereby a room-temperature (RT) stable black perovskite structure is not guaranteed  (10) . Implementing Cs + cations (i.e., CsPbI 3 ) has allowed for both high solar cell conversion efficiencies [above 17%  (11) ] and improved environmental stability  (12, 13) . However, regarding phase stability, single-cation FA/CsPbI 3 systems form a thermodynamically stable yellow RT d-phase (nonperovskite) before undergoing reversible, high-temperature phase transitions to their optically active black perovskite phases: a (cubic), b (tetragonal), and g (orthorhombic). The thermal phase relations for CsPbI 3 are depicted in Fig.  1A , with the relative transitions shown in Fig.  1B . The term "black" is used to define collectively the (pseudo-)cubic phases, as they typically exhibit similar optoelectronic properties. At RT, the black phase is unstable  (14, 15) . As seen in Fig.  1A , the black a-CsPbI 3 perovskite can, depending on conditions, pass through a variety of different restructuring paths. The thermodynamically preferred cooling path (path 2) (  16 ) is mediated by the series of structural distortions (Fig.  1B ). When the requisite sample preparation and cooling rates are used, an RT black phase can persist (paths 3 and 4 in Fig.  1A ) in the form of a pseudocubic phase. A metastable black phase will only survive at RT when the strong driving force to transform into the yellow phase (path 5) is successfully countered. For example, upon mild reheating (60 to 100°C), the metastable black phase (path 6) will normally turn yellow  (14, 15, 17)  once its saddle point is energetically overcome. Thus, the problem is how to form a stable black CsPbI 3 perovskite for near-RT device operation. Recent findings offer a range of solutions, each following at least one of three general approaches: (i) nanocrystal formation  (18) (19) (20) (21) , (ii) surface functionalization  (22) , and (iii) compositional tuning  (23) (24) (25) . When forming a perovskite-substrate heterojunction in thin-film device architectures, tensile strain was recently shown to manifest at RT  (26)  due to the large mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients (a T ) of the perovskite layer (~50 × 10 -6 K -1 for lead iodide-based perovskites) and typical optically transparent substrates [both indium tin oxide (ITO) and glass reside between 4 × 10 -6 and 9 × 10 -6 K -1 ]. By definition, strain will push the competing perovskite phases into a relative state of thermodynamic unequilibrium  (27) (28) (29) . Within this context, strain engineering can favor the formation of a desired phase or can even lead to new phases  (30) . For example, the strain introduced into CsPbI 3 nanocrystals processed with hydroiodic acid (29) has been connected to improved stability. We report the use of interfacial clamping and strain to form an RT-stable black phase of functional CsPbI 3 -based thin films. A combination of synchrotron-based, grazing incidence, wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and ab initio thermodynamic modeling revealed that substrate clamping drives texture formation (preferential alignment of domains within a polycrystalline system) and can create large biaxial strain. Strain beneficially shifted the relative free energies of the competing phases at RT. We elucidate the stabilizing roles of Br doping (≤10%) and thin-film formation [i.e., nanocrystal (NC) formation and substrate clamping], and find that strain is a key enabler in the design of stable optoelectronic devices. We grew CsPbI 3 materials using a solutionprocessing method previously reported  (31) , with the black phase accessed through thermal annealing (see the materials and methods). Three material types were considered: powders (drop cast), thin films (spin coat), and free NCs scraped from the thin-film substrate. Figure  S1  presents scanning electron microscopy data showing their differing morphologies; the thin films exhibited the formation of NC grains (50 to 200 nm), and the powders appear bulk-like. Synchrotron-based GIWAXS was used (see fig.  S2  for experimental scheme) to resolve the structural state of a CsPbI 3 thin film before and after thermal annealing at 330°C, as well as after thermal quenching (i.e., kinetically trapping the black phase using an RT metal slab; path 3 in Fig.  1A ). Figure  S3  presents the structural refinements of a d-CsPbI 3 thin film at RT and its a-phase (330°C), which is consistent with the result of Trots and Myagkota  (32) . A black phase was obtained at RT by kinetically trapping the thin film, hinting at the role of the interface for suppressing the a-to-d phase transformation. In situ GIWAXS experiments showed that the strained black thin film remained vulnerable to moisture attack, quickly destabilizing and turning yellow when exposed to moisture (fig.  S4 ). Figure  2A  displays the GIWAXS image detected from a black g-CsPbI 3 thin film shortly after quenching, highlighting occurrences of anisotropic peak splitting in-plane (q x,y ) and out-of-plane (q z ) (fig.  S5  shows the full GIWAXS image). This feature is a signature of crystallographic texture (preferential crystallographic orientation with distribution ϕ; see fig.  S6 ) in the quenched thin film, a signature not observed before or after gradual cooling (fig.  S7 ). Figure  2B  illustrates how this split GIWAXS signal arises after cooling; the CsPbI 3 lattice forming an interface is lengthened in-plane when clamped, corresponding to a relative lattice reduction outof-plane. Figure  2C  shows analysis of the 2q scattering intensities generated along directions q x,y , q z, and q x,y,z . Compared with the cubic a-phase (fig.  S3 ), a reduction in crystal symmetry is evident from the more complex scattering pattern  (16, 33) . Refining the q x,y,z data (with the Le-Bail method) using a g-CsPbI 3 structure (  16 ) provided an agreeable fit and yielded unit cell parameters a = 8.629 Å, b = 8.955 Å, and c = 12.636 Å (volume = 976.509 Å 3 ). Analyzing the GIWAXS image pixel intensities in Fig.  2A  as a function of the azimuthal angle, we were able to quantify the degree of texturing (fig.  S8 ). We found that the intensity of the g(002)/(020) scattering peaks maximized in-plane, whereas the g(200) peak was normal to this. The g(110) peak exhibited an out-of-plane bimodal distribution (two maxima separated by ~90°), with the full width at half maxima for both being near 55°, providing a measure of the orientational distribution, ϕ. An illustration of the crystal texture derived from this analysis is provided in fig.  S9 . The texture was imposed by the symmetry of the initial high-temperature cubic unit cell. Any phase transition that results from a reduction in symmetry (forming an anisotropic cell) is paralleled by the formation of domains, e.g., a transition from a cubic (a) to a lower-symmetry tetragonal phase (b) gives three equally probable domains. In an isotropic bulk a-CsPbI 3 system, the domains have the same energy upon cooling and are equally probable. However, the situation changes after the introduction of an anisotropic strain field at the interface that energetically favors some domains, causing the longer lattice b-and c-axes to remain in-plane (fig.  S8 ). Compared with the bulk g-CsPbI 3 structure refined by Marronnier et al.  (16) , our thin-film g-CsPbI 3 crystal was heavily distorted (fig.  S10 )-a result of clamping strain and rapidly cooling the material from 330°C down to RT on a glass substrate. In quantifying the extent of crystal deformation, we assessed distortions using the split low-angle peak(s) nearing 2q = 9°(inset of Fig.  2C ). These peaks arose during the a-to-g transition through a relative doubling of the c-axis [i.e., a(001) becomes g(002)] and a reduction in the unit-cell symmetry, whereby the (110) spacing is no longer equal to (002) in the pseudocubic bor g-phase. Considering the distortions in-and out-of-plane relative to the parent cubic, we evaluated the degree of biaxial anisotropy as follows: Dd ⊥ ¼ 1 À d ð110Þ ðq z Þ d ð001Þ ðq x;y Þ ð1Þ Here, d is the interplane spacing in the direction noted. Because of the relative transformation of the c-axis length during the a-to-g transition, d (001) represents the normalized spacing. For a quenched RT black CsPbI 3 thin film, Dd ⊥ = 1.65%. Two different types of strain act to increase the size of Dd ⊥ : (i) spontaneous strain, which is introduced by a change in unit cell shape during the phase transition(s), and (ii) strain at the film/substrate interface, which is induced by the thermal expansion mismatch. Spontaneous strain can be decoupled from our measurement by using the temperature-dependent changes in the bulk CsPbI 3 lattice parameters, data recently reported by Marronnier et al.  (16) . By analyzing their data (see fig.  S10 ), we found that Dd ⊥ jumped to 1.18% during the a-to-b tetragonal distortion and ceased to increase after forming an orthorhombic g-phase. The value Dd ⊥ = 1.18% after the tetragonal distortion represents the spontaneous strain contribution of the RT g-CsPbI 3 system, with an additional 0.47% arising in our thin film from substrate clamping. Thus, the effect of the interface is an out-of-plane structural relaxation of the same nature driven by the phase transitions (Fig.  1B ), leading to texture formation and a continuation of the spontaneous strain and anisotropy. To investigate whether the concept of straininduced stabilization was a more general one, we explored the development of strain in the solutionprocessed thin films as a function of film thickness. With increasing thickness, the relative volume of the perovskite film that is subject to strain will decrease. The films shown in Fig.  2  were ~270 nm thick, so we varied the solution precursor concentration to prepare CsPbI 3 thin films with thicknesses ranging from 135 nm up to nearly 1 mm (an upper limit constrained by the solubility of precursor) and evaluated the structural state of their kinetically trapped RT black phase using GIWAXS (fig.  S11 ). The strain profile and texture properties were consistent across the film thickness range studied. Further, Dd ⊥ retained a value close to 1.65%, although it did decrease slightly to 1.62% for the thickest films (fig.  S12 ). For devices based on solution-processed perovskite thin films, this suggests substrate clamping and the formation biaxial strain to be centrally important. In a second stage, the properties of the thermodynamically preferred d-phase material formation were investigated. A slowly cooled CsPbI 3 thin film (-5°C/min) was tracked in situ (Fig.  1D ) through an a-to-d phase transition with GIWAXS time-temperature (t-T) profiling. The black-toyellow phase change was identified by the introduction of d peaks near 270°C and the fading of the black phase peak(s), which turn asymmetric with reduced crystallographic symmetry. The signals recorded in the q x,y,z and q z directions are compared in Fig.  2E  at the selected t-T values shown in Fig.  2D . Again, both strain and texture were established in the black phase during cooling, as seen by the distinct absence of g(110) scattering in q x,y . Before the black phase disappeared, Dd ⊥ increased throughout the phase change toward the expected spontaneous strain limit (~1.2% for purely spontaneous strain; see fig.  S10 ). The introduction of the yellow phase in Fig.  2E  underwent a contrasting evolution; the growth of d-phase peaks upon cooling was paralleled by the loss of texture and strain within the polycrystalline thin film (fig.  S7 ). This result indicates that a sharp and clamped interface was lost once the film transformed to the yellow phase through strain release (i.e., plastic deformation), facilitated by the near-equilibrium transformation kinetics above 200°C. The constraint of the perovskite atoms at the interface was the cause for this; if the atoms were to remain affixed during a d-phase restructuring, then there would be an increased energy penalty. The black-to-yellow phase conversion involved a marked shift in the crystal volume  (16)  (per unit formula) and a total repositioning of atomic coordinates. The in situ XRD findings of Frolova et al.  (15)  visualized this directly; their [001]-oriented black films (grown by vapor deposition) became disordered after a transition to the yellow phase. They also attributed the results to the large mismatch in the structure of different crystal phase layers relative to the substrate. To investigate the influence of the strained interface on the relative stability of the a and d phases, we monitored the local phase of a CsPbI 3 thin film that was partly scraped (forming free NCs), as it is thermally quenched from 330°C (Fig.  3A ). From the optical images recorded in situ during the cooling ramp, the material that was still attached to the substrate became kinetically trapped at RT in the black phase, whereas the free NCs readily turned yellow below 230°C. This result confirmed the stabilizing role of the interface and its generated strain. To investigate whether the perovskite films respond in a similar way when clamped to other common interfaces, we evaluated the GIWAXS and phase behavior of CsPbI 3 thin films deposited on ITO-coated glass substrates (possessing a similar a T value; see fig.  S13 ). The root mean square roughness of the ITO (3.1 nm) is far larger than that of the bare glass (1.1 nm), yet the strain profile, crystal texture properties, and clamping-induced phase properties of thin films on the ITO surface are all comparable (fig.  S13 ). This extends the influence of substrate clamping and improved black-phase stability across substrates possessing different roughness and chemical natures, suggesting that such parameters are unimportant in establishing a strained interface or a stable black thin film. To understand the strain-induced shifts in the energetic stability of the competing phases, periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations of strained and unstrained gand d-CsPbI 3 structures were performed (Fig.  3, B  and C ). Our approach (see the materials and methods) first considered the average unstrained linear reduction (DL) of the CsPbI 3 crystal when it was cooled to 100°C (where the black and yellow phases strongly compete energetically), which resulted in different degrees of relative contraction for g and d (16) (Fig.  3B ). Our experiments revealed that the interface in the RT black phase prevented shrinking along the in-plane direction, heavily distorting the crystal. As a result, cooling from 300°to 100°C introduced an in-plane biaxial strain of ~1%. Moreover, our DFT calculations using the SCAN (strongly constrained appropriately normed) functional (at 0 K) showed that the equilibrium volume per formula unit of d-CsPbI 3 (229 Å 3 ) was substantially less than that of the g-CsPbI 3 (241 Å 3 ), forcing the strain to grow to ~3% if the (A) GIWAXS image acquired from a thermally quenched RT CsPbI 3 thin film, with expansions over selected diffraction peaks azimuthally split in the in-plane (q x,y ) and out-of-plane (q z ) directions.

      <text> RESEARCH | REPORT Downloaded from  https://www.science.org  at University of California San Diego on November 07, 2024 material underwent a g-to-d phase transition while remaining clamped. The quenched g-CsPbI 3 thin film was polycrystalline and expressed texture, whereas the crystallographic alignment was lost in the film upon transforming to the yellow phase. To account for this, 12 different crystal orientations were considered, resulting in 12 different strained interfacial planes, with the lowersymmetry planes forming supercells (fig.  S14 ). Their energy increase upon straining is listed in table  S1  and varied only slightly across the different surface orientations. The average relative energies determined from periodic DFT simulations (Fig.  3C ) show that the unstrained yellow phase is strongly favored over the unstrained black phase, driving the g-to-d phase transition in free-standing crystals. However, the introduction of biaxial strain led to different energy penalties for the two phases. There was a strong relative destabilization of the strained yellow phase with respect to the strained black phase. Thus, the energy difference promoting the g-to-d transition was reduced, explaining in part the stabilizing influence of substrate clamping that we saw experimentally. An additional energy penalty may be present if release of the surface clamping is required, as suggested by the kinetic trapping of the CsPbI 3 thin film. We never formed an RT black-phase CsPbI 3 thin film without kinetic trapping, with the limited lifetime of the black phase during slow cooling (Fig.  2D ) preventing a detailed study of the straininduced restructuring. For this, we used relatively light Br halide mixing to better access the temperature-dependent black-phase evolution, i.e., CsPb(I 1 -x Br x ) 3 , x ≤ 0.1. These materials retain both a band-gap energy useful for solar cells (fig.  S15 ) and comparable material morphologies (fig.  S1 ). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies of CsPb(I 1-x Br x ) 3 powders and NCs (fig.  S16 ) provided two pertinent types of data. First, sizedriven effects likely make the NCs formed during spin coating more stable than the bulk materials. A disparity in the surface energy between g-CsPbI3 (0.13 J/m 2 ) and d-CsPbI3 (2.57 J/m 2 ) is predicted  (21)  to reverse the relative magnitudes of their Gibbs free energies at crystal volumes approaching ~100 nm 3 . The size of nanograins making up our thin films (fig.  S1 ) was near this regime. Second, although Br doping helped to stabilize the black phase, the calculated enthalpies (table  S2 ) of the reversible yellow-to-black phase transitions were comparable (13 kJ/mol) and steady across the Br mixing explored. This result suggests that the phase transitions in our mixed halide samples closely followed the thermodynamics of the parent CsPbI 3 system. Figure  4A  shows the GIWAXS t-T profile and strain state in a CsPbI 2.7 Br 0.3 thin film through multiple phase transitions imposed during thermal cycling. The changes therein can be tracked after the successive phase transitions, whereas the emergence of texture induced by anisotropic strain results in azimuthal splitting; the latter effect can only be seen with a large area detector. Starting from d-CsPbI 2.7 Br 0.3 , we saw the hightemperature formation of the a-phase (1), followed by b (2) and g (3) distortion during cooling, which were reversed (2' and 3′) upon reheating. After an initial yellow-to-black transition, a thermodynamically stable black thin film with a strained interface was realized. This is in contrast to the unstable free NCs studied by DSC (fig.  S16 ), which do not benefit from the stabilizing strained interface. For completeness, the sequence described above for thin-film CsPbI 2.7 Br 0.3 was compared with the nominal thermal phase relations of CsPbI 3 in Fig.  1A . The textured GIWAXS signal (full image shown in fig.  S17 ) and the crystal structure of the RT g-CsPbI 2.7 Br 0.3 thin film is analogous to the quenched black CsPbI 3 thin film (fig.  S4 ). The magnitude of Dd ⊥ in the g-CsPbI 2.7 Br 0.3 thin film at RT reached 1.64%, and reheating caused the strain-driven texture to be undone, reforming randomly distributed a-phase domains (see fig.  S18 ). Thus, in addition to hindering a decay to the d-phase (fig.  S16 ), kinetically trapping a black CsPbI 3 thin film incurred no additional structural modification. A temperature-domain structural analysis of the black CsPbI 2.7 Br 0.3 thin film (Fig.  4B ) showed no considerable hysteresis between the different restructuring pathways (fig.  S19 ). We thus evaluated these data together; as the temperature difference (DT) increased, the interplanar distances d shifted relative to d 0 (DT = 0) by d = d 0 (1 + a T × DT). Linear fits yielded the a T values shown in Fig.  4B  using high-temperature d 0 values. Upon cooling the black film from 300°C, the lattice a-axis contracted smoothly with an expansion rate comparable  (32)  to the high-temperature a-CsPbI 3 (a T =4.0×10 -5 K -1 ). Near 200°C, the cubic After the b-to-g transition, Dd ⊥ should not increase in a nonstrained system. In our clamped thin film, Dd ⊥ grew rapidly and overshot spontaneous strain contributions, being driven solely by the strained interface. With rising strain, the relative destabilization of the yellow phase was only expected to continue. The small divergence of the in-plane CsPbI 3 lattice parameter (crystal c-axis) from the expected linear contraction of the glass suggests that the perovskite/substrate interface resulted from the adaptable nature of the perovskite crystal rather than from covalent bonding. This is supported by our studies of strained films deposited on ITOcovered glass (S13). The strong mirroring of the structural evolutions during thermal cycling signified high elastic recovery. Clamping and interfacial strain combined as key driving forces in defining both the structural texture and the improved thermal phase relations of the black phase. Thus, once a d-CsPbI 2.7 Br 0.3 thin film was annealed at high temperatures, it became thermodynamically trapped in an optically active black phase (Fig.  1A ). Such thermal stability is highly desirable within optoelectronic devices; for instance, the energy provided by a light-emitting diode (LED)-driving current can readily destabilize the black phase  (34) . As a conceptual demonstrator, we fabricated and characterized a functioning LED device using a strained CsPbI 2.7 Br 0.3 active layer (see fig.  S20  for full details). Without any optimization, the result is a working LED device with a visibly bright (luminance of 20 cd/m 2 at 9 V) and high color purity (CIE coordinates: 0.72, 0.28) emission. Fig. S4 . S4 Fig. S4.
