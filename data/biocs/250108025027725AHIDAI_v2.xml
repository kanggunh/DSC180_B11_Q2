      <text>The primary precursors used in this study are butylamine (99.5%, Sigma), methylamine (33 wt% in ethanol, Sigma), PbI 2 (98%, TCI), and N,N-dimethylformamide (anhydrous, 99%, Sigma), acetonitrile (anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma) butylammonium iodide (Dyesol), and tetrabutylammonium iodide (Sigma). All other amines were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Linear PEI (MW = 10,000) was purchased from Sigma. The butylammonium iodide and tetrabutylammonium iodide were not exposed to atmosphere due to their hygroscopic nature. The solution chemistry and sample preparation were mainly performed inside of a N 2 filled glovebox to exclude the effects of moisture and oxygen. However, it was observed to proceed similarly in atmosphere. In addition to the precursors listed above, two different purities of PbI 2 from Alfa Aesar were also examined. The higher purity (99.999% by trace metals) PbI 2 also reacted readily with amines. Solutions where PbI 2 was reacted with methylamine:ethanol in DMF were allowed to react at room temperature for several days to ensure some amide formation. The PbI 2 /butylamine reaction product samples for XRD and XPS were prepared in a N 2 glovebox by drop casting 10 μL of solution onto a clean 1 cm x 2.5 cm glass substrate at 110 o C and annealing for 20 min. The PbI 2 /PEI was fabricated in an N 2 glovebox by spin coating PbI 2 (200 mg/mL in DMF, 4000 rpm for 35 s), annealed at 75 o C for 15 min, followed by spin coating linear-PEI (~1 mg/mL in chlorobenzene, 4000 rpm for 60 s). The MAI:PbI 2 (0.8:1 ratio, 345 mg of PbI 2 per mL of DMF) with and without methylamine additive were spin coated onto a 3 cm x 3 cm ITO substrate at 5300 rpm for 35 s also in an N 2 glovebox. A solvent exchange with toluene was performed at 4 s after the start of spinning, and the films were annealed at 75 o C for 15 min. A Bruker D8 Discover X-ray Diffractometer with a Cu X-ray tube, monochromating Göebel mirror, scintillation detector, and 0.6 mm divergence slits was used to obtain Bragg-Brentano geometry XRD patterns. A Thermo-Scientific K-Alpha X-ray Photoemission Spectrometer at a base pressure of 5x10 -8 mbar using an Al anode at a power of 72 W, hemispherical analyzer, pass energy of 50 eV, and 400 μm X-ray beam spot size was used to obtain XPS spectra. A flood gun was used to neutralize the non-conductive, drop cast samples. 1 H-NMR spectra were recorded using a JEOL ECA-500 at room temperature, and chemical shifts were referenced to the chloroform peak at 7.26 ppm and DMF at 8.0 ppm. The PbI 2 •butylamine complex was prepared by reacting PbI 2 with butylamine for 2 hours at 65 o C. The mixture was then diluted in deuterated chloroform and filtered with a 450 nm PTFE syringe filter. The filtered solution continued to react forming more precipitates. After several filtrations, the solution was suitable to collect a 1 H-NMR spectrum. TGA was performed in dynamic rate mode with a nominal rate of 50 o C/min, sensitivity of 1% mass change/min, and resolution of 4. Samples for TGA were prepared by reacting 200 mg of PbI 2 in 1 mL in DMF with 2 molar equivalents of butylamine at 65 o C for at least 2 hours to form a considerable amount of precipitate. The DMF containing excess PbI 2 , BAI, and butylamine was decanted and the solid precipitate was washed 3 more times with 3 mL of ACN. The Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for Journal of Materials Chemistry C. This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018 solid was dried under vacuum for 8 h before loading into the TGA where it was dried at 150 o C for 10 min prior to starting a scan. Photoluminescence measurements were performed on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 photoluminescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 550 nm. Acid/Base Chemistry of a variety of Pb salts. A variety of primary and secondary amines reacted with PbX 2 salts (X = Cl, Br, I, and NO 3 ). Tertiary amines and salts of PbX (such as X = SO 4 ) were not observed to react. Salient observations include azobenzene formation between aqueous Pb(NO 3 ) 2 and aniline and gelation when PbBr 2 was reacted with butylamine in DMF under certain conditions.      Fig.  S7 . XRD versus time of a drop cast film of PbI 2 solvated in a butylamine atmosphere and subsequently encapsulated in PMMA by spin coating (50 mg/mL in chlorobenzene at 4000 rpm giving roughly 300 nm of PMMA). The peak at low angle decreases over time as the solvate loses butylamine at room temperature which is only slowed by the PMMA. The peaks near 2θ ≈ 6.4 o are very near to that of BA 2 PbI 4 which is expected to form from a PbI 2 •butylamine solvate exposed to atmosphere due to a reaction with water.      Figure Figure S2.

      <text> Figure Figure S6. (a) Solutions of PbI 2 in DMF (200 mg/mL) with additives ratios from left to right: methylammonium iodide (MAI):butylamine (ba):PbI 2 (molar ratio 1:1:1), formamidinium iodide (FAI):ba:PbI 2 (molar ratio 1:1:1), and ba:MAI:PbI 2 (molar ratio 0.5:0.5:1) in DMF at a concentration of 200 mg/mL with respect to PbI 2 . The solutions were reacted for one month at room temperature. The FAI and MAI deficient solutions produced an insoluble product which is clearly illustrated by the Tyndall effect (b). The ba:MAI:PbI 2 0.5:0.5:1 solution illustrates that any excess of PbI 2 w.r.t. MAI in solution is available participate in acid-base reactions with free amines. &#13;</text>
