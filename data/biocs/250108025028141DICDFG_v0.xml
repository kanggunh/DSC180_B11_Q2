      <text>We performed 1 H-NMR to support our proposed reaction products for 3-APy. Supplementary Fig.  2  shows the spectra of 3-APy, MAI + 3-APy, and FAI + 3-APy in DMSO-d6. It is clear from these data that FA + and 3-APy react to form a unique product, whereas MAI and 3-APy simply exchange acidic NH protons. Our results show that a reaction has nearly fully occurred between FA + and 3-APy within 10 minutes at room temperature, which does not rule out a faster reaction time, as this is the minimum amount of time it takes to go from sample preparation to completing the measurement. Before concluding these data as direct evidence for our proposed surface mechanism, we need quantitative integration proving a 1:2:3 H-shift ratio of the protons involved in the condensation reaction product (MPyFA, see Scheme above). Unfortunately, clean integration of chemical shifts ascribed to these protons is complicated by the FA "formic" CH peak and broad NH proton peaks overlapping with the MPyFA formic proton. Additionally, the NH3 chemical shifts are un-resolvable at this pH and temperature given how rapidly proton exchange is occurring.&#13;</text>

      <text>results quantitatively agree with the expected ratio of CH:CH2:NH4 = 1:2:4 to within expected uncertainty of this measurement (note the ammonia H ratio is not 3 because it is protonated by HI). Supplementary Fig.  3 . (a) Downfield and (b) upfield 1 H-NMR of the FAI + 3-APy after spiking with 2 µL HI. The "formic" C-H protons in the products are identified slight downfield from the FA CH, and display the similar fine-splittings as the FA CH. The NH4 + is visible as a triplet with ~51 Hz splitting centered near 7.1 ppm. The methylene -CH2-protons corresponding to different isomers for the MPyFA product are located 4.6-4.9 ppm in (b). 400 MHz in DMSO-d6. For reference, and to justify our integration of three different -CH2-peaks, the three possible isomers of MPyFA are depicted in Supplementary Fig.  4 , acknowledging both the possibility for resonance and isomers to manifest in the spectra when the proton exchange rate is negligible. Supplementary Fig.  4 . Different resonance structures and isomers of the 3-MPyFA condensation product that can contribute to three different -CH2-peaks anticipated for the methylene C. Finally, we characterized a set of samples to check for the unlikely event of a reaction between FA + and the pyridine (Py) nitrogen, i.e. -investigate the possibility of chemistries occurring besides the ammonia condensation reaction we propose. As shown in Supplementary Fig.  5 , the peaks for pyridine in the presence of excess FAI are unchanged from the control, demonstrating the amine nitrogen is the reactive group toward the FA + molecule. &#13;</text>

      <text> Supplementary Note 2. Transient reflectance (TR) analysis TR measurements were performed at 400, 600, and 700 nm excitation. By using various wavelengths for excitation, we are able to excite different volumes of the film due to changes in the absorption coefficient of the material. This means that pump wavelengths with higher photon energies (such as 400 nm) will cause a greater initial build-up of photogenerated charge carriers at the surface of the film than pump wavelengths with lower photon energies (such as 700 nm). The distribution of photogenerated charge carriers can be well described using a onedimensional diffusion model (Equation S1), which allows for a quantitative analysis of the photogenerated carrier population over time and at different film depths. The one-dimensional diffusion model shown below was used where N(x,t) is the carrier density as a function of film depth (x) over time (t), τB is the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers in the bulk, and D is the ambipolar diffusion coefficient of charge carriers in the film. By assuming that the initial carrier generation happens instantaneously and within the time resolution of the pump excitation pulse, the initial carrier concentration at the surface of the film can be found using 𝑁𝑁 0 = 𝛼𝛼(1 -𝑅𝑅)𝐽𝐽 0 (S2) where N0 is the initial carrier density, α is the absorption coefficient at the chosen pump wavelength, R is the reflectance of the pump, and J0 is the carrier density (calculated by the measured power output and measured spot size of the excitation pulse). To solve the diffusion model, boundary conditions were set with the following conditions: where M is the film thickness and SRV is the surface recombination velocity. The assumption was made that the SRV at the front and back sides of the film do not vary significantly, which has been shown to be a valid assumption in previous reports. Additionally, the bulk recombination is considered to be negligible in the time window of the experiment (2.5 ns) since the bulk recombination typically occurs on a much longer time scale (&gt;5 ns). While the film thickness is a known value, this system of equations cannot be solved analytically and must be solved using a backward finite difference method. By using the numerical solution N(0,t), the TR kinetic traces (Figs.  3a, b ) at the various pump wavelengths used are modeled with a global fit method which utilizes the above diffusion model and boundary conditions. &#13;</text>

      <text> Supplementary Note 3. External radiative efficiency (ERE) measurement and analysis PL emission was measured using 632.8-nm excitation (HeNe laser). To calculate an excitation fluence (in photons cm -2 s -1 )), the excitation beam size was determined with a CCD camera beam profiler (Thorlabs BC106N-VIS/M). We assumed that 1-sun equivalent fluence for our 1.53-eV absorber is 1.73×10 17 photons cm -2 s -1 , and we adjusted the excitation fluence to this level. To measure PL emission spectra, Princeton Instruments HRS300 spectrograph with dual Si CCD (Pixis F100) and InGaAs (PyLoN IR) detectors was used. To correct spectral responses of both detectors, commercial calibration sources (IntelliCal for vis and IR ranges, Princeton Instruments) were placed at the sample position. Corrected PL emission spectra measured with two detectors were identical at 1.30-1.38 eV, confirming small band tails for control and target solar cells. Spectral integration at 1.30-1.90 eV was used to determine integrated PL intensity, and integrated PL emission intensity is plotted vs. excitation fluence in the inset of Fig.  3d . To report PL emission spectra in absolute units (photons cm -2 eV -1 s -1 ), we used the same setup to measure excitation laser light scattering from reflectance standards (2%, 5%, and 99%, LabSphere Inc). We normalized PL spectra using the data where reflectance values were known, and in this way obtained absolute PL emission spectra (Fig.  3d ). Supplementary Fig.  17 . Analysis of perovskite bandgap from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum by taking its derivative spectrum. The bandgap was estimated to be about 1.53 eV.   Supplementary Table 1  Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with an inverted structure (often referred to as the p-i-n architecture) are attractive for future commercialization owing to their easily scalable fabrication, reliable operation and compatibility with a wide range of perovskitebased tandem device architectures 1,2 . However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of p-i-n PSCs falls behind that of n-i-p (or normal) structure counterparts  [3] [4] [5] [6]  . This large performance gap could undermine efforts to adopt p-i-n architectures, despite their other advantages. Given the remarkable advances in perovskite bulk materials optimization over the past decade, interface engineering has become the most important strategy to push PSC performance to its limit  7, 8  . Here we report a reactive surface engineering approach based on a simple post-growth treatment of 3-(aminomethyl)pyridine (3-APy) on top of a perovskite thin film. First, the 3-APy molecule selectively reacts with surface formamidinium ions, reducing perovskite surface roughness and surface potential fluctuations associated with surface steps and terraces. Second, the reaction product on the perovskite surface decreases the formation energy of charged iodine vacancies, leading to effective n-type doping with a reduced work function in the surface region. With this reactive surface engineering, the resulting p-i-n PSCs obtained a PCE of over 25 per cent, along with retaining 87 per cent of the initial PCE after over 2,400 hours of 1-sun operation at about 55 degrees Celsius in air. &#13;</text>

      <text> Supplementary Tables During the past decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been widely studied as a promising alternative photovoltaic technology  6  . Although the perovskite composition is still undergoing fine-tuning and improvement for specific applications, the perovskite field has accumulated various processing strategies for optimizing perovskite bulk materials, including their structure, crystallinity, defects and other optoelectronic properties  [9] [10] [11]  . As a result, interface and surface modification has become vitally important to ensure further advances in the areas of charge extraction, interface recombination and device stability  7, 8, 12, 13  . At present, the record single-junction PSC efficiencies are all based on n-i-p architectures, which are associated with the optimized electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite absorber layer  8, 14  . However, the standard doped hole transport layer (HTL) in the n-i-p structure presents a challenge for simultaneously achieving both high efficiency and excellent operational reliability. The p-i-n cell structure represents an attractive option for PSC commercialization owing to its low-temperature processing and compatibility with large-scale fabrication  15, 16  . Much progress on long-term operation has been reported for p-i-n PSCs 1 . Moreover, the p-i-n-structure-based perovskite tandem solar cells have demonstrated efficiencies surpassing those of single-junction PSCs  2, 17, 18  . Despite these attractive features, the performance of single-junction p-i-n PSCs has historically fallen behind that of n-i-p PSCs  19  . The performance of p-i-n devices has seen clear improvement in recent years, mainly owing to strategies to improve perovskite quality and interfacial properties  [3] [4] [5] 13  . However, the performance gap is still large, and significant efforts are required to accelerate p-i-n PSC development to its full potential for various applications. PSCs have two critical junctions at the perovskite/ETL and perovskite/HTL interfaces, and their quality has been correlated with device performance, including power conversion efficiency (PCE), photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) hysteresis, and stability and reliability  [20] [21] [22]  . Thus, realizing high-quality junctions is key to achieving high PSC performance. During perovskite-film processing, the top-surface region is prone to defect formation owing to easier escape of volatile species such as organic molecules and iodine; thus, top-surface engineering is particularly important to push p-i-n PSCs to a new level. An ideal surface engineering approach for p-i-n PSCs should: (1) not negatively affect the bulk quality of the perovskite film; (2) not produce materials hindering charge transfer; (3) reduce the density of unwanted defects; and/or (4) have a surface region that creates a built-in electric field, ensuring effective electron extraction and reducing carrier recombination. Here we demonstrate that a simple reactive surface engineering approach using the organic amine small-molecule 3-(aminomethyl) pyridine (3-APy, where Py denotes pyridine) can achieve these outcomes and, consequently, improve all photovoltaic parameters for p-i-n cells, amounting to a PCE greater than 25% as well as good operational stability, that is, 87% of the initial PCE for over 2,400 h at about 55 °C. &#13;</text>

      <text> Surface reaction We first explain our design strategy of selecting 3-APy for surface treatment. Creating a built-in electric field in the surface region represents a promising approach for minimizing surface recombination and enhancing charge extraction. As good perovskite absorbers typically exhibit weak p-type conductivity or intrinsic nature, generating iodine vacancies, which are shallow donors, in the surface region is a preferred method to create the built-in electric field. The formation of a positively charged iodine vacancy (V I ) can be promoted by introducing a molecule with a negatively charged Py ring owing to their electrostatic attraction. To allow for the incorporation of the molecule without significantly perturbing the lattice in the surface region, it is better for the molecule to contain a formamidinium (FA) unit as its head. This will allow the FA unit to be incorporated into the A site of the lattice, displaying no barrier for charge transfer. In addition, the Py-ring unit will be left outside to promote the formation of a V I nearby. 3-APy is a good candidate for this purpose. It has been shown that organic amine small molecules can react with FA 1+ cations to form bulkier amidinium 1+ cations. For example, methylamine readily reacts with a FA 1+ cation, forming a N-methylformamidinium 1+ cation and releasing an ammonia (NH 3 ) molecule  23  . 3-APy contains both a Py ring and an amine group, and is expected to react with FA 1+ to form a 1+ cation composed of an 'FA cation unit' with an attached Py ring. The reaction is depicted in Fig.  1a , where the surface FA + reacts with 3-APy, forming MPyFA + (N-(3-methylpyridine) formamidinium) and releasing NH 3 . Indeed, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed a reaction energy of 0.72 eV, supporting a spontaneous (thermodynamically favourable) reaction. We also experimentally verified this reaction, as discussed in Supplementary Note 1. We now describe the effect of 3-APy treatment of the perovskite surface, the composition of which is Rb 0.05 Cs 0.05 MA 0.05 FA 0.85 Pb[I 0.95 Br 0.05 ] 3 , where MA is methylammonium. The 3-APy solution was applied to the perovskite surface by spin-coating. We conducted atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to examine the impact of 3-APy treatment on the surface topography and potential distribution. Figure  1b  shows that for the control sample, the perovskite surface consists of clear steps (or terraced edges), which are normally an indication of highly crystalline perovskite  7, 12, 24  . However, the corresponding surface potential map shows that the steps cause strong potential fluctuations (Fig.  1c ). It is worth noting that various surface defects can modify the potential distribution of the perovskite surface  25  . Figure  1d  compares the line scan of the topography and surface potential variations from a typical perovskite region, as shown in Fig.  1b, c . These potential fluctuations can be up to about 50-100 mV over a length scale of about 10-20 nm. The steps on the perovskite surface are also probably more active/reactive and effective surface defects able to cause variations in local surface charge. In contrast, the 3-APy treatment drastically smoothed out these steps and suppressed the surface potential variations (Fig.  1e-g ; more comparison in Supplementary Fig.  7 ). The reaction-induced 'polishing' effect is also verified by scanning electron microscopy images (Supplementary Fig.  8 )-the perovskite  &#13;</text>

      <text> Article surface without 3-APy treatment shows obviously terraced structures, whereas the 3-APy treatment shows a much smoother surface, which is consistent with the topography results observed in Fig.  1a, d . This reactive surface engineering approach showed negligible impact on X-ray diffraction (Supplementary Fig.  9 ) and ultraviolet-visible (Supplementary Fig.  10 ), consistent with the 3-APy treatment being primarily a surface modification. A smoother, less defective surface is expected to be beneficial for improving the perovskite/ETL main junction  26, 27  . &#13;</text>

      <text> Interfacial properties More importantly, we found that the 3-APy treatment can modify the energetics of the perovskite surface, creating a built-in electric field that should favour electron extraction and reduce charge recombination. We utilized ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to characterize the energetics of the perovskite film with and without 3-APy treatment. The secondary electron cut-off (SECO) and the valence band maximum (VBM) spectra are shown in Fig.  2a . The 3-APy treatment reduced the work function from about 4.77 eV to 4.21 eV and shifted the VBM from about 0.80 eV to 1.51 eV, creating favourable surface energetics and band bending for extracting electrons and blocking holes (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted to understand the chemical changes at the surface. Survey spectra, core-level spectra and compositional ratios are shown in Supplementary Figs. that is consistent with the C=CH-N/C-CH=N pyridinic bonds of 3-APy (Supplementary Fig.  15e ,f)  29  . Turning to the N 1s, we see a slight increase in the higher binding-energy peak that is consistent with the proposed reaction, which converts one of the lower-binding-energy C=NH 2 + / C-NH 2 amidine from FA to a pyrrolic C-NH-C bond  28  . Moreover, we see no significant change to the peak at a lower binding energy, consistent with the aforementioned reaction being compensated by signals from the pyridinic C-N=C group of 3-APy  30, 31  . The iodine deficiency is consistent with the observed effective n-type doping and reduced work function associated with 3-APy treatment, because a V I is a shallow donor  32  . We also conducted DFT calculations to understand the mechanism leading to the observed n-type Fermi-level shift induced by the 3-APy surface treatment. For simplification, we chose FAPbI 3 for DFT modelling, as it represents the main component used in this study. The DFT results are shown in Fig.  2d-g . We found that transforming surface FA + via 3-APy treatment into MPyFA + (a reaction product) on the surface can reduce the formation energy of a charged V I by 0.19 eV. This reduced formation energy is consistent with the observed iodine deficiency and effective n-type doping in the surface region upon 3-APy treatment, and it is mainly owing to the electrostatic attraction between the positive charge of the V I and the negative charge on the Py-ring side of MPyFA + , which is consistent with the significant rearrangement of the MPyFA cation (Fig.  2f, g ). &#13;</text>

      <text> Optoelectronic properties We conducted transient reflection spectroscopy to study the effect of 3-APy treatment on surface charge carrier dynamics (Fig.  3a, b  and Supplementary Note 2). With the 3-APy treatment, the effective surface recombination velocity decreased by one order of magnitude, from about 1.9 × 10 3 cm s -1 (control) to 0.2 × 10 3 cm s -1 (target). The ten-times reduction of the surface recombination velocity with 3-APy treatment is consistent with the improved surface potential distribution and the surface field induced by the n-type Fermi-level shift associated with the treatment. Furthermore, time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements showed an improved average weighted carrier lifetime (from about 1.7 µs to 2.1 µs; Supplementary Table  1 ) with the 3-APy treatment (Fig.  3c ). Another good way to investigate optoelectronic properties is to measure the absolute photoluminescence of the devices. The photoluminescence intensity is a direct measure of the carrier density in the perovskite absorber and the corresponding quasi-Fermi-level splitting. Figure  3d  compares the absolute intensity photoluminescence of the control and target perovskite films in the p-i-n device configuration. The external radiative efficiency increased from about 0.4 ± 0.1% (control) to 2.0 ± 0.1% (target) at about 1-sun-equivalent photon fluence (about 1.7 × 10 17 cm -2 s -1 ) (Supplementary Note 3). This corresponds to a 42-mV gain in quasi-Fermi-level splitting, which is associated with the reduction of non-radiative recombination enabled by the 3-APy treatment. The inset in Fig.  3d  shows that after the 3-APy treatment, the slope of integrated photoluminescence intensity versus excitation fluence decreased from about 1.9 ± 0.1 to 1.6 ± 0.1, indicating reduced interface recombination  33  . &#13;</text>

      <text> Device characteristics We examined the impact of 3-APy treatment on the device characteristics using a typical p-i-n cell stack: glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/ MeO-2PACZ/Rb 0.05 Cs 0.05 MA 0.05 FA 0.85 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 /lithium fluoride (LiF)/C 60 /bathocuproine (BCP)/silver (Ag), where MeO-2PACZ denotes [2-(3,6-Dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid and is a self-assembled monolayer for hole-selective contact  34  .

      <text> Article stack is shown in Supplementary Fig.  16 . The perovskite film thickness is about 860 nm, with grains spanning across the film thickness. Figure  4a  compares the PSCs based on the pristine perovskite (control) and 3-APy-treated perovskite (target). The 3-APy treatment increased the PCE from 23.39% (reverse)/22.18% (forwards) to 25.49% (reverse)/25.27% (forwards), owing to improvements in all parameters (Supplementary Table  2 ). The corresponding stabilized power (SPO) was 22.85% and 25.35% for the control and target devices, respectively (Fig.  4a , inset). Moreover, the short-circuit current density J sc reached &gt;26 mA cm -2 for the target cell, which is consistent with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) results (Fig.  4b ). Analysis of the EQE spectrum suggests a bandgap of about 1.53 eV (Supplementary Fig.  17 ), which is consistent with the optical absorption measurement (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). It is noted that the device hysteresis is also reduced for the target device. The improvements in these photovoltaic parameters validate the hypothesis that the observed enhancement in structural, interfacial and optoelectronic properties associated with the 3-APy treatment, as discussed in connection with Figs.  1 2 3 , is directly relevant to photovoltaic performance. The combination of the improved J sc , open-circuit voltage (V oc ) and fill factor (FF) was further verified based on statistical comparison of the photovoltaic parameters from 72 control and 246 target devices, with an average PCE enhancement ranging from 22% to 24.4% (Supplementary Fig.  18 ). Among these target devices, a maximum V oc of about 1.19 V (Supplementary Fig.  19 ) and a maximum FF of about 86% (Supplementary Fig.  20 ) were achieved, both with PCEs of about 25%. These results further attest to the effectiveness of the reactive surface modification with 3-APy in improving the interface for enhancing charge extraction with reduced recombination loss. One such device was measured by an accredited photovoltaic laboratory, obtaining a certified stabilized PCE of 24.05 ± 0.48% using an 11-point asymptotic P max (maximum power) scan protocol (Supplementary Fig.  21 ), along with J-V scans yielding a reverse-scan PCE of 25.37% and forwards-scan PCE of 25.06% (Supplementary Fig.  22 ). We found that our reactive surface treatment also worked effectively for other FA-based perovskites (Supplementary Figs.  23  and 24 ) as well as various 3-APy-related molecules (Supplementary Fig.  25 ), making our approach a general strategy for improving p-i-n device performance. It is worth noting that surface treatment using the 3-APy-based iodide salt (3-APyI 2 )-which can form a two-dimensional surface layer-does not improve p-i-n device performance (Supplementary Fig.  26 ), probably owing to interfacial energy misalignment  13  . Furthermore, 3-APy surface treatment in n-i-p devices significantly decreased device performance (Supplementary Figs.  27  and 28 ), which confirms that n-type surface doping is ideal for p-i-n device operation, but it is detrimental to n-i-p devices. This result underscores the broader importance of designing surface treatment strategies that are both chemistry and functionality specific to a particular charge extraction interface. Finally, we investigated the operational reliability of encapsulated devices aged under continuous light illumination at about 55 °C in ambient air (Fig.  4c ). These devices were biased with fixed resistance loads near the maximum power point during illumination. The target device retained about 87% of its initial maximum PCE after 2,428 h, whereas the control kept only 76% over 1,368 h. We further examined the operation stability of unencapsulated target device at 65 °C under 1.2-sun continuous illumination in nitrogen (ISOS-L-2I). The device retained 90% of its maximum PCE after 1,315 h (Supplementary Fig.  29a ). Moreover, the damp heat (85 °C and 85% relative humidity; ISOS-D-3) test showed that the device retained 94% of its maximum PCE after 850 h (Supplementary Fig.  29b ). Taken together, our results suggest that the reactive surface engineering using 3-APy is an effective approach to significantly enhance p-i-n PSC performance to state-of-the-art levels of efficiency and operational reliability. &#13;</text>

      <text> XPS and UPS measurements XPS and UPS measurements were performed on a Kratos AXIS-Supra in the Surface Science Facility at the UC Irvine Materials Research Institute. X-ray radiation was produced by a monochromatic Al Kα excitation centred at 1,486.6 eV. UPS radiation was produced by ionizing helium i (energy 21.22 eV). XPS survey spectra were collected using a step size of 1 eV and pass energy of 160 eV; core-level spectra were collected using a step size of 0.1 eV and pass energy of 20 eV; and UPS spectra were conducted using a step size of 0.02 eV and pass energy of 10 eV. The electron binding-energy scale was calibrated using the Fermi edge and core levels of gold and silver substrates cleaned with argon-ion bombardment. To ensure that important energetic information was preserved, UPS scans and I 3d 5/2 low-power XPS (1.5 W versus 225 W) scans were conducted at the beginning of analysis, each on unanalysed locations. To attempt to account for energetic shifts arising from the beam damage that is unavoidable in the high-power core-level scans, all core levels were shifted back such that their high-power I 3d 5/2 peak (225 W, 0.5 min) overlapped with the low-power peak (1.5 W, 4 min). UPS spectra were numerically corrected for satellite peaks that arose from the polychromic helium radiation  35  . XPS peaks were fit using a Gaussian-Lorentzian peak-fitting algorithm with a Shirley background using the XPST package on Igor WaveMetrics. Work functions were determined using the intersection between the baseline and a linear fit to the SECO. VBMs were calculated using linear extrapolation of the valence band feature to the background signal on a semilog plot. &#13;</text>

      <text> Transient reflection measurement Transient reflection measurements were performed with a Coherent laser (800-nm fundamental beam, 1-kHz repetition rate, 3-mJ pulse and 100-fs pulse width). The fundamental beam was split into a pump and probe pulse. The probe pulse was used to generate a white light supercontinuum via a sapphire crystal that was then sent through a delay line with a timescale up to 2.5 ns. The pump pulse was tuned using a Palitra Duo optical parametric amplifier to obtain varying excitation wavelengths. The pump and probe pulses were aligned spatially onto the sample at an approximately 45° angle to the sample surface. A Helios ultrafast spectrometer was used for detection, with the spectrometer at a 90° angle to the incident pump and probe beams. The excitation density for all transient reflection measurements was kept so that the initial number of photogenerated charge carriers directly after pump excitation did not exceed about 4 × 10 17 charge carriers per cm  3  . A global fit analysis was performed on the measurements in accordance with previously reported protocols  36  . &#13;</text>

      <text> Time-resolved microwave conductivity measurement Perovskite target and control films were prepared in an identical manner to those used in devices, except onto precleaned 25 × 11 × 1-mm quartz plates (Technical Glass Products). Microwave conductivity measurements were conducted using previously described protocols  37  . In brief, a 5-ns pulse width, 10-Hz laser at 643 nm was coupled into an X-band resonant cavity to photo-generate carriers in each perovskite film, the power from which was measured before and after each measurement using a photothermal detector placed at the sample position and masked by the optical widow and waveguide sections when the sample was present. Each sample was positioned inside the microwave cavity such that excitation was always incident to the quartz side, and continuous nitrogen purge was applied to the cavity during all measurements. Neutral density filters were used to attenuate the beam power over one order of magnitude to below 10 10 cm -2 absorbed photon flux. For analysis, each sample's fraction of absorbed light was measured inside an integrating sphere diffuse reflectance accessory (Cary 7000i), whereas the beam attenuation profiles of the filter combinations were extracted from the measured specular transmission data for each neutral density filter at the excitation wavelength. &#13;</text>

      <text> Photoluminescence characterization Excitation at 632.8 nm (HeNe laser) was used to measure photoluminescence emission spectra. A Princeton Instruments HRS300 spectrograph with silicon charge-coupled-device (Pixis F100) and indium gallium arsenide (PyLoN IR) detectors was used. The spectral response of the detectors and spectrometer system was corrected using calibration sources (IntelliCal for visible and infrared ranges, Princeton Instruments) and placing calibration sources at the sample position. Excitation beam size was determined with a charge-coupled-device camera. Data were measured in absolute photon numbers using Spectralon reflectance standards (LabSphere) and assuming that 1-sun equivalent fluence for 1.53-eV bandgap is about 1.73 × 10 17 photons cm -2 s -1 . &#13;</text>

      <text> DFT calculations The structural relaxation and static self-consistent energy calculations are performed by CP2K package at the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof level  38, 39  . A six-layer FAPbI 3 perovskite slab model is constructed for the cases before and after 3-APy treatment with typical (001) orientation selected on the surface, which is terminated by FAI. The double-ξ valence polarization basis set trained from optimized molecular geomis used in the calculations with only the gamma point considered, and an energy cut-off of 550 Rydberg is set. The formation energy difference of a charged V I on the surface region with and without 3-APy treatment is calculated by the following equation: E E q E E q E Δ =( (V, ) -) -( (V, ) - ) f w I w w/o I w/o where E w (V I , q) is the total energy of the supercell with the 3-APy cation and a charged V I , E w is the total energy of the supercell with the 3-APy cation but without a charged V I , E w/o (V I , q) is the total energy of the supercell without the 3-APy cation but with a charged V I , q denotes the elementary charge, and E w/o is the total energy of the supercell without the 3-AP cation and without a charged V I . &#13;</text>

      <text> Mass spectrometry measurement The sample was diluted 1:1,000 v/v in acetonitrile and analysed with a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive mass spectrometer equipped with a heated electrospray ionization source. The sample was directly infused via a syringe pump at 10 µl min -1 , with the following source conditions: sheath gas flow, 10 arbitrary units; aux gas flow, 0 arbitrary units; spray voltage, +2.9 kV; capillary temperature, 320 °C; S-lens radio frequency voltage, 50 V; aux gas heater, 0 °C. Spectra were collected with a resolution of 140,000 at m/z 200 and an automatic gain control target of 1 million. Full-scan spectra were collected from m/z 50-700 and mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry data were collected by quadrupole isolation of m/z 136 ± 2 and fragmented with normalized collision energy values of 10 and 60 to yield the full fragmentation profile. Quasi mass spectrometry data were collected by inducing fragmentation in the source region, and isolating m/z 92 ± 2, followed by fragmentation at 60 normalized collision energy. Molecular formula assignments were based on accurate mass and  13  C isotopic fine structure. &#13;</text>

      <text> Other characterizations The optical properties of the perovskite films were measured using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (Cary 6000i). The crystal structures of perovskite films were recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (D-Max 2200, Rigaku). The morphologies and microstructures of the perovskite films and cross-sectional structures of the solar cells were investigated using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope. The J-V curves were measured in a nitrogen glovebox using a Newport Oriel Sol3A class solar simulator with a xenon lamp that was calibrated before use with a silicon cell under a KG2 filter. The SPOs of the devices were measured by monitoring the photocurrent density output evolution under the biased voltage set near the maximum power point. EQE measurements were performed in ambient air using a Newport Oriel IQE200 with monochromatic light focused on the device pixels and a chopper frequency of 37 Hz.
