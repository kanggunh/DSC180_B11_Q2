      <text>In halide perovskite solar cells the formation of secondary-phase excess lead iodide (PbI 2 ) has some positive effects on power conversion efficiency (PCE) but can be detrimental to device stability and lead to large hysteresis effects in voltage sweeps. We converted PbI 2 into an inactive (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl compound by RbCl doping, which effectively stabilizes the perovskite phase. We obtained a certified PCE of 25.6% for FAPbI 3 (FA, formamidinium) perovskite solar cells on the basis of this strategy. Devices retained 96% of their original PCE values after 1000 hours of shelf storage and 80% after 500 hours of thermal stability testing at 85°C. &#13;</text>

      <text> S everal strategies can enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), such as growing films with high crystallinity (1, 2), doping with anions, cations, or both  (3) (4) (5) , engineering the charge transport layer  (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) , and use of a universal passivation layer  (13) (14) (15) (16) . Several groups have reported certified PCEs &gt;25% by modulating the SnO 2 electron transport layer  (10) (11) (12) . Previous reports have shown that the secondary phase of PbI 2 is critical for attaining high performance levels  (7, 12, (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) . The benefits of excess PbI 2 -either in the bulk or at the grain boundary of perovskite filmshave mainly been attributed to its passivation effect resulting from the formation of a type-I band alignment  (24) . However, excess PbI 2 is too active and leads to instability of the device and large hysteresis in current density voltage (J-V) characteristics  (18, 23, 25, 26) . Both factors can be ascribed to the photodecomposition of PbI 2 and the enhanced ionic migration. It is crucial to manage excess unstable PbI 2 in perovskite films to achieve high efficiency. Recently, Luo et al. developed a ligandmodulation approach to manage the excess PbI 2 and successfully improved both PCE (up to 22%) and stability  (23) . We propose stabilization of the perovskite by converting excess PbI 2 into an inactive, new, secondary-phase (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl that can improve the stability of the perovskite FAPbI 3 layer (for simplicity, the perovskite film with (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl is henceforth referred to as PIRC), in addition to improving its optoelectronic properties, the reduction of PbI 2 decreased the bandgap of the perovskite layer. As a result, a 26.1% efficiency (certification efficiency: 25.6%) of perovskite solar cells with &gt;1000 hours of shelf stability and 500 hours of thermal stability at 85°C have been developed. We deposited nearly pure FAPbI 3 by a modified two step method used in our previous reports  (7, 15, 18) . For deposition of FAPbI 3 , the PbI 2 seed layer was first grown on the sub-strate while the organic salt formamidinium iodide (FAI) solution was deposited on PbI 2 for diffusion and formation of perovskite by annealing. Further, to improve the perovskite crystallization, methylammonium chloride (MACl) was added to the FAI solution  (7, 27) . In contrast to our previous reports, to enhance the thermal stability and decrease the bandgap of perovskite as much as possible, traditional organic salt methylammonium iodide (MAI) or methylammonium bromide was not used in this study. We confirmed that a 5% molar ratio of RbCl doping is the best condition for device performance, as discussed below. We performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig.  1, A  and B ) measurements to determine the perovskite film crystallinity. For the control film, the perovskite crystal grain size was ~1 mm and the grains were surrounded by PbI 2 grains (white needle shapes, Fig.  1A ), which formed as decomposition products on the perovskite surface after heating at elevated temperatures. For the PIRC films, the perovskite crystal size was increased to ~2 mm. Instead of a large fraction of evenly distributed white needle-shaped grains, sporadically distributed white irregular flakes were observed (Fig.  1B ). Energy dispersive spectroscopy mapping of the PIRC film (fig.  S1 ) revealed that the white region contained Pb, I, Rb, and Cl, but no N. This result indicated that there was no organic-inorganic hybrid FAPbI 3 perovskite phase in this region whereas a PbI 2 /RbCl mixed phase was possible (fig.  S1  and tables S1 and S2). The cross-section SEM images showed that the new secondary phases only formed on top of the perovskite films (Fig.  1C ). Conventional x-ray diffraction (XRD) for the perovskite films (Fig.  1D ) showed that the main diffraction peak of the control film could be assigned from the black phase of FAPbI 3 located at 14°. The yellow phase of FAPbI 3 (11.7°) was also observed in addition to the PbI 2 diffraction peak (12.6°) (the inset of Fig.  1D  shows the enlarged figure). The PbI 2 diffraction peak in the PIRC film was largely suppressed and a diffraction peak (11.3°) emerged (Fig.  1D , inset). Grazing-incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) of the PIRC films were also consistent with conventional XRD results (fig.  S2 ). We directly compared the XRD pattern of the annealed PbI 2 /RbCl precursor films with different ratios (fig.  S3 ), and we found that the diffraction of PbI 2 almost disappeared whereas the diffraction intensity at 11.3°was greatly enhanced when the ratio of PbI 2 /RbCl is 2. Thus, we could attribute the 11.3°peak to crys-talline (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl. Density function theory calculations and powder diffraction results also confirmed this assignment (fig.  S4 ). To study the phase stability of the perovskite materials obtained we aged the perovskite films at 85°C for 48 hours. The XRD and SEM results showed that more PbI 2 was formed after heating of the control perovskite film (figs. S5 and S6). We found that integration of the XRD intensity ratio of PbI 2 /perovskite in the control film increased from 0.42 to 0.98 after aging whereas the PIRC film remained at ~0. trigger decomposition of the perovskite layer  (18, 25, 26, 28, 29)  whereas the perovskite becomes much more stable after conversion of PbI 2 into the (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl phase. The presence of PbI 2 in the perovskite layer could lead to ion migration as a result of the formation of Schottky defects such as FA and I vacancies  (30) . We measured the temperaturedependent conductivity with a previously reported procedure  (31)  to confirm that ion migration is suppressed in the PIRC films through reduction of PbI 2 (Fig.  2, A  and B ). We can estimate the ion migration active energy based on the Nernst-Einstein relation: sT ¼ s 0 exp ÀE a =k B T ð Þ where s 0 is a constant, k B is Boltzmann's constant, s is ionic conductivity, T is temperature, and E a is the ion-migration activation energy. We derived E a values from the slope of the ln (sT) versus 1/T of ~0.32 eV for the control films and ~1.03 eV for the PIRC films. Given the E a , we can estimate that the ion migration rates (k) at the operating temperature (50°C) are 4.2 × 10 8 s -1 and 3.3 × 10 -3 s -1 , respectively, based on the Arrhenius equation: k ¼ k B T ð Þ=ℏ exp ÀE a =RT ð Þ where k B stands for the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, and R is the ideal gas constant  (32) . We found that (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl could not easily react with FA cations or I ions compared with those of PbI 2 (fig.  S7 ), inferring that (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl lacks similarity to PbI 2 in regards to acting as a sink for absorbing adjacent FA and I during heating, photo soaking, or voltage application. This will suppress FA and I vacancy formation, as well as ion migration. Another possible reason for suppression of ion migration as a result of (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl is that as the derivative of PbI 2 , the (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl is a fully inter-calated compound (fig.  S4 ) with narrow ion migration pathways whereas PbI 2 is a layer structure crystal with enough interlamellar space for ion migration. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization of the PIRC film showed the expected Rb 3d core level peak (Fig.  2C ). For Cl, a substantial difference was found between the control and PIRC films. We estimated ~2.7% Cl in the control film (Fig.  2D ), resulting from the addition of residual MACl during perovskite film growth, although most MACl would have evaporated during annealing. In these perovskite films, the radius of Cl was too small to incorporate into the lattice. We estimated that ~5.3% Cl was left in the PIRC film that was bonded with Pb or Rb ions and could not be easily evaporated (Fig.  2D ). This excess Cl could stabilize the perovskite phase through strong Pb-Cl bonding  (8) (9) (10) . The presence of RbCl also enhanced the formation of the black perovskite phase (Fig.  1D ). Previous studies showed that the metallic Pb formed from PbI 2 under high-energy illumination drives loss of I 2  (28, 29) . We found that the metallic state of Pb was suppressed after introducing PIRC (Fig.  2E ), which could be due to much better photo stability of PIRC compared with PbI 2 (fig.  S8 ). Depth profile XPS for the PIRC films revealed that the top surface was Rb-and Cl-rich (Fig.  2F  and fig.  S9 ), which could be a result of the secondary phase having a different solubility in the precursor solvent. Time-of-flight second ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) of the control and target perovskite films (fig.  S10 ) also confirmed that Rb and Cl that convert PbI 2 into (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl were mainly distributed on top of the perovskite. The Cl ratio on the bottom of the perovskite is about 1% higher than that in the bulk estimated from ToF-SIMS (fig.  S10 ) and XPS results (Fig.  2F ). Excess PbI 2 can increase the perovskite bandgap  (7, 12, 17) , which could be attributed to the strong quantum confinement in perovskite/PbI 2 . The photoluminescence (PL) emission of the control film peak at 805 nm red shifted to 810 nm in the PIRC film (Fig.  2G ). The PIRC perovskite film showed enhanced PL intensity indicative of suppression of nonradiative recombination. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) showed that the lifetime of the perovskite increased from 0.98 ms to 2.3 ms for the PIRC films and that this lifetime can be extended to ~6 ms with the addition of a passivation layer on the perovskite surface (Fig.  2H ). We fabricated the solar cell devices in an n-i-p configuration of FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite/passivation layer/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au [FTO, fluorine-doped tin oxide; spiro-OMeTAD, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,Ndipmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene; Fig.  1C ]. After testing the device performance using perovskite films with 1 to 10% RbCl doping we found that the 5% RbCl device had the best performance (fig.  S11  and table  S3 ); additionally, improved performance was observed when Cl was used as the halide (fig.  S12  and table S4 ). A representative J-V curve for the control and 5% RbCl-doped device showed that each of the photovoltaic parameters increased (Fig.  3A ). The typical short circuit current density (J SC ) increased from 25.1 to 25.8 mA/cm 2 , which could be attributed mainly to the lower bandgap (Fig.  2G ) as well as the external quantum efficiency (EQE) (Fig.  3B ). The open circuit voltage V OC increase from 1.17 to 1.19 eV despite the bandgap decrease was due to the suppression of recombination. The fill factor (FF) was almost the same or slightly improved compared with the control device. Overall, the PCE increased from 24.6 to 25.6%. In addition, the PIRC-based device was almost hysteresis-free whereas the control device showed obvious hysteresis. The highest PCE for an optimized device tested in our laboratory was 26.1% (Fig.  3C ); said device also showed 25.7% efficiency and steady output for 1200 s (device area: 0.108 cm 2 ; measurement mask size: 0.0741 cm 2 ). The statistics of the PCE distribution confirm the reproducibility of our results (fig.  S13 ). These devices, which showed 25.6% certificated efficiency with a V OC of 1.182 V, a J SC of 26.3 mA/cm 2 , and a FF of 82.7% (figs. S14 and S15), were sent to the accredited laboratory in Newport, USA, for certification. The V OC reflects the recombination rate of a given device and can be measured through the EQE at short circuit current conditions when the device is tested as a light-emitting diode. These devices had electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies as high as 21.6% under the injection current of 26 mA/cm 2 (equal to short circuit current J ph ) (Fig.  3D ). High quantum efficiency can only be observed through charge confinement in light-emitting diodes, so the high-EL efficiency indicates that the defectrelated nonradiative recombination was largely suppressed in the tested device. Light intensitydependent results (fig.  S16 ) also confirm this conclusion  (33)  and are consistent with our device simultaneously delivering high J sc and V oc . We tracked device shelf stability and hysteresis in a nitrogen environment while using the Spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer. After 1004 hours of aging, a slight drop in the FF from 82.6 to 80.6% was observed for the RPIC strategy-based device, which could be attributed to the reduction of Spiro-OMeTAD in an oxygen-free environment  (34, 35) ; further, it had 96% of its original PCE. The device maintained almost the same PCE in both reverse and forward scans (Fig.  3E ). However, the control device could only maintain its reverse scan PCE of 24.1% whereas the forward efficiency was reduced to 22.9%. We attributed this enhanced hysteresis (fig.  S17  and table S5 ) to the spontaneous formation of PbI 2 as a result of aging and enhanced ion migration. We also tested accelerated aging stability while heating the devices at 85°C in a nitrogen environment. We removed other possible sources of instability such as the organic passivation layer and replaced Spiro-OMeTAD with Poly[bis(4phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine]. We found that the PIRC-targeted devices primarily showed improved stability. Under 500 hours of continuous heating, the device maintained 80% initial performance (Fig.  3F  and table  S6 ) whereas the control device only retained 50% of its initial PCE. The PIRC method proposed in this study could enhance both stability and device efficiency which will provide a new direction and push the development of perovskite solar cells; there is also potential for use in other optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes and photodetectors. was added into the transparent solution for reverse precipitation. The yellowish product was isolated by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5min and then was washed by anhydrous IPA, this procedure was repeated twice. Finally, the powder was dried in a bake oven at 85 o C for 10 hours. &#13;</text>

      <text> Perovskite solar cells fabrication: FTO glass was cleaned by sequentially washing with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol (IPA). Before use, the FTO was cleaned with ultraviolet ozone for 10min. Then the substrate was spin-coated with a thin layer of SnO2 nanoparticle film (2.67%, diluted by water) at 4,000 rpm. for 30 s, and annealed in ambient air at 150 °C for 30min. It is better to clean the substrate with ultraviolet ozone for 10min to improve the surface wetting. After that, 1.5M of PbI2 in DMF:DMSO (9:1) solvent was spin-coated onto SnO2 at 1,500 rpm for 30 s, and annealed at 70 °C for 1min, then cooled to room temperature. For comparison, different concentrations (1%, 3%, 5%, 10% molar) RbCl were doped into the PbI2 solution. For FAPbI3 perovskite film deposition, a solution of FAI: MACl (90mg: 9-18mg in 1ml IPA) was spin-coated onto the PbI2 at spin rate of 1,800 rpm. for 30 s, and the perovskite precursor film was taken out from the nitrogen glove box to ambient air for thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15min in humidity conditions (30-40% humidity). It must be noted that the humidity is very critical for achieving high crystallinity of perovskite films and high performance of devices. This could be explained that the perovskite precursor could absorb water onto the surface, which could promote the perovskite crystal growth  (36) . From our previous results, the humidity should be controlled around 30-40%, lower humidity will not promote the perovskite growth, high humidity could lead to perovskite decomposition. Humidifier or dehumidifier is usually used for keeping the humidity around 30-40% in the open ambient air environment. After perovskite formation, the samples were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box for further processing. For passivation layer, the PEAI solution was dissolved in IPA with 20mM and spin-coated onto the perovskite surface at a spin rate of 5,000 rpm. without any further processing. Then the hole transporting layer was deposited on top of the passivation layer at a spin rate of 1,500 rpm. for 30 s using spiro-OMeTAD solution, which consisted of 90mg spiro-OMeTAD, 44μl bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) stock solution (260mg Li-TFSI in 1ml acetonitrile), 37μl 4-tertbutylpyridine and 1ml chlorobenzene. The devices without electrode were put in a drying cabinet (25 o C, 1% humidity) for overnight oxidation of Spiro-OMeTAD to enhance the conductivity. For the device thermal stability test, PTAA doped with 4-Isopropyl-4'-methyldiphenyliodonium Tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl) borate(TPFB) was used to replace spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer. The concentration of PTAA was 30mg ml -1 and the weight ratio of PTAA/TPFB was 10:1  (37) . The PTAA was deposited on top of the perovskite layer at a spin rate of 2,000 rpm. for 30 s. Finally, 80nm of Au film was thermally evaporated as a counter electrode using a shadow mask. The device size areas were 0.108 cm 2 . When measuring, a 0.07414 cm 2 non-reflective mask was used to define the accurate active cell area. &#13;</text>

      <text> Ion conductivity measurement: The ionic conductivity ( 𝜎 ) was extracted from the current response of a lateral perovskite device, with a configuration of Au/perovskite (100 μm)/Au, under an applied electrical field of 0.35 V/µm. The ionic conductivity measurement (Keithley 4200-SCS) was performed in N2 atmosphere with the working temperature controlled by a probe station (Lakeshore PS-100) with resolution of 0.1 K. The effective activation energy (𝐸 a ) for ion migration was obtained from fitting the Nernst-Einstein equation  (38) : 𝜎 ∝ 1 𝑇 e - 𝐸 𝑎 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 where the kB and T are Boltzmann constant and temperature respectively. Performing linear fitting in the ln(𝜎𝑇)~1/𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 plot gives two slope values, where the larger slope obtained at low 1/𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 region was assigned to the 𝐸 a value of ion migration  (39, 40) , and the smaller slope obtained at high 1/𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 region was related to the trapping and de-trapping process of electron/hole in perovskite, or sometimes limited by the lower resolution of Keithley 4200-SCS.  It can be observed that after 14 hours UV soaking, an obvious metallic Pb 0 state has been found for the PbI2 film.    3D , the surface Cl amount is about 5.3%, the bulk Cl amount is about 2.1%, according to the Cl -SIMS intensity shown in Fig.  S7D , we could estimate the Cl amount on the bottom of perovskite is about 3.1%, which is about 1% higher than in the bulk.
