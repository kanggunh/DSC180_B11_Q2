2,61_2,"The heterogeneous stacking of a thin two-dimensional (2D) perovskite layer over the three-dimensional (3D) perovskite film creates a sophisticated architecture for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). It combines the remarkable thermal and environmental stabilities of 2D perovskites with the superior optoelectronic properties of 3D materials which resolves the chronic stability issue with no compromise on efficiency. Herein, we propose the vapor-assisted growth strategy to fabricate highquality 2D/3D heterostructured perovskite films by introducing long-chain organoamine gases in which the 2D layers have a uniform and tunable thickness. The 3D to 2D transformation of the widely adopted MAPbI 3 (MA = methylammonium) film is initiated by the butylamine vapor and monitored through the in situ grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction technique. A variety of 2D species are observed and rationalized by the different collapsing and reconstruction models of the Pb-I octahedra. The PSC devices based on the optimized 2D/3D heterostructures show significant improvements in photovoltaic performances, owing to better energy level alignments, longer carrier lifetimes, and less defects as compared to their 3D analogues. In addition, both the butylamine vapor-treated perovskite films and the derived PSC devices demonstrate exceptional long-term stabilities.","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""methylammonium lead iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
17,59_2,"Surface treatment using large alkyl/aryl ammonium cations has demonstrated reduced open-circuit voltage (V OC ) deficits in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the origin of the improvements has been vaguely attributed to defect passivation.

Our results reveal that arylammonium surface treatment using phenethylammonium iodide increases the activation energy barrier for ion migration on the surface, which suppresses the accumulation of charge defects at surface and grain boundaries, leading to a reduced dark saturation current density in WBG PSCs.

18,59_3,"P erovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted a tremen- dous amount of attention in the past decade because of the superb photovoltaic properties of metal halide perovskites and the high certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction devices that has already reached 25.2%.  1  Beyond single-junction PSCs, the bandgap tunability of perovskite materials ranging from ∼1.2 to 3 eV enables the realization of perovskite-based tandem solar cells, which have the potential to surpass the Shockley-Queisser (S-Q) thermodynamic limit of single absorber solar cells.  [2] [3] [4] [5]  Perovskite-based tandem solar cells have made considerable progress in recent years.  [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]  Impressively, a variety of perovskitesilicon (Si),  6, [15] [16] [17]  perovskite-copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS),  9, 11  and perovskite-perovskite tandem solar cells have demonstrated PCEs of ∼25% or higher.  13, 14  These achievements show the enormous potential of perovskite-based tandem solar cells in the future.  5  Notably, all of the tandem cells share a common component that is a top cell based on a wide-bandgap (WBG) (∼1.7-1.9 eV) perovskite absorber layer,  [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27]  which plays a critical role in highly efficient tandem solar cells. The performance of WBG PSCs has always been limited by a high open-circuit voltage (V OC ) deficit, which is defined as -V E q OC g , where E g is the bandgap of the absorber layer and q is the unit charge. PSCs based on WBG perovskites with a bandgap of >1.72 eV typically exhibit V OC deficits (>0.5 V) that are larger than those of their lower-bandgap counterparts (Figure  S1  and Table  S1 ). While the origins of the large V OC deficit in WBG PSCs are still under debate, it is certain that the shortfall is related to the composition of perovskites with a relatively high content of Br and Cs, which typically results in phase segregation and a relatively high defect density.  28, 29  In particular, the aggregation of I-rich and Br-rich domains lowers the optical bandgap of WBG perovskites (that is primarily determined by the lower bandgap of the domains in the material),  [30] [31] [32]  severely limiting the V OC and thus the PCE of WBG PSCs. Therefore, strategies for mitigating large V OC deficits in WBG PSCs are urgently needed to advance perovskite tandem solar cells. Over the past few years, many approaches, such as compositional, additive, solvent, processing, and interface engineering techniques, have been employed to fabricate high-quality WBG perovskite films and devices.  [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [33] [34] [35] [36]  Among them, bulk incorporation or surface treatment using large alkyl/aryl ammonium cations has been demonstrated to be most effective in reducing V OC deficits of PSCs regardless of the perovskite composition. Despite the advances, the underlying mechanism of the alkyl/aryl ammonium treatment has always been attributed vaguely to a reduced defect density and increased carrier lifetime. In particular, little is known about the subtle differences in how the alkyl/aryl ammonium surface passivation affects WBG (>1.7 eV) and mediumbandgap (1.5-1.7 eV) iodine-based perovskites differently. Further efforts are needed to understand the origins and mechanisms of the large V OC deficit in WBG PSCs and to explore effective strategies for mitigating this issue. Very recently, we demonstrated an approach for probing the activation energy of ion migration in the perovskite absorber using a capacitance-based measurement,  37  which enables the PSC device performance analysis from the perspective of the ionic behavior in the perovskite absorber. Here, we combine the microscopic probing of localized electrical properties, thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) measurements, and first-principles calculations of defect migration to elucidate the primary factors limiting the V OC in WBG PSCs. Our results reveal that, in contrast to the passivated grain boundaries (GBs) in the pure iodine-based perovskite, the nature of the relatively more conductive GBs than grain interiors (GIs) in WBG perovskite films fundamentally limits the V OC of WBG PSCs. Our measurements and calculation consistently show that an arylammonium surface formed by phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) increases the activation energy barrier for ion diffusion and suppresses the accumulation of ionic defects on the perovskite surface and at GBs. Consequently, inverted 1.73 eV WBG PSCs show the V OC improved from 1.16 to 1.25 V, yielding a V OC deficit of <0.5 V. Using the arylammonium surface treatment, we obtained champion PCEs of 19.1% and 24.1% for single-junction WBG PSCs and four-terminal (4-T) all-perovskite tandem solar cells. Our work provides a better understanding of how arylammonium cations suppress ion migration in WBG perovskites and its importance in reducing large V OC deficits and improving the performance of WBG PSCs. To identify the primary limiting factors for the large V OC deficit in WBG PSCs, conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) was employed to analyze the microscopic electrical properties of our benchmark FA 0.8 Cs 0.2 Pb(I 0.7 Br 0.3 ) 3 WBG perovskite films deposited on poly(triarylamine) (PTAA)/ indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass substrates. Note that Pb(SCN) 2 was incorporated into our WBG perovskite films as an additive to promote perovskite grain growth, as reported previously.  20  Figure  1a  shows a c-AFM map of a control WBG perovskite film, which exhibits nonuniform grain sizes with a heterogeneous current distribution over different grains, indicating the formation of polycrystalline domains with different chemical phases and electrical conductivities. All of the c-AFM images in Figure  1  and the Supporting Information were taken with the same sample bias voltage (V S ) of +0.6 V to enable a reliable comparison. The segregation of I-rich and Br-rich (with respect to the 7:3 I:Br stoichiometry) domains leads to a distinct difference in the local electrical properties. The AFM tip (Pt-coated Si probe) forms primarily a junctionlike structure with the underlaying perovskite film. Dark saturation current J 0 of the structure is affected mainly by the perovskite bandgap. A larger current under the V S indicates a larger J 0 caused by a smaller bandgap. The large grains, corresponding to the higher-contrast (brighter) grains in the c-AFM image (Figure  1a ), are expected to be more conductive because their bandgaps are narrower than those with higher Br:I ratios and, therefore, allow higher local current flow (J GI, H ) through GIs. In contrast, the perovskite grains with a higher Br content tend to form smaller grains because Br accelerates the nucleation process, leading to a large number of small grains.  19  The Brrich small grains, corresponding to the lower-contrast (darker) grains, are more electrically resistive, demonstrating lower current flow (J GI, L ) through GIs. Therefore, the I-rich perovskite grains contribute larger dark currents (Figure  1b ). A remarkable heterogeneity in microscopic electrical behavior is discerned at the GBs of the WBG perovskite film in Figure  1a . The current signals at GBs (J GB ) are much higher than the current flows through GIs (J GI ), making GBs contribute to the increase in the leakage current in the WBG perovskites, as illustrated in Figure  1b . For comparison, we measured a conventional 1.55 eV MAPbI 3 perovskite film prepared using the same approach. In contrast to the WBG perovskite, the MAPbI 3 film (Figure  S2 ) exhibits mostly resistive GBs, which indicates passivated GBs because of the PbI 2 passivation introduced by the addition of Pb(SCN) 2 .  38  However, incorporating Pb(SCN) 2 into the WBG perovskites shows no efficacy in passivating GBs. For the FA/Cs-based WBG perovskite films, the dynamic of perovskite formation is greatly accelerated due to the presence of significant amounts of Cs and Br (20 and 30 mol % with respect to the monovalent cations and halide anions, respectively) in the precursor solution, leading to a higher density of defects.  19  The aggregation of the active ionic defects at GBs increases not only the electrical conductivity but also the extent of ion migration at the GBs.  [39] [40] [41] [42]  Because Br has a higher vapor pressure and escapes more easily from GBs of perovskite, it is likely that mostly positively charged ions, such as halide vacancies and lead interstitials, accumulate on the surface and at GBs, introducing detrimental defect states and making GBs more electrically conductive.  43, 44  The ambiguity of the impact of conductive GBs or regions near GBs has been discussed in the literature  39, [45] [46] [47] [48]  but deserves to be discussed further. The local current probed by c-AFM should be determined by two factors: the equivalent resistance of the probe-sample contact and the material resistivity of the local volume underneath the probe. If the contact resistance over the sample surface is uniform, the current contrast is determined by the local resistivity of the sample. A high J GB is sometimes attributed to improved charge transport properties at the GBs, which can be beneficial for series resistance in a solar cell.  47, 48  However, a current contrast in a c-AFM image is often dominated by the nonuniform electrical characteristics of the probe-sample contact. A substantially high J GB value is typically detrimental because of the likelihood of concomitant high reverse leakage current in finished devices. The defective GB and defective surface and subsurface material would cause a higher current flow because of the increased J 0 of the probe-sample contact, which also results in an inferior leaking junction when the device is completed. Moreover, highly conductive GBs may indicate defective GBs without proper passivation, behaving as nonradiative recombination centers, significantly increasing the level of Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination. Therefore, the high current flows through the defective GBs, as probed by c-AFM, can substantially increase the macroscopic dark saturation current in a solar cell device, fundamentally limiting the photovoltaic performance of a device, particularly the V OC . It is worth noting that some defective GBs show conductivities that are higher than those of the relatively conductive GIs that are formed due to the I-Br phase segregation, indicating that the defective GBs are likely to be the most critical factor contributing to the J 0 of a device. To reduce the detrimental defects at the GBs of WBG perovskite films, we applied an arylammonium surface treatment using PEAI, which is known to be an effective two-dimensional perovskite passivation agent that has been demonstrated in some state-of-the-art PSCs.  33, 49, 50  We spincoated 2 mg/mL PEAI in an isopropanol solution on asprepared WBG perovskite films and performed the c-AFM measurement to identify the impact of PEAI on the microscopic electrical properties of the film (Figure  1c ). Compared with the control film, the current flow through the perovskite grains is reduced by almost 1 order of magnitude, and the spatial distribution of microscopic conductivity becomes more uniform. Furthermore, there is an insignificant conductivity contrast between the GBs and GIs of the PEAItreated film, indicating that J GB is significantly reduced and comparable to J GI (Figure  1d ). Therefore, current flow through the perovskite film can be uniformly distributed across the GIs and GBs. The impacts of PEAI passivation on GIs and GBs are clearly displayed in the c-AFM line profile comparison in Figure  1e , where the PEAI treatment shows a marked effect in reducing the leakage current through both GBs (J GB ) and the grain interior (J GI ). Figure  1f  compares the histograms of the microscopic current distribution in the control and PEAItreated WBG perovskite films. The control WBG perovskite film exhibits two distinct local conductivity behaviors, including highly conductive GBs and GIs (J GB and J GI, H ) and less conductive GIs (J GI, L ). In marked contrast to the control film, the film with the PEAI treatment shows a narrow distribution with a greatly suppressed average current of 26 pA, almost 1 order of magnitude lower than the average c-AFM current of 135 pA for the control film. Because the probeperovskite contact in the c-AFM imaging qualitatively reflects the electrical aspect of the electron transport layer (ETL)perovskite contact in a real solar cell, the microscopic current distribution in WBG perovskite films determines the macroscopic current flow in the corresponding devices. Suppressed local leaking current at GBs and the defective subsurface region of GIs is beneficial for reducing the overall dark saturation current density in the devices. To reveal the influence of microscopic electrical properties on the macroscopic device performance of WBG PSCs, we fabricated solar cells with a glass/ITO/PTAA/FA 0.8 Cs 0.2 Pb-(I 0.7 Br 0.3 ) 3 /C 60 /bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag structure (Figure  S3 ). Figure  1g  shows representative current density-voltage (J-V) curves of PSCs based on the control and PEAI-treated perovskite absorbers. With the PEAI treatment, V OC increases significantly from 1.16 to 1.25 V, leading to an improvement in the PCE from 17.5% to 18.6%. To further understand the V OC enhancement as a result of the PEAI treatment, in Figure  1f , we plot a V OC contour of a general solar cell using the diode equation = + ( ) V ln 1 nkT q J J OC L 0 , where n is the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature of a solar cell, and J L and J 0 are the light and dark saturation current densities, respectively. On the basis of the contour plot, for a solar cell with a given absorber layer bandgap and device operational temperature, V OC is determined only by the combination of n and J 0 . Note that n is not an independent variable but is strongly influenced by J 0 . In reality, a small increase in n would typically lead to a significant increase in J 0 and, thus, a decreased V OC . Therefore, from the perspective of device analysis, J 0 is an extremely critical parameter that determines the V OC of a solar cell. A lower J 0 is desired to achieve a higher V OC of a solar cell. The light intensity-dependent device analysis shows the ideality factor n decreases from 1.69 for the control to 1.45 for the device with the PEAI treatment (Figure  S4 ). As discussed above, a lower n value is typically accompanied by a reduced J 0 , which in turn increases the V OC of a solar cell. In a good agreement, the detailed J-V analysis confirms that J 0 is reduced from ∼10 -10 to 10 -13 mA/cm 2 with the PEAI treatment (Figure  S5 ). The decreases in J 0 and n contribute to the improvement in V OC , consistent with the prediction (the triangle to star route) in Figure  1h . This decrease in the J 0 and n of the devices after the PEAI treatment is ascribed to the reduction in the microscopic leaking current in GIs and GBs of the WBG perovskite films. The defective GB and defective subsurface region without the PEAI passivation form a poor junction, causing the photoexcited carriers to be transported over the junction via these defects to some degree instead of the desired diffusion process, which subsequently causes energy loss of the charge carriers and reduces the voltage output of the device. It is worth noting that the reduced microscopic leaking current also leads to increased shunt resistance and series resistance (Table  S2 ). However, the change in series resistance has a stronger impact on fill factor (FF) than shunt resistance, leading to a reduced FF. Therefore, the decreased J 0 is the primary reason for the improved performance of PSCs with PEAI treatment. To further elucidate the interplay between the microscopic and macroscopic currents in the perovskite films and devices, we conducted TAS measurements on the WBG PSCs without and with the PEAI treatment. We have demonstrated in our recent work that the low-frequency capacitance measured by the TAS technique can be used to estimate the activation energy (E a ) of ionic movement in perovskite absorber layers.  37  Panels a and b of Figure  2  display the TAS spectra of PSCs without and with the PEAI treatment, respectively, measured from 250 to 300 K in the dark. The characteristic transition frequency values (ω peak ) were obtained from the derivative of the capacitance-frequency spectra, as shown in panels c and d of Figure  2 . Figure  2e  shows E a values calculated by fitting the corresponding Arrhenius plots using the relation ω β = - ( ) T exp E kT peak 2 a , where β is a temperature-related prefactor.  51  The device with the PEAI treatment exhibits an E a of 0.905 eV, higher than that of 0.680 eV for the control device. The substantially higher E a indicates that the ion migration in the perovskite layer is suppressed significantly after the PEAI treatment (Figure  2f ). The suppression of mobile ionic defects is also expected to reduce the extent of formation of charge defects that can act as nonradiative recombination centers. We measured the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of WBG perovskite films without and with the PEAI treatment (Figure  S6 ). The film with the PEAI treatment exhibits a more intense PL emission and a longer carrier lifetime compared to those of the control film, demonstrating that PEAI can effectively decrease the rate of nonradiative recombination in WBG perovskite films. To understand how PEAI can suppress ion migration in perovskites, we performed first-principles calculations to study the behaviors of mobile ionic defects on the surface of perovskite films. It is known that the diffusion and exchange of mobile ions at GBs and on the surface are detrimental to the device performance. Compared to the diffusion in bulk, ions have smaller diffusion barriers on the surface due to smaller steric hindrance. Panels a and b of Figure  3  illustrate the diffusion path of an I interstitial defect loosely bound on the pristine surface. The diffusion of the I interstitial is  accompanied by relatively small geometric distortions, and hance the diffusion barrier. The ion diffusion barrier is calculated to be 0.68 eV (Figure  3c ). On the PEA-modified surface, due to the hindrance of PEA, the I interstitial is forced to squeeze into the surface, forming a Pb-I-Pb-I loop (Figure  3d ,e), which is similar to the defect structure of an I interstitial in a bulk perovskite (Figure  S7 ). The diffusion barrier of an I interstitial on the PEA-modified surface is increased to 0.96 eV (Figure  3f ), suggesting that PEA may help mitigate halide ion migration on the surface. It is worth noting that the finding from the theoretical calculation is in good agreement with the results of TAS measurement. Although the atomic model for the calculation is based on the surfaces of perovskite films, the agreement with the measured diffusion barrier heights indicates that the ETL layer on top of the perovskite film in the devices may have a negligible or minor effect on ion diffusion. Furthermore, the molecular orbital diagram and partial density of states (PDOS) calculations of a PEAI-treated perovskite film (Figure  S8 ) show that an I interstitial introduces a shallow defect level above the valence band maximum, which is similar to the same defect structure on the pristine surface. Therefore, the PEAI treatment does not affect the I interstitial being an innocuous defect. The aforementioned results combining microscopic conductivity analysis, TAS device analysis, and theoretical calculations indicate that the PEAI surface treatment can suppress ion migration on the surface of perovskite films and prevent the accumulation of ionic defects at GBs. The suppressed ion migration and reduced defective GBs in the near junction region lead to a reduction in the macroscopic J 0 . Consequently, the V OC of WBG PSCs increases after the PEAI surface treatment. Once we understood the effect of PEAI on reducing ion migration and improving the V OC of WBG PSCs, we further analyzed the impact of PEAI concentration on the structural and optical properties of perovskite films and the performance of PSCs. Details are summarized in the Supporting Information (the optimization of PEAI concentration and Figures  S9-S15 ). The optimized PEAI concentration was found to be 2 mg/mL. To further improve the PCE of WBG PSCs, we deposited an antireflection coating (ARC) of MgF 2 to reduce the reflectance of the glass substrate and improve the J SC . Figure  4a  shows the J-V curves of the best-performing device with a MgF 2 ARC. The cells show negligible hysteresis and a stabilized efficiency of 18.78%. The J SC gain of ∼0.5 mA cm -2 due to the MgF 2 ARC is confirmed by the EQE spectra shown in Figure  4b . The increased J SC leads to an improvement in PCE in WBG PSCs from 18.64% to 19.07% (Table  S3 ). To the best of our knowledge, a PCE exceeding 19% is among the highest reported PCEs for inverted WBG PSCs with a bandgap of >1.72 eV (Table  S1 ). The V OC of 1.25 V is remarkable for inverted WBG PSCs. We also fabricated WBG PSCs using a transparent ITO back electrode, yielding a PCE of 16.3% (Figure  S16a  and Table  S4 ). In addition, the high transmittance beyond 720 nm (Figure  S16b ) makes it feasible to fabricate efficient perovskite tandem solar cells. As a proof of concept, we combined semitransparent WBG PSCs with a typical 1.25 eV low-bandgap mixed Sn-Pb PSC  46  to construct a 4-T all-perovskite tandem solar cell following a reported approach,  52  demonstrating a PCE of 24.1% (Figure  4c ) with complementary spectral responses in both subcells (Figure  4d ). This advance shows the promise of high-efficiency all-perovskite tandem solar cells. In summary, we examined the microscopic and macroscopic origins for the large V OC deficit in the WBG perovskite films and devices and identified that the leaking current of the junction caused by the accumulation of charge defects is one of the major factors limiting the photovoltaic performance of WBG PSCs. We applied an arylammonium surface treatment to suppress ion diffusion to reduce the extent of formation of charge defects on the surface and at GBs. This surface passivation strategy leads to an improvement in the V OC and PCE of WBG PSCs. With electrical and optical optimizations, we demonstrated WBG PSCs with a PCE of 19.07% and a V OC of ∼1.25 V, corresponding to a V OC deficit of <0.5 V for a 1.73 eV WBG perovskite absorber layer. Semitransparent WBG cells using an ITO back electrode enabled the creation of 4-T all-perovskite tandem solar cells with PCEs of >24%. This advance in understanding the importance and control of ion migration in WBG perovskites will benefit the development of perovskite tandem solar cells. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""phenethylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""19.07"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.25"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""MAPbI 3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""poly(triarylamine) (PTAA)/ indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass substrates"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""NIP"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": ""17.5"", ""treated_pce"": ""19.07"", ""control_voc"": ""1.16"", ""treated_voc"": ""1.25"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
48,84_17," Thermal and operational stability To examine the thermal stability of the device prepared with DM, we investigated the thermal behaviour of a pristine HTM and an additive-doped HTM in a powder state using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in a simulation, as shown in Fig.  1e  and Fig.  4a . The observed T g of ~161 °C for the pristine DM powder is considerably reduced to ~90 °C after doping with the additives. This is most likely due to the role of liquid-type tBP as a plasticizer. A similar trend for spiro-OMeTAD can be found in the literature; doping with an additive into a pristine powder led to a significant drop in T g from ~120 to ~50 °C (ref.  32  ). Moreover, it was reported that the T g values of organic semiconductors can be reduced in the thin-film state as compared to the bulk state  35  . It is known that deformation of spiro-OMeTAD film arises from crystallization after thermal annealing at a high temperature. For this reason, the device made with additivedoped spiro-OMeTAD exhibited apparent degradation when thermal annealing was applied from 60 °C to 80 °C in air (~25% relative humidity, RH) (Fig.  4b ). In contrast, though slight degradation of the device was observed after thermal stress at 80 °C, the device with DM exhibited much better stability under an identical condition than the device with spiro-OMeTAD. Even after thermal stress at 60 °C for 500 h, the device performance was maintained at ~95% of the original value (see Fig.  4c ). This is good evidence that our strategy of using a HTM with a high T g value is feasible in PSCs, even if a higher T g value of the HTM is still required for better thermal stability of the device. Furthermore, the encapsulated device using DM is also highly stable, with PCE maintaining 92.6% of its initial value after 310 h under continuous illumination condition (see Fig.  4d  and Supplementary Fig.  21 ). In conclusion, we have demonstrated highly efficient and thermally stable PSCs by employing a fluorene-terminated DM that has a HOMO energy level well matched to perovskite along with a high glass transition temperature (T g ). We fabricated a DM-based device and achieved high PCE values of 23.2% and 21.7% for small-(~0.094 cm 2 ) and large-area (~1 cm 2 ) cells, respectively, due to the significant reduction of the voltage loss of the device. The outcomes here were certified at 22.6% and 20.9% for small-and large-area cells, respectively. Furthermore, the device with DM showed better thermal stability than the device with spiro-OMeTAD, maintaining almost ~95% of its initial performance for more than 500 h after thermal annealing at 60 °C. We firmly believe that our fluorene-terminated DM created via molecular engineering is a promising HTM candidate for the fabrication of highly efficient and thermally stable PSCs and that our strategy in this work will offer a new direction for the fabrication of highly efficient and stable PSCs. ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""(FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""DM"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOST"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""60"", ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""23.2"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null, ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.95""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""(FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOST"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""60"", ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""23.2"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null, ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.95""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""310"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.926""}}"
76,128_2,"anions also played a critical role in modulating the crystallization of 3D perovskites and contributed to improved crystallinity and ameliorated morphology. In fact, it was extensively revealed that Cl - anions can effectively regulate the perovskite crystallization and passivate the defects at grain boundaries (JACS 2014, 136, 13249; Adv. Funct.

The main bottlenecks limiting the photovoltaic performance and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are trap-assisted non-radiative recombination losses and photochemical degradation at the interface between perovskite and charge-transport layers. We propose a strategy to manipulate the crystallization o f m et hy la mm on iu m-free perovskite by incorporating a small amount of 2-aminoindan hydrochloride into the precursor inks. This additive also modulates carrier recombination and extraction dynamics at the b ur ied i nt er face v i a t h e formation of a bottom-up two-dimensional/three-dimensional heterojunction. The resultant inverted PSC achieves a power conversion efficiency of 25.12% (certified 24.6%) at laboratory scale (0.09 cm 2 ) and 22.48% at a larger area (1 cm 2 ) with negligible hysteresis. More importantly, the resulting unencapsulated devices show superior operational stability, maintaining >98% of their initial efficiency of >24% after 1,500 hours of continuous maximum power point tracking under simulated AM1.5 illumination. Meanwhile, the encapsulated devices retain >92% of initial performance for 1,200 hours under the damp-heat test (85 °C and 85% relative humidity). Inverted (p-i-n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently drawn intensive attention, owing to their merits of compatibility with different bottom cells for tandem solar cells  1, 2  , low-temperature processability  3, 4  and excellent stability  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]  . Researchers have carried out numerous studies to improve the performance and stability of inverted PSCs, such as compositional engineering  10  , additive engineering  11, 12  , processing methods  13  and interface engineering  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [14] [15] [16]  . Although the efficiency of inverted PSCs has increased substantially over the years  12  , methylammonium (MA + ) and bromide (Br -) are usually employed to modulate the crystal growth and stabilize the photoactive black phase of formamidinium lead triiodide (α-FAPbI 3 )  4, 12, 17, 18  . However, since MA + was certified to easily volatilize and escape from the perovskite crystal lattices, large amounts of MA + doping (≥10 mol%) would cause material degradation of α-FAPbI 3 at high temperatures and thus reduce thermal stability of the corresponding PSCs  19, 20  . In addition, mixed halide (I/Br) perovskites inevitably suffer from phase segregation, which is exacerbated under light illumination and thermal ageing  [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25]  . In the long run, MA-and Br-free perovskite is highly desirable for the fabrication of long-term ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""ISOSLT"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOST1"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1500"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.12"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.98""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""85"", ""temperature"": ""85"", ""time"": ""1200"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.92""}}"
82,128_9," Perovskite As a comparison, we also predeposited different amounts of AICl salts on the indium tin oxide (ITO)/HTL substrates before 3D perovskite formation (Supplementary Fig.  28 ), which is expected to form bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunctions according to previous reports  16, 27  . As shown in Supplementary Fig.  29a , it is clear that a 2D perovskite layer was formed at the bottom of the 3D perovskite film. However, the fabricated inverted PSCs with the bottom-up 2D/3D perovskite films show poor photovoltaic performance compared to the control device (Supplementary Fig.  29b ). These results further prove the advantages of our strategy of incorporating the 2D perovskite spacer into precursor inks. Finally, we evaluated the stability of the high-efficiency inverted PSCs under accelerated ageing conditions according to the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols  50  . The long-term operational stability of the unencapsulated control and target PSCs was evaluated by MPP tracking under constant simulated AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm -2 ). Both the target devices maintained over 98% of their initial PCE of >24% after 1,500 hours of continuous tests at 55 ± 5 °C, whereas the control device degraded to 78% of its initial PCE of 21.73% (Fig.  3e ). Additionally, we conducted damp-heat measurements for the encapsulated devices at 85 °C in the 85% relative humidity-controlled chamber. As shown in Fig.  3f , the target device exhibited a T 90 (the time over which the device efficiency reduces to 90%) of >1,000 hours under the heating stress and thus successfully passed the main point of ISOS qualification for thermally accelerated ageing conditions (ISOS-T-1). The enhanced thermal and operational stability can be attributed to a lower concentration of defects and the suppressed ion migration at the HTL/perovskite interface caused by the construction of the bottom-up 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction  6, 7  . Taken together, these data indicate that inverted PSCs with tailored bottom-up 2D/3D heterojunction at the buried interface exhibited excellent efficiency and stability, and this work takes an important step towards the realization of commercial perovskite-based single-and multiple-junction solar cells. ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""PCBM"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""poly(triarylamine)"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOST1"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1500"", ""control_pce"": ""21.94"", ""treated_pce"": ""25.12"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.98""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""85"", ""temperature"": ""85"", ""time"": ""1200"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.92""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""PCBM"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""poly(triarylamine)"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOST1"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""55"", ""time"": ""1500"", ""control_pce"": ""21.73"", ""treated_pce"": ""25.12"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.98"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.78""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOST1"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""85"", ""temperature"": ""85"", ""time"": ""1200"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.92""}}"
132,101_22," Results and Discussions The molecular structures of DTB(xDEG) polymers are shown in Scheme 1. The synthetic procedures for monomers of Ph(EH) and Ph(DEG) and polymers are similar to those in our previous work (Scheme S1, Supporting Information),  [45]  and the polymers with x values of 0, 3, and 10% were synthesized. The absorption spectra of polymers in Figure  1a  demonstrate that the absorption band edges are almost the same and the optical bandgap energies are calculated to be 2.14 eV for the three polymers. The absorption shoulder at around 542 nm which can be assigned to the intermolecular π-π stacking is moderated after the introduction of DEG groups, indicating that the DEG group forces the polymer turn to be a random packed copolymer and weaken the interchain π-π interaction. As presented in Figure  S3  (Supporting Information), the light absorption coefficient monotonically increases with the DEG amount, probably caused by the increased crystallinity of the films. Through the cyclic voltammetry (CV) test (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information), the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of the polymers are determined to be -4.99, -4.97, and -4.94 eV when x increases from 0% to Adv. Funct. Mater. 2019, 29, 1904856   Scheme 1. Synthetic route to the polymers DTB(xDEG) (x is the feed percentage of Ph(DEG)). 3% and 10%. Combined with the bandgap values, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are obtained and schematically illustrated in Figure  1b . As for the variation of HOMO levels, the DEG group is an electron-donating group, thus the electrons in the HOMO of polymers with DEG groups would be of higher energy than the ones for the pristine DTB(0%DEG), and as a result the HOMO level would rise after the introduction of DEG. The more DEG groups introduced, the higher the HOMO level of polymers goes. As suggested by Figure  1b , all the three polymers could not only effectively block the photogenerated electrons in the perovskite from reaching the positive electrode (here is Au electrode) but also fluently extract the photogenerated holes due to their large HOMO offsets with the perovskite layer and freely pass these holes to the Au electrode due to the ohmic contact. The molecular packing was examined by the grazingincidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). As shown in Figure  2  and Figure  S5  (Supporting Information), when 3% of DEG groups are introduced to the polymer, the molecular packing does not change apparently, but the diffraction intensity is improved, further demonstrating the increased crystallinity. If the content of DEG groups further increases to 10%, the π-π stackings in both the edge-on and the faceon arranging modes (as illustrated in Figure  S6 , Supporting Information) are remarkably weakened, whereas the lamellar packing patterns in the edge-on mode are obviously strengthened. As observed from Figure  S5a  (Supporting Information), the diffraction peak for lamellar packing at around 4.6° shifts to a higher degree, indicating the decreased lamellar distance. On the contrary, the peak for the π-π stacking at around 15.7° in Figure  S5b  (Supporting Information) moves to a lower degree, indicative of a larger π-π stacking spacing (summarized in Table  S1 , Supporting Information). This loosened π-π stacking interaction is opposite to the previous reports where the incorporation of ethylene glycol oligomers generally led to a closer π-π stacking,  [56] [57] [58] [59] [60]  and the tightened lamellar packing has seldom been reported. We suspect that the weakened π-π stacking is caused by the lowered symmetry of the random DTB(xDEG) copolymer in comparison to the previous alternating copolymers, and the lamellar distance is shortened due to the interdigitation of the side chains in neighboring layers (Figure  S6a , Supporting Information) or stacks (Figure  S6b , Supporting Information) stemming from the higher flexibility of oligo(ethylene glycol) chains compared with the alkyl chains.  [58]  It should be noticed that the lamellar packing patterns only exist in the edge-on mode for all the three samples, suggesting that the majority of these polymers adopt an edge-on arrangement in the solid state, which is consistent with our previous observation.  [45]  The hole mobility was measured through the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (Figure  S7 , Supporting Information), and the values for DTB(xDEG) are extracted to be 1.74 × 10 -4 , 3.22 × 10 -4 , and 2.02 × 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 s -1 for x is 0, 3, and 10%, respectively. Although the gradually weakened π-π stackings, especially those in the face-on mode, decrease the hole transportation, the lamellar packing interaction increases as the DEG percentage rises, which could engender the enhancement of hole mobility. As a consequence, the mobility touches its maximum around x = 3%, which is nearly as twice as that of without DEG groups. To guarantee the long-term stability of PSC devices, the thermal stability of the polymers is of great importance and was tested by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Figure  S8 , Supporting Information). The polymers could stay stable up to over 375 °C and undergo no obvious phase transitions in the tested temperature  range (up to 300 °C), showing their high tolerance to temperature variation. The contact angles against water were also measured, which are 97.5°, 99.7°, and 95.7° when x turns from 0% to 3% and 10%. Although introducing DEG groups could lift the hydrophilicity of the polymer, the simultaneously improved intermolecular interaction, which is reflected by the increased crystallinity, let the adjacent polymer chains hold tight with each other and protect the film against the invasion of water, leading to a nonlinear changing trend for the contact angle. The photovoltaic performance of the three polymers is characterized on the PSC devices with a configuration of FTO/c-TiO 2 /m-TiO 2 /Cs 0.05 FA 0.81 MA 0.14 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45 /HTM/Au, where FTO stands for a layer of fluorine-doped tin oxide and c-TiO 2 /m-TiO 2 are the compact and mesoporous TiO 2 layers. Figure  3a  shows the current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of the three optimized devices for the polymers. As summarized in Table  1 , when x comes to 3%, a champion PCE of 20.19% is attained with an open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.14 V, a shortcircuit current density (J SC ) of 23.64 mA cm -2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 75.08% (the certified PCE is 20.10%, Figure  S9 , Supporting Information). The distribution of all the four photovoltaic parameters can be found in Figure  3b,c  and Table 1 , where almost all of them catch its maximum at x = 3%. The stabilized PCE values measured at the biases of the maximum power points (MPPs) are 19.09, 19.90, and 16.71%, respectively (the biases are 0.85, 0.96, and 0.82 V, respectively), which are very close to these extracted from J-V characterization (Figure  3d ). External quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the devices were also recorded to verify the photovoltaic properties. As can be seen in Figure  3e , the polymers exhibit strong photoresponses across the range of 350-750 nm, revealing their high effectivity of being HTMs. The integrated current densities from these EQE charts are 24.81, 24.32, and 23.01 mA cm -2 , respectively, and thus relative deviations of as low as 0.8, 2.9, and 2.2% in comparison to the corresponding J SC values are obtained, which are much lower than the generally acceptable deviation limit of 5% and demonstrate the validity of our J-V measurement. The stability of PSCs at ambient atmosphere (room temperature and 20-30% relative humidity) was also tested. As described in Figure  3f , all the polymers could render their devices remain over 87% of the initial PCEs, and DTB(3%DEG) holds the best long-term stability, which may be ascribed to its better hydrophobicity. The PCE evolution under continuous 100 mW cm -2 illumination also suggests that the PSCs based on DTB(xDEG) polymers own a good long-term stability (Figure  S11 , Supporting Information). As stated before, the DTB(3%DEG) presents the champion PCE value, which should be mainly because of its highest hole  The average values with a standard deviation are calculated from 15 devices; b) In the parenthesis are the values of the champion devices. mobility. The corresponding J SC of its device is also much higher than those for the reported dopant-free organic HTMs (Table  S2 , Supporting Information); however, it is still a little smaller than that of the control polymer without DEG groups, contradictory to the expectation of a larger J SC value from a higher hole mobility. In order to unveil the underlying mechanism and provide a strategy for the future improvement, investigation on the HTM/perovskite interface beside the HTM bulk is needed, and to this end, we conducted further experiments based on photoluminescence (PL). The PL spectra were recorded on the sample of FTO/c-TiO 2 /m-TiO 2 /perovskite/HTM. As shown by the steady-state PL (SSPL) spectra in Figure  4a , the DTB(3%DEG) sample owns the highest PL intensity, revealing the charge transfer at its HTM/perovskite interface is the poorest. The locations of PL peaks for the three samples are also different, which are 766, 768, and 763 nm, respectively. The redshift of PL peak signifies there are more defects existing in the perovskite layer for the DTB(3%DEG) sample, whereas the blueshift for DTB(10%DEG) is just the opposite when compared with the DTB(0%DEG) one.  [61]  Fitting the time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra (Figure  4b ) with the bicomponent decay model, we obtained the time constants for the two decaying processes (Table  S3 , Supporting Information). The fast decay, which is believed to arise from the chargetransfer at the HTM/perovskite interface, has a constant of 1.44, 1.61, or 1.38 ns for the sample with x of 0, 3, or 10%, respectively. The biggest value for the 3% sample suggests free carriers in the sample cannot be taken away timely to quench the PL, consistent with the inference from SSRL. To know the exact quantity and distribution of these defects in the perovskite layer, we turned to thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS, Figure  4c ). According to the literature,  [61, 62]  the region with energy lower than 0.40 eV is the shallow trap state that can be assigned to the defects in the bulk of the perovskite layer, while the one over 0.40 eV belongs to the deep trap state that stems from the defects on the surface of the perovskite layer. The specific concentrations of these defects are consequently calculated by integrating the TAS spectra. As summarized in Table  S4  (Supporting Information), the defects in the device of DTB(3%DEG) touch the maximum concentrations on all the three indexes, including shallow trap state, deep trap state, and the sum, whereas those for DTB(10%DEG) are the lowest. As mentioned before, with the increased DEG content, the crystallinity of HTM film and the concentration of hydrophilic groups increase, leading to a maximum hydrophobicity when x = 3%. The perovskite layer is hydrophilic, and its interaction with HTM layer should be quite similar to that of water. In such condition, the DTB(3%DEG) is supposed to interact poorly with the perovskite layer, and the DTB(10%DEG) film interacts strongly. Accordingly, the defects of the perovskite layer could then be passivated by DTB(xDEG) to different extent, and it is also reasonable for DTB(3%DEG) to present the strongest PL intensity, the longest time for the PL decay, and the moderate J SC value. Combining the results from PL and TAS analyses, we can infer that a better hydrophilicity would be ideal if the HTMs want to passivate the defects more effectively in and extract the holes more efficiently from the perovskite layer, which could be another important factor for designing HTMs. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""720"", ""control_pce"": ""c"", ""treated_pce"": ""20.10"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.9225""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""20-30"", ""temperature"": ""25"", ""time"": ""720"", ""control_pce"": ""r"", ""treated_pce"": ""16.71"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.87""}}"
142,101_35," A variety of dopant-free hole-transporting materials (HTMs) is developed to serve as alternatives to the typical dopant-treated ones; however, their photovoltaic performance still falls far behind. In this work, the side chain of a polymeric HTM is engineered by partially introducing diethylene glycol (DEG) groups in order to simultaneously optimize the properties of both the bulk of the HTM layer and the HTM/perovskite interface. The intermolecular π-π stacking interaction in the HTM layer is unexpectedly weakened after the incorporation of DEG groups, whereas the lamellar packing interaction is strengthened. A doubled hole mobility is obtained when 3% of the DEG groups replace the original alkyl side chains, and a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.19% (certified: 20.10%) is then achieved, which is the first report of values over 20% for dopant-free organic HTMs. The device maintains 92.25% of its initial PCE after storing at ambient atmosphere for 30 d, which should be due to the enhanced hydrophobicity of the HTM film. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""20-30"", ""temperature"": ""25"", ""time"": ""720"", ""control_pce"": ""r"", ""treated_pce"": ""16.71"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.87""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""20-30"", ""temperature"": ""25"", ""time"": ""720"", ""control_pce"": ""r"", ""treated_pce"": ""20.10"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.9225""}}"

225,64_5," ACS Energy Letters Letter layer with and without the 2D perovskite interlayers was investigated by SEM. The surface of the MAPI film appears homogeneous and compact (Figure  2a ), composed of grains with an average size of approximately 100 nm. In the 2D/MAPI/2D heterostructure (Figure  2b ), we can already observe how the PEA 2 PbI 4 layer affects the film growth and morphology as the grain size is reduced, and the surface seems more textured as compared to the bare MAPI film.  64, 65  These effects correlate with the XRD discussed before (Figure  S2 ). The surface of the samples was further analyzed by AFM. While homogeneous on a large scale (Figure  2c ), the MAPI film surface was found to be rather rough, with a root-meansquare roughness R RMS of 13 nm and average height z AVG as high as 50 nm (Figures  2e  and S4 ). The grain size reduction observed by SEM for the 2D/MAPI/2D heterostructure was also confirmed by AFM (Figure  2d ), where the topography was characterized by R RMS = 8 nm and a strongly diminished z AVG of 27 nm (Figure  2f ). At the same time, the height distribution was found also to be narrower, indicating a more homogeneous surface. Grain size reduction as a result of the interaction of a 3D perovskite with large cations has also been observed previously.  42, 66  To evaluate the potential of a 2D/MAPI/2D perovskite heterostructure in photovoltaics, we incorporated it in fully vacuum-deposited PSCs using a p-i-n device layout (Figure  3a ). The diodes were prepared on indium tin oxide (ITO), using molybdenum oxide (MoO 3 , 5 nm) and N4,N4,N4″,N4″tetra([1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)-[1,1′:4′,1″-terphenyl]-4,4″-diamine (TaTm, 10 nm) as the hole transport layer (HTL) and a 500 nm thick MAPI film, fullerene (C60, 25 nm), and bathocuproine (BCP, 8 nm) as the electron transport layers (ETLs). The devices were completed with the deposition of a silver electrode (100 nm). The low-dimensional PEA 2 PbI 4 films were vacuum-deposited in between the HTL/MAPI or the MAPI/ETL interfaces, varying the thickness between 2.5 and 10 nm. All layers were thermally deposited in high vacuum with a base pressure of 10 -6 mbar. The current densityvoltage (J-V) curves of PSCs were recorded under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm -2 , Figure  3 ), and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table  1  (only for devices with 2.5 nm thick 2D films). We initially fabricated and tested the triple layer heterojunctions of the type 2D/MAPI/2D. The heterojunction device with 2.5 nm thick 2D films showed a short-circuit current density (J sc ) exceeding 20 mA cm -2 , only slightly lower than that of the reference MAPI solar cell (Table  1  and Figure  S5 ). While the open-circuit voltage (V oc ) was found to decrease only approximately 6-7 meV compared to the reference, we observed a strongly reduced FF (65.5%) even though the two 2D films were only 2.5 nm thick (Figure  3b ). With increasing thickness of the low-dimensional perovskite films, the FF further decreased to 49.7%, accompanied by a drastic reduction in the current density, being as low as 8 mA cm -2 for 10 nm thick 2D films.

We used peaks from these spectra to extract the absorption wavelengths in Table  S4 . Note that for <n> = 5 FA and Cs based quasi-2D perovskites there is little absorption from the n > 2, this could be due to the phase instability of FAPbI3 and CsPbI3. Using MAI as a sole additive with PEAI in our 2D treatment reduced the formation of n = 1 in 2D treated films but did not produce n ≥ 3 (Fig.  S8d ). Only when DMF was added to this treatment did we produce wider RDPs. When using PEAI and DMF (no MAI in the IPA solution) we found no obvious change in the TA signal compared to using PEAI alone (Fig.  S8 ). However, XRD suggested that more PbI2 was formed using this treatment (Fig.  S9a ), hence we used a very small amount of DMF (1:200 by vol. to IPA) to ensure that we did not dissolve large amounts of 3D perovskite, as this would not be beneficial to devices. We also used XRD to check the effect of using any combination of MAI/DMF to treat the perovskite surface, with no obvious changes (Fig.  S9b ). We thought to vary the MAI content to induce wider RDPs to grow, but found that this induced disorder into the heterostructure with a broadening of existing peaks rather than the formation of wider RDPs (Fig  S10 ). Ultimately, we found that using DMF (1:200 by vol. to IPA) and adding MAI (1:2 by wgt. to the 2D ligands in solution) produced our most valuable results.

Controlling the surface termination and defects has the potential to improve the performance of both conventional 3D and latterly reduced-dimensional perovskites photovoltaics. Here, we characterized the termination and all possible defect formations in FAPbI 3 surface by the first-principles calculations. We found that, among the surfaces we considered, FAI-termination exhibits the most stable surface with a high defect tolerance. The PbI 2 -terminated surface is also found to be relatively stable; however, certain defects, such as electron-donating FA-interstitial and Pb-interstitial defects, can create deep-level stable charge-traps, potentially limiting the optoelectronic performance. We further investigate the surface treatment on these deep defects by model small molecule additives. We found that benzene additive with delocalized electron distribution can effectively passivate the deep FA-interstitial and Pb-interstitial defects by electron donating to the surface defect through charge-transfer. P erovskite semiconductor materials have attracted a lot of attention because of their potential properties, such as strong light absorption, excellent carrier diffusion lengths, high open circuit voltages, low electron and hole effective masses, bipolar charge transport, and solution processability.  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  Although the reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) for perovskite solar cells are about 25% inside the lab,  6  they are currently below the thermodynamic PCE limit of about 30%, predicted for such systems.  7  There are many ongoing attempts to enhance the performance of the hybrid perovskite solar cells not only by tailoring the growth/fabrication processes but also by engineering the atomic structure. Surface management and grain-control, such as through molecular functionalization or doping, are widely used strategies in order to improve the stability, charge-extraction, and charge-migration.  3, 6  One of the major factor limiting the device performance is the inevitable defect formation in the bulk film, surfaces, and grain boundaries.  [8] [9] [10]  Previous studies showed that hybrid perovskites contain largely shallow defects; 6,11 however, several controversial studies represent some defects can introduce deep-level trap states.  [12] [13] [14]  For example, iodine vacancy (V I ) and iodine interstitial (I i ) defects are generally known as benign since they create only shallow trap states;  11, 13, 15  however, other studies reported that both V I and I i are deeplevel traps and nonradiative recombination centers.  14, 16  These discrepancies can be caused by the distinct defect formation mechanisms on the surface  3, 6  since such unavoidable surface defects can cause nonradiative charge-recombination, chargemobility reduction, and ionic diffusion. Moreover, 2D and 2D/ 3D multidimensional perovskite structures are emerged in recent years, for instance, which differs from conventional 3D perovskites by having an additional larger organic separator cation (OSC) layer isolating the inorganic metal halide octahedra layers to form quantum well superlattices; 17 however, limited charge transport of these multidimensional perovskites frustrate their usage in perovskite solar cells and necessitate further research on the formation of defects on such surfaces.  18  Therefore, understanding, characterizing, and passivating (or neutralizing) these surface defects in perovskite materials are of great importance in terms of device optimization.  10, [19] [20] [21] [22]  For this, density-functional theory (DFT) based defect description is one of the most appropriate strategy since experimental identification of such defects/traps is quite challenging.  3, 23  For instance, computational analysis can suggest with a good sensitivity what kind of growth condition (such as, the rate of element composition) should be considered to identify detrimental defects or to reduce defect formations.  24  H. Uratani and K. Yamashita suggested, with their DFT calculations on MAPbI 3 perovskite, that surface defect formation can be minimized in a lead-rich environment.  25  On the other hand, Liu et al. have suggested that the preparation of FAPbI 3 film in ""iodine"" rich medium is necessary to prevent deep level defects.  26  This result is quite consistent with increasing PCE with excess iodide ions as additives in the FA-based bulk systems.  24  On the other hand, the majority of research had been focused on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ) because of its highly promising photovoltaic properties and the incredibly rapid improvements in power conversion efficiency in last years.  27  However, they are susceptible to deterioration due to humidity and high temperatures since they transform into hydrated perovskite phases as soon as they are exposed to moisture.  [28] [29] [30]  In addition, they can be easily transformed from tetragonal phase to cubic phase at around 55 °C and rapidly decompose above 85 °C by thermal effects.  [31] [32] [33]  Therefore, MAPbI 3 type perovskite materials have stability problems and this has been the biggest obstacle to the technological use of such materials. In extensive studies recently conducted, formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) type perovskite solar cells have been recently proposed as an alternative to MAPbI 3 and that FAPbI 3 -based solar cells can have a maximum power conversion efficiency of 23.7%.  27  When MA is replaced by FA, the perovskite was found to have a band gap of 1.48 eV and a higher decomposition temperature and, therefore, a higher thermal stability.  [33] [34] [35] [36]  Thus, the surface construction and surface defect formation mechanisms in FAPbI 3 should be well-understood to maximize the performance and stability of FAPbI 3 -based solar cells. In this study, we investigate the defect formation in FAPbI 3 surface by the first-principles calculations. We, first, calculated the surface energies of FAPbI 3 to determine the stability of different types of surface terminations. The formation energies of 12 native point defect types that could form on a certain surface are then calculated. A strong correlation between the surface energy and defect formation energy is found among different surface types. The charge transition levels of the defects and corresponding formation energies are concurrently discussed to identify harmful defects. We finally propose several healing scenarios for those harmful defects via the introduction of passivating molecule additives to the FAPbI 3 surfaces. First-principles calculations were performed based on the density functional theory (DFT) using a plane-wave basis set and the projected augmented wave (PAW) method, as implemented in the VASP package.  37, 38  Generalized-gradientapproximation type cost-effective  39, 40  Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional is used for the exchange-correlation functional in all geometry optimization and self-consistent field calculations. A plane wave basis with a 300 eV energy cutoff and 4 × 4 × 1 Γ-centered k-mesh is used for the geometry optimizations. Site positions and cell volumes were allowed to relax using a conjugate gradient algorithm, until all residual forces are smaller than 0.02 eV/Å. A further single-point energy calculations on the optimized geometries with 400 eV cutoff and 8 × 8 × 1 k-mesh were performed in order to improve the accuracy of the energy calculations. The FAPbI 3 slabs for the defect formation calculations are created in the [001] crystallographic direction along with a 10-15 Å of vacuum layer. We generated four different types of 2 × 2 slabs: (i) PbI 2 , (ii) FAI-terminated surfaces, (iii) I-terminated surface, where FAs are removed from the FAI terminated surface, and (iv) PbI-terminated surface (see Figure  1 ). The surface energies are then calculated from σ = σ cl + σ relax , where σ cl is the cleavage energy when forming the clean (unrelaxed) slab and σ relax is the surface energy due to surface relaxation. We obtained the σ cl and σ relax from: E E n A 2 i i i cl slab unrel bulk σ μ = - +∑ (1 ) E E A relax slab rel slab unrel σ = - ( 2 ) where A is the surface area and E slab unrel and E slab rel are the energies of the unrelaxed and relaxed slabs, respectively.  41  E bulk is the energy of the bulk structure. n i is the number of Pb, I, and FA exchanged by the reservoir to generate the surface with the corresponding chemical potentials μ i . Intrinsic point defects are generated in one side of the slabs. Vacancy (V X ), antisite (X Y ), and interstitial (X i ) defect types are appropriately considered. The defect formation energies of the relaxed slabs are calculated using the following formula: H E E n q E E E ( ) d q d q i i i pr F VBM corr ∑ μ Δ = - + + + + (3) Here, q and d represent charge state and defect type, respectively. E pr is the energy of the pristine slab, and n i is the number change in element exchange from the reservoir to generate the corresponding defect. μ i , E F , and E VBM is the chemical potential, Fermi energy, and the energy of the valence-band maximum, respectively. E corr is the energy correction due to finite supercell sizes considered in formation energy calculations (see the SI for details). Because of the unique optoelectronic properties of FAPbI 3 , the majority of high-performance PSCs are based on a FAPbI 3dominant composition,  19, 24  however, its metastable nature makes it vulnerable to degradation mechanisms.  33, 36, 42  Therefore, understanding the surface termination process and its effect on the intrinsic point defects is crucial to solve the instability issues of FAPbI 3 -based PSCs. Moreover, controlling the surface termination should play a key role in 2D, 3D, and 2D-3D multidimensional perovskite structures which need robust surface engineering. Thus, we focus on the termination and defect formation in (100) FAPbI 3 surface. We first calculated the surface energy of four different termination type; PbI 2 , FAI, I, and PbI, as can be seen in Figure  1 . We find that FAI-termination has the lowest surface energy, that is, most stable surface among the four investigated termination types. This is a significant outcome, because the vast majority of The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters multidimensional perovskites are schematically represented by the I-termination even if the surface termination around the 2D-3D junction remained something of a puzzle, to the best of our knowledge. While we report that the FAI-termination is found to be 3 times stable when compared to I-termination, we should note that FAI-termination may not be the dominant surface because of its high volatility, according to other studies on organic cation-I terminated surfaces.  25, 40  Thus, we can speculate that FA and organic separator cations, such as butylammonium (BA) and octylammonium (OCA), can coexist at the surface and can collectively create the multidimensional junction. We investigate the formation of point defects at the surface of FAPbI 3 perovskite depending on the surface termination. We presented our results for the case of Pb-rich growth condition, since Pb-rich is typically considered for highperformance perovskite solar cells.  3, 6  The formation energies for other growth conditions (moderate and I-rich conditions) are represented in Supporting Information. We investigate the formation of 12 types of crystallographic point defects can present at the surfaces: three vacancy (V Pb , V I , V FA ), three interstitial (Pb i , I i , FA i ), and six antisite (Pb I , I Pb , FA I , I FA , FA Pb , Pb FA ). The number of investigated defects depends on the type of the termination, for example, we consider 9 different types of defects for PbI 2 -terminated surface in Figure  2a , while only four type of defects can be studied for surface in Figure  2d . On the PbI 2 surface in Figure  2a , only FA i has low formation energy. The formation energies of all other eight defects are larger than 1 eV. The high stability of PbI 2 surface against the defect formation is readily understood by considering the surface energy of PbI 2 -term is one of the smallest subsequent to that of FAI-term. On the other hand, FAI is the most suitable surface termination from the viewpoint of defect formation energies in Figure  2b , as well as the surface energy. The lowest formation energy belongs to I i , which is about 2 eV and still higher than I i formation energies for other three termination type. Also, we should note that the iodine defects are generally benign and they can be overcome by various surface treatment methods.  21  In Figure  2c , I-termination is found to be the most vulnerable surface against all types of defect formations as well it is one of the most energetically unfavorable surface. In Figure  2d , PbIterminated surface is likely to host V Pb , Pb i , and I i . It is only suitable for avoiding the formation of V I . Hereby, we report a strong correlation between the surface energy and the defect formation energy. FAI and PbI 2 terminations have lower surface energies and higher defect formation energies when compared to that of PbI and I terminations. A low surface energy corresponds to more stable structure against the defect formations. However, the formation energy of defects is not the sole parameter influences the performance of PSCs. The trap states of the defects play a critical role on carrier dynamics and consequently the photovoltaic performance. Some types of defects can have lower formation energy but it can be benign if the energy states of the defects are out of the band gap or vice versa. In Figure  3 , we present the formation energy of defects with respect to the Fermi level to examine the effects of the electrochemical potential on the formation of these intrinsic defects for Pb-rich growth condition (see SI for moderate and I-rich conditions). Defects with relatively high formation energies, that is, unstable ones, are displayed as gray dashed lines. The valence band maxima (VBM) and conduction band minima (CBM) are shown by colored backgrounds, while the remaining white regions are band gaps. In Figure  3a , on PbI 2terminated surface, FA I , Pb I , and FA i are dominant defects when the host material is p-type (E F < 0.5 eV), whereas FA Pb and I i become dominant for n-type (E F > 0.5 eV) host material. On FAI-terminated surface in Figure  3b , defect V I is stable for p-type material, while V FA and I i defects become dominant when the host material is n-type. In Figure  3c  and d , all investigated defects are stable in any region of the band gap of PbI-and I-terminated surfaces. As can be seen in Figure  3 , the defect formation energies are strongly correlated with the Fermi energy levels. For negatively or positively charged defects electrons are transferred at certain Fermi levels from the reservoir to form the charged defect or vice versa, respectively. From eq 3, the electron chemical potential μ e (i.e., qE F ) is conventionally referenced to the valence band maximum energy (i.e., q(E F + E VBM )). This μ e = q(E F + E VBM ) makes sense because for the electron-poor environment (i.e., p-type region or hole-rich) E F ∼ 0 so that μ e ∼ qE VBM , and similarly for the electron-rich environment (i.e., n-type region) E F ∼ E g so that μ e ∼ qE CBM . In this last part, we aim to clarify the types of surface defects responsible for carrier trapping by calculating the charge transition levels. The Fermi level where the defect state can accept/donate electrons is called as the charge transition level of a defect, which can be ""shallow"" or ""deep"" level according to its position in the band gap. Specifically, deep level defects have a major impact on the device performance in two ways: (1) they can act as Shockley-Read-Hall recombination centers and (2) the scattering effect of charged defects can influence carrier migration and reduce the conductivity.  26  In Figure  4 , we present the charge transition levels of the defects. In Figure  4a , on PbI 2 -terminated surface, most defects create deep transition levels. Even if the formation energies of most defects on PbI 2 -terminated surface are relatively high, the low formation energies of FA i (-0.20 eV) and Pb i (0.42 eV) can The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters pubs.acs.org/JPCL Letter make them effective recombination centers. On the other hand, the FAI-terminated surface has deep transition levels created by Pb i , FA I , and Pb I in Figure  4b ; however, their formation energies are relatively high so they can be considered benign. In Figure  4c , PbI-terminated surface has deep transition levels created by V Pb , Pb i , and V I , and the formation energies of V Pb and Pb i are relatively low. Similarly, on I-terminated surface in Figure  4d , most investigated defects create deep transition levels and their formation energies are quite low. We should note that we represent the formation energies and transition levels belong to the Pb-rich condition throughout the text while those of moderate and I-rich growth conditions are given in Supporting Information. Among the studied surface types, FAI-termitaion at first seems an appropriate surface type in terms of stability and achieving high photovoltaic performance owing to its low surface energy, high defect formation energy, and shallow charge transition levels. In reality, however, FA molecules can abandon the FAI-terminated surface due to their delicate nature against environmental conditions such as heat or moisture. In this case, the surface termination can ultimately be transformed into the I-termination (as well as mobile FAs would inhibit performance), which potentially makes the surface unstable and vulnerable against defect formations as shown in Figure  3d . This is also evidenced from relatively low formation energy of V FA shown in Figure  3b . Alternative to the  The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters FAI-termination, PbI 2 -terminated surface is another candidate since the surface energy of PbI 2 -termination is one of the smallest subsequent to that of FAI-termination. Indeed, recent studies also reported that a controlled PbI 2 -termination enhances the solar cell performance due to its appropriate band gap and lack of volatile FAs.  6, 43  On the other hand, electron donating FA i and Pb i defects are dominant in the hole-rich region (low Fermi-energy) on the PbI 2 -terminated surface. Thus, certain passivation treatments on the defects creating deep transition levels on the PbI 2 -terminated surface may further enhance the performance of FAPbI 3 perovskite solar cells. To complement our findings we demonstrate a possible deep trap defect passivation scenario for surfaced FAPbI 3 . Ten model small molecule passivation agents are taken into account (see Figure  5a ). The molecules are taken to be neutral, cation and anions in terms of their charge-states and linear, cyclic and aromatic in terms their molecular structures. Therefore, a wide range of possible electrostatic defect-molecule interactions are being considered. Among these 10 passivation agents, there are 6 cation, 1 anion, and 3 neutral molecules. We applied 1 anion passivation agent to donor defects and 6 cation passivation agents were applied to acceptor defects. The remaining 3 neutral molecules were applied on both donor and acceptor defects. These agents are contacted with the deep defects (see Figure  5d  and e ), which is a widely used strategy for surface defect passivation.  3, 20, 23, 44  We choose anions and neutral passivating agents on cationic defects to avoid any repulsive force between them. Likewise, for the anionic defects, we choose cation and neutral agents. This approach enabled more stable interaction between the surface and the agents according to our geometry optimizations. We first focused on the electron donor, FA i defect in PbI 2terminated surface and introduced neutral pyridazinone, benzene, SO 3 , and lactate anion molecules. We first relaxed the slab geometries and calculated the density-of-states (DOS) for each case, shown in Figure  5d  and e . DOS of FA i has a narrower band gap relative to that of defect-free DOS; trap states above the VBM and below the CBM are visible. We observed that (i) a weak O•••H hydrogen bond between pyridazinone and FA i on the surface, (ii) a nonbonded electrostatic interaction between benzene and FA i , (iii) a separate O•••H hydrogen bond between lactate and FA i and a Pb-O covalent bond between Lactate and surface Pb 2+ are formed and (iv) SO 3 interacts much strongly with the neighboring Pb 2+ , instead of FA i , most likely due to stronger valency of lead compared to FA cation. The details of the structures are shown in Figure  S6 . We calculated the interaction energies of pyridazinone, benzene, lactate, and SO 3 with the FA i surface defect and found to be -1.06, -0.67, -4.38, and -5.51 eV, respectively. When the FA i defect reacts with the aforementioned additives traps in both sides were effectively passivated, as presented in Figures  5d  and S6 . Among the additives, benzene molecule seems to exhibit the best FA i passivation. Pyridazinone, lactate, and SO 3 addition under-passivate the defect, even though they interact more strongly with the electron donor defect. For the other deep electron donor Pb i defect we consider, we observed that the deep trap state near the VBM is eliminated by the benzene additive, as shown in Figure  5e . However, pyridazinone, lactate, and SO 3 , which were covalently bond to the surface defect, does not passivate the defect level at all (Figures S7 and Table  S1 ). Here, we attribute the passivation of FA i and Pb i defects with benzene to the charge-transfer between the molecule and the defect and the delocalized chargedistribution in benzene. Charge-density difference (CDD) analysis can be used to quantify the charge-transfer between the defect (d) and the passivating additive (p) using Δρ = ρ dp -(ρ d + ρ p ), where ρ dp , ρ d , and ρ p are the charge density of defective surface with additive, defective surface only, and additive only, respectively. Figure  5f -g shows the CDD isosurface distributions of FA i and Pb i defects interacting with benzene.

343,92_29," RESULTS AND DISCUSSION BSO may be the best candidate as an ETL for commercializing PSCs because it has excellent conductivity with no additional process compared to its TiO 2 counterpart. But, a previous report shows the TiO 2 /BSO-based PSCs have a large hysteresis in current-voltage (J-V) curves.  18  Surprisingly, during the optimization process, we found that the introduction of SnO 2 nanoparticle layer onto the spray-deposited TiO 2 reduces the hysteresis in J-V curves (Figure  S1 ). For this reason, we employed a TiO 2 /SnO 2 bilayer as a blocking layer for mp-BSO-based PSCs. To maximize the device performance of mp-BSO-based PSCs, we adopted a state-of-the-art PSC architecture consisting of an FTO/ blocking layer (bl-TiO 2 and SnO 2 bilayer)/mesoporous layer/FA-based mixed perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au (Figure  1A ). For fabricating best-performing devices, all processes were carried out under optimum condition, i.e., 10% RH. From a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Figure  1A ), all the layers are discernible; the mesoporous BSO layer is deposited with a thickness of 140 nm, and a uniform perovskite layer on top of BSO is fabricated with a thickness of 450 nm by using our solvent engineering technique. From this resultant device, we obtained a reverse PCE of 22% with a stabilized PCE of 21.7% (Figure  1B ) and a certified average PCE of 21.3% (Figure  S2 ). As displayed in Figure  S3 , hysteresis behavior is clearly observed but is considerably suppressed in the mesoporous scaffold based on FA-based mixed perovskites, as compared to a previous study using La-doped BSO/MAPbI 3 planar PSCs.  18  A histogram of the solar-cell PCEs for 43 cells is shown in Figure  1C  and Table  S1 . Surprisingly, over 30 cells have a PCE of more than 21% (an average PCE of 21.45% G 0.61%), which is comparable to that of Li-doped mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs (hereafter, denoted as mp-TiO 2 ) (20.74% G 0.58%) (Figure  1C ). In addition to a highly efficient performance, practical processing stability in a production line is required until the device is encapsulated since moisture cannot be perfectly excluded in the processing environment, in contrast with the inert atmosphere of a laboratory (e.g., a glove box filled with nitrogen or dry air). We investigated the processing stability of an mp-BSO-based device fabricated and aged under controlled humidity (i.e., low humidity [$10% RH] and high humidity [$40% RH]). For comparison, we also prepared an mp-TiO 2 -based device under the same conditions. It should be noted that it is usually difficult to prepare a high-quality perovskite film with a dense and uniform morphology under humidity higher than 40% RH. Thus, we adjusted the humidity up to 40% RH. As shown in Figure  S4 , at 10% RH, we could not detect any degradation in either device even after 1 week, and the performance was enhanced from 19.4% and 19.2% to 20.1% and 21.3% for the mp-TiO 2 -based PSC and mp-BSO-based PSC, respectively, owing to the aging effect. However, at 40% RH, we found a significant difference in the device stability between mp-BSO and mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs. Figure  2A  shows the evolution of the average photovoltaic parameters over 24 h for non-encapsulated mp-BSO-and mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs aged at controlled 40% RH. Surprisingly, the mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs show serious degradation at 40% RH in the early stage of the first 3 h because of abrupt decreases in the fill factor (FF) and open circuit voltage (V OC ), and their performance diminishes to approximately 50% of the initial efficiency over 24 h (Figure  2A ). Conversely, the mp-BSO-based PSCs exhibit good stability at 40% RH for 24 h. The FF and short circuit current (J SC ) values stay constant for the first 3 h, while the V OC increases slightly because of the aging effect (similar to the result at 10% RH), resulting in an improvement in the PCE (Figure  2A ). Even after 24 h, only a slight decrease in the PCE is observed for the mp-BSO-based devices. For detailed information, a histogram of PCEs (Figure  S5 ), and full photovoltaic parameters (Tables  S2  and S3 ) for mp-BSO-and mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs processed and aged at 40% RH for 0 and 24 h are further shown. Consequently, it can be concluded that the mp-BSO is an ideal candidate for the ETL in a highly efficient PSC with good processing stability. To elucidate the degradation pathway by the humidity effect on both PSCs, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed at a V OC under 1 sun illumination. Figure  2B  presents the Nyquist plots of mp-TiO 2 -and mp-BSObased PSCs at different humidity conditions. The Nyquist plots show a typical semicircle in a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. The semicircle in the high-frequency region is caused by the selective contact or the interface of this contact and is related to the series resistance (R series ).  19  For a BSO-based PSC, the R series is negligibly affected by humidity, while the diameter of the semicircle for the mp-TiO 2 -based PSC in high-frequency regions increases significantly at higher humidity (40% RH), i.e., the increase in R series , which reduces the FF and thus decreases the PCE of the device. This is in agreement with R series trends extracted from the J-V curves. This increase in the R series can be attributed to the reduced electrical property of Li doped mp-TiO 2 film because all layers in the PSCs are identical except for the n-type mesoporous layer. Because the measured electron concentration for BSO and TiO 2 film also is the same (Figure  S6 ), the reduced electrical property may be ascribed to low mobility of TiO 2 film. Furthermore, the dark J-V curves show a clear difference between mp-BSO-and mp-TiO 2 -based devices, depending on humidity (Figure  2C ). The dark current of mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs is significantly reduced at high humidity ($40% RH) compared to mp-BSO-based PSC, although at low humidity ($10%), they exhibit similar dark J-V curves. In general, the reduction of dark current has a positive effect on devices, suggesting a decrease in defects and hence a reduction of recombination. However, an abnormally greater reduction of dark current may be due to a large drop in electrical properties of the ETL or the ETL/perovskite interface, i.e., an increase in the resistance of the ETL or the ETL/perovskite interface, which increases the R series , as shown in EIS analysis.  19  We further performed transient photocurrent (TPC) and photovoltage (TPV) analysis for devices aged at 40% RH (Figures  2D  and S7 ). It is observed that the mp-BSO-based PSC shows faster decay in TPC and slower decay in TPV than that of the mp-TiO 2 -based PSC, respectively. Additionally, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) result exhibits that the BSO/perovskite sample has a faster charge transfer compared to TiO 2 /perovskite (Figure  S8 ). Based on these results, we can conclude that mp-BSO-based PSCs fabricated and aged at 40 % RH have superior charge extraction capability than mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs fabricated and aged at 40% RH. Therefore, it can be assumed that a high-humidity condition can inhibit electron transport or transfer at the interface between oxide particles or at the interface between the perovskite and the ETL, thereby increasing the resistance of the ETL, which in turn can significantly decrease the FF and PCE of the device with mp-TiO 2 -treated Li salt. To reveal the exact reason for the increase in the resistance of the device, various analyses for mesoporous films under different humidity conditions were performed. First, we carried out X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figures  3A  and S9 ). Figure  3A  displays XPS O 1s spectra of BSO and mp-TiO 2 films with different humidity conditions. The spectra of the BSO films are almost identical regardless of the humidity, indicating that BSO is almost unaffected by humidity, whereas the spectra of the TiO 2 film show clear differences at different humidity conditions. A peak deconvolution process shows that the O 1s spectrum of the samples consists of two peaks at 529.4 and 531.4 eV. The peak with low binding energy is generally associated with the contribution of O 2 À ions in the anatase anionic network, while that with higher binding energy is attributed to the oxygen atoms in the OH species and/or the adsorbed oxygen species on the surface.  20, 21  At a high-humidity condition ($40% RH), the shoulder peak at 531.4 eV is diminished compared with the TiO 2 film at a low-humidity condition, indicating a decrease in the OH species on TiO 2 . Generally, the reduction of OH species may originate from the formation of a new oxide layer (e.g., oxide shell) on the surface of TiO 2 nanoparticles. To support this speculation, we performed a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis (Figure  3B ). Comparing the FTIR spectra of pristine TiO 2 and Li-doped TiO 2 , we found that Li doping inevitably produces lithium oxide (e.g., 625 and 716 cm À1 ; Li-O stretching) on TiO 2 films regardless of the humidity level.  22  Interestingly, the peaks for 625 and 716 cm À1 become stronger at higher humidity, although the peak at 832 cm À1 (Ti-O-Ti stretching) becomes weaker. This indicates that the moisture can accelerate the formation of lithium oxides in TiO 2 . As reported, some types of lithium compounds are critically sensitive to moisture in the air. Water can easily penetrate crystal structures or porous films and react with lithium in the lattice or surface, which can produce Li 2 O.  16  Furthermore, we directly confirmed the formation of an oxide layer on TiO 2 nanoparticles via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). Figures  3C  and 3D  compare HR-TEM images of Li-doped TiO 2 nanoparticles prepared under different humidity (10% or 40% RH). At low humidity (10% RH), the surface of the TiO 2 nanoparticles is smooth. Although we detected Li-O stretching on TiO 2 under low humidity through an FTIR analysis, we could not directly observe a noticeable layer on the TiO 2 surface in the TEM image. This can imply that Li x O can be partially or very thinly formed at a low-humidity condition. However, at high humidity (40% RH), we distinctly observed a non-uniform thin amorphous layer (<5 nm) on the surface of the TiO 2 nanoparticles. Therefore, it can be concluded that the formation of a lithium oxide layer on the surface of TiO 2 nanoparticles is one of the key factors responsible for deterioration of the device under high humidity.  Along with outstanding device performance, the durability of PSCs is another major factor for the commercialization of PSCs. We therefore investigated the long-term stability of BSO-based PSCs under dark storage, as well as under continuous illumination. First, devices were tested without any encapsulation in an ambient environment (25 C and $25% humidity). Figure  5A  shows a normalized PCE of the non-encapsulated FTO/ BSO/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au device as a function of storage time. The resulting device exhibits substantially excellent storage stability for 500 h, retaining almost 100% of the original PCE. Second, we performed a light stability test using two representative HTMs, i.e., Spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA, in a nitrogen-filled chamber at a constant temperature of $25 C under AM 1.5 G illumination using a xenon lamp. Figure  5B  displays the normalized PCE of the encapsulated FTO/BSO/(FAPbI 3 ) 0.93 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.07 (FAMA)/ Spiro-OMeTAD/Au device as a function of testing time under constant air mass (AM) 1.5 G illumination. The PCE of the BSO-based PSC degrades to 67% of its original value within the first 50 h, followed by retention over the next 450 h. Figure  5C  shows the normalized PCE of the encapsulated FTO/BSO/FAMA/PTAA/Au device as a function of testing time under constant AM 1.5 G illumination. The BSO-based PSCs using PTAA exhibit excellent photostability under light illumination, including UV without a drop in the PCE over 500 h, showing superior light stability to a Spiro-OMeTAD-based device. Based on these results, including successful elimination of the problems originating from the TiO 2 ETL, the n-type BSO ETL is a good candidate as an ETL for PSC commercialization. In conclusion, through systematic analyses, we demonstrated that a BSO ETL is an excellent alternative to TiO 2 for commercialization of PSCs. With the state-of-the-art PSC using mp-BSO ETL, we achieved a certified efficiency of 21.3% (reverse scan: 22%; and forward scan: 20.6%) with a stabilized efficiency of 21.7%. These values are comparable to those of the top-performing PSCs based on Li-doped TiO 2 and are the highest efficiencies among non-TiO 2 -based PSCs. By establishing a humid environment similar to that of an actual production line (i.e., high humidity over 40%), we have verified that the BSO ETL would be beneficial to the actual process because of its superior resistance to moisture relative to TiO 2 ETL. In addition, we confirmed that the mp-BSO-based PSCs exhibit superior long-term stability in a humid environment (25%-30% RH) and under light illumination, including UV. We believe that the introduction of mesoscopic BSO will enable a wide processing window in an actual production line, where it is difficult to remove moisture or control humidity, and it can move us a step closer to PSC commercialization. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""Li-doped TiO2"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": ""20"", ""treated_pce"": ""21.3"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""ISOSLT"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""40"", ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": ""20"", ""treated_pce"": ""21.3"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.9"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.5""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSD"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""25"", ""temperature"": ""25"", ""time"": ""500"", ""control_pce"": ""1.5 G"", ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""1""}, ""test_3"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""450"", ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.67""}}"

376,21_10," Electroluminescence (EL) efficiency measurements EL efficiency is measured in a nitrogen filled glovebox under ambient conditions in the dark. The device is voltage driven, and current is measured simultaneously by a Keithley 2636A sourcemeter. Photocurrent is collected using a calibrated Newport 818-UV/DB Silicon photodetector coupled to a Newport 1835-C Multifunction Optical meter. EL spectra are collected using an Ocean Optics USB 2000 spectrometer using a multimode fiber positioned over the center of the active area. As the device area (~0.32cm2) is comparable to the photodetctor active area, the photodetector surface is positioned such that the active area is 17.0 mm from the top surface of the device. To prevent collection of waveguided emission, a black plastic baffle surrounds the edge of the device. We measured the emission profile to be approximately Lambertian (Extended Data Figure  9 ) and applied an appropriate multiplicative geometric factor to the photocurrent value collected. EQE and radiance values are then obtained by scaling the corrected photocurrent values with the photodetector responsivity and EL spectrum. Note that the detector responsivity is relatively flat in the emission region and the observed variation in the EL spectra will account for a negligibly small variation in EQE. Current density and radiance values are calculated assuming the device active area is equal to the gold top contact area. It is found that a sweep rate below 20mV/s is required for the EL to stabilize. The I-V-Photocurrent sweep is run by a custom Labview code.     The band diagrams depicted in Extended Data Figure  8c -f to provide an explanation of the observed kinetics in the TRPL traces and the observed increased device performance. The 3D-control structure (Extended Data Figure  8c ) depicts the band diagram and the observed recombination pathways based on TRPL measurements. The observed radiative rate, k R (3D), is faster than the known intrinsic carrier lifetime in 3D perovskite thin films, likely due to the presence of non-radiative recombination pathways, k NR (3D), associated with the surface. When a LP layer is deposited on the 3D perovskite (Extended Data Figure  8d ), TRPL measurements observed with excitation from the 3D perovskite side show an increase in carrier lifetimes, k R1 (3D/LP), compared to the 3D control perovskite. On the other hand, the lifetime trace shows a relatively fast component, k R2 (3D/LP), when the 3D/LP is excited from the LP side, in addition to the long component (Extended Data Figure  7a ). This behavior of different lifetime profiles depending on the excitation side is not observed in the 3D control perovskite where the lifetime traces are almost identical for both film and substrate excitation. We identify the LP interlayer as a passivating layer that minimizes surface/interface trap states that otherwise would serve as nonradiative recombination centers. The additional passivation results in an increase in carrier lifetimes and the increase in detected photons. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the fast radiative component, k R2 (3D/LP), is due to a carrier buildup at the 3D/LP interface from band bending, which is supported by the UPS results. This carrier accumulation can contribute to the    without a UV-filter. The PSC shows an initial PCE of 22.6% and maintained 85% of its efficiency after 500 hrs. The device is encapsulated and measured in ambient condition.

435,49_15," Supplementary Here, we report phase-pure QW thin films by introducing a molten salt spacer n-butylamine acetate (BAAc), instead of the traditional halide spacers n-butylamine iodide (BAI). For strong ionic coordination between BAAc and the perovskite framework during the initial stage of solution processing, compounds with a uniformly distributed intermediate phase can be gelled from the precursor solution with near-monodisperse unit cell particles. We observe that the phase-pure QW films with microscale, vertically aligned grains can then be crystallized from their respective intermediate phases. Two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper layered metal-halide perovskites have attracted increasing attention for their desirable optoelectronic properties and improved stability compared to their three-dimensional counterparts. However, such perovskites typically consist of multiple quantum wells with a random well width distribution. Here, we report phase-pure quantum wells with a single well width by introducing molten salt spacer n-butylamine acetate, instead of the traditional halide spacer n-butylamine iodide. Due to the strong ionic coordination between n-butylamine acetate and the perovskite framework, a gel of a uniformly distributed intermediate phase can be formed. This allows phase-pure quantum well films with microscale vertically aligned grains to crystallize from their respective intermediate phases. The resultant solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency of 16.25% and a high open voltage of 1.31 V.

The BA 2 MA n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving BAI, MAI and PbI 2 , or BAAc, MAI and PbI 2 in DMF and DMSO (volume ratio is 4:1). For the n = 1-5 systems, the molar concentration of BAAc (liquid) was 0.58 mmol ml -1 , 0.31 mmol ml -1 , 0.21 mmol ml -1 , 0.16 mmol ml -1 and 0.13 mmol ml -1 , respectively. The obtained solution was stirred at 65 °C for 2 h in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. BAAc-based precursor (<n> = 1) was prepared with BAAc (76.86 mg, 0.58 mmol), HI (~66 µl, 0.58 mmol) and PbI 2 (133.14 mg, 0.29 mmol) in DMF and DMSO. For the <n> > 1 precursor, we provided additional MAI with the BAAc in the amount needed to make up for the insufficient iodine; for example, the <n> = 2 precursor contained BAAc (41.47 mg, 0.31 mmol), MAI (74.36 mg, 0.47 mmol) and PbI 2 (143.74 mg, 0.31 mmol); <n> = 3 precursor contained BAAc (28.39 mg, 0.21 mmol), MAI (67.90 mg, 0.43 mmol) and PbI 2 (147.65 mg, 0.32 mmol); <n> = 4 precursor contained BAAc (21.59 mg, 0.16 mmol), MAI (64.53 mg, 0.41 mmol) and PbI 2 (149.68 mg, 0.32 mmol); and <n> = 5 precursor contained BAAc (17.42 mg, 0.13 mmol), MAI (62.46 mg, 0.39 mmol) and PbI 2 (150.93 mg, 0.33 mmol). Device fabrication. The patterned ITO substrate was washed with deionized water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol successively, with drying under nitrogen flow. After 15 min ultraviolet-O 3 treatments, a SnO 2 nanocrystal solution was spin coated on the substrate at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s to form a 50-nm-thick electron-transporting layer, which was then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in air. For the persistent hot-casting process, the ITO/SnO 2 substrates were preheated at 100 °C on the spin coater for 5 min, and 50 μl of precursor solution was dropped onto the hot substrate. The spin coater was immediately started with a spin speed of 4,000 r.p.m. for 20 s with 4,000 ramp, and the substrate temperature was elevated from 100 °C to 110 °C by a program controller. The colour of the thin film turned from pale yellow to brown in a few seconds as the solvent escaped. After spin coating, the substrates were quickly removed from the spin coater and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min covered with a small Petri dish. The substrates were then transferred to a nitrogen glove box to complete the device fabrication. For the hole transporting layer, a spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (75 mg ml -1 ) solution was employed with the addition of 35 μl Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (260 mg ml -1 ) and 30 μl 4-tertbutylpyridine. For the stability test, PTAA solution was obtained by dissolving 40 mg PTAA powder in 1 ml chlorobenzene with 10% TPFB. Then 35 μl of the spiro-OMeTAD solution or PTAA solution was dropped onto the perovskite-coated substrate and spin coated at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The device was finished by the thermal evaporation of molybdenum trioxide (5 nm) and Au (80 nm) under vacuum with a shadow mask that kept an active area of 0.05 cm 2 . Characterization. The crystallographic structure information was characterized on a Rigaku (Smart Lab 3 kW) X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å) at a speed of 20 degrees per minute under the operation conditions of 40 kV and 30 mA.

474,56_2,"Introduction Perovskite solar cells have undergone major development from their first discovery in 2009, to a viable technology that is approaching commercialization.  [1]  One of their most interesting assets is the wide range of bandgaps which can be fabricated by changing the perovskite composition, opening up the possibility to produce allperovskite multijunction cells that can overcome the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit of single junctions. For a tandem cell, the ideal bandgaps for the top and bottom cell are 1.7-1.9 and 0.9-1.2 eV, respectively.  [2]  Fully lead-based perovskites are widely investigated and have reached power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 25.5%.  [3]  In order to achieve ideal bandgaps for the low-gap cell in all-perovskite tandem photovoltaics, a mixture of lead and tin atoms at the B-site of the ABX 3 perovskite structure is required. This allows metal halide perovskites to reach bandgaps as low as 1.2 eV.  [4, 5]  While many studies in the literature focus their efforts into improving the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) and fill factor (FF) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), there are less reports that investigate the loss in short-circuit current density (J SC ). In fact, highperforming perovskites have been shown to have ""only"" moderate (≈5-15%) J SC losses compared to the SQ limit making them competitive in this regard with established technologies such as c-Si and GaAs, as shown in Figure  1a . In many cases, this loss is quickly overlooked and treated as a result of suboptimal light management in the cell which could be solved by optimizing the thickness of the solar cell stack or by using more complex light management strategies such as, for example, textured substrates,  [6, 7]  cavities & plasmon resonances,  [8]  or carefully designed anti-reflective layers.  [9, 10]  However, as we will show, suboptimal light management is not the only cause of J SC losses in perovskite solar cells, even in well performing mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite cells. Tin-based and mixed PbSn perovskite solar cells are particularly affected by short-circuit current losses and their efficiencies lag behind those of their full-lead equivalents, despite having a band gap closer to the ideal for single junctions, with the best mixed lead/tin cells only reaching certified PCEs Efficient mixed metal lead-tin halide perovskites are essential for the development of all-perovskite tandem solar cells, however they are currently limited by significant short-circuit current losses despite their near optimal bandgap (≈1.25 eV). Herein, the origin of these losses is investigated, using a combination of voltage dependent photoluminescence (PL) timeseries and various charge extraction measurements. It is demonstrated that the Pb/Sn-perovskite devices suffer from a reduction in the charge extraction efficiency within the first few seconds of operation, which leads to a loss in current and lower maximum power output. In addition, the emitted PL from the device rises on the exact same timescales due to the accumulation of electronic charges in the active layer. Using transient charge extraction measurements, it is shown that these observations cannot be explained by doping-induced electronic charges but by the movement of mobile ions toward the perovskite/transport layer interfaces, which inhibits charge extraction due to band flattening. Finally, these findings are generalized to lead-based perovskites, showing that the loss mechanism is universal. This elucidates the negative role mobile ions play in perovskite solar cells and paves a path toward understanding and mitigating a key loss mechanism. of a bit over 20%.  [11] [12] [13] [14]  Considering reported bandgaps of 1.22 eV for a 50:50 Pb:Sn mixture, this would allow a maximum shortcircuit current density of ≈37.1 mA cm -2 if we assume that an average external quantum efficiency of 95% can be achieved as demonstrated in the best Pb-perovskite cells.  [15, 16]  However, even the best APbSnI 3 perovskites achieve significantly lower currents, for example, 32 mA cm -2 have been demonstrated for a bandgap of 1.22 eV in ref. [13]. In most other reports, PbSn perovskites with similar bandgaps delivered even lower shortcircuit current (<30 mA cm  -2  ).  [17] [18] [19]  This discrepancy between two apparently similar technologies is not often discussed and it is currently not clear why Sn(II) containing perovskites cannot achieve as high currents as their lead counterparts relative to their SQ limits. Generally, it is well known that Sn(II)-containing metal halide perovskites are more prone to oxidation to Sn(IV) than their Pb(II) counterparts, due to the inert pair effect stabilizing the 6s electrons in Pb(II). This propensity to oxidize has led researchers to conclude that this is likely the origin of performance losses in PbSn perovskites. In turn, significant efforts have been undertaken to prevent this oxidation, or reduce its negative effects, such as the addition of metallic Sn to the solution to reduce Sn 4+ through comproportionation,  [13]  addition of antioxidants and reducing agents,  [14, 20, 21]  or addition of excess Sn 2+ by using salts such as SnF 2 , which also acts as a reducing agent.  [22]  Recently, it was also proposed to move away from using dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as a co-solvent, as this could oxidize Sn 2+ to Sn 4+ in solution.  [23]  However, the exact effect of the increased concentration of ""oxidation-induced"" mobile charges in the system has only been investigated by a few researchers.  [24] [25] [26]  On the one hand, there has been substantial evidence of a large increase in the dark conductivity of Sn based perovskites upon exposure to oxygen, which is most likely due to electronic doping. For example, in ref. [27,28], a background hole carrier concentration of 10 15 to 10 16 cm -3 has been reported. This led to the conclusion that it is largely the p-doping that is responsible for the significant current losses.  [29, 30]  For example, a high concentration of doping-induced carriers could reduce the lifetime and diffusion length of photoinduced charge or screen the   [13,48,49], as compared to the perovskite cells studied in this work (filled circles). The graph was inspired by ref. [56] Generally, PbSn-perovskites have larger current losses compared to Pb-perovskites, including MAPbI 3 and several triple cation Cs 0.05 (FA x MA y ) 0.95 Pb(I x Br y ) 3 devices made from different (x:y) ratios of FAPbI 3 and MAPbBr 3 . b) A cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy image of a typical FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 perovskite pin-type solar cell device. c) Forward and reverse JV scan at a scan rate of 60 mV s -1 under AM1.5G illumination. d) Device absorption (1-reflectance) and external quantum efficiency spectra of a FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 perovskite pin-type solar cell, with a graphical representation of the different current losses that occur in the system. It can be seen that, besides parasitic absorption and optical losses that stem from the sample being too thin to absorb all the light, there are also significant charge collection losses. built-in field, which would in turn reduce the charge extraction efficiency, thereby causing short-circuit current losses.  [27, 31, 32]  Although it is expected that high levels of doping can undermine the device performance, the exact underlying mechanisms have not been studied thoroughly experimentally, and the concentration of charge carriers required to induce detrimental effects is not precisely known. Moreover, the charge collection losses at short-circuit conditions in Sn-based perovskites can be caused by an insufficient charge carrier diffusion length due to electronic defects, which would also negatively affect the open-circuit voltage. On the other hand, the performance losses could be caused by mobile ions, which may cause screening (or more precisely, a redistribution) of the internal field. Several groups have attempted to quantify mobile ion concentrations in different perovskites, and their outcomes are generally in the range of 10 15 to 10 19 cm -3 .  [33] [34] [35] [36]  Indeed, the presence of mobile ions is expected in PbSn perovskite thin-films. For example, Leijtens et al.  [37]  recently investigated the mechanism of oxidation of Sn and PbSn perovskites through X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and UV-vis, and demonstrated that mobile ions such as FA + or I -are likely formed. However, the effect of mobile ions on the short-circuit current losses in perovskites has, in general, not been investigated as intensively as, for example, their effect on the V OC ,  [38]  the hysteresis,  [39] [40] [41]  and device stability.  [42] [43] [44]  In order to further improve PbSn and Pb-based perovskite solar cells and other electronic devices,  [45, 46]  it is vital to gain a more detailed understanding of the mechanism causing short-circuit current losses and the exact effects of electronic doping and mobile ions on the device operation. In this work, we investigated short-circuit current losses in low bandgap, mixed PbSn (FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 ) and other lead-based perovskite cells. In particular, we first aimed to understand whether the charge transport losses under short-circuit conditions in mixed PbSn perovskites (FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 ) are a result of electronic doping or mobile ions, before generalizing the results to other Pb-based systems. To this end, we recorded the temporal evolution of the current transient and determined a concurrent rise in the photoluminescence (PL) emission intensity after switching the voltage from V OC to short-circuit, which implies an accumulation of electronic charge in the perovskite bulk. We hence attribute the reduced current-density to a reduced charge extraction efficiency. The decay in current directly translates into a loss of the steady-state maximum power point output of the device on the same timescales and to a current loss at slow scan speeds. To distinguish whether background doping or mobile ions are responsible for this loss, we performed bias assisted charge extraction (BACE) and charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV) measurements, which allowed us to investigate the density and dynamics of extracted electronic and ionic charges. Overall, these measurements underline the extraction of electronic (bias-induced injected) charges on the µs-timescales, while the characteristic features of mobile ions appear on the ms-s timescales, as observed in the current decay transients. Importantly, the ionic charge density (>1 × 10 17 cm -3 ) was found to exceed the injected and photogenerated electronic charge density (5 × 10 15 cm -3 ) present at V OC by several orders of magnitudes, therefore dominating the observed recombination losses in the transient current decay. Moreover, the density of doping induced equilibrium charges (≈6 × 10 14 cm -3 ) was found to be negligible compared to the capacitive charge density (6 × 10 15 cm -3 ), hence the density of doping-induced charge, in contrast with the mobile ion density, is insufficient to screen or redistribute the built-in potential. Furthermore, we could reproduce both the transient and steady-state performance of the device using numerical simulations, which further corroborated the understanding obtained from the experimental results. Finally, we demonstrated that PbSn based perovskites are not unique with respect to ion-induced current losses, but the same losses appear in various other perovskite compositions and architectures. Overall, the mobile ion induced losses limit the power conversion efficiency of our devices by 1-3% absolute. As such, this work underlines the importance ""ionmanagement"" to overcome band flattening and to minimize the recombination losses under maximum power point losses and improve device stability. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""FA0.83Cs0.17Pb0.5Sn0.5I3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}"
475,56_3," Results Here we studied, low bandgap FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 perovskite photovoltaic devices. The device stack is comprised of spin-coated poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) hole transporting layer (HTL) on a glass substrate coated with an indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) conductive layer. On top of that, the perovskite layer with a thickness of 470 nm is deposited via spin-coating. The stack is completed by an electron transporting layer (ETL) comprised of evaporated C 60 (30 nm) and bathocuproine (BCP) (8 nm), with a copper (Cu) electrode on top. A detailed description of the device preparation can be found in Supporting Information. A crosssection of a complete device is displayed in Figure  1b . A JV scan of a characteristic efficient device can be seen in Figure  1c , while more detailed characteristics and statistics can be found in Figure  S1 , Supporting Information. From the device absorption and the external quantum efficiency (EQE), displayed in Figure  1d , the different current losses in the device can be determined. First of all, the optical losses of the device, as determined from the total reflectance R of the device, are significant. This is caused by the relatively low absorption coefficient of the lead-tin perovskite near the band edge (Figure  S2 , Supporting Information) and the absorber layer being too thin to absorb all the incident photons with energies above the bandgap. On top of that, the lead-tin perovskite devices suffer from significant additional collection losses (≈2 mAcm -2 ), which can be determined from the difference between the device absorption minus parasitic losses in the ITO, PEDOT:PSS and copper (i.e., 1-R-R parasitic ), and the device EQE. The parasitic losses were estimated using a transfer matrix code developed by McGehee, et al.  [47]  Although the optical losses can be largely reduced in thicker ≈800 nm devices (Figure  S3 , Supporting Information), the J SC cannot be improved due to enhanced collection losses. Therefore, it can be concluded that the combination of relatively large optical losses in 470 nm thick devices and the large collection losses in our thicker devices (e.g., ≈800 nm), possibly due to traps resulting in an insufficient carrier diffusion length, are among the main reasons for the relatively low J SC of the PbSn-perovskite as compared to Pb-based perovskites, with respect to what is expected from their different band gaps. In the following, however, we focus on understanding the observed charge collection losses at 0 V in the optimum 470 nm-thick devices, which are poorly understood and also significantly contributing to the J SC loss. To investigate these collection losses at 0 V, we first measured the time dependence of the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and the short-circuit current density (J SC ) immediately after switching from V OC to 0 V, while the sample remains under continuous illumination. As can be seen in Figure  2a , the J SC falls during the initial few seconds of operation at 0 V before eventually reaching a steady-state. On average, we find that freshly prepared FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 devices experience current density losses of 1.4 mA cm -2 . This equals about 5% of the initial current density. To reveal the reason for the loss in current, we simultaneously measured the emitted PL from the cell as a function of time. The temporal evolution of the PL spectra is displayed in Figure  2b , while the corresponding peak height is displayed in Figure  2c . It can be seen that, when the device bias is changed to 0 V at t = 0 s, the PL is initially nearly completely quenched. Considering that the PL yield is directly proportional to the product of the electron and hole density (n × p), the strong reduction of the PL at 0 V with respect to V OC indicates an efficient initial extraction of electronic charges.  [50]  However, after the initial quench, the PLQY starts to quickly rise again despite the fact that the device is still kept under short-circuit conditions. This indicates that the efficiency of the charge extraction is gradually reduced, causing charges to accumulate in the device until the PL and the charge carrier distribution stabilizes after about 3 s. Therefore, the loss of current is not consistent with a deteriorating interface quality Adv. Energy Mater. 2021, 11, 2101447 or defects. At the time of stabilization, the PL has increased to up to ≈6% of the PLQY value at open circuit conditions. Importantly, the decrease in current density and increased PL yield leads also to a direct loss in efficiency, that is, in the initial phase of maximum power point (MPP) tracking measurements, as displayed in Figure  2d . This has important implications as it indicates that the observed effect also influences cell performance under steady-state working conditions. Figure  2e  displays the field screening due the accumulation of mobile ions at the interfaces over time, which is expected to cause the observed J SC and MPP losses and the increase of the PL on the same timescales. The simplified time dependent band structures displayed in Figure  2e  are extracted from our numerical device simulations (details about the simulations are discussed further below). The corresponding time-dependent simulated band structures are presented in Figure  S4 , Supporting Information, which also includes a more detailed description of the movement of mobile ions in the performed experiments. Interestingly, as shown in Figure  S5 , Supporting Information, we find that there is an approximately linear relationship between the current decay and the increase in PL at 0 V. To explain this, we consider that the PL yield is proportional to the radiative recombination current ( J rad = eϕ PL ), while the current decay is mostly governed by non-radiative recombination (as the overall PLQY yield of the sample is only 10 -4 ). Therefore, a linear relationship between the current decay and the PL increase implies that the radiative and non-radiative recombination losses are directly proportional to each other. In other words, the field screening-induced accumulation of electronic charges in the active layer increases the radiative and non-radiative recombination losses in the same way, which is consistent with the findings of our previous study.  [50]  It is important to note that the current losses can occur even if the charge carrier diffusion length in the perovskite exceeds the film thickness. This is because the transport layers can limit the extraction from the device and also interfacial recombination can increase if more charges accumulate in the active layer. To describe the current decay more quantitatively, we performed numerical drift-diffusion simulations of the cell, using the commercially available SETFOS 5.1 software package provided by FLUXiM. The input parameters for the simulations shown in Table  S1 , Supporting Information were partially based on our previous simulation work of pin-type triple cation perovskites,  [51, 52]  and parameters tailored for lead-tin using the literature specified in Table  S1 , Supporting Information and our own extraction measurements, as discussed further below. The fit from the numerical simulations is shown in Figure  2a  by the dashed line, which highlights that both the kinetics of the decay can be reproduced with the experimentally obtained effective ion diffusion coefficient (≈10 -10 cm 2 s -1 ) and density (≈10 17 cm -3 ) as well as the overall magnitude of the current losses. Figure  S6 , Supporting Information demonstrates the simulated current decay for other mobile ion densities. In the following we demonstrate that the time dependent losses of the short-circuit current are also present in JV hysteresis measurements at slow scan speeds. To clearly visualize this important fact, we performed ""fast hysteresis"" measurements, where the JV is measured in forward and reverse direction over several orders of magnitude in scan speed (100 mV s -1 to 800 V s -1 ) after keeping the cell under open-circuit conditions and constant AM1.5G illumination. The details of this measurement are presented in Supporting Information. ) ) ) Figure  3 . a) The current density as obtained from JV scans in forward and reverse direction as a function of scan speed (100 mV s -1 to 800 V s -1 ). b) exemplifies the JV scans in forward and reverse direction at the slowest (top) and fastest scan speed (bottom). At fast enough scan speeds (scan time << ion transit time), the mobile ions in the perovskite layer are not able to react to the change in the applied voltage, and hence the obtained efficiency can be regarded as a proxy of the ion-free efficiency. At slow scan speeds, however, mobile ions are able to screen the built-in field. This lowers the device efficiency, primarily through increased short-circuit current losses in case of the studied cells. Panel (a) shows lower current density for JV scans taken at slower scan speeds, as opposed to the ""mobile-ion free"" JV scans taken at the fastest scan speeds. Hence, the current losses also appear in the JV-measurements at slow scan speeds that are representative for steady-state conditions, as shown in Figure  2 . 800 V s -1 ), the mobile ions do not have enough time to react to the change in the external voltage, hence an ""ion-free current density"" is obtained if the ions are roughly homogeneously distributed at the starting voltage (V OC ). However, at slower scan speeds (e.g., 1 s per scan), the mobile ions are able to follow the change in internal field by moving from their equilibrium positions toward the transport layers, where they start to screen the field causing the losses in the J SC . Indeed, at the slowest scan speeds (10 -1 V s -1 ), a decrease in J SC of about 1.5 mA cm -2 is observed with respect to the fast-scan (800 V s -1 ). As such, both the timescale (1 ms to 10 s) and the magnitude of the current decay (1.5 mA cm -2 ) in the hysteresis measurements is consistent with the temporal current decay shown previously in Figure  2a . In order to distinguish between different processes that could cause the observed current losses and the suspected band flattening, and to elucidate the density and kinetics of free electronic and ionic charge, we performed different charge extraction measurements. Figure  4a  shows the extracted charge as a function of time from bias assisted charge extraction (BACE), where the (displacement) current is recorded upon a switch from V OC to 0 V. The charge inside the active layer is thereby obtained by integrating the displacement current over time. It is important to note that mobile ions are not extracted from the device rather transported to the transport layers or electrodes, which however, causes an external displacement current. As can be seen in Figure  4a , the obtained temporal evolution of the charge density displays two features; an initial rise at ≈1 µs and a second rise at ≈300 ms. The initial rise consists itself of two contributions, the extraction of electronic charges that were injected at V OC and the RC decay due to the electrode (capacitive) charge (CU, where U is the V OC ). As shown in Figure  S7 , Supporting Information, using a separate setup with a home-built amplifier with a relatively low resistance (≈5 Ω), we can distinguish the contribution of these two initial processes to the first bump. As shown in  an injected charge carrier density of 2 × 10 15 cm -3 , while the electrode charge divided by the perovskite volume equals to 6 × 10 15 cm -3 at 0 V (if the V OC is equal to the built-in field). Furthermore, upon applying a constant background illumination with a 1-sun equivalent intensity, the same measurement allows us to quantify the photogenerated charge carrier density that is present at V OC , Figure  S8 , Supporting Information. The details of the measurement are discussed more elaborately in the captions of the corresponding figures in Supporting Information. Coming back to Figure  4a , the second increase in the extracted (or transported) charge is assigned to the mobile ion density in the system with a characteristic effective displacement time of 300 ms. This corresponds to the timescale observed in the current decay and PL increase. Note, this corresponds to an effective ion mobility of 4 × 10 -9 cm 2 V -1 s -1 and a diffusion coefficient of ≈1 × 10 -10 cm 2 s -1 . Importantly, the obtained ion density in the system is ≈2 × 10 17 cm -3 , which is significantly larger than the electronic charge in the system, including the electrode charge (per volume) that creates the built-in potential. Hence, a significant redistribution of the built-in field is expected due to the obtained ion density (as already shown above in Figure  2e ). We note again, that the obtained ion diffusion coefficient and density was used as an input parameter for the numerical simulations, which allowed us to fit the current decay shown in Figure  2a . In order to further corroborate the BACE measurements, we performed charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (dark-CELIV) measurements, which are shown in Figure  4b . In this measurement, the linearly increasing voltage leads to a constant charging current of the electrodes. For a dielectric capacitor in the absence of mobile charges in the active layer, the response to the CELIV voltage pulse is a step function.  [53]  Any additional charge present, for example, doping induced equilibrium charges or mobile ions (or photogenerated charges with background light), will cause a ""bump"" in the transient response, which allows us to estimate their density with respect to the electrode charge (CV max , where V max = -0.4 V is the maximum applied voltage of the triangular pulse in this case). Hence, the absence of an initial bump in the dark-CELIV response, shown in Figure  4b , indicates that the doping density is insignificant with respect to CV max per cell volume (≪ 5 × 10 15 cm -3 ). To further highlight this important point, we performed a photo-CELIV measurement, where we intentionally photogenerated a charge carrier density of e.g. 1 × 10 15 cm -3 in the perovskite cell. As shown in Figure  4c , this photogenerated charge carrier density can nicely be seen in the current response and is roughly in the correct ratio compared to the CV max charge. Moreover, the extraction of the photo generated charge carrier density happens on the order of 1 µs, which further confirms the timescale of electronic charge transport. We note the relatively long extraction time is likely limited by the transport layers rather than bulk transport through the perovskite layer, as has been previously shown.  [54]  To quantify the doping density in the PbSn perovskite, we performed lateral conductivity measurements which revealed a dark conductivity of 9 × 10 -5 S cm -1 (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information). Assuming a long-range charge carrier mobility of roughly 1 cm 2 V -1 s -1 (which is lower than the short-range charge carrier mobility as obtained from optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy measurements in ref. [18], since we consider grain boundaries), this would correspond to a doping-induced charge carrier density of ≈6 × 10 14 cm -3 , which is consistent with the absence of a dopinginduced feature in the CELIV response. Turning our attention again to the dark-CELIV transient in Figure  4b , after ≈1 ms the signal rises again just as observed in the BACE measurements due to the presence of mobile ions until beyond 100 ms, which represents the detection limit of our current setup. Considering that the current does not saturate, only a lower mobile ion density of 1.5 × 10 16 cm -3 , can be specified upon integration of the dark-CELIV signal. Therefore, these transient measurements demonstrate that the mobile ion concentration is much larger than the photogenerated charge carrier density, the injected charge at V OC and the doping induced charge, and sufficiently large to redistribute the device built-in electric field. In contrast, it is important to note that the doping density is much smaller than the CU charge per cell volume (6 × 10 15 cm -3 ), which is too low to screen the electric field. To further highlight this point, we performed numerical simulations, the results of which, displayed in Figure  4d , demonstrate that the doping density will only start to make a significant impact at densities exceeding ≈1 × 10 16 cm -3 , at which point the built-in field becomes screened. Moreover, it can be seen that electronic doping, although it can affect the device performance at higher concentrations, as is displayed in Figure  S10 , Supporting Information, never leads to a temporal current decay, whereas for mobile ions, temporal current decays are observed for a range of concentrations. Interestingly, we also found that when the mobile ion concentration reaches a certain threshold, the stabilized current still decreases with increasing mobile ion densities, but the temporal decay disappears. We attribute this to the fact that at these high mobile ion densities, the ion concentrations at the TL interfaces are already large enough at t = 0 s to fully screen the field. The simulation results displayed here are for the case of only one mobile ionic species. In Figure  S11 , Supporting Information, results for the case were there are two types of mobile ion present are displayed. Overall, the experimentally measured timescales and carrier densities allow us to conclude that the collection losses of the current stem from the ionic movement in the perovskite causing a redistribution of the internal field, rather than from electronic doping. In order to find out whether the loss mechanism described above is unique for tin-containing perovskites, or if it also occurs for other perovskite compositions or architectures, we investigated several different lead-based perovskite systems. Surprisingly, as shown in Figure  5a , we observed that the exact same charge transport losses are indeed present for all other studied lead-based perovskites, including methyl ammonium lead triiodide, two triple cation perovskites (Cs 0.05 (FA x MA y ) 0.95 Pb(I x Br y ) 3 ), with different x/y ratios as well as for a triple cation perovskite in a nip-configuration based on TiO 2 and Spiro-OMeTAD. Further details of the device fabrication are presented in the Supporting Information. Also for these systems, as displayed in Figure  5b , the transient current decay is accompanied by an increase in PL over time at 0 V, while the timescales of the current loss and deterioration in charge extraction efficiency corresponds to the timescales at which the ions move in the respective systems. Figure  5c  displays the effects of different scan speeds on the obtained short-circuit current confirming that the current at slow scan speeds is significantly lower than the ""ion-free"" J SC fast-scan speeds. This confirms that the finding that ionic charge movement is responsible for the observed current losses can be generalized beyond tin-based perovskites to lead halide perovskites. The formation of field-free regions in the perovskite bulk due to mobile ions is thus not only responsible for the JV hysteresis, but also for significant current and efficient losses under realistic operating conditions. The latter is shown in Figure  5d , which highlights the MPP tracking of several devices with a high time resolution (≈10 ms). Each of these devices displays a quick initial decrease in maximum power output (which might be easily overlooked when tracking the device efficiency over longer times). We point out that light soaking has also shown to have an impact on ion migration and hysteresis.  [55]  In order to distinguish between light soaking effects and the studied current losses, we have checked whether the scan-rate dependent hysteresis is reversible, or if there are permanent/light-induced changes in the device performance. Figure  S12 , Supporting Information shows that for the pin-type perovskite cells studied here, the current losses observed are not linked to light soaking induced changes in the device performance. However, on longer timescales, light soaking may have more pronounced effects. Finally, we note that we found the mobile-ion-induced  losses were overall quite similar in PbSn-and Pb-perovskite, hence we attribute the difference in the J SC loss in these two systems more to the difficulties in obtaining thicker active layers in PbSn-perovskites, which are required due to their lower absorption coefficient at the band edge. Nevertheless, preventing the fast-field screening and the corresponding current losses by minimizing the mobile ion density in all studied perovskites, would thus allow a significant improvement of the current in steady-state and in turn a substantial PCE improvement of between 1.5-3% absolute, even in our optimized devices. ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""FA0.83Cs0.17Pb0.5Sn0.5I3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""FA0.83Cs0.17Pb0.5Sn0.5I3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TitaniumDioxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP""}"

Supplementary Note 1. In order to investigate and address the issue of cations inhomogeneity, we draw a conclusion that the criterial of additive molecule design should be integrating functions of modulating crystallizations of perovskite and compensating lattice mismatch. Firstly, we selected design route of sulfone group because of it has more electron doners, which would possibly regulate the crystallization better through interacting with perovskite more strongly. Secondly, geometrical parameters and polarities are determinant to additive properties. We expected an appropriate geometrical size to ensure molecules to stay in the films rather than escape because of there would be residuals in the films to maintain inhibiting cations inhomogeneity, and compensate discrepancy of cations size in perovskite. Considering sulfoxide group is recognized to serve as electron doner for PbI2, according to PbI2 lattice space of 6.32 Å (Calculated using Bragg's Law 𝑑 = 𝜆 2sin(𝜃) = 1.54 2×sin(𝑅𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑠(  13.98°2  )) = 6.32Å ), inserting two single five-or six-membered rings is most suitable to creat a stable structure. Furthermore, the directional electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution and moderate negative potential center enable additive to precisely regulate the target site during crystallizations and stable adsorption to perovskite (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). Therein, it is preferrable for two asymmetry single rings to be arranged on either side of the sulfoxide group. We calculated local potential of perovskite lattice adsorbed with PSP in order to assess additive properties through potential variation at specific region. The results demonstrated a significant potential variation at Cs region, suggesting PSP prefer to adsorb at Cs region through charge interaction (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). Supplementary Fig.  4 . ToF-SIMS profiles obtained from a solar cell configuration of (a) the reference and (b) PSP sample.     that serious behavior of cations accumulation, leading to Cs-rich phase. The conventional XRD measurements results demonstrated that, with the increasing x value, the right-side shoulder peak was growing stronger and shifting towards higher 2-theta degrees. A linear relationship between Cs/(Cs+FA)-ratio and the location of shoulder peaks was observed, which is consistent with the assumption that the Cs-rich phase preferred to accumulate at the bottom region within perovskite films, thus leading to a gradient phase distribution of Cs-poor to Cs-rich evolution from the surface to bottom.     During the annealing process, PSP residuals should be a high-temperature crystal structure remain in the perovskite films, which possibly accounts for the passivation effect. However, we cannot detect PSP related characteristic XRD signals in perovskite films, it was possibly attributed to tiny amount of PSP introduced. We presume that PSP have different function interact with perovskites through different structures. At the stage of crystallization and perovskite phase transition, PSP worked as homogeneous phase regulator through RT structure. Regarding with the as-fabricated films, PSP residues with high-temperature structure remains in perovskite films possibly worked as passivator and further stabilize the device through strengthen the bottom region.   Perovskite solar cells with the formula FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 , where FA is formamidinium, provide an attractive option for integrating high efficiency, durable stability and compatibility with scaled-up fabrication. Despite the incorporation of Cs cations, which could potentially enable a perfect perovskite lattice  1, 2  , the compositional inhomogeneity caused by A-site cation segregation is likely to be detrimental to the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells  3, 4  . Here we visualized the out-of-plane compositional inhomogeneity along the vertical direction across perovskite films and identified the underlying reasons for the inhomogeneity and its potential impact for devices. We devised a strategy using 1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole to homogenize the distribution of cation composition in perovskite films. The resultant p-i-n devices yielded a certified steady-state photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of 25.2% and durable stability. There have been significant improvements in the efficiency of lead-halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs)  5  , largely due to the development of new passivation strategies  6, 7  and the optimization of the perovskite composition  8  . Notably, the modulation of the A-site composition, specifically with FA-Cs alloyed perovskite, where FA is formamidinium, is emerging as a promising method for boosting efficiency  9  . However, there are growing concerns about the stability of Cs-containing perovskites due to the segregation of the cations, which could potentially accelerate the long-term degradation  3, 4, 10, 11  . The distribution of these inhomogeneous phases within perovskites and their direct impact on efficiency are not yet fully understood. Herein, we visualize the spatially inhomogeneous phase distribution along the vertical direction across perovskite films and propose that device performance is limited by out-of-plane compositional inhomogeneity. Furthermore, we identified that unbalanced crystallization and phase transition between A-site components have a significant effect on the segregation of the FA and Cs phases. To address this issue, we devised a strategy using 1-(phenylsulfonyl) pyrrole (PSP) as an additive to retard the segregation of cations in FA-Cs perovskites. The PSP-treated devices have a p-i-n structure and yielded a champion photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.1% (certified reverse PCE of 25.8% and certified steady-state PCE of 25.2%). ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN""}"

The bandgap of this perovskite recipe was determined to be 1.51 eV by the Tauc plot method (Supplementary Figs. 21) and by using the derivative of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the solar cell (Extended Data Fig.  7 ). The champion device yielded a notable PCE of up to 26.09%/25.16% (reverse/forward scan direction) whereas the reference cell had PCEs of 24.62%/23.48% (Fig.  4a ). The corresponding steady-state power output efficiencies were 25.15% and 23.72%, respectively. An unencapsulated device achieved certified PCEs of 25.8% and 25.2% for the reverse scan and for the steady-state output, as certified by an independent organization (Supplementary Fig.  22 ). The fill factor of the champion device exceeded 85%, which is nearly 95% of the theoretical limit (89.5%). We attributed the remarkable fill factor improvement to the improved charge carrier extraction, which is supported by the efficiency improvement in the n-i-p configuration as well (Supplementary Fig.  23 ). The open-circuit voltage (V OC ) improved from 1.145 to 1.164 V, which is consistent with the reduced trap density. The short-circuit current density (J SC ) over 26 mA cm  -2  was consistent with the integrated J SC extracted from the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) (Fig.  4b ). The reproducibility was evaluated using a batch of devices comprising 16 individuals for each set-up (Supplementary Fig.  25 ). We further tested the solar cells in a light-emitting diode (LED) mode. The LED EQE EL improved from 7.1% to 9.7% (Fig.  4c ), so that the emission peaks were around 820 nm (Supplementary Fig.  26 ). We fabricated devices with an upscaled area of 1 cm 2 , and the efficiency improved from 21.78% to 23.64% (Fig.  4d ). This improvement was mainly associated with the enhanced fill factor.

569,127_5," Supplementary Bi-layered three-dimensional/low-dimensional (3D/LD) perovskite solar cell (PSC) architecture recently emerged as an extremely promising approach to resolve the compromise between photovoltaic performance and operational stability  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]  . The superincumbent LD capping layer plays a crucial role not only in surface passivation, but also heterojunction construction and environmental stress resistance  [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16]  . The most common LD capping materials are types of halogenometallate, such as the popular two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with the general formula of A 2 MX 4 (refs.  [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23]  ), where A is a bulky ammonium cation, M is a metal cation and X is a halide anion. The widely adopted manufacturing process for the LD capping layer is to deposit a bulky ammonium halide such as phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) on top of a 3D perovskite, followed by a cation exchange reaction  14, 16  , which is known as the half precursor (HP) methodology. The metal cation of the LD capping materials is restricted to Pb 2+ /Sn 2+ and is almost irreplaceable in the current methodology as they are derived from the underlying 3D perovskite. Hence, the most popular strategy in new LD capping materials design is to engineer bulky molecular Article  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01204-z  PEAI salt still partially remained on both 3D perovskites under the same post-treatment, although most of it transformed into PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7 (Fig.  1d, e ). The superior controllability of our FP technique for growth of the LD overlayer is further confirmed by the successful realization of a 2D (NMA) 2 PbI 4 (where NMA is 1-naphthylmethylammonium) capping layer with superior intrinsic stability  25  on a 3D perovskite (Supplementary Fig.  2 ), which is inaccessible via the traditional HP process due to the difficult reaction between the 1-naphthylmethylammonium iodide salt and the 3D perovskite  26  . Interestingly, we found that both PEA 2 ZnX 4 and PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7 phases were detected in the Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4 film (Fig.  1d ), but only PEA 2 ZnX 4 was present in the Cs 15 /PEA 2 ZnX 4 film (Fig.  1e ). It is also noted that halide exchange between I -in PEA 2 ZnX 4 and Cl -in either Rb 5 Cs 10 or Cs 15 perovskite always occurs, ultimately leading to a chloride-rich composition of PEA 2 ZnI 4-x Cl x (x ≥ 2) (Fig.  1d, e ), where the estimated values of x are presented in Supplementary Table  1 . Henceforth, we describe the zinc-based capping component using the simplified formula of PEA 2 ZnX 4 unless specified otherwise, where X is Cl -, I -or their mixture. To reveal the possible reaction pathways between PEA 2 ZnX 4 and Rb 5 Cs 10 perovskite, we investigated the RbCl/PEA 2 ZnX 4 stack film under similar conditions and discovered that Rb + partially exchanged with PEA + to generate PEAX salt (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). The exchanged Rb + is probably incorporated into the PEA 2 ZnX 4 structure to form (PEA 1-y Rb y ) 2 ZnX 4 , which is a reasonable deduction as the full-width at half-maximum value for the characteristic diffraction peak of PEA 2 ZnX 4 almost doubled (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), and considering that Rb 2 ZnX 4 has the same β-K 2 SO 4 -type crystal structure as PEA 2 ZnX 4 (refs.  24, 27  ). Hence we conclude that the PEA 2 ZnX 4 capping layer partially reacted with the Rb 5 Cs 10 perovskite to generate (PEA 1-y Rb y ) 2 ZnX 4 and PEA-2 FAPb 2 I 7 via the cation exchange between Rb + and PEA + . The possible reactions between the studied LD capping materials and the 3D perovskites are summarized in Supplementary Table  2 . We further determined the possible conversion ratio of PEA 2 ZnX 4 in the Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4 stack film by means of a rough quantitative XRD analysis (Supplementary Fig.  4  and Supplementary Table  3 ), in which the relative amount of phases present was estimated by using the integral intensity of the corresponding characteristic diffraction peak. Considering the identical preparation and measurement conditions, and similar chemical environments for both Rb   3 ). Meanwhile, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of both Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEAI and Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 PbI 4 films based on a relatively thin Rb 5 Cs 10 layer exhibit a clear and strong excitonic absorption peak at ~570 nm corresponding to PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7 , which is barely observed for the Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4 film (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). It can therefore be deduced that PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7 is a minor capping by-product in the Rb 5 Cs 10 /PEA 2 ZnX 4 film, although it is difficult to directly identify cations at the A-site  12, 13, 16  . Although an interesting solid-state in-plane growth method was recently demonstrated to have good controllability specifically for 2D BA 2 PbI 4 (where BA is butylammonium) on top of 3D perovskites  5  , the intrinsically weak solid-state interaction/reaction and high-pressure (60 MPa) requirements may limit its applicability to LD materials with metal cations that are distinct from the underlying 3D perovskite layer. Tailoring the metal cation of LD capping materials so far remains an open question. Expanding the library of LD capping materials with metal cations different from those in 3D perovskites opens up another exciting lever for engineering the energy levels and optoelectronic properties of the LD interface for high-efficiency 3D/LD PSCs. Herein we developed a full precursor (FP) solution methodology for LD capping layer deposition, where an FP solution containing both the metal halide and bulky ammonium halide-instead of the traditional HP solution containing only the bulky ammonium halide-is directly spin-coated on top of a 3D perovskite. Our approach enables easier synthetic control of the LD capping layer compared with the traditional HP process due to the co-existence of both ammonium halide and metal halide. This ensures that the metal cation reactant is no longer limited by the upward diffusion from the underlying 3D perovskite layer. Importantly, our approach allows unprecedented access to the vast library of metal cations beyond the widespread use of Pb 2+ /Sn 2+ for LD capping materials, thus affording fresh opportunities for optimizing the interface alignment and charge transfer properties for efficient PSCs. We discovered that the zero-dimensional (0D) zinc-based halogenometallate (PEA 2 ZnX 4 ; PEA = phenethylammonium, X = Cl/I) with a β-K 2 SO 4 -type single crystal structure  24  functions as a more effective surface capping material for 3D perovskites. By contrast to the lead-based counterpart, PEA 2 ZnX 4 can induce better surface passivation and stronger n-N isotype heterojunctions, which in turn results in substantial suppression of charge recombination and remarkable enhancement of the built-in potential (V bi ). Consequently, in combination with a traditional surface passivation molecule tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite (TPPi), we achieved one of the highest power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.1% for p-i-n-structured PSCs with negligible hysteresis; the corresponding certified PCE reached 23.25%. The target PSC also exhibited enhanced stability, retaining 94.5% of the initial PCE after 1,009 h of operation at the maximum power point (MPP) under an equivalent effective irradiance of 1 sun. Our findings pave the way forward to expand the toolkit of LD capping materials with metal cations different from those in 3D perovskites. Our study opens a valuable research avenue for engineering efficient 3D/LD PSCs. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""zinc-based halogenometallate"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""24.1"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.945""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""zinc-based halogenometallate"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1009"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""24.1"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.945""}}"

593,10_1,"Supplementary Note 1: Further discussion on the heterointerface energy band diagrams In Extended Data Fig.  3 , the perovskite bulk work function should also be affected by ΔEvac. This is because the less negative ΔEvac by replacing OAI treatment with OATsO treatment resultantly delocalizes the accumulated electrons in the potential well, which enhances the electron density and thus electron quasi-fermi level (𝐸 𝑓𝑛 ) work function of the perovskite bulk. Moreover, the change in bulk work function by surface treatment would also affect the band alignment and thus charge accumulation at the perovskite/SnO2 heterointerface. Indeed, a slightly increased hole accumulation was observed for the OATsO-treated device (Fig.  1h, i ). However, although the hole quasi-fermi level (𝐸 𝑓𝑝 ) for the OATsO-treated device slightly up-shifted, its increase is not as significant as 𝐸 𝑓𝑛 . The overall effect on the quasi-fermi level splitting is consistent with the slight VOC enhancement by replacing OAI treatment with OATsO treatment (Extended Data Fig.  5 ). ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TinOxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""octylammonium tosylate"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
595,10_4," Supplementary Note 5: Contrasting the device degradation under MPP aging versus OC aging In general, we observed that all devices were less stable under OC stability test, compared to their corresponding degradation rate under MPP stability test. This is consistent with previous reports that studied PSC degradation behavior under different aging conditions.  8  That previous study showed that PSC degradation rate increases in the trend MPP aging < short-circuit aging < OC aging (i.e. PSCs have the worst stability under OC aging). Therefore, the OC stability test can be used to represent a conservative estimate of the PSC lifetime under maximum accelerated degradation, although we note that MPP aging is more truly reflective of real working PSCs. Relatedly, a rapid ""burn-in"" decay stage is often observed during the first ~100 h of aging during PSC photostability tests.  [8] [9] [10] [11]  Importantly, the ""burn-in"" decay has been shown to be more severe for OC aging, and less severe for MPP aging.  8  This is also consistent with our own observations (Fig.  2f ). Although the ""burn-in"" decay is less noticeable under MPP stability tests, it nevertheless still exists, where the devices decayed at a more rapid rate in the first 100 h compared to the following ~400 h (Fig.  2f , Supplementary Table  4 ). Specifically, the OABF4-treated device performance decreased by -0.029 %/h in the first 100 h, compared to -0.014 %/h in the next 400 h. The OAI-treated device performance decreased by -0.064 %/h in the first 100 h, compared to -0.022 %/h for the next 400 h. Remarkably, the OATsO-treated devices displayed no obvious ""burn-in"" decay in both MPP aging and OC aging. General n-i-p devices are notoriously plagued by crippling initial ""burn-in"" decays,  8, 12  so this improvement was already noteworthy. Ligand-induced work function changes, ∆W, is given by the relation:  [13] [14] [15]   ∆W = 𝑒 𝜀 0 𝐴 Δ𝜇 = 𝑒 𝜀 0 𝐴 (𝜇 𝑑𝑖𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑒 + 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 ) where 𝑒 is the elementary charge, 𝜀 0 is the vacuum permittivity, A is the surface area, and Δ𝜇 = 𝜇 𝑑𝑖𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑒 + 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 . 𝜇 𝑑𝑖𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑒 and 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 are two independent contributions,  [13] [14] [15]  where respectively, 𝜇 𝑑𝑖𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑒 is the ligand intrinsic dipole moment normal to the surface, while 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 is related to a charge density displacement by interaction and bond formation of the ligand during chemisorption to the surface. The former is intensively reported in the perovskite community,  16  while the latter has been relatively less explored. 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 is the primary mechanism by which low polarity (or non-polar) species cause a ∆W. We first computed the respective dipole moments of various species in this work (Supplementary Fig.  15, 16 ). The negative ∆W (i.e. more n-type) with increasing alkylammonium chain length is correlated with their successively increasing positive dipole moments. On the other hand, while both [I] -and [Br] - are non-polar, the experimentally measured ∆W for the films treated with OAI or OABr were different (Fig.  1b ), hinting of a contribution from 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 . Additionally, the dipole moment of [TsO] -has an opposite sign but only half that of [OA] + , and thus the net dipole remains positive, which should have resulted in a negative ∆W, and thus cannot fully explain the experimental observations. Therefore, the contribution of 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 must be taken into consideration. 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 is related to the charge density differential, ∆𝜌, as a function of position (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧) by: 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 ≈ -𝑒 ∭ 𝑧∆𝜌 𝑑𝑥 𝑑𝑦 𝑑𝑧 The averaged charge density displacement as a function of 𝑧, ∆𝜌̅ (𝑧), and charge displacement, ∆𝑞(𝑧), in terms of ∆𝜌̅ (𝑧), is given by: ∆𝜌̅ (𝑧) = 1 𝐴 ∬ ∆𝜌 𝑑𝑥 𝑑𝑦 ∆𝑞(𝑧) = 𝐴∆𝜌̅ (𝑧)∆𝑧 where ∆𝜌 is calculated from: ∆𝜌 = 𝜌 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥 -𝜌 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 -𝜌 𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑎𝑛𝑑 Here, 𝜌 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥 , 𝜌 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 and 𝜌 𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑎𝑛𝑑 are the charge densities of the surface-ligand complex, freestanding surface, and free ligand, respectively. Subsequently, the charge displacement, 𝑞 ̅ , near the surface positioned at 𝑧 𝑠 is then calculated by: 𝑞 ̅ = 1 ∆𝑧 ∫ Δ𝑞(𝑧)𝑑𝑧 𝑧 𝑠 +Δz/2 𝑧 𝑠 -Δ𝑧/2 We computed the ∆𝑞(𝑧) with the different ligands to explore the 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 contribution (Fig.  4c-e ). Strikingly, [TsO] -induces a pronounced negative surface charge displacement, 𝑞 ̅, of -0.022 e, threefold larger in magnitude than the positive 𝑞 ̅ of [OA] + of +0.006 e. Calculations with varying ligand surface density corroborate the trends (Supplementary Fig.  18 ). We did further calculations by introducing iodine vacancy (VI) or lead-iodine antisite (PbI) defects to the surfaces of the slab models. Both defects have been reported to form readily on the perovskite surface.  17, 18  We present our results in Supplementary Fig.  17  and Supplementary       OA + BF 4 - V OC (V) J SC (mA cm -2 ) FF (%) PCE (%) V OC (V) J SC (mA cm -2 ) FF (%) PCE (%) V OC (V) J SC (mA cm -2 ) FF (%) PCE (%) ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TinOxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""OABF4"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TinOxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""OABF4"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
596,10_7," Consequences for charge-carrier dynamics Band alignments constructed from the UPS results predict that a negative ΔE vac may create a potential well to trap charges at the heterointerface (Extended Data Fig.  3  and Supplementary Note 1). Cross-sectional KPFM measurements under illumination in the open-circuit (OC) condition were followed to investigate the real-time charge-carrier distributions in complete devices of planar-architecture indium tin oxide (ITO)/ tin oxide (SnO 2 )/perovskite/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl) amino]-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD)/gold (Au) (Extended Data Fig.  4 , Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Figs.  3, 4 ). The measured device ΔE vac values at the perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD heterointerface are consistent with those obtained from the films (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). Charge carriers are unextractable in the OC condition (split quasi Fermi level), and might accumulate at a contacting selective heterointerface of the opposite polarity  8, 9  . This is observed as an accumulation of holes for both devices at the perovskite/SnO 2 heterointerface (Fig.  1h, i ). In contrast, a pronounced electron accumulation exists at the perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD heterointerface for only the OAI-treated device. The electron accumulation is noted to be significantly more severe than the counterpart hole accumulation. In principle, the ideal photovoltaic device would have a homogeneous electric-field distribution with no charge accumulation across its heterojunctions  10  , which is seen for the OATsO-treated device at its perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD heterointerface. Both devices were relatively field-free (that is, flat potential) along the active layer, indicative of a high-quality perovskite bulk, suggesting that the different behaviours were a consequence of the surface treatments. The results are consistent with those predicted based on the band diagrams (Extended Data Fig.  3 ), where the non-negative ΔE vac of the OATsO-treated device avoided the potential well and charge accumulation.  ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TinOxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""methylammonium"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TinOxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""octylammonium tosylate"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"

633,46_19," Device architecture Our work builds on recent advancements in the understanding and improvement of pin devices  11, 19, 22  . The chemical structures of PTAA, perovskite and C 60 as used in our standard cells with architecture [(indium tin oxide, ITO (150 nm)/PTAA (8 nm)/perovskite (400-500 nm)/C 60 (30 nm)/bathocuproine, BCP (8 nm)/Cu (100 nm)] are shown in Fig.  1a . For the active layer material, we chose the previously reported 'triple cation perovskite' mixture with the composition CsPbI 0.05 [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.89 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.11 ] 0.95 , as it delivers among the best photovoltaic performance. We note that though we focus on triple cation cells we have also generalized the results to methylammonium lead iodide MAPbI 3 and caesium formamidinium lead iodide (Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 )PbI 3 absorber layers, as discussed at the end of the manuscript. Figure  1b  displays a schematic energy level diagram based on the results from ultraviolet and inverse photoemission spectroscopy  15  , and proposes possible recombination mechanisms. One of the most important considerations for scaling the device area is the electrode architecture, due to the relatively high sheet resistance of the transparent conducting electrode (TCE)  8  . It is thus essential to minimize the distance carriers have to traverse through the comparatively high resistance electrode (that is, ITO versus copper). Figure  2a  shows the current-voltage characteristics of optimized 1 cm 2 cells with electrode widths of 8 mm and 4 mm, which demonstrate that the fill factor can be increased from 69% to 77.9% simply by reducing the width of the active area. This is also in agreement with numerical solutions of the Shockley equation for different electrode aspect ratios, as illustrated in Fig.  2b , which confirm a roughly 2% absolute efficiency gain through the fill factor (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). This approach is in principle scalable, as the rectangular cells can be connected using laser patterning  23  while the electrode width may be slightly increased using a lower-resistance ITO substrate (for instance, 10 Ω sq -1 ). ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""Lithium Fluoride"", ""humidity"": ""25"", ""temperature"": ""25"", ""time"": ""100"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""CsPbI 0.05 [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.89 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.11 ] 0.95"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""Lithium Fluoride"", ""humidity"": ""25"", ""temperature"": ""25"", ""time"": ""100"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
639,46_28," Conclusions Hyperspectral photoluminescence imaging allowed us to identify the origin of non-radiative recombination loss channels through mapping of the QFLS of the relevant perovskite/transport layer combinations. We found significant non-radiative recombination losses in the neat perovskite layer that reduce the potential V OC by approximately 135 mV compared to the radiative limit of this type of perovskite (1.345 V). However, interface recombination at each individual hybrid interface (PTAA/perovskite and perovskite/C 60 ) dominates the non-radiative loss current in the stack and results in a significant reduction of the QFLS down to ~1.13 eV. In line with this interpretation, we achieved a considerable improvement of the device performance by applying PFN-P2 and LiF as interfacial layers, which suppressed the recombination losses by 65 meV and 35 meV at the p-and n-interfaces, respectively. The reduced recombination and increased QFLS splitting resulted in significant V OC and fill factor gains, which in combination with an optimized composition of the perovskite layer led to a PCE above 20% for 1 cm 2 cells, with a certified PCE of 19.83% and stabilized power output. This work demonstrates how interfacial recombination losses can be unambiguously identified and suppressed, and paves the way to reach the thermodynamic limit for perovskite solar cells through further minimization of interface and trap-assisted recombination in the absorber layer. ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""CsPbI 0.05 [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.89 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.11 ] 0.95"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""1.143"", ""humidity"": ""25"", ""temperature"": ""25"", ""time"": ""100"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""19.6"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.16 V"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.6""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""CsPbI 0.05 [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.89 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.11 ] 0.95"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""Lithium Fluoride"", ""humidity"": ""25"", ""temperature"": ""25"", ""time"": ""100"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""19.6"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.16 V"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.6""}}"
656,136_4," Interfaces of MPA-CPA with perovskite films A triple-cation perovskite with a nominal composition of Cs 0.05 (FA 0.95 MA 0.05 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 , in which FA is formamidinium and MA is methylammonium, with a bandgap of 1.56 eV (fig.  S3 ), was then deposited on different HTLs of MPA-CPA, PTAA, and 2PACz, without any prewetting treatment. The superwetting capability of MPA-CPA led to highly uniform perovskite films that could be readily fabricated, in contrast to PTAA, with which attaining full coverage was quite difficult (movie S3). As shown in Fig.  1F  and fig. S4, all 10 perovskite films fabricated on MPA-CPA displayed full coverage (~100% production yield; table  S1 ), whereas on PTAA-and 2PACz-coated substrates, the yields were only ~50 and ~83%, respectively. The fabrication yield for the PTAA-based substrate could be improved with some prewetting treatments, such as DMF washing or hydrophilic interlayer coating  (26) . However, an intrinsic superwetting HTL without the need of prewetting treatments is more favorable for practical applications. We infer that the amphiphilic overlayer was partially dissolved into the perovskite solution, which facilitated the spreading of the solution, whereas the chemically anchored SAM layer was preserved as an ultrathin hole-extraction layer because it could not be dissolved by the perovskite solution (fig.  S5 ). Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurement indicated that the MPA-CPA was distributed across the entire perovskite bulk but with higher concentration near the buried interface (fig.  S6 ). Considering the large molecular size of MPA-CPA with respect to that of FA and MA, the embedded molecules should lie at the perovskite grain boundaries. The dissolved MPA-CPA also played an important role for the passivation of the perovskite, as discussed below. The absorption spectra of perovskite films deposited on different HTLs were almost identical (fig.  S7 ), but the films exhibited differences in their PL properties. Consistent with previous reports  (26) , perovskite films on PTAA exhibited a low PLQY (<1%) that we attributed to severe nonradiative recombination loss (Fig.  1G ). A much higher PLQY of 17% was reached for perovskite films on MPA-CPA, which is twice the value obtained on 2PACz. The dis-solution of unadsorbed MPA-CPA is necessary to reach such high PLQY values, as confirmed by fig.  S8 . We added 4-fluorophenethylammonium iodide (F-PEAI) to the antisolvent to process the perovskite film, which likely passivated the surface, the perovskite bulk, or both  (17, 27) . This PLQY value was higher than that on a glass substrate (~10%), further underlining the high quality of the MPA-CPA/perovskite interface. This PLQY would translate into a maximum potential PCE of ~27% if the recombination and transport loss at the electroselective contact can be eliminated (fig.  S9  and table  S2 ). Even after capping with the C 60 -based electron transport layer (ETL), the MPA-CPA-based samples could preserve a PLQY of ~5%, versus ~2% with 2PACz, which demonstrated the high optoelectronic quality of the overall stack. QFLS of perovskite on MPA-CPA before and after capping with C 60 are 1.24 and 1.20 eV, respectively (fig.  S10 ). The Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime of perovskite on MPA-CPA is around 7 ms, which is also much longer than those on PTAA and 2PACz (Fig.  1H  and fig.  S11 ). These results suggest that the deposited underlayer impacted the electronic quality of perovskite, and that nonradiative recombination could be suppressed by changing the nature of the underlying surface layer. Top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the microstructure of the perovskite deposited on different HTLs appears to be very similar (fig.  S12 ). To understand the huge difference of PL, we carefully characterized the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite near the bottom interface. We first peeled off the perovskite films with an epoxy encapsulant (4) and examined the morphology of the exposed bottom surface (Fig.  2A ). There were many nanovoids at the bottom surface of the perovskite grown on PTAA that likely formed because hydrophobicity led to insufficient wetting (Fig.  2 , B to D). There were fewer nanovoids when the perovskite was deposited on the 2PACz layer, but when the perovskite was deposited on the MPA-CPA substrate, a more compact and homogeneous morphology formed without observable voids. We further examined the bottom interfacial structure with cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) (fig.  S13 ), energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy mapping, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). PTAA formed a thin layer (~10 nm) between the perovskite and ITO and a morphologically defective contact was observed (Fig.  2 , F and G, and fig.  S14 ). These nanovoids not only hampered the extraction of photogenerated holes, but also triggered the degradation of perovskite film  (4, 17) . The perovskite deposited on MPA-CPA had very intimate contact with the ITO substrate, and we could not distinguish a clear HTL (Fig.  2 , H to J, and fig.  S15 ), which confirmed the ultrathin character of the SAM. This nanovoid-free, tight, and intimate contact between the perovskite and the SAMcoated ITO substrate correlates well with the suppressed recombination observed above with the electro-optical measurements. To gain further understanding of the influence of the substrate on the crystallization of perovskite, we performed depth-resolved grazingincidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements on the peeled-off perovskite films (fig.  S16 ). Fig.  S17  displays the azimuthal intensity profiles of the (100) reflection of perovskite layers deposited on different HTLs with incident angles of 0.2°, 0.4°, and 1.0°, respectively. However, the diffraction intensity showed a similar distribution for different substrates and different incident angles, which indicated a random crystallite orientation of the perovskite deposited on the different substrates in the bulk and surface. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""2-(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-1-cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.4"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.21"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Cs0.05(FA0.95MA0.05)0.95Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""2,2'-(9,6-diyl)bis(4-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-phenyl)amine,9-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-3"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.4"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.21"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
657,136_6," Photovoltaic performance To study the photovoltaic performance of different HTLs, we first fabricated small-area inverted PSCs (~0.1 cm 2 ) with a configuration of ITO/HTL/perovskite/C 60 /BCP/Ag. The concentration of MPA-CPA was optimized to be 1.0 mg/ml (in ethanol) to obtain the best performance (fig.  S22 ). Further fabrication details can be found in the supplementary materials. The current density-voltage (J-V) curves of champion devices based on different HTLs are shown in Fig.  4A , and the average performance parameters are discussed further below. The PTAA-based device showed a PCE of 22.6% with a moderate V OC of 1.13 V and a FF of 81.7% (Table  1 ). The 2PACz-based devices achieved a higher PCE of up to 23.4% that was mainly the result of the increased V OC of 1.17 V. However, the champion device of MPA-CPA exhibited a PCE of 25.2% with a V OC up to 1.20 eV (for a bandgap of 1.56 eV), a FF of up to 84.5%, and a shortcircuit current density (J SC ) of 24.8 mA cm -2 . This device had negligible hysteresis between the forward and the reverse J-V scan at a scan speed of 10 mV s -1 (fig.  S23 ). After setting up a reasonable model in SCAPS simulations  (35) , we can well reproduce the J-V curves as well as the PLQY values (fig.  S24 ). The stabilized power output measured near the maximum power point (MPP) with an applied voltage of 1.07 V resulted in a stabilized PCE of 24.7% without decay in 300 s (fig.  S25 ). Fig.  S26  shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of MPA-CPA based champion device, and the integrated current density of 24.3 mA cm -2 agreed well with the value from J-V measurement and was consistent for the perovskite with an optical band gap of 1.56 eV. We sent one of the MPA-CPA-based devices to an independent laboratory (Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, SIMIT, Shanghai, China) for certification, where a PCE of 25.4% (with V OC =1.21 V, FF = 84.7%, and J SC = 24.8 mA cm -2 ) was confirmed (fig.  S27 ). This value is among the highest reported PCEs for inverted PSCs (table  S4 ). Figure  4B , S28 and Table  S5  summarizes the statistical distribution of PCEs and related parameter values for PSCs based on different HTLs. The average PCEs were gradually enhanced from PTAA (21.6%) to 2PACz (23.1%) to MPA-CPA (24.6%), with the main contribution stemming from the simultaneous improvement   S5 ), which can be related to the highly reproducible fabrication of perovskites films arising from the superwetting properties of the HTL. For MPA-CPA-based devices, the highest V OC exceeds 1.21 V and the highest FF exceeds 85%. Compared with other reported high-performance inverted PSCs, our devices achieved the highest V OC -FF product (Fig.  4C ), which reflects the low nonradiative recombination and the low resistive losses in the MPA-CPA-based devices. We achieved the high-performance PSCs by using alcohol solvents for the amphiphilic MPA-CPA HTL (Fig.  4D , fig.  S30 , and table  S6 ). The universal effectiveness of MPA-CPA was further verified in other perovskite compositions such as a wide-bandgap (1.68 eV) triple cation relevant for tandem applications and a CsFA doublecation perovskite (fig.  S31  and table  S7 ). The amphiphilic hole transport bottom layer favors wetting and spreading of perovskite )    precursor solutions and enabled fabrication of 1 cm 2 PSCs (fig.  S32 ). The champion device had a PCE of 23.4% with a V OC of 1.19 eV, a FF of 80.9%, and a J SC of 24.27 mA cm -2 (Fig.  4E ). Additionally, we successfully fabricated a PSC minimodule with an active area of around 10 cm 2 and tested its J-V characteristics (Fig.  4F ). The PCE of the minimodule with 4 subcells reached 22.0%, with a J SC of 6.11 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 4.68 V, and a FF of 76.9%. The stability of solar modules based on different HTLs was evaluated under acceleratedaging conditions according to the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols  (36) . Under continuous air mass 1.5 G 100 mW cm -2 illumination in ambient air in 30 to 40% relative humidity (RH) at ~45°C (ISOS-L-1, light only), the PCEs of all modules were almost unchanged within 500 hours of continuous operation (Fig.  4G ), and the MPA-CPAbased module retained >90% of its initial PCE after 2000 hours (fig.  S33 ). In addition to the operational stability, we conducted the damp heat stability test following the IEC61215:2016 standard (Fig.  4H ). The MPA-CPA-based modules retained >95% of their initial performance for 500 hours under the damp heat test (85°C and 85% RH).

744,69_2,"Despite the notable success of hybrid halide perovskite-based solar cells, their long-term stability is still a key-issue. Aside from optimizing the photoactive perovskite, the cell design states a powerful lever to improve stability under various stress conditions. Dedicated electrically conductive diffusion barriers inside the cell stack, that counteract the ingress of moisture and prevent the migration of corrosive halogen species, can substantially improve ambient and thermal stability. Although atomic layer deposition (ALD) is excellently suited to prepare such functional layers, ALD suffers from the requirement of vacuum and only allows for a very limited throughput. Here, we demonstrate for the first time spatial ALD-grown SnO x at atmospheric pressure as impermeable electron extraction layers for perovskite solar cells. We achieve optical transmittance and electrical conductivity similar to those in SnO x grown by conventional vacuum-based ALD. A low deposition temperature of 80 °C and a high substrate speed of 2.4 m min -1 yield SnO x layers with a low water vapor transmission rate of ∼10 -4 gm -2 day -1 (at 60 °C/60% RH). Thereby, in perovskite solar cells, dense hybrid Al:ZnO/SnO x electron extraction layers are created that are the key for stable cell characteristics beyond 1000 h in ambient air and over 3000 h at 60 °C.

773,107_3,"The ORCID identification number(s) for the author(s) of this article can be found under  https://doi.org/10.1002/solr.202000069 . DOI: 10.1002/solr.202000069 Bulky organic ammonium cations have been widely used to stabilize lead halide perovskites via surface passivation or dimensionality modulation. Herein, a sulfonyl fluoride-functionalized phenethylammonium salt (SF-PEA) is reported as a bifunctional additive to stabilize the formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) perovskite. The sulfonyl group is found to interact with PbI 2 in the precursor and slow down the crystallization of FAPbI 3 during thermal annealing, leading to improved crystalline quality and decreased structural defects. After annealing, the spontaneous assembly of SF-PEA on the crystal surface of FAPbI 3 not only passivates the surface defects, but also protects the perovskite from phase transition that is caused by strain or moisture invasion. The resulting FAPbI 3 films are extremely stable, which can maintain their black phase for more than 3 months in air with 40-50% relative humidity, much better than pristine and unsubstituted phenethylammonium (PEA)-based samples. Because of the greatly improved phase stability and crystallization quality, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.25% (certified PCE of 20.70%) is achieved in planar n-i-p structured solar cells, which is the highest one among ""methylammoniumfree"" FAPbI 3 perovskite photovoltaics. Previous literatures mainly focused on the surface effect caused by the bulky cations, whereas their impacts on the crystallization dynamics are largely omitted, especially for the additive route in which the whole crystallization process is associated with the additives.  [21]  As well known, the intermolecular interactions in the perovskite precursor solution play a crucial role on the crystallization dynamics.  [22, 23]  Considering that the active sites on PEA cation are limited, we proposed to introduce additional functional groups onto its phenyl unit for enhancing the intermolecular interactions as well as the perovskite crystallization. Herein, we report a successful example of sulfonyl fluoride-functionalized phenethylammonium salt (SF-PEA) that features with a sulfonyl fluoride group on the para-position of the PEA (chemical structures shown in Figure  1a ) for fabricating and stabilizing high-quality FAPbI 3 perovskite thin films. The sulfonyl group is found to interact with PbI 2 in precursor and slow down the crystallization of FAPbI 3 during thermal annealing, leading to an improved crystalline quality and decreased structural defects. Combining with the surface passivation and protection effects, we achieved extremely stable FAPbI 3 films that can maintain their back phase for more than 3 months in air with relative humidity (RH) of 40 AE 5% without encapsulation, much better than pristine and PEA-based samples. In planar n-i-p structured solar cells, we achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.25% (certified PCE of 20.70%), which is the highest one among ""MA-free"" FAPbI 3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The unencapsulated device retains 91% of its initial PCE after 1000 h with a humidity of 50-60%. Compared with Cs þ -and MA-based lead halide perovskites, the FAPbI 3 shows more optimal bandgap and broader absorption spectra, thus possessing a higher efficiency maxima under standard solar spectrum.  [24] [25] [26]  However, it suffers from a poor ambient stability because its nonperovskite δ-phase is thermodynamically more favorable than the black α-phase at room temperature.  [27]  Mixed cations and anions strategy that incorporates MA, Cs þ , and Br À is often used to stabilize the black α-phase of FAPbI 3 , but these additives can widen its bandgap and decrease the thermal stability. Herein, we use bulky cation strategies to fabricate and stabilize FAPbI 3 perovskite for retaining its inherent low bandgap merits. The FAPbI 3 perovskite films are first prepared on glass substrate using a solvent-engineered one-step spin-coating procedure, with detailed fabricating parameters described in the Experimental Section. The bulky cation halide salts of SF-PEA or PEA are added into the precursor solution with a molar ratio of 1.0% to that of FAPbI 3 . The FAPbI 3 film fabricated without using any additive is denoted as ""pristine,"" and the ones with addition of PEA or SF-PEA are denoted as ""w/PEA"" and ""w/SF-PEA,"" respectively. After spin coating, the three types of precursor films are all transparent without significant difference in color (Figure  1b ). However, their crystallization velocities are quite different when they were annealed at 150 C on a hotplate. The pristine and w/PEA samples were found to turn into a black phase quickly after heating for about 40 s, with complete color conversion within 60 s, indicating a fast crystallization of the α-phase FAPbI 3 . In contrast, the color conversion of w/SF-PEA sample is much slower. The transparent appearance was retained during the first 60 s, and another 60 s is required to finish the color conversion from yellow to black, as shown in Figure  1b . These results suggest that the incorporation of SF-PEA as an additive into the precursor of FAPbI 3 can distinctly decrease the crystallization velocity. Considering the structural difference between PEA and SF-PEA, we attribute the retarded crystallization in w/SF-PEA sample in the presence of additional sulfonyl fluoride group. The oxygen atoms in the sulfonyl group contains totally four groups of lone pair electrons (Figure  1a ), representing a strong Lewis base that may form adduct with the Lewis acid of PbI 2 in the precursor solution and modulate the crystallization dynamics. To verify such intermolecular interactions, we prepared a PbI 2 /SF-PEA complexes (for method, see Supporting Information) and used Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to compare the complexes with pure SF-PEA. The complete FTIR spectra are shown in Figure  S1 , Supporting Information, and Figure  1c  shows an enlarged segment that are closely related to the vibration of the sulfonyl group. The strong peaks appeared at 1209 and 1400 cm À1 for the pure SF-PEA corresponds to the stretching vibrations of S═O bonds.  [28]  Upon complexing with PbI 2 , these two characteristic peaks were shifted to 1216 and 1404 cm À1 , respectively. This indicates that the SF-PEA likely formed an adduct with PbI 2 via the interaction between Pb 2þ and the S═O bonds, which increases the activation energy of nucleation, and then retards the perovskite crystal growth.  [29, 30]  According to classic crystallization theory, a low crystallization velocity will be beneficial to the growth of large-size crystals with high crystalline quality.  [30, 31]  As the incorporation of bulky cation of SF-PEA significantly decreases the annealing-induced crystallization velocity of FAPbI 3 , we therefore investigate the surface morphology of the three types of perovskite thin films by comparing their top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. As shown in Figure  2a , all of the three samples show typical polycrystalline character of lead halide perovskite, with grain size in the range of tens to hundreds of nanometers. The average grain size for the pristine, w/PEA, and w/SF-PEA samples are calculated to be 315.3, 443.6, and 704.1 nm, respectively, suggesting that the introduction of bulky cations is indeed capable of increasing the grain size. The increase in average grain size means reduced grain boundaries, which is beneficial to the optoelectronic qualities of the polycrystalline semiconductor materials. We note that the perovskite film with SF-PEA exhibited smooth surface morphology, as demonstrated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Figure  S2 , Supporting Information), although it consists of larger-sized grains. The smooth and uniform thin-film morphology is advantageous to the subsequent deposition of a thinner hole-transporting layer with full coverage for achieving low transporting resistance as well as low current leakage. To further evaluate the crystalline quality, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on the three types of perovskite samples, with results shown in Figure  2b . It can be found that their XRD patterns are very similar, all showing the characteristic diffraction peaks of 3D perovskite without any signal of 2D species.  [32]  The pristine sample showed a weak peak at 11.8 that corresponds to the nonperovskite δ-phase, which was almost disappeared in the w/PEA and w/SF-PEA samples, suggesting that such small amount of bulky cations (1.0 mol%) can effectively suppress the formation of the unfavorable δ-phase FAPbI 3 . The intensity of diffraction peaks corresponding to the α-phase FAPbI 3 (typical 2θ of 14.0 , 28.0 , 31.5 , 40.2 , and 42.7 ) was gradually enhanced in the order of pristine < w/PEA < w/SF-PEA. The full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) values of the peak at 2θ of 14.0 for the three samples were calculated to be 0.64 , 0.60 , and 0.49 . The decrease in the FWHM value clearly indicates improved crystallinity, which is consistent with SEM observations. Figure  2c  shows the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the samples. The three samples showed typical absorption of α-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite with an optical bandgap (E g ) of around 1.49 eV. Their absorption onset as well as normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra are almost overlapped (Figure  S3 , Supporting Information), indicating that the E g was maintained upon the addition of bulky cations. Previous work showed that the incorporation of over 5 mol% bulky cations can lead to the formation of 2D/3D heterostructures and an increase in E g .  [33]  Here, the unchanged E g can attribute to the trace amounts of bulky cations, only 1.0 mol%, which is more likely to play the role of surface functionalization, rather than to form 2D/3D heterostructures. This is particularly important as the inherent E g feature of FAPbI 3 can be utilized, unlike traditional mixed cations strategy of incorporating MA, Cs þ , and Br À , which significantly enlarge the E g to values around 1.6 eV. It can be found that the bulky cations involved samples showed steeper and higher absorbance than the pristine near their band edge, suggesting a decrease in sub-bandgap states for the w/PEA and w/SF-PEA perovskites. The enhanced absorption is probably due to an improved perovskite phase purity, with additional contribution from light scattering due to the improved grain size. We further use time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectroscopy to estimate the optoelectronic quality of the perovskite films.  [34]  As shown in Figure  2d  and Table  S1 , Supporting Information, the TRPL profiles of the three samples can be fitted to a twocomponent exponential decay model. Compared with the pristine sample, the average lifetime was significantly prolonged from 250.9 to 657.9 ns and 1208.0 ns for the PEA-and SF-PEAassisted FAPbI 3 films, respectively. Generally, an extension of TRPL lifetime suggests the removal of nonradiative decay pathways to some extents, and thus an improvement of the optoelectronic quality of perovskite semiconductors. Apparently, the high optoelectronic quality of SF-PEA-based perovskite films could be attributed to the enhanced phase purity and crystallinity, which decreased the charge traps in the perovskite films as will be discussed later. Under ambient conditions, the α-phase of FAPbI 3 is subject to undergo undesirable transition to form photoinactive δ-phase, which is a critical challenge for the application of FAPbI 3 in optoelectronic devices. During our preliminary stability evaluations, we found that the incorporation of bulky organic cations can effectively improve the ambient stability of the FAPbI 3 perovskite. As shown in Figure  3a , the black pristine FAPbI 3 film decomposes quickly, and it was completely bleached within 1 week when maintained in ambient with RH of 40 AE 5% and temperature at 20 AE 5 C. The formed colorless product was proven to be δ-phase FAPbI 3 (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information). Under the same conditions, such phase transition from black to colorless was greatly retarded in the w/PEA and w/SF-PEA samples. Notably, the new bulky cation of SF-PEAbased FAPbI 3 films can maintain its black appearance for at least 2 months. The UV-vis absorption spectra were used to quantitatively record the variation of α-phase FAPbI 3 during the ambient storage (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information). Figure  3b  shows the evolution of absorbance at 600 nm (normalized to the initial value of the w/SF-PEA sample) for the three samples. The w/SF-PEA sample shows constant absorbance near their band edge, suggesting negligible phase transition during such long ambient storage duration. As far as we know, this is the best shelf lifetime for MA-, Cs-, or Br-free FAPbI 3 perovskites to date. Previous studies have proven that the PEA-based bulky cations can spontaneously assemble to the grain surface of 3D perovskites during the crystallization process.  [12]  As shown in Figure  3c , such surface functionalization can not only passivate the surface defects, but also decrease the surface energy and improve hydrophobicity (Figure  S6 , Supporting Information), thus protecting the perovskite from phase transition caused by strain or moisture invasion. Although such bulky organic cations are capable of forming low-dimensional perovskite, we have not observed any related information in the XRD measurement, which might be attributed to the very small amount (only 1% molar ratio) of bulky cation additives in the perovskite precursor solution. Therefore, we mainly attribute the enhanced phase stability of black FAPbI 3 to the passivation and surface energy engineering. Compared with the perovskite films with PEA, the SF-PEA seems to be more efficient in enhancing the phase stability of FAPbI 3 . Therefore, there might be additional contributions arising from the SF-PEA bulky cations, most probably related to the sulfonyl group decorated on the phenyl of SF-PEA. Previous studies have revealed that the ammonium and aromatic groups in PEA can heal negative charged and neutral iodine related defects, respectively.  [17]  The Lewis basefeatured sulfonyl group provides extra passivation effect to positive-charged defects, such as undercoordinated Pb 2þ at the surface of 3D FAPbI 3 perovskites. This can be partially reflected by the extended PL lifetime for the SF-PEA base FAPbI 3 perovskite film. The more comprehensive passivation achieved by the SF-PEA salt will not only eliminate more charge defects, but also lead to a larger extent of decrease in surface energy, thus greatly stabilizes the pervoskite phase of FAPbI 3 . The high crystalline quality of the SF-PEA involved FAPbI 3 films may further improve the phase stability as internal structure defects that can induce phase transition are decreased. High-quality film means a low trap density. We evaluate the trap density of different perovskite films using the space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement on electron-only devices, which have the architecture of fluorine-doped tin dioxide (FTO)/TiO 2 /perovskite/PCBM/Ag. As shown in Figure  3d , the devices show ohmic response (linear relation) at low bias and a marked increase in the current injection at the intermediate region as the traps are continuously fielded with increasing bias until reaching the trap-filling limit voltage (V TFL ). The trap density is calculated based on the following equation  [35]   n trap ¼ 2ε 0 ε r V TFL eL 2 (1) where ε r is the relative dielectric constant of perovskite, ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, e is the electron charge, and L is the thickness of perovskite film. The calculated trap density of the pristine, w/PEA, and w/SF-PEA FAPbI 3 films are 5.36 Â 10 15 , 3.65 Â 10 15 , and 3.08 Â 10 15 cm À3 , respectively. These results directly prove that the bulky cation-based additives can decrease the trap density, thus improving the electronic quality as well as structural stability of the FAPbI 3 perovskite films. To further study the photovoltaic performance of different FAPbI 3 samples, PSCs with a planar n-i-p configuration of FTO glass/SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au were fabricated (Figure  4a ). Detailed fabrication process was described in the Experimental Section. The typical current density-voltage ( J-V ) characteristics for the champion PSCs based on pristine, w/PEA, and w/SF-PEA FAPbI 3 perovskite films are shown in Figure  4b , and the corresponding device parameters are shown in Table  1 . The pristine FAPbI 3 -based devices show a best PEC of 15.32%, with short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 22.49 mA cm À2 , opencircuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.051 V, and fill factor (FF) of 64.77%. These results are in line with previous literatures.  [12]  The incorporation of bulky cation additives of PEA and SF-PEA remarkably improves all of the photovoltaic parameters, achieving champion PCE of 18.39% and 21.25%, respectively. Moreover, the J-V scanning hysteresis is also decreased for the additive-based devices (Figure  S7 , Supporting Information). The improved performance of the SF/PEA sample-based devices was mainly attributed to the higher V OC and FF values. As the electron-and hole-transporting materials are same, the enhanced V OC should be attributed to decreased carrier recombination in perovskites with high crystallization quality. The w/PEA-and w/SF-PEAbased devices showed gradually decreased series resistance (R s ) and enhanced shunt resistance (R sh , Table  1 ), thus resulting in gradually improved FF performance. The bulky cation-based FAPbI 3 perovskite additives show larger crystal size, less grain boundary, and lower charge trap density, which facilitate charge transporting and suppress carrier recombination. Moreover, the uniform thin-film morphology with smooth surface helps to deposit thin and full-coverage hole-transporting layer, further benefiting the FF performance. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices are shown in Figure  4c . It can be found that the threshold of the spectral response reaches 850 nm, which matched well with the absorption character of FAPbI 3 perovskite. The integrated current density values from EQE spectra are also in good agreement with the J sc obtained from J-V measurement. The improved photocurrent of the w/SF-PEA sample-based device was primarily due to the elevated light-harvesting efficiency and enhanced charge transportation, which was closely related to the larger crystal size and higher phase purity of the perovskite film. Figure  4d  shows the stable photocurrent density measured near the maximum power point, and the calculated stable power output are in good agreement with the J-V scanning curves. The histograms of efficiency statistics for three batches of devices fabricated with optimized conditions are shown in Figure  4e . The performance of these devices were highly reproducible, showing average PCE of 13.11%, 16.8%, and 20.32% for devices based on pristine, w/PEA, and w/SF-PEA FAPbI 3 samples, respectively. One of the optimized devices based on w/SF-PEA FAPbI 3 was measured in an independent laboratory, which showed a certified stabilized PCE of 20.70% (Figure  S8 , Supporting Information). As far as we know, this is the highest PCEs for ""methylammonium-free"" FAPbI 3 PSCs to date. Finally, we estimated the stability of PSCs devices based on pristine, w/PEA, and w/SF-PEA FAPbI 3 perovskite films. The unencapsulated devices were stored under ambient exposure with a RH of 50-60% at room temperature, and their J-V curves were measured at different intervals. As shown in Figure  4f , the PCEs of devices based on pristine and w/PEA FAPbI 3 samples sharply decreased to below 50% at 70 and 400 h. In contrast, the PCEs of device based on w/SF-PEA sample exhibited remarkable stability, retaining 91% of their original PCEs after 1000 h. Such a good environmental stability should be attributed to the enhanced stability of the active perovskite layer. The more than 21% efficiency as well as excellent environmental stability achieved by our strategy made great progress for future commercialization of efficient and stable PSCs. In summary, we have demonstrated an efficient strategy for fabricating FAPbI 3 perovskite films with high optoelectronic quality and phase stability via incorporating functionalized bulky organic cations as crystallization modulator. The sulfonyl group in SF-PEA interacts with the PbI 2 in precursor to decrease the crystallization velocity and improves the crystalline quality. Moreover, the assembly of SF-PEA on the surface of FAPbI 3 significantly improves its stability in the black perovskite phase via surface passivation and moisture blocking. With the multifunctional additive of SF-PEA, the FAPbI 3 perovskite films show extremely high air stability and optoelectronic properties. Consequently, we achieved a champion PCE of 21.25% (certified stabilized PCE of 20.70%), which is to date the best performance among ""methylammonium-free"" FAPbI 3 -based PSCs. When stored in air with a humidity of 50-60%, the unencapsulated device can retain 91% of its initial PCE after 1000 h. This work suggests that chemical tailoring of bulky organic cations is a promising way to further improve the stability and performance of hybrid perovskite materials. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""formamidinium lead iodide"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""50-60"", ""temperature"": ""25"", ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": ""15.32"", ""treated_pce"": ""21.25"", ""control_voc"": ""1.051"", ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.91""}}"

784,78_2,"The band gap of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskites allows broader absorption of the solar spectrum compared to conventional methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3). The optoelectronic properties of perovskite films are closely related to the film-quality, so depositing dense and uniform films is crucial for fabricating high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We report an approach for depositing high-quality FAPbI3 films, involving FAPbI3 crystallization by the direct intramolecular exchange of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) molecules intercalated in PbI2 with formamidinium iodide. This process produces FAPbI3 films with (111)preferred crystallographic orientation, large-grained dense microstructures, and flat surfaces without residual PbI2. Using films prepared by this technique, FAPbI3-based PSCs with maximum power conversion efficiency of over 20% were fabricated.","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""formamidinium lead iodide"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}"
785,78_3,"The tremendous improvements in device architecture (1-3), high-quality film formation methodologies  (4) (5) (6) , and compositional engineering of perovskite materials (7-9) over the last 3 years have led to rapid improvements in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Although solar-to-electric PCE of up to 18% has been reported for PSCs  (10) , developing technologies further to achieve PCEs near theoretical values continues to be among the most important challenges in the solar cell industry to achieve economic feasibility. Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) is a perovskite material that can potentially provide better performance than methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) because of its broad absorption of the solar spectrum. In addition, FAPbI3 with the n-i-p architecture (the n-side is illuminated with solar radiation) exhibits negligible hysteresis with sweep direction during current-voltage measurements  (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . However, compared to MAPbI3, it is more difficult to form stable perovskite phases and high-quality films of FAPbI3. Various methodologies such as sequential deposition (4), solventengineering  (5) , vapor-assisted deposition  (14) , additiveassisted deposition  (15, 16) , and vacuum evaporation  (6)  can now produce high-quality films of MAPbI3 with flat surfaces and complete surface coverage by controlling its rapid crystallization behavior and have led to substantial improve-ments in the PCE of MAPbI3based PSCs. Among these methodologies, two-step sequential deposition and solvent-engineering are representative wet processes that can yield perovskite films for high-performance PSCs. In the sequential deposition process, a thin layer of PbI2 is deposited on the substrate. methylammonium iodide (MAI) or formamidinium iodide (FAI) is then applied to the pre-deposited PbI2 to enable conversion to the perovskite phase. This process involves crystal nucleation and growth of the perovskite phase because of solution-phase or solid-state reaction between PbI2 and an organic iodide such as MAI or FAI  (4, 13, 17) . However, the sequential reaction of organic iodides with PbI2 that occurs from the surface to the inner crystalline regions of PbI2 has been ineffective in producing highperformance perovskite films that are > 500 nm in thickness because of incomplete conversion of PbI2, peeling-off of the perovskite film in solution, and uncontrolled surface roughness. In contrast, the solvent-engineering process utilizes the formation of intermediate phases to retard the rapid reaction between PbI2 and organic iodide in the solution. While this process has been successfully used to form dense and uniform MAPbI3 layers, it has not been explored for FAPbI3  (5) . To deposit a uniform and dense FAPbI3 layer, Snaith et al. added a small amount of aqueous HI to a solution mixture containing PbI2, FAI, and dimethylformamide (DMF)  (11) . Very recently, Zhao et al. reported the deposition of highly uniform and fully covered FAPbI3 films using FAI and HPbI3, which is formed by the reaction of PbI2 and HI in DMF  (18) . The HI in the PbI2 layers retards the rapid reaction between FAI and PbI2. In addition, the release of HI from PbI2 at high temperatures allows the formation of a FAPbI3 layer by solid-state reaction with the neighboring FAI molecules. Stated differently, this process can be regarded as the transformation of PbI2-HI-FAI into FAPbI3, similar to the formation of MAPbI3 via the PbI2dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-MAI phase in the solventengineering process  (5) . However, we observed that the solvent-engineering process, which is effective for depositing dense and uniform MAPbI3 layers, yields FAPbI3 layers with pin-holes and a rough surface. Although the FAPbI3 film-quality including coverage and uniformity on the substrate have been improved, the performance of FAPbI3-solar cells still lag behind those of MAPbI3-based PSC  (8) , implying that more sophisticated deposition techniques are necessary for fabricating high-quality, thick FAPbI3 films (> 500 nm), for achieving sufficient absorption up to a wavelength of 840 nm. As expected from the conversion of PbI2-DMSO-MAI to MAPbI3  (5) , the DMSO molecules intercalated in PbI2 can be easily replaced by external FAIs because of its higher affinity toward PbI2 compared to DMSO; the FAI molecules experience ionic interactions, whereas DMSO participates in van der Waals interactions  (5, 19) . Highly uniform and dense pre-deposited PbI2-(DMSO) layers could be directly converted to FAPbI3 because the inorganic PbI2 framework would be retained. FAPbI3 crystallization by the intramolecular exchange process (IEP) of DMSO intercalated in PbI2 with FAI was schematically shown in Fig.  1A . The intramolecular exchange between DMSO and FAI can be described as PbI2-DMSO + FAI → PbI2-FAI + DMSO ↑ (removal)  (1)  and does not induce volume expansion, unlike the FAP-bI3 formed with FAI intercalating into pristine PbI2 (discussed below) because the molecular sizes of DMSO and FAI are similar. In this work, we report on the synthesis of a PbI2-(DMSO) precursor with excellent capabilities for molecular exchange with FAI at low temperatures during the spinning process, as well as the fabrication of highly efficient FAPbI3based PSCs with certified PCEs exceeding 20%. To synthesize the PbI2-(DMSO) precursors, precipitates were obtained by pouring toluene as a non-solvent into 1.0 M PbI2 solution dissolved in DMSO. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the resulting complex (Fig.  1Ba ) matched that of the PbI2(DMSO)2 phase  (5, 19) . The as-prepared PbI2(DMSO)2 was then annealed at 60°C for 24 hours in vacuum to obtain PbI2(DMSO) by removal of 1 mol DMSO. The XRD pattern of the vacuum-annealed powder (Fig.  1Bb ) did not match that of PbI2(DMSO)2, implying that the PbI2(DMSO)2 transformed into a different phase by releasing some DMSO molecules. The content of DMSO in the as-annealed powder was estimated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA was suitable for this purpose because the only volatile species in the powder was DMSO. The TGA results of the PbI2(DMSO)2 and PbI2(DMSO) complexes are shown in Fig.  1C . The PbI2(DMSO)2 complex exhibited a two-step decomposition process with weight-loss of 12.6% at each step, whereas the vacuum-annealed PbI2(DMSO) complex showed a singlestep decomposition. The decomposition of both the complexes was completed at the same temperature (138. 6°C). The powders obtained by vacuum-annealing PbI2(DMSO)2 complex at 60°C can be regarded as one of the most thermodynamically stable forms among the various crystalline PbI2-(DMSO)-based complexes, which are similar with PbBr2(DMSO) and PbCl2(DMSO)  (20) . The DMSO content of the vacuum-annealed PbI2(DMSO) complex was also checked by elemental analysis (EA), which yielded H = 1.0% (1.1%); and C = 4.1% (4.4%), where the values expressed in parenthesis indicate the theoretical mass percent for a given element for C2H6SOPbI2. To fabricate FAPbI3-based PSCs through IEP between DMSO and FAI (MABr) using pre-deposited PbI2-DMSO layers and a FAI (MABr) solution, we first confirmed that the PbI2(DMSO) phase was retained even after spin-coating with the PbI2(DMSO) precursor dissolved in DMF. The XRD pattern for film coated on a fused silica substrate was compared with that of the initial precursor. As seen in Fig.  1Bc , the XRD pattern for the as-coated film was in consistent with that of the PbI2(DMSO) complex powder, although its crystallinity is lowered. The as-coated PbI2(DMSO) film also had a flat and dense surface, as shown in the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image in fig.  S1    (21) . Next, we investigated the formation of mixed FAP-bI3/MAPbBr3 by IEP. We recently reported that the coexistence of MA/FA/I/Br in the PbI2 skeleton improved the phase-stability of FAPbI3  (10) . The formation of mixed FAP-bI3/MAPbBr3 layers via IEP was controlled by coating solution mixture with different mole ratios of MABr to FAI dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (IPA), on the pre-deposited PbI2(DMSO) layers (discussed below). It is evident from Fig.  1Da  that well-crystallized FAPbI3-based films were formed by IEP. The XRD pattern for the FAPbI3 film derived from the PbI2(DMSO) complex film exhibits dominant (-111) and (-222) diffraction peaks at 13.9° and 28.1°, respectively, corresponding to the FAPbI3 trigonal perovskite phase (P3m1), in contrast with the XRD patterns of the FAPbI3 powder (Fig.  1Db )  (13) . The intensity ratio of (-123) peak at 31.5 ° to the (-222) peak at 28.1° was 0.05. This value was much smaller than the corresponding intensity ratios (= 0.8) for the FAPbI3 power. Thus, IEP leads to high-quality pure FAPbI3-based films with preferred orientation along the [111] axis. Fig. S2  (21)  presents the current density-voltage (J-V) curves measured under standard air-mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) illumination, and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the fabricated cells with FAPbI3-based layers fabricated with various amounts of MABr (0 to 20 mol%). The onset wavelength in the EQE spectra near 830 nm showed a non-linear blue shift with increasing amounts of MABr, indicating that there is unsymmetrical competition between FAI and MABr in forming the FAPbI3-MAPbBr3 perovskite phase through an intramolecular exchange reaction. Nevertheless, the highest PCE of 19.2% was achieved for the film fabricated from a FAI solution containing 15 mol% MABr. To accurately determine the composition of the FAPbI3-based layer, we investigated the lattice parameter using XRD and the band gap using the EQE for the film showing the best performance. Fig.  S3  (21) shows the pseudocubic lattice parameter for (FAPbI3)1-x(MAPbBr3)x as a function of x, in which the composition was controlled by a previously reported method  (10) . In this study, the pseudocubic lattice parameter of the FAPbI3/MAPbBr3 film fabricated by IEP with a FAI solution containing 15 mol% MABr is 6.348 Å. As indicated in fig.  S4    (21) , the lattice parameter can be assigned as x = ~ 5, corresponding to (FAP-bI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05. This result is in agreement with the value estimated using the band gap (1.49 eV) from EQE [fig. S3  (21) ], because pure FAPbI3 has a band gap of 1.47 eV and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, 1.55 eV  (10) . Fortunately, the simultaneous introduction of both MA + cations and Br -anions in FAPbI3 even after incorporating 5 mol% of MAPbBr3 serves to stabilize the perovskite phase  (10) . After comparing the absorption coefficients of FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 at wavelengths beyond 800 nm, we noted that the thickness of a FAPbI3 layer needed to be higher than the optimal thickness of a typical perovskite layer with a band gap of ~1.55 eV (300 to 400 nm) to guarantee fully lightharvesting around 800 nm  (20, 22) . We deposited FAPbI3based layers with thickness of ~ 500 nm, and fabricated devices consisting of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)glass/barrier layer (bl)-TiO2/mesoporous (mp)-TiO2/perovskite/poly-triarylamine (PTAA)/Au (n-i-p architecture), as shown in the cross-sectional FESEM image of Fig.  2A . FESEM plane-view images of the device with film derived from PbI2(DMSO) complex and PbI2 films are shown in Fig.  2B . The FAPbI3 film derived from PbI2(DMSO) exhibited a dense and well-developed grain structure with larger grains than the FAPbI3 film derived from PbI2. Figure  2Ca  shows the J-V curves measured via reverse and forward bias sweep for one of the best-performing solar cell. The devices we fabricated also showed no hysteresis. Here, we believe that the hysteresis is highly dependent on the perovskite materials (FAPbI3 or MAPbI3) and cell architecture (n-i-p or p-i-n), although the ferroelectric properties of the perovskite itself are more likely to be the origin of the hysteresis in PSCs  (23, 24) . Thus, FAPbI3-based PSCs with n-i-p architecture show negligible hysteresis between the reverse and the forward scan in the I-V characteristics. In contrast, FAPbI3based cells consisting of FTO/NIO/ perovskite/PCBM/LiF/Al (p-i-n architecture) showed very strong hysteresis [fig.  S4 (21) ]. JSC, VOC, and FF determined from the J-V curves were 24.7 mA cm -2 , 1.06 V, and 77.5%, respectively, and correspond to a PCE of 20.2% under standard AM 1.5G illumination. Figure  2Cb  shows the EQE spectrum and integrated JSC for one of the best-performing solar cell. The high JSC is attributed to a very broad EQE plateau of >85% in the illumination wavelength range of 400 to 780 nm and broad lightharvesting up to a long wavelength of 840 nm, owing to the relatively low band gap (1.47 eV) of FAPbI3. The JSC value (24.4 mA cm -2 ) obtained by integrating EQE spectrum agreed well with that derived from the J-V measurement. The PCE of the best-performing cell (20.2%) was certified by the standardized method in the PV calibration laboratory, which confirmed a PCE of 20.1% under AM 1.5 G full-sun illuminations [fig.  S5 (21) ]. To gain more insight into the enhanced performance of the FAPbI3-based PSCs, we compared the properties of the films fabricated by IEP with those obtained from a conventional sequential process. A sequential reaction such as inter-diffusion between FAI/MAI and PbI2 through thermal annealing in organic iodide/PbI2 multilayer films has been used to form perovskite FAPbI3/MAPbI3 films from inorganic PbI2 films in the conventional process  (17) . Thus, considerable volume expansion occurs in the sequential deposition process based on PbI2 because of the growth of perovskite crystals with the insertion of organic iodides into PbI2 skeleton  (14, 22) . As expected, an initial PbI2 film with thickness of ~ 290 nm was doubled to 570 nm for the film formed by the reaction of PbI2 with FAI [Table  1  and fig.  S6 (21) ]. In contrast, the change in thickness observed by the application of the FAI (MABr) solution to the pre-deposited PbI2-(DMSO) film was negligible. In fact, the reaction between FAI (MABr) and PbI2(DMSO) was completed within 1 min during spin-coating and the FAPbI3 perovskite phase was formed without sequential annealing. However, in a conventional process using PbI2 films, annealing at high temperature is required to achieve interdiffusion. Figure  3A  compares XRD patterns for as-formed and annealed films by IEP and conventional process from PbI2(DMSO) complex film and PbI2 film, respectively; there is no appreciable difference in XRD patterns between as-formed and annealed film. This result confirms that the FAPbI3-based layer is formed by the IEP of DMSO and FAI (MABr) without additional annealing process. In addition, such an exchange can considerably favor crystallization into perovskite, compared to conventional interdiffusion from PbI2, and led to an increase in the XRD peaks intensity after annealing at 150°C for 20 min. However, the as-formed film with PbI2 showed XRD patterns assigned to PbI2, FAI, and FAPbI3, and a (002) peak at 12.5° corresponding to the PbI2 still remains after annealing at same temperature and time with IEP. In particular, the FAPbI3 film prepared by IEP is remarkably preferred (111)-oriented compared to FAPbI3 film annealed after preparing it by conventional process. The advantages of IEP become further apparent upon comparing the J-V curves and PCEs of FAPbI3-based devices derived from PbI2(DMSO) complex films and conventional PbI2 films (Fig.  3, B  and C ). The devices based on FAPbI3 fabricated from PbI2(DMSO) showed superior PCEs with smaller deviations in the value, compared to those prepared from conventional PbI2 films. High-efficiency solar cells with average PCEs of over 19% could be produced with a high degree of reproducibility by using the IEP. This study provides an effective protocol for fabricating efficient and cost-effective inorganic-organic hybrid heterojunction solar cells.    The tremendous improvements in device architecture (1-3), high-quality film formation methodologies (4-6), and compositional engineering of perovskite materials (7-9) over the last 3 years have led to rapid improvements in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Although solar-to-electric PCE of up to 18% has been reported for PSCs  (10) , developing technologies further to achieve PCEs near theoretical values continues to be among the most important challenges in the solar cell industry to achieve economic feasibility. Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) is a perovskite material that can potentially provide better performance than methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) because of its broad absorption of the solar spectrum. In addition, FAPbI3 with the n-i-p architecture (the n-side is illuminated with solar radiation) exhibits negligible hysteresis with sweep direction during current-voltage measurements  (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) .

Various methodologies such as sequential deposition (4), solventengineering (5), vapor-assisted deposition (  14 ), additiveassisted deposition  (15, 16) , and vacuum evaporation (  6 ) can now produce high-quality films of MAPbI3 with flat surfaces and complete surface coverage by controlling its rapid crystallization behavior and have led to substantial improve-ments in the PCE of MAPbI3based PSCs.

818,118_13," P erovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on three-dimensional (3D) perovskite absorbers have achieved rapid progress with PCE values of over 25% due to the outstanding optoelectronic properties of 3D perovskites. Nevertheless, their poor stability, particularly their susceptibility in humid environments, lack of thermal stability and light-soaking degradation, is a major shortcoming that limits their further practical application. As the bandgap-voltage offset values of PSCs are still higher than that of GaAs cells (W OC ≈ 0.3 V),  1  reducing the W OC and pushing the open-circuit voltage of PSCs towards the Shockley-Queisser V OC limit (where there is radiative recombination loss only) is of great significance for boosting the PCE, as well as for understanding the fundamental science more deeply  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]  . Several studies have shown that non-radiative recombination via defects at the interfaces between the perovskite and charge-transport layers is the main source of voltage losses for PSCs  [7] [8] [9]  . Strategies such as surface passivation or the use of processing additives have been explored to minimize non-radiative recombination losses at interfaces and thus improve the open-circuit voltage of devices  10, 11  . For example, surfaces and grain boundaries with potassium passivation have been shown to enable the substantial mitigation of non-radiative recombination losses (ΔV OC,nr ), pushing the V OC value up to 1.17 V with a low W OC of 0.39 V (ΔV OC,nr = 0.11 V) for a 1.56-eV-bandgap 3D perovskite system. However, there are still substantial non-radiative losses produced from trap states within the perovskite bulk film, which limits the performance and stability of the perovskite device  12  . In addition, the energy-level alignment at the interface is also a key factor for minimizing the interfacial non-radiative recombination, which requires careful interface design  13  . Thus, a simultaneous interface and bulk trap passivation strategy as well as interface engineering are required to further reach the full thermodynamic potential of the open-circuit voltage. In this work, we introduced a multifunctional (bulk and interface) 2D perovskite passivation approach and graded interface design to reduce the photovoltage loss of the PSC and enhance the device stability. n-Butylammonium bromide (BABr) was first coated on top of a 3D perovskite film, and through thermal driving we simultaneously achieved a relatively uniform distribution of self-passivated 2D/3D perovskites in the bulk, covered by graded mixed-dimensional, wider-bandgap 2D perovskite layers. We name it the dimensionally graded perovskite formation (DGPF) approach. This multifunctional approach effectively suppresses the non-radiative recombination loss in both the bulk and at the interface of the perovskite. Via this DGPF technique, we demonstrate a hysteresis-free maximum PCE of 21.54% with a high V OC of 1.24 V in a 1.63 eV perovskite system, and the W OC is only 0.39 V, which is equivalent to a non-radiative recombination V OC loss (ΔV OC,nr ) of only 0.11 V. In particular, a minimum W OC of 0.38 V and a ΔV OC,nr of 0.10 V was achieved in a 20.15% PCE device.

Here we improve the quality of both the bulk and surface of FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 perovskite films to reduce the efficiency gap. First, we use dibutyl sulfoxide, a Lewis base additive, to improve the crystallinity and reduce the defect density and internal residual stress of the perovskite bulk. Then, we treat the surface of the perovskite film with trifluorocarbon-modified phenethylammonium iodide to optimize the energy levels, passivate defects and protect the film against moisture. The inverted PSCs simultaneously achieve 25.1% efficiency (24.5% from the reverse current-voltage scan measured by a third-party institution) and improved stability. The devices maintained 97.4% and 98.2% of their initial power conversion efficiencies after operating under continuous 1-sun air mass 1.5 G illumination for 1,800 h and under damp heat conditions (85 °C and 85% relative humidity) for 1,000 h, respectively.  ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSD"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""85"", ""temperature"": ""85"", ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.1"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.982""}, ""test_1_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1800"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
864,73_3," Modulation of perovskite films crystal growth First, we optimized the preparation process of FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 -based perovskite films; a small amount of caesium is introduced to stabilize the black phase of FAPbI 3 -based perovskite  11  . We found that it is easier to prepare pin-hole free FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 -based films with DMF/NMP solvent mixture rather not the commonly used DMF/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in a N 2 -filled glove box (Supplementary Fig.  1 ), which is similar to the results reported in ref. 22. Starting from the DMF/NMP solvent, we further modified it by adding DBSO (longer-chain analogue of DMSO) as a coordination agent to modulate the perovskite growth (Supplementary Tables  2  and 3 ). The longer alkyl chains incorporated in DBSO result in its higher boiling point (250 °C versus 189 °C) and stronger electron donating power (Gutmann donor number, 31.0 versus 29.8) as compared with DMSO, which enables more stable coordination with PbI 2 than the DMSO case and also NMP case (donor number of 27.3) as demonstrated below. Such properties play an important role in control of perovskite crystal growth and defects concentration in the resultant FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 films. The effects of different DBSO additive contents (0%, 5%, 10% and 20%, molar ratio to PbI 2 ) on the morphology and crystal size of perovskite films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig.  1a , the average grain size in the perovskite films gradually increases from 260 to 378 and 466 nm following the increase in the DBSO content from 0% to 5% and then to 10%. When the DBSO content further increases to 20%, the average crystal size slightly decreases to 432 nm (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). When the amount of DBSO further increases to 40%, many micron-level cracks are observed in the resultant perovskite films (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), which may be due to DBSO residue caused by excessive addition (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). Therefore, using an appropriate amount of DBSO is the key factor to improving the film quality. Figure  1b ,c shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite films before and after annealing with different DBSO content. As can be seen, the non-annealed precursor film with 0% DBSO exhibits a δ-phase diffraction peak at 11.8°, while the addition of DBSO inhibits the formation of δ-phase in the non-annealed films thus leading to the increased amount of α-phase perovskite with the main peak at 14.0° and a new phase with the main peak at 6.3°. Furthermore, increase in the content of DBSO from 5% to 10% and then to 20% is accompanied by the gradual increase in the XRD peak intensity of the new phase, while the peaks of α-phase perovskite gradually decay. These findings indicate that DBSO induces the formation of a new crystalline intermediate phase facilitating the formation of α-phase perovskite. The diffraction peak at 6.3° is attributed to the formation of DBSO•PbI 2 intermediate phase similar to other Lewis base-PbI 2 intermediate phases  10, 23  (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). The interactions between DBSO, PbI 2 and formamidinium iodide (FAI) are confirmed by comparing the Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectra of the DBSO, DBSO•PbI 2 , FAI and FAI•PbI 2 •DBSO samples (Fig.  1d , Supplementary Fig.  6  and Supplementary Table  4 ). The sulfoxide S=O bond stretching vibration peak of DBSO located at 1,028 cm -1 shifted to 968 cm -1 in the DBSO•PbI 2 sample, which is owing to the formation of dative bond by sharing the lone pair electrons in oxygen with Pb 2+ . And the C=N double bond stretching vibration peak of FAI at 1,697 cm -1 shifted to 1,712 cm -1 in the FAI•PbI 2 •DBSO sample. This phenomenon is similar to the peak shift induced by coordination between other Lewis bases to PbI 2 and FAI  22, 24  . Although it has been widely reported that many Lewis bases can lead to the formation of intermediate phases (for example, DMSO•PbI 2 and NMP•PbI 2 ) in the perovskite precursor films, it is noteworthy that the specific DBSO•PbI 2 intermediate phase is much more stable than NMP•PbI 2 , so it could resist the instantaneous anti-solvent extraction process (Supplementary Figs.  7 8 9 ). Note that the amount of NMP in our solvent system is large, but the amount of the NMP•PbI 2 intermediate phase in the obtained non-annealed films is negligibly low after the anti-solvent washing process. Based Therefore, it is particularly urgent to improve the efficiency of inverted PSCs at the current stage. Screening the performance optimization strategies reported for high-efficiency (>25%) regular PSCs 2-6 reveals that methylammonium (MA + )-and bromide (Br -)-free formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 )-based perovskites are commonly employed because of their ideal bandgap close to the Shockley-Queisser optimum. The resultant devices typically simultaneously demonstrate high short-circuit current density (J SC ) of ~26 mA cm  -2  , and high open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.17-1.19 V (Supplementary Table  1 ). The high-efficiency (>24%) inverted PSCs  [11] [12] [13] [14]  usually incorporated FAPbI 3 as the main component with small amounts of MA + and Br -as additives, which may be beneficial for achieving higher V OC , but also lead to a slight sacrifice of J SC (Supplementary Table  1 ) due to the optical loss caused by blue-shifted absorbance. Li  with a lower V OC of 1.095 V. In addition, the introduction of MA + and Br -to FAPbI 3 could raise risk to induce problems such as low thermal stability caused by the existence of MA, phase separation caused by the presence of mixed halides, and reduced photon absorption and current density cause by Br -incorporation  [15] [16] [17]  . Although some recent literature reported controversal results that the incorporation of small portions of MA + , Br -in hybrid perovskites is benefit for stability improvement  18, 19  . FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 has been widely recognized as the most attractive material for PSCs exhibiting both high efficiencies and good thermal stability  20  . Until now, the highest certified efficiency of inverted PSCs based on MA + -and Br --free formamidinium cesium perovskite is only 23.5% with V OC of 1.14 V (ref. 11). Thus, it is desirable to further optimize inverted PSCs based on the MA + -and Br --free formamidinium cesium perovskites. So far, key strategies implemented in those high-efficiency inverted PSCs mainly focused on optimizing interfacial materials and surface passivation of perovskite absorber films  [11] [12] [13] [14] 21  . Beyond these strategies, the management of the bulk and surface defects in perovskite films is of equal importance to achieve an efficient and stable inverted PSCs. In this Article, we report an optimization strategy to simultaneously manage the bulk and surface defects in FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 perovskite films to enable high-performance inverted PSCs. Firstly, a low-volatile dibutyl sulfoxide (DBSO) Lewis base additive with a strong coordination ability was introduced into the N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent system, thus leading to the formation of a stable intermediate phase of DBSO•PbI 2 in the precursor film even after anti-solvent extraction. Such intermediate phase can suppress the formation of undesirable δ-phase FA-perovskite and modulate perovskite crystal growth. The proposed improved film fabrication strategy leads to perovskite films with larger grain size and reduced internal film stress and bulk defects. In addition, 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) phenethylammonium iodide (denoted as 2CF 3 -PEAI) was introduced as an interface passivator designed to simultaneously adjust interfacial energy levels, passivate surface defects of the perovskite films and stabilize the films against moisture with help from the presence of hydrophobic CF 3 groups. As a result, the devices demonstrated impressive PCEs of up to 25.1% (24.5% from reverse scan was measured by a third-party institution) owing to the use of the high-quality FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 films. Moreover, the encapsulated devices showed stable operation in air under continuous 1-sun air mass (AM) 1.5 G illumination for up to 1,800 h without notable efficiency decay and also pass the damp heat test (85 °C and 85% relative humidity (RH)) according to the international standards for mature photovoltaics (IEC61215). on the molecular structures of NMP, DBSO and PbI 2 octahedral, we used density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the interaction energy between PbI 2 and the two coordination molecules (Fig.  1e, f ). The interaction energy between PbI 2 and DBSO (-1.42 eV) is much higher than that between PbI 2 and NMP (-1.03 eV), and also higher than the interaction energy between PbI 2 and DMSO (-1.01 eV; Supplementary Fig.  10 ) due to the stronger electron donating of DBSO than the other two Lewis bases. This difference could explain why the   ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSD"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""85"", ""temperature"": ""85"", ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.1"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.982""}, ""test_1_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1800"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""FA0.98Cs0.02PbI3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSD"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) phenethylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": ""85"", ""temperature"": ""85"", ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.1"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.982""}, ""test_1_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1800"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
865,73_4," Characterization of the perovskite film's quality XRD patterns of the annealed perovskite films made from different precursor solutions show that all the films transform into α-phase FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 perovskite after annealing at 150 °C for 20 min (Fig.  1c ). With the increasing content of DBSO loading from 0% to 5% and then to 10%, the XRD peak intensity gradually increases, thus indicating the enhancement of the perovskite crystallinity. This is consistent with the increased grain size upon DBSO addition as observed by SEM. The perovskite crystal growth mechanisms can be explained by two different pathways as described in Fig.  1g . In the case of 0% DBSO sample, the δ-phase transition to α-phase occurs directly during annealing; while in the 10% DBSO sample a molecular exchange between DBSO•PbI 2 intermediate phase and FAI is controlling the α-phase crystal growth upon annealing. It has been widely reported that the intermediate phase or molecular exchange dominated crystal growth could reduce the activation energy of the perovskite crystal formation, which normally leads to larger crystalline grain size in the as-fabricated perovskite films  23, 25  . We also conducted XRD characterization to monitor the crystal structure evolution from the as-coated films to fully crystallized perovskite films during annealing (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). The obtained results further confirm the important role of the DBSO•PbI 2 intermediate phase in promoting the crystallinity of the obtained α-phase FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 films. When the DBSO content further increases to 20%, the XRD diffraction peak intensity becomes slightly lower, which is also consistent with the SEM data discussed above. It is well known that the internal residual stress in perovskite films can promote the formation of atomic vacancies, increase non-radiative recombination, reduce carrier mobility and structural stability, and thus deteriorate the photovoltaic performance of devices  [26] [27] [28] [29]  . We employed grazing incident XRD to test the residual stress at the 50 nm and 200 nm depth regions of the perovskite films obtained using different DBSO content (Supplementary Tables  5  and 6 ). The results show that the tensile stress at 200 nm (Fig.  2a  and Supplementary Fig.  12 ) and 50 nm (Fig.  2b  and Supplementary Fig.  13 ) gradually release with the increasing DBSO content from 0% to 5% and then to 10%. In addition, Williamson-Hall analysis also confirmed that the introduction of DBSO can relax the lattice strain (Supplementary Fig.  14 ). This phenomenon may be related to the following two reasons  30  : first, when DBSO•PbI 2 reacts with FAI to form perovskite, the formation energy of α-phase perovskite can be significantly reduced, thereby avoiding the formation of δ-phase nuclei in the precursor film. Thus, the tensile stress caused by cell volume shrinkage during the transformation of δ-phase to α-phase in the case of the 0% DBSO samples could be avoided (Supplementary Fig.  15a, b ). Second, the tensile stress remaining at the grain boundaries due to the lattice expansion during high-temperature annealing of perovskite could be further released by reducing the number of grain boundaries when using optimal concentrations of DBSO additive (Supplementary Fig.  15c ). Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) (Fig.  2c ) and transient PL spectroscopy (Fig.  2d  and Supplementary Fig.  16 ) were used to evaluate the non-radiative carrier recombination behaviour of the perovskite films made from different DBSO additive content. The results show that the addition of DBSO, especially for 10% content, could effectively suppress the fast non-radiative decay component. As can be seen, benefitted from strain relaxation, the fitted carrier lifetime increases from 423 ns (0% DBSO) to 613 ns (5% DBSO) and finally to 708 ns (10% DBSO). The 20% DBSO sample has a shorter PL lifetime (525 ns), which is consistent with its reduced crystallinity (Fig.  1c ). Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy was further used to analyse the carrier dynamics in the perovskite films with and without DBSO addition (Fig.  2e, f ). It can be seen that the attenuation rate of ground-state bleaching of perovskite film decreases significantly when DBSO is added, and the single exponential kinetic model delivered the lifetimes of 9.89 ns (0% DBSO) and 32.56 ns (10% DBSO) (Supplementary Fig.  17 )  31, 32  , which again verified the decrease in defect density within the DBSO-based films. The above results consistently show that using appropriate DBSO loading can effectively release residual stress within the film and reduce defect density due to the ability of this additive to modulate the perovskite crystal growth. These effects inhibit the non-radiative recombination of charge carriers and improve the carrier lifetime. To optimize the content of DBSO, we prepared inverted PSCs with the ITO/p-PY/FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 /PCBM/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag configuration; the typical cross-sectional SEM image of the device is shown in Supplementary Fig.  18 . p-PY is an efficient and stable hole transport material incorporating pyridine core functionalized with poly(triarylamine) units as we reported recently  33, 34  . Supplementary Fig.  19  shows the current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the devices based on the perovskite films with different DBSO content. It can be seen that PCE reaches the highest values when DBSO content is close to 10% (Supplementary Fig.  20 ). As compared with the reference 0% DBSO samples, J SC of the 10% DBSO device increases from 24.88 mA cm -2 to 25.68 mA cm -2 , V OC increases from 1.024 V to 1.091 V, fill factor (FF) increases from 0.792 to 0.805, and PCE increases from 20.2% to 22.6% (Supplementary Table  7 ). The improved device performance is assigned to the reduced defect density and improved carrier lifetimes caused by the use of DBSO additive. ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""FA0.98Cs0.02PbI3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSD"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) phenethylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": ""85"", ""temperature"": ""85"", ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.1"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.982""}, ""test_1_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1800"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""FA0.98Cs0.02PbI3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSD"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) phenethylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": ""85"", ""temperature"": ""85"", ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""22.6"", ""control_voc"": ""1.024"", ""treated_voc"": ""1.091"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.982""}, ""test_1_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1800"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
893,117_2,"Record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been obtained with the organic hole transporter 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). Conventional doping of spiro-OMeTAD with hygroscopic lithium salts and volatile 4-tert-butylpyridine is a time-consuming process and also leads to poor device stability. We developed a new doping strategy for spiro-OMeTAD that avoids post-oxidation by using stable organic radicals as the dopant and ionic salts as the doping modulator (referred to as ion-modulated radical doping). We achieved PCEs of >25% and much-improved device stability under harsh conditions. The radicals provide hole polarons that instantly increase the conductivity and work function (WF), and ionic salts further modulate the WF by affecting the energetics of the hole polarons. This organic semiconductor doping strategy, which decouples conductivity and WF tunability, could inspire further optimization in other optoelectronic devices. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""ion-modulated radical doping Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null}"
895,117_4,"M etal halide perovskites have achieved impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in both single-junction (1-6) and tandem solar cells  (7, 8) . However, a key challenge limiting their practical application is the trade-off between high efficiency and high stability, an issue determined by not only the perovskite materials  (9)  but also the charge transport layers  (10) . Currently, most high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with >24% PCE are based on the benchmark hole transport layer (HTL) spiro-OMeTAD doped by lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP)  (11) (12) (13) , a process that limits the stability of these highefficiency PSCs. Conventional spiro-OMeTAD doping (Fig.  1A , top) involves LiTFSI to facilitate the generation of spiro-OMeTAD •+ TFSI -radicals and tBP to improve dopants' solubility and film morphology  (14) . This recipe usually requires an in situ oxidization process for a period of 10 to 24 hours in air to reach the optimal conductivity and work function (WF)  (15) . However, because of the low doping efficiency of this process, a large amount of dopants and additives (~56 mol % LiTFSI and ~330 mol % tBP) are required to generate ~10 mol % radicals  (16) . The residual LiTFSI, tBP, and by-products (e.g., Li x O y ) are not only diffusible  (17)  but also sensitive to humidity and heat  (18, 19) , negatively affecting device stability. In addition, the complex in situ oxidation process makes it challenging to understand the mechanism of conventional spiro-OMeTAD doping, which limits further development of stable HTLs with high PCEs. Several efforts addressing the spiro-OMeTAD stability issue have focused on the hygroscopic lithium salt. For example, a CO 2 gas-forming treatment was recently used to remove the hygroscopic lithium species  (20) . Less hygroscopic dopants, including metallic salts  (21) (22) (23) , protic ionic liquids  (24) , and ex situ synthesized spiro-OMeTAD 2•+ (TFSI -) 2 radicals  (25, 26) , have also been used to replace the oxidant LiTFSI. Such doping usually requires the addition of volatile tBP, whose role in the doping process has been controversial  (27, 28) . In particular, tBP would react with radicals and coordinate with LiTFSI to form by-products (Fig.  1A , top), which not only negatively affects device performance but also prevents a full understanding of the spiro-OMeTAD doping mechanism. We developed a stable doping strategy for instant and effective doping of spiro-OMeTAD, which we call ion-modulated (IM) radical doping (Fig.  1A , bottom), that relies on two components. One is the presynthesized stable spiro-OMeTAD 2•+ (TFSI -) 2 radical (synthesis and characterizations in figs. S1 and S2), which acts as the main dopant to improve conductivity and WF. The second is the ionic salt 4-tert-butyl-1methylpyridinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (TBMP + TFSI -) to further modulate the WF. In this doping strategy, the localized ionic environment created by the ionic salt was used to manipulate the energetics of the hole polarons and decouple the conductivity and WF tunability. The doped spiro-OMeTAD based on our IM radical doping strategy delivered PSCs simultaneously with high efficiency (PCE > 25%) and high stability (T 80 for ~1200 hours under 70 ± 5% relative humidity (RH) and T 80 for ~800 hours under 70°± 3°C without encapsulation), minimizing the trade-off between efficiency and stability of PSCs. In addition, the IM radical doping strategy provides a facile yet effective approach to separately optimize the conductivity and WF of organic semiconductors for a variety of optoelectronic applications. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""ion-modulated radical doping Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""ion-modulated radical doping Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""70"", ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1200"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.8""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""70"", ""time"": ""800"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.8""}}"
951,90_3,"O ver the past decade, hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskites have received enormous interest as low-cost and highly efficient light absorbers in photovoltaics  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]  . The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has shortly surpassed 22% in the lab scale  7  , and that of larger-area (>1 cm 2 ) devices has exceeded 20%  [8] [9] [10] [11]  . The highest PCEs are mostly achieved by employing the mixed halide perovskites (e.g., (HC(NH 2 ) 2 PbI 3 ) 0.85 (CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 ) 0.15 i.e., (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 ). Through element substitution, it provides a largely unexplored compositional space to tailor the physiochemical properties of corresponding materials for efficient and stable devices  1, [12] [13] [14] [15]  . However, the mixed hybrid perovskites potentially suffer from materials inhomogeneity partially due to composition separation  16, 17  and/or thermal stress. This may be originated from substantial chemical mismatch among each component, and the nonequilibrium growth conditions during film fabrication. On one hand, serious material inhomogeneity is regarded as phase separation, deviating from the originally desired materials properties to deteriorate the resultant device performance (both efficiency and operational stability)  18, 19  . On the other hand, moderate material inhomogeneity correlates to local lattice mismatches and emergent residual strains in perovskite films. It deserves more attention, because such residual strains should result in lattice distortion of microscopic crystal structure, and further affect optoelectronic properties of the perovskite thin film  [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25]  . Recently, the residual strains have been identified in the singlecomposition MAPbI 3 polycrystalline films, and were found to influence stability of perovskite films under illumination  22  . In an even wider spectrum of semiconductors, strain has been extensively investigated, and accordingly, strain engineering has been exploited to tailor the optoelectronic functionalities. For instance, the application of tensile strain was found to improve light emission in Germanium crystals and drive indirect-to-direct optical transition in bilayered two-dimensional WSe 2  [26] [27] [28]  . Strain compensation strategy has been demonstrated to improve efficiencies of GaAs-based quantum dot solar cells  29, 30  . Strainengineered MoS 2 monolayer was also proposed to have broadrange capture of solar energy  26  . For hybrid halide perovskites, especially mixed perovskites, in-depth understanding of their characteristics and effects on the material's optoelectronic properties, is still absent. This precludes effective employment of strain engineering to further enhance the device performance. In this report, we probe the residual strain distribution profiles in the mixed perovskite thin films and its effects on photovoltaic device efficiency. We investigate the evolution of in-plane residual strain over the film thickness in the typical mixed perovskite (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 by using grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurement. We identify a gradient distribution of in-plane strain component that correlates to the composition inhomogeneity perpendicular to the substrate. We further demonstrate a feasible method to modulate the tensile or compressive nature of residual strain and even its gradient over perovskite films in a controllable manner. With the aid of firstprinciples calculations, we find that the strain gradient induces energy bands bending and thus affects the carrier dynamics across the interfaces over the solar cell. By deliberately engineering the residual strains to enhance carrier extraction efficiency, we successfully fabricate strain-engineered perovskite solar cells to achieve enhanced PCEs up to 20.7% (certified). ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""(FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""20.7"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
952,90_4," Results Probing residual strain gradient of mixed perovskite films. In the direction parallel to substrates, the grain-to-grain inhomogeneity in polycrystalline films was already observed by adopting photoluminescence in a scanning electron microscopy (PL-SEM) and conductive-atomic force microscopy (C-AFM)  31  . However, it lacks depth profile along the film thickness regarding the lattice structure inhomogeneity. At the macroscopic level, the vertical homogeneity of thin films can be quantitatively evaluated by residual strain to reflect the lattice mismatch  20, 22, 32  . The macroscopic residual strain is an internal strain in polycrystalline materials that is balanced over a wide range of grains. We explored the residual strain distribution for mixed perovskite films vertically with the depth-dependent GIXRD measurement, wherein the classical sin 2 φ measurement is combined with grazing incident X-ray diffraction to probe the in-plane residual strain. This method has been used in thin films of ZrO 2 and TiN, which provides reliable depth resolution to reveal lattice structure evolution  [33] [34] [35]  . As depicted in Fig.  1a , we fixed the 2θ and varied the instrument tilt angle ψ to obtain corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns as shown in Fig.  1b . For detailed test information, please see the Supplementary method, Supplementary Fig.  1  and Supplementary Table  1 . The mixed perovskite films on the SnO 2 /ITO/glass substrates showed XRD peaks (2θ) at around 14.0°, 31.6°, and 40.5°, corresponding to (001), (012), and (022) crystallographic planes, respectively  36  . Among all three planes with intensive diffraction peaks, the (012) plane was chosen for further analysis due to its high diffraction angle and multiplicative factor, which provides the most reliable structure symmetry information. We picked up three representative depths of 50, 200 and 500 nm to check the residual strain in the mixed perovskite films with the nominal formula of (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 . At each fixed depth, diffraction data were fitted with Gaussian distribution function and it clearly observed a systematic shift in peak position to lower 2θ when the penetrated depth increased (Fig.  1b  and Supplementary Fig.  2 ). Generally, sin 2 φ and 2θ follow a linear relationship and the slope of the fitting line stands for the magnitude of the residual strain (see equation (1) in Supplementary method). As shown in Fig.  1b , all fitting lines exhibited negative value in the slopes, which means (012) crystal planes exhibit enlarged distance when turning to the out-of-plane direction at the same detected depth. It thus indicates the entire sample is subjected to tensile strain. It is in agreement with previous study wherein the residual tensile strain was observed in perovskite thin films upon the similar annealing process  22  . With the increase of probe depth, the fitting lines show smaller slopes in absolute value, which implies the macroscopic residual tensile strain gradually decreases. Moreover, we found the most significant deviation in lattice constant at 50 nm as compared to that of 200 and 500 nm. Besides, the (001) and (022) crystal planes were also found to follow the similar trend (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). It indicates the residual strain inhomogeneity in the mixed perovskite thin film, wherein the top surface of the film bears the largest tensile strain. It is worth noting that residual strain correlates to the lattice distortion, which might affect the carrier dynamics at the relevant interfaces, as will be discussed later. Therefore, the residual tensile strain gradient was clearly identified, which gradually decreases from the top surface to the core in the mixed perovskite polycrystalline thin films. So far, we have observed the gradient distribution of tensile strain in the perovskite thin film. And it will be interesting to understand the origin of the residual strain. The residual stain is often stemmed from the lattice mismatch due to lattice structure evolution. We thus conducted GIXRD measurements with variable grazing incident angle ω (Supplementary Table  1 ) to reveal the lattice mismatch along the film thickness. These depthdependent XRD patterns were roughly similar and no new diffraction peaks appeared, indicating the film exhibited the same cubic phase structure at different depths. However, we observed a systematic shift of diffraction peaks along with the probing depths at 50, 200, and 500 nm in the perovskite film. Take (001) planes for example, the corresponding diffraction peaks for 50, 200, and 500 nm exhibited peak centers at 14.01°, 13.94°, and 13.90°, respectively (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). Among different crystal planes of (001), (012) and (022), corresponding peak positions gradually shift towards the low diffraction angle with the increase of probing depths. According to the Bragg's law, larger lattice constant was expected in the deeper zone of films. Thus, the crystal structure inhomogeneity along the film thickness is detected unambiguously. To provide the evidence regarding the structure inhomogeneity in the microscopic level, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) nano-beam electron diffraction measurement was further carried out to investigate crystal structure evolution along the depth direction of mixed perovskite films. We obtained the high-resolution TEM image with microarea diffraction patterns to inspect three typical regions with different depths (Fig.  1d-f ). After careful calibration of all measured diffraction patterns (Supplementary Table  2 ), we found that the crystal plane distance increased with scanning depth. As shown in Fig.  1e-g , lattice parameters of (004) planes were measured to be 1.60, 1.64 and 1.67 Å for three individual areas, respectively, which is consistent with the GIXRD results. Combining the microscopic analysis (TEM) and the long-range structure characterization (GIXRD), we clearly illustrate lattice structure evolution developed vertically in the mixed perovskite polycrystalline thin films, wherein the lattice constant decreases from the surface to the bottom. The above-mentioned crystal structure inhomogeneity is likely to correlate to the composition evolution in mixed perovskite thin films. It is commonly accepted that FAPbI 3 exhibits the cubic phase with the lattice constant of 6.357 Å  36  . When MA and/or Br element are incorporated to form the mixed perovskites single crystals, they hold the cubic phase with decreased lattice parameters. We observed smaller lattice constant at the surface of the film, which may partially attribute to higher ratio of MA and/or Br components in the long-range ordered FA based perovskite lattices. To identify the distribution of MA and/or Br components, we resorted to time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) depth profiles and TEM/EDX mapping for the (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 perovskite film samples as shown in the inset of Fig.  1h , Supplementary Figs.  4  and 5 . It shows a homogeneous distribution of CsBr 2+ , CsI 2+ , FA + in the all samples, which indicates the even distribution of the halogen Br -. It is reasonable because the smallest halogen ion Br -can diffuse and be evenly distributed during the crystallization process. To be noted, the signal intensity of MA + fragment decreased substantially from the surface to the core region in all mixed perovskite thin films, consistent with the XRD and TEM results. Unambiguously it reveals the gradient evolution of composition and thus lattice structure across the depth direction due to the gradient distribution of organic cation MA + . The nonuniform composition distribution indicates the unique kinetics for film growth, which is possibly related to the coordination strength of different precursors  37  and film processing conditions. It clearly implies the compositional distribution serve as one major factor that leads to the gradient residual strain. It is revealed that hybrid perovskites with different lattice structures often exhibit different optoelectronic properties  25, 38  and it is expected to observe the gradient variation in terms of optoelectronic properties within the gradient phase structure of the film. Therefore, we examined the depth-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra within the film by using confocal fluorescence microscope. With the increasing depth of the beam probe, a systematic red shift of PL spectra was observed (Fig.  1h  and Supplementary Fig.  6 ). Fitting with the Gaussian distribution function, we found the PL peak positions shifted from 781 to 788 nm, and their full width at half maximum (FWHM) decreased along the film thickness. Since the emission photon energy is determined by the bandgap of semiconductors, it indicates the perovskite film exhibits gradually decreased bandgap from the surface to the bottom vertically. To be noted, it follows the similar trend in gradient evolution of lattice structure and compositional distribution, wherein more MA + ions are incorporated in the perovskite crystals at the top surface of the film. In addition, narrower PL linewidth emission at the deeper region of perovskite film was observed, which may indicate weakened interaction between charge carriers and lattice vibrations (phonons) due to improved film homogeneity and lattice order  39, 40  . Modulating the residual strains. Based on the analysis above, we reveal that the observed residual strain gradient in perovskite films is closely related to lattice structure evolution due to detectable compositional inhomogeneity. However, it may not be the only contributor that governs the residual strain, given the largest tensile strain concentrated on the film surface. Interestingly, when examining the pure MAPbI 3 perovskite thin film, we still observed the existence of gradient residual strain (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). It is thus speculated that the thermal strain may take effects due to the temperature gradient during perovskite film fabrication. To illustrate, the perovskite film is roughly divided into two regions, e.g., the surface and the bottom (near the substrate). When heated on a hot plate, both regions experienced substantial temperature gradient (higher at the bottom). Consequently, the inorganic framework near the bottom expands more in volume upon annealing as compared to that at the surface, which facilitates the insertion of larger cation (FA + ) to form the perovskite crystalline structure. It possibly results in the inhomogeneous composition in the film, wherein MA + prefers to stay at the surface. Upon cooling, it is reasonable that the surface cools down much faster than that of the core, which leads to less volume shrinkage. As a result, the surface withstands tensile strain and the core is subjected to compressive strain accordingly. Additionally, since the thermal expansion coefficient of perovskites is much larger than that of the substrate, the entire film bears the tensile strain during film cooling process. Thereby, the core experiences not only compressive strain from the surface, but also tensile strain from the substrate, which leads to the gradient residual tensile strain in the perovskite thin film. To verify the speculation, we attempted to modulate the gradient in-plane residual strain in the perovskite thin films by adjusting the annealing process. We first tried to anneal the film at 150 °C high temperature for a long time, which is a conventional approach to eliminating residual strains in metal alloy materials. Unfortunately, it led to the significant occurrence of PbI 2 (Supplementary Fig.  7 ) in the resultant thin films due to the relative poor thermal stability of hybrid perovskites  41  . We then tried to change the temperature gradient when the films were annealed. Simply, we modified the heat treatment process by flipping over the thin film sample to provide an invert temperature gradient. Interestingly, tensile strain was significantly reduced in the samples upon this treatment as shown in Fig.  2a, b . With small strain gradient and the closer lattice distance in the perovskite film, the lattice structure was almost homogeneous. It thus suggests an effective way to significantly reduce the tensile strain inhomogeneity across the film thickness by tuning the temperature gradient during film processing. Furthermore, we tried to directly perform flipped annealing process to the intermediate state film after the spin-coating process ends, which is expected to apply compressive strain with vertical gradient over the film. In contrast to the previous samples, the as-prepared films show the fitting curves possessed slopes in positive values (Fig.  2c, d ), which increased along with the probe depth. It clearly indicates films exhibit compressive strain, which is also distributed in a vertical gradient. Unfortunately, we observed a lot of pinholes in the resultant film possibly because the solvent cannot be spread smoothly during the annealing process (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). Therefore, we demonstrate the temperature gradient is also an important source to residual strain during the film growth, which further suggests a method to manipulate the evolution of lattice structure of polycrystalline thin films and the surface strain. To investigate whether the upper contacting layer influences the surface strain, we prepared a tensile-strained film to test the surface residual strain as a reference point. Then for the same sample, 1 mL chlorobenzene solution was dripped on the film surface during the spin-coating process and the film was tested. Furthermore, the same sample was coated with Spiro-OMeTAD layer and then tested again. We found the same slope of the fitting curves indicating the magnitude of the surface strain remained constant. (Supplementary Fig.  10 ) It clearly shows that the chlorobenzene dripped process and/or Spiro-OMeTAD contacting layer does not affect the surface strain significantly. The residual strain and its gradient distribution reflects the structure inhomogeneity in the perovskite thin film along the vertical direction. It is known that the strain gradient is derived from the XRD peak offset, which actually reveals the variation of lattice parameters leading to the crystal structure mismatch across the thin film. In hybrid halide perovskites, the framework of corner-sharing PbI 6 octahedral contributes to the electronic configuration, especially at the band-edge  42, 43  . It means variations in the inorganic framework would possibly result in the change in optoelectronic properties of the materials. The structure variations include enlargement/shrinkage, tilting, and other deformation of the octahedral network, which can be clearly illustrated by measuring the residual strain. Therefore, it is of great interest to bridge the gulf between the residual strain and the optoelectronic properties of the materials and relevant devices. Given the thin film surface exhibits the most significant strain, it is reasonable focus on the carrier dynamic behavior across the interface via strain modulation, and their effects on device performance. ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""(FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""20.7"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""(FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""MAPbI 3"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""20.7"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
953,90_5," Impacts of strain on carrier dynamics and device performance. To investigate the impact of the gradient residual strain on the device performance, we first fabricated planar heterojunction solar cells by adopting the perovskite absorbers with/without residual strains. The device architecture follows the regular structure of ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. We then compare the J-V curves of the tensile-strained and the strain-free devices. To avoid possible misleading due to sample variation, we fabricated 40 cells under optimal conditions in each batch. Figure  3a  shows the histograms of PCEs for each batch of samples with/without strain. The tensile-strained devices exhibited the PCE averaged around 18.7% with a wider distribution from 17.3% and 20.3%. In comparison, the strain-free devices achieved the averaged PCE of 19.8%, whose PCEs were distributed in a narrow range between 18.8% and 20.7%. The narrow distribution in PCEs of the strain-free devices stands for the good processing reproducibility. We also conducted the current-voltage (I-V) measurement for devices under different annealing conditions to preserve different tensile strains in the absorbers, which provided the statistics of parameters in Supplementary Fig.  11  and Supplementary Table  4 . It is found that the fill factor (FF) and the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) have significantly improved with the increase of the flipped annealing time, wherein the surface tensile strain is gradually released through prolonged annealing at 120 °C. We measured current-density voltage (J-V) characteristics of one of the best devices under a simulated illumination of air mass (AM) 1.5 and 100 mW cm -2 . This device generated a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 22.8 mA cm -2 , a FF of 78.0%, an opencircuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.17 V, and a power conversion efficiency of 20.7% (Fig.  3b ). The forward and reverse scanning current density-voltage (J-V) curves showed negligible hysteresis in the corresponding device in Supplementary Fig.  11e , which was likely attributed to the improved carrier extraction at the interface  44, 45  . By holding a bias near the maximum power output point (0.96 V), a stabilized photocurrent of 21.3 mA cm -2 was obtained, corresponding to a stabilized efficiency of 20.5% (the inset of Fig.  3b ). The device performance was certified by the independent third party (Supporting Information). The External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for the two types of devices were shown in Supplementary Fig.  11f . Compared to the tensile strain device, the strain-free device showed improved light harvesting efficiency along the entire absorption wavelength range of 350 to 800 nm. The integrated photocurrent densities were calculated to be 20.81, 22.7 mA cm -2 , respectively, which was in good agreement with the J SC derived from the J-V measurement. Thus far, we observed the significant improvement in FF and V OC in strain-engineered devices. This is likely attributed to improved carrier extraction dynamics around the absorber interface, which is subjected to further analysis. Firstly, the carriers transport behavior at the interface was probed with transient photocurrent (TPC) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement. The TPC measurement (Fig.  3c ) was often used to monitor the carrier transport across the device. By fitting with the exponential function, the photocurrent decay time was significantly reduced from 12.96 to 1.0 µs (Supplementary Table  5 ). A faster decay of photocurrent than the reference device suggested the improvement in carrier extraction when tensile strain gradient was almost eliminated at the surface. Further investigation with the TRPL measurement indicates improved hole extraction due to elimination of residual strain, as observed in the samples with the configuration of glass/ perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD. As shown in Supplementary Fig.  12  and Supplementary Table  6 , the average decay time τ avg related to PL quenching was dramatically decreased from 14.6 to 4.9 ns in the strain-free sample, showing the higher quenching rate. It indicates that the strain-free sample exhibits better hole extraction at the interface between absorber and hole transport material (HTM), as compared to that of the tensile strain sample. This result is in accordance with the TPC measurement, showing that modulation of residual tensile strain can accelerate the carrier transfer process. Secondly, we investigated how the carrier recombination process of devices is affected by the residual strain. We conducted the combined measurements of light-intensity-dependent V OC , electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and transient photovoltage decay (TPV). The light-intensity-dependent V OC provides critical insights into the mechanism of recombination processes in solar cells  46  . The corresponding charge carrier recombination process is reflected by the ideality factor of ''n'' as determined by the slope of the V OC versus incident light-intensity according to the equation V OC = E g /qnk B T/qlnJ 0 /J; where q is the elementary charge, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. When the ideality factor n approaches 2, Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) type, trap-assisted recombination dominates. As shown in Fig.  3d , from the relationship between V OC ~ln(I), the ideality factor n are 1.01, 1.55 for the devices with/without tensile strain, respectively. It indicates that trap-assisted SRH recombination is effectively suppressed by reducing the tensile strain that is mainly located at the absorber surface. The alleviated SRH recombination may be attributed to the reduced trap density in strain-free devices, wherein crystal structure homogeneity is achieved. The carrier dynamics across the perovskite/HTM interface upon strain modulation is further examined by EIS. Corresponding Nyquist plots were obtained from solar cells with/without gradient residual strain in dark without applied bias (Fig.  3e ). It shows two separate arcs, equivalent to the resistive and capacitive components of various interfaces  47, 48  . Generally, the first arc in the intermediate-frequency region is associated with the recombination impedance due to the selective contacts or their interface with the perovskite active layer in the device. Here, we mainly focused on the mid-frequency region and found that the recombination impedance increased from 23.69 to 521.10 KΩ when the tensile strain was relaxed. It is consistent with that of the light-intensity-dependent V OC measurement. We further measured the recombination resistance (R rec ), wherein the device was subjected to applied bias ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 V. By fitting with the simple RC equivalent circuit, we exacted the recombination resistance under different bias as shown in Fig.  3f . It is clear that strain-free devices display a larger R rec than that of the tensile-strained one, which indicates that the interfacial charge recombination is suppressed in strain-free device. The reduced recombination loss was further confirmed by TPV measurement  49  , wherein the photovoltage decay time was significantly increased from 4.01 to 10.32 µs (Supplementary Fig.  12  and Supplementary Table  5 ) when tensile strain was released. It is also in agreement with higher V OC observed in the devices with strainfree absorbers. Mechanisms of the effect of strain on photovoltaic properties. The above results unambiguously indicate that the gradient distribution of residual strains directly affects the hole carrier dynamics across the perovskite/HTM interface and thus the device performance. To reveal the underlying mechanism, we performed first-principles calculations to simulate changes of electronic structure and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite films under strained condition. In particular, we chose the (001)-oriented FAPbI 3 perovskite film represented by six-layers Ruddlesden-Popper phase of FAPbI 3 and applied in-plane biaxial strains to it. Since (001) is one of predominate growth direction of perovskite crystals as indicated by the XRD measurements, and FAPbI 3 , MAPbBr 3 and their mixture have similar electronic structures  50, 51  , we expect the above model can reasonably mimic the strained mixed perovskite (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 films in experiment. We embedded the (001) FAPbI 3 film in the vacuum and applied biaxial strains of 1%, 0.5% (compressive) and -0.5%, -1% (tensile), respectively (Supplementary Fig.  13 ). We found that the perpendicular direction exhibit quite small opposite stain components as the rotation of organic FA/MA molecules contributes substantially to strain relaxation. The calculated band structures under tensile, zero, and compressive strains are shown in Fig.  4a, b . One sees that the band gaps of the films show increase with the strain changing from compression, zero-strain, to tension. This agrees with the observed tendency of bandgap change from the ultraviolet (UV)-visible (Vis) absorption and PL measurement (Fig.  4c ). To be noted, the bandgap measured from UV-Vis absorption and PL spectra less than the theoretical value. It is because the theoretical value was calculated with the assumption that the entire lattice structure is subjected to strain state. In our experiment however, the largest strain only locates at the surface region rather than the entire film (Fig.  1c ), wherein quite a large portion of films remain the original bandgap. The tendency can be explained by consideration of the band-edge features of Pb halide perovskites APbX 3 , where the valence band (VB) edge is composed of the strong anti-bonding interaction between Pb-s and X-p orbitals, and the conduction band (CB) edge is predominantly from Pb-p orbital with weak anti-bonding character  51, 52  . With the perovskite film experiencing compressive, zero, to tensile biaxial strain, the in-plane lattice gradually expands, which weakens the Pb-X bonds and thus in principle pulls down both the anti-bonding VB and CB energy levels. However, the VB with strong anti-bonding hybridization is substantially decreased, while the CB is less affected. As the result, the bandgap shows increase from compressive, zero, to tensile strain. This explanation is indeed supported by our calculations as shown in Fig.  4a . Based on the changed electronic structure in the strained perovskite, we attempt to illustrate how residual strains affect hole carrier dynamics in solar cells. Figure  4b  (left panel) shows the evolution of band-edge energies under tensile strains. The CB decreases slightly with increasing strain magnitude, whereas the VB exhibits pronounced downshift. It reveals that strains evolve vertically in the perovskite film, wherein the largest tensile strain is observed at the perovskite/HTM interface. Therefore, the VB bends downward monotonously over the entire perovskite absorber layer, as depicted in the Fig.  4b  (right panel). This VB downward bending has dual effects on the hole carrier dynamics. On one hand, it creates the ''cliff-type'' band alignment by repelling hole carrier energy level away from that of the HTM (Fig.  4b ). This was reported to be unfavorable for hole extraction in Cu(In,Ga)Se 2  53  and perovskite solar cells  [54] [55] [56] [57] [58]  . On the other hand, the hole mobility is possibly affected along the direction of VB downward bending, wherein the hole carrier diffusion suffers from extra hindering force field due to unfavored energy level gradient. As indicated by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement (Fig.  4d ) of the fabricated capacitor-like devices by sandwiching the perovskite films between ITO and Au, the mobilities of the samples with and without tensile strain were calculated to be 7.04 × 10 -4 and 1.02 × 10 -3 cm foot_1  V -1 S -1 , respectively. Indeed, the experimentally observed carrier mobility is improved when tensile strain is released. In short, by eliminating the tensile strain gradient in the perovskite film, the VB is flattened to cancel the ''cliff-type'' band alignment of perovskite absorber/HTM and hole mobility is enhanced simultaneously. It thus favors the charge transport and extraction of photogenerated holes, which suppresses the carrier recombination and leads to the significant improvement in FF and V OC in the corresponding device. In addition to the above two main effects, the tensile strain induced downward shift of valence bands may also result in the deeper defect levels of the perovskite films with the assumption of defect energy levels being not sensitive to strain. This is supported by the experimental observation that the hydrostatic pressure render the shallower defect energy levels of hybrid halide perovskites  59, 60  . As demonstrated above we also observed the prolonged carrier lifetime in the strain-free samples (Supplementary Fig.  14 ). ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""(FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""MAPbI 3"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""20.7"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""(FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""MAPbI 3"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": ""18.7"", ""treated_pce"": ""19.8"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.17"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
969,88_11,"Figure  4 , the mean diameter of PbI2-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) complexes in the reference is measured to be 334.3 nm, while in the case NaF is added, the PbI2-DMSO complex diameter increases to 455.8 nm. We speculate that the stronger interaction between PbI2 and F leads to larger colloidal particles. Interestingly, the morphology of PbI2 films (Supplementary Figure  5 ) is also modified by NaF. Larger PbI2 crystals are formed if NaF is added, and the PbI2 film has a larger number of voids per unit volume, regardless of the annealing process. We attribute the increased void density to the inhomogeneity of the PbI2 precursor solution, caused by larger PbI2 colloidal particle sizes with the introduction of NaF. Such a ""porous PbI2"" film with larger grain size obtained by NaF addition may possess fewer nucleation sites, resulting in a reduced nucleation rate during perovskite formation. Hence the slower nucleation rate in a PbI2 film in the presence of NaF, results in a larger grain size in the perovskite film, if the growth rate is fixed, consistent with other reports  3  . perovskite semiconductor, the defect activation energy (Ea) can be calculated by the trap state energy level (ET) and the perovskite VBM energy level (EVBM) (Ea = ET -EVBM). Ea and the characteristic transition angular frequency (ω0) can be formulated in the following equation: ω0 = βT 2 exp(- 𝐸 𝑎 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 ), where β is a temperature dependent parameter, T is the temperature and kB is the Boltzmann's constant. The derivative of the capacitance spectrum can be used to determine ω0. According to this relation, the value of Ea can be obtained from the slope of the graph by fitting the Arrhenius formula: ln( ), where Vbi is the builtin potential, W is the depletion width, q is the elementary charge, C is the capacitance, and ω is the applied angular frequency. The Mott-Schottky junction was obtained by capacitancevoltage measurement, which was analyzed to obtain Vbi and W. According to the depletion approximation  12  , the C, Vbi, and W at the junction can be expressed in the relation： , where A is the active area, ε is the static permittivity of perovskite, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, N is the apparent doping profile in the depleted layer, and V is the applied bias. A Mott-Schottky plot ： O rganic-inorganic halide perovskites (ABX 3 , where A is an organic cation, such as methylamine (MA) or formamidine (FA); B is lead or tin; X is a halide ion) have emerged as exciting new materials for solar cells due to their unique combination of properties, such as strong light absorption 1 , superb charge carrier mobility  2  and low-cost fabrication  3  . Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have risen from 3.8% to a certified 23.7%  1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]  , close to that of crystalline silicon solar cells. In spite of the unparalleled growth in photovoltaic performance, the industrial application of PSCs is hampered by instability issues. One of the main sources of the instability is the defect chemistry of perovskites. In particular, owing to the ionic nature of perovskite materials  11  , as well as their solution-based fabrication processes, numerous defects are formed at the surfaces and grain boundaries of polycrystalline perovskite films  [12] [13] [14] [15]  . In particular, point defects such as halide anion vacancies and organic cation vacancies are easily produced in perovskite materials due to their low formation energies  [16] [17] [18]  . Although these defects mostly create shallow electronic levels near the band edges  8, 19  , they still have profound unwanted effects on carrier dynamics and the I-V hysteresis of PSCs  [20] [21] [22] [23]  . Even more importantly, such defects are believed to play an important role in the chemical degradation of the perovskite material and of the interfaces with the charge transport layers, leading to long-term instability of the PSCs  [24] [25] [26] [27]  . Ion vacancies diffuse into the crystallites, and promote the diffusion of cations and anions to the surfaces and grain boundaries. Decomposition reactions at these locations, such as evaporation of the organic species MA or FA, then lead to degradation of the material. Therefore, control and mitigation of the number of organic cation or halide anion vacancies has become an important research direction towards more efficient and stable PSCs. As organic components such as MA or FA easily evaporate from the surface during the thermal annealing process  11, 28  , thereby creating organic cation vacancies, one way to suppress the formation of such vacancies is to use excess MA/FA during or after the perovskite annealing process  29  . Another approach to prevent the formation of organic cation vacancies is to create a two-dimensional layered structure by introducing a small amount of larger organic molecules, such as phenethylamine, polyethylenimine and trifluoroethylamine, which are difficult to evaporate  30  . Similar methods have also been reported to be effective for passivating or suppressing halide anion vacancies  8, 31, 32  . Previously, iodide ions have been introduced into the organic cation solution, which decreases the concentration of iodide vacancies  8  . Elsewhere, guanidinium, an organic ion that probably forms hydrogen bonds, has been used to suppress the formation of iodide vacancies  31  . Addition of KI to perovskites has also demonstrated a positive effect of small alkali ions on Defects play an important role in the degradation processes of hybrid halide perovskite absorbers, impeding their application for solar cells. Among all defects, halide anion and organic cation vacancies are ubiquitous, promoting ion diffusion and leading to thin-film decomposition at surfaces and grain boundaries. Here, we employ fluoride to simultaneously passivate both anion and cation vacancies, by taking advantage of the extremely high electronegativity of fluoride. We obtain a power conversion efficiency of 21.46% (and a certified 21.3%-efficient cell) in a device based on the caesium, methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA) triple-cation perovskite (Cs 0.05 FA 0.54 MA 0.41 )Pb(I 0.98 Br 0.02 ) 3 treated with sodium fluoride. The device retains 90% of its original power conversion efficiency after 1,000 h of operation at the maximum power point. With the help of firstprinciples density functional theory calculations, we argue that the fluoride ions suppress the formation of halide anion and organic cation vacancies, through a unique strengthening of the chemical bonds with the surrounding lead and organic cations. passivating I -vacancies, which consequently improves the efficiency and stability of PSCs  [33] [34] [35]  . In addition, small ions (Cl and Cd) were doped into the perovskite lattice to suppress the formation of halide vacancies via lattice strain relaxation  26  . Although significant advances have been made in defect engineering of the bulk and grain boundaries of perovskites, most strategies focus on passivating or preventing only one type of defect, either the organic cation or the halide anion vacancy. Only recently, choline chloride was used to passivate both positive and negative charged defects by quaternary ammonium and halide ions  11  . This 'charged components compensation' provides a possible method of multi-vacancy defects passivation. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""CsFAMA"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""formamidinium (FA)"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1,000"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""21.46"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.9""}}"
986,5_4," PROGRESS AND POTENTIAL Despite their appealing characteristics, successful implementation of 2D/3D heterojunctions in monolithic perovskite/silicon tandems remains a challenge. This is because the 2D/3D heterojunction needs to be integrated into the transparent front contact. In 2D perovskite slabs, high exciton binding energies can impede effective free charge generation and collection at typical device operating conditions. This work demonstrates a successful method for passivating the perovskite/HTL interface in an n-i-p tandem solar cell configuration with a 2D/3D heterojunction, where the HTL is at the sunward side. Specifically, iso-BA-based 2D passivation at this interface is used, which allows effective charge transfer without charge accumulation. The iso-BA passivation resulted in an improvement in both the V OC and J SC of the bifacial perovskite/ silicon tandem solar cells. These findings are a significant step toward advancing bifacial perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. OLA + ), etc.  8, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]  Despite these attractive features, 2D/3D heterojunctions have yet to be implemented successfully in monolithic perovskite/silicon tandems. To date, this has not been achieved, as in this device structure, the 2D/3D heterojunction has to be part of the transparent front contact, which imposes additional constraints on processing compatibility and requires broadband transparency and unhindered charge collection. For 2D perovskites, the latter may be of particular concern due to the associated high exciton binding energies (E b s; in the range of hundreds of meV) of the phase-pure 2D perovskite slabs,  8, 16, 17  which impedes effective free charge generation and collection upon illumination at typical device operating temperatures.  18  Here, we overcome this challenge in a 2-fold way for n-i-p tandem solar cells, which have their hole-collecting contact at the sunward side. Firstly, we tune the dimensionality n of the 2D perovskite slab (n refers to the number of octahedral sheets in the 2D perovskite slab).  8, 15, 19  We apply different isomers of the BA + spacer cation-namely n-BAI and iso-BAI (which are linear and branched molecules, as shown in Figure  S1 )-which allows for tailoring of the 2D crystal formation and thus their optoelectronic properties.  17, 20  Secondly, we form a discontinuous 2D/ 3D heterojunction on the perovskite surface, which also helps to efficiently collect free charges at the perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interface. We investigated the formation of Ruddlesden-Popper 2D perovskite crystals and found that a post-solution treatment of the 3D perovskite with BAI molecules results in the formation of discontinuous 2D crystals on the 3D perovskite surface. Photoluminescence (PL) and photoelectron spectroscopy measurements revealed that the shape of the BA + molecule (linear or branched) alters the dimensionality n of the 2D perovskite crystals. When inserted at the perovskite/HTL interface of n-i-p perovskite single-junction and n-i-p bifacial monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem devices, we found that the iso-BAI passivation systematically enhances the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) and the short-circuit current density (J SC ). The former is due to a reduced 2D/3D interfacial trap state density, and the latter suggests efficient hole extraction at this interface.  21  We also implemented such 2D/3D heterojunctions in the front contacts of bifacial perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. As reported by Lehr et al., to maximize the energy yield of bifacial perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with albedo values of practical relevance, narrower band-gap (<1.60 eV) perovskite compositions are required.  [22] [23] [24]  For instance, bifacial perovskite/silicon tandems located on grass ground can yield 24%-38% more energy compared with monofacial single-junction c-Si solar cells if 1.55 eV perovskite top cells are used.  23, 24  Here, we used textured silicon heterojunction bottom cells and solution-processed formamidinium (FA)-and pure-iodide-based 3D perovskites, FA(MA)PbI 3 , as the top-cell absorber. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""iso-butylamine iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
988,5_7," Solution processing of perovskite films on textured Si To apply our BAI passivation to perovskite/silicon bifacial tandem devices, we first adapted two-step FA(MA)PbI 3 perovskite processing to textured Si substrates, which required a different optimization protocol than the one used for flat substrates (Figures  S15-S18 ).  35  We obtained highly crystalline perovskite films with vertically oriented grains extending through the entire film thickness using our two-step interdiffusion method on the micron-scale pyramidal textured surfaces as confirmed via cross-sectional scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) micrographs and static X-ray diffraction/scattering measurements (Figures  3, S19 , S20, and S26). Interestingly, we discovered that the crystal orientation in 3D perovskite films deposited on flat substrates (glass) and textured silicon is different, as indicated by the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) plots shown in Figure  S19 . A preference for out-of-plane orientation (with super-lattice formation) was observed in the case of depositions on flat substrates, in line with our previous observations.  29  On the other hand, a diffraction ring associated with the (100) reflection of the perovskite phase indicates a predominantly random orientation when the deposition was performed on textured silicon. We also probed the predominantly parallel-to-the-substrate-oriented 2D perovskite formation both for linear and branched BA + molecules (Figures  3A  and S21 ). Furthermore, we found that the formation of 2D perovskite crystals on planar and textured surfaces was slightly altered. As shown in Figure  3A , iso-BA-based 2D perovskite crystals exhibited Pb 2 I 7 (020) and Pb 4 I 13 (060) planes, while n-BAI passivation resulted in dominant Pb 3 I 10 (020) planes, in addition to Pb 2 I 7 (020) planes on the perovskite surface (Figure  3A ). The change in the FA(MA)PbI 3 perovskite crystal orientation at the surface is critical to tuning the dimensionality of the 2D layers. Next, we investigated the surface electronic structure and stoichiometry of the perovskite films following BAI passivation. For the bare FA(MA)PbI 3 perovskite, we observed the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) at $1.16 and À0.39 eV, respectively, with respect to the Fermi level (E F ), resulting in an E g of $1.55 eV, using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and low-energy inverse photoemission spectroscopy (LE-IPES) spectroscopy (further details of the analysis are provided in the supplemental information).  36  E F is found to be relatively closer to the CBM, and the work function (WF) was measured to be 4.20 eV, in line with earlier studies of the influence of an underlying n-type substrate on the position of E F in the perovskite layer (Figures  3B  and 3C ).  37, 38  The n-BAI-and iso-BAI-modified films demonstrated increases of the band-gap E g at the surface of the perovskite to 1.90 and 2.20 eV, respectively. This would result in an apparent straddling type 1 band offset with respect to the underlying 3D perovskite bulk, with both band edges moving away from E F and a decreasing WF (Figure  S23 ). For a mixed 2D/3D system, this is consistent with earlier reports of the direct assessment of the energy levels in pure 2D BA 2 PbI 4 perovskite films, showing a band gap of 2.7 eV and a WF of 3.8 eV.  39  Furthermore, high-resolution X-ray photoelectron specotroscopy (XPS) spectra revealed the stoichiometry of the perovskite layers, indicating a (1:2.8) PbI 3 character for the control and 1:3.45 and 1:3.5 for n-BAI and iso-BAI, respectively (Figures  S24  and S25 ). These values are in between the stoichiometry of n = 2 and n = 3 layered perovskites and are consistent with the optical and structural analysis. Further, we investigated the distribution of 2D slabs at the surface and grain boundaries using TEM. High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) imaging revealed that the iso-BA-based 2D perovskite crystals on the surface were located within the first tens of nm of the 3D perovskite, while at the grain boundaries, the penetration of the 2D crystals was up to 100 nm (Figures  3D  and S27 ). n-i-p bifacial perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells Next, we investigated the charge carrier extraction dynamics at the perovskite/HTL interface using TRPL spectroscopy and excitation from the HTL side to mimic the n-ip tandem configuration (Figures  S28  and 4A ). The differential lifetime (t diff ) of the stacks was calculated according to the relation t diff ðtÞ = À dlnðF PL Þ = dt À 1 , where F PL is the PL photon flux.  40  The log-log plot shows a transition from gradually increasing differential lifetimes to a plateau, where the charge transfer concluded and first-order recombination started to dominate the carrier dynamics. As expected, iso-BAI passivation leads to less interfacial recombination without lowering the charge extraction rate. However, the n-BAI-passivated sample showed charge carrier accumulation, even though all samples were measured in the same charge carrier generation regime. Zheng et al. reported that the existence of bulk 3D phases embedded in iso-BA-based pure 2D perovskites can facilitate the transfer of charges confined in 2D phases and subsequent transport with higher carrier mobility and lower recombination rates.  21  Thus, we conclude that the shorter spacer (iso-BA) can enhance the charge (or energy) transfer rate by reducing the charge accumulation in thinner quantum wells via tunneling through the barrier induced by the spacer cations.  20, 21  We fabricated n-i-p perovskite/silicon tandem devices with and without iso-BAI passivation, whose device structures are shown in Figure  4C . Importantly, we intentionally selected here the n-i-p device architecture aiming to minimize parasitic absorption losses at the front side of the devices. Indeed, spiro-TTB/VO x /IZO holeselective contacts (in n-i-p devices) were earlier found to reduce parasitic absorption compared with C 60 /SnO x /IZO electron-selective contacts (as used in most p-i-n tandem devices).  41  When we adapted iso-BAI passivation to tandem solar cells, we did not observe significant changes in the reflectance of the device due to the 2D passivation (Figure  4B ). However, we found an important increase in the V OC of around 70 mV compared with the control device as well as a reduced hysteresis in the current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics (Figure  S29A ). We evaluated the performance of the bifacial tandem solar cell (expressed through its power generation density [PGD] to account for its bifaciality) in our custom-designed bifacial tandem solar cell setup as shown in Figure  4D , which allows controlled illumination of both device sides, yet using only a single light source. We achieved various albedo values by using two identical Ag mirrors positioned at a 90 angle with respect to each other, and we lowered the rear-side illumination intensity with neutral-density filters. Here, instead of albedo, we use the term ''rear irradiance'' (mW cm À2 ) to visualize the power density of the rear-side illumination on the silicon subcell. We measured a PGD >27 mW cm À2 for iso-BAI-passivated devices (with as low as $16 mW cm À2 of rear irradiance, i.e., albedo of 16% -PGD BiFi16 = 27.10 mW cm À2 ), whereas the control samples gave only 23.8 mW cm À2 . However, for real applications, we found that increasing the rear irradiance above 16 mW cm À2 did not further enhance the current, which saturated at 22.8 mA cm À2 , thus closely matching the integrated current of the perovskite top cell determined from the EQE spectra. This demonstrates the high PGD potential of our devices even at moderate albedo values (Figures  4E  and 4G ). Interestingly, besides the V OC improvement, we observed a consistent J SC enhancement for the iso-BAI-passivated devices (Figure  S29B ). Both single-junction (1-sun illumination, from the ETL side) and perovskite/silicon tandem (1-sun illumination, from the HTL side) solar cells exhibited higher current densities with iso-BAI-based 2D passivation. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""indium tin oxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""iso-butylamine iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""22.1"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.135"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""butylammonium lead iodide"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""buckminsterfullerene"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""iso-butylamine iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""22.1"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.135"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
1009,140_10," Alta LG NREL NREL (MM) Achieving both high efficiency and long-term stability is the key to the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs)  1, 2  . However, the diversity of perovskite (ABX 3 ) compositions and phases makes it challenging to fabricate high-quality films  [3] [4] [5]  . Perovskite formation relies on the reaction between AX and BX 2 , whereas most conventional methods for film-growth regulation are based solely on the interaction with the BX 2 component. Herein, we demonstrate an alternative approach to modulate reaction kinetics by anion-π interaction between AX and hexafluorobenzene (HFB). Notably, these two approaches are independent but work together to establish 'dual-site regulation', which achieves a delicate control over the reaction between AX and BX 2 without unwanted intermediates. The resultant formamidinium lead halides (FAPbI 3 ) films exhibit fewer defects, redshifted absorption and high phase purity without detectable nanoscale δ phase. Consequently, we achieved PSCs with power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 26.07% for a 0.08-cm 2 device (25.8% certified) and 24.63% for a 1-cm 2 device. The device also kept 94% of its initial PCE after maximum power point (MPP) tracking for 1,258 h under full-spectrum AM 1.5 G sunlight at 50 ± 5 °C. This method expands the range of chemical interactions that occur in perovskite precursors by exploring anion-π interactions and highlights the importance of the AX component as a new and effective working site to improved photovoltaic devices with high quality and phase purity.

1038,28_16," Plane The first relates to the volatility of organic cations in methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA) lead halide systems, which promotes material degradation  (7) (8) (9) . The second arises from their polymorphic nature, whereby a roomtemperature (RT) stable black perovskite structure is not guaranteed  (10) . Implementing Cs + cations (i.e., CsPbI3) has allowed for both high solar cell conversion efficiencies (above 17%  (11) ) and improved environmental stability  (12, 13) . However, regarding phase stability, single-cation FA/CsPbI3 systems form a thermodynamically stable yellow RT δ-phase (non-perovskite) before undergoing reversible high-temperature phase transitions to their optically active black perovskite phases; α (cubic), β (tetragonal) and γ (orthorhombic). The thermal phase relations for CsPbI3 is depicted in Fig.  1A , with the relative transitions shown in Fig.  1B . The term ""black"" is used to define collectively the (pseudo-)cubic phases, as they typically exhibit similar optoelectronic properties. At RT, the black phase is unstable  (14, 15) . As seen in Fig.  1A , the black α-CsPbI3 perovskite can, depending on conditions, pass through a variety of different restructuring paths. The thermodynamically preferred cooling path (path 2) (  16 ) is mediated by the series of structural distortions (Fig.  1B ). When the requisite sample preparation and cooling rates are used, a RT black phase can persist (paths 3 and 4 in Fig.  1A ) in the form of a pseudo-cubic phase. A metastable black phase will only survive at RT when the strong driving force to transform into the yellow phase (path 5) is successfully countered. For example, upon mild reheating (60 -100°C), the metastable black phase (path 6) will normally turn yellow  (14, 15, 17)  once its saddle point is energetically overcome. Thus, the problem is how to form a stable black CsPbI3 perovskite for near-RT device operation. Recent findings offer a range of solutions, each following at least one of three general approaches: (i) forming nanocrystals (18-21), (ii) surface functionalization  (22) , and (iii) compositional tuning  (23) (24) (25) . Interestingly, when forming of a perovskite-substrate heterojunction in thin-film device architectures, tensile strain was recently shown to manifest at RT because of the large mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients (αT) of the perovskite layer (~50×10 -6 K -1 for lead iodide-based perovskites) and typical optically transparent substrates (both ITO and glass reside between 4 ×10 -6 to 9×10 -6 K -1 ). By definition, strain will push the competing perovskite phases into a relative state of thermodynamic unequilibrium  (26) (27) (28) . Within this context, strain engineering can favor formation of a desired phase or can even lead to new phases  (29) . For example, the strain introduced into CsPbI3 nanocrystals processed with hydroiodic acid  (28)  has been connected to improved stability. 1 Centre for Surface Chemistry and Catalysis, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, Leuven, 3001, Belgium. 2 Department of Chemistry, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, Leuven, 3001, Belgium. 3 Swiss-Norwegian Beamlines at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, 71 Avenue des Martyrs, F-38000 Grenoble, France. 4 Department of Chemistry, Western Washington University, 516 High Street, Bellingham WA 98225, USA. 5 Center for Molecular Modeling (CMM), Ghent University, Technologiepark 46, 9052 Zwijnaarde, Belgium. 6 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, 35 St George Street, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A4, Canada. 7 Departamento de Química Física, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, 02071 Albacete, Spain. 8 NCD-SWEET Beamline, ALBA Synchrotron Light Source, 08290, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Barcelona, Spain. 9 Polymer Chemistry and Materials, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, Leuven, 3001, Belgium. 10  The high-temperature all-inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite black phase is metastable relative to its yellow nonperovskite phase, at room temperature. Since only the black phase is optically active, this represents an impediment for the use of CsPbI3 in optoelectronic devices. We report the use of substrate clamping and biaxial strain to render stable, at room temperature, black phase CsPbI3 thin films. We used synchrotronbased grazing incidence wide angle x-ray scattering to track the introduction of crystal distortions and strain-driven texture formation within black CsPbI3 thin films when they were cooled following annealing at 330°C. The thermal stability of black CsPbI3 thin films is vastly improved by the strained interface, a response verified by ab initio thermodynamic modelling. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Cesium lead iodide"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}"
1081,65_3,"Three-dimensional (3D) hybrid perovskites of the form (MA) [PbX 3 ] (MA = CH 3 NH 3 + ; X = Cl, Br, or I) have recently emerged as promising absorbers for solar cells.  [1]  The first reported perovskite solar cell with (MA)[PbI 3 ] showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.81 %.  [1a]  Rapid material and device optimization has led to PCEs exceeding 15 % in just a few years.  [2]  Though progress in device efficiencies has been remarkable, the lead-halide perovskites have two main drawbacks: the toxicity of the water-soluble source of lead and the instability of the material to atmospheric moisture. Recently, the lead perovskite was replaced by the significantly less toxic tin analogue in solar cells with efficiencies of up to approximately 6 %.  [3]  However, the moisture sensitivity of the lead perovskite has not yet been addressed. Motivated by our observations that the structurally related two-dimensional (2D) perovskites readily formed high-quality films that appeared more resistant to humidity than the 3D analogues, we sought to assess if the layered materials could function as solar-cell absorbers. Herein, we report the structure of the layered perovskite (PEA) 2 (MA) 2 [Pb 3 I 10 ] (1; PEA = C 6 H 5 (CH 2 ) 2 NH 3 + ) that can act as an absorber in a solar cell with an open-circuit voltage of 1.18 V and a PCE of 4.73 %. Although our first-generation devices have lower efficiencies than current solar cells with 3D perovskite absorbers, the layered structure brings distinct advantages. In contrast to (MA)[PbI 3 ] (2), high-quality films of 1 can be obtained through one-step spin coating under ambient conditions without annealing. Films of 1 are also more resistant to moisture compared to 2, and devices containing 1 can be fabricated under humid conditions. Importantly, the layered structure affords greater tunability, which may provide additional routes for material optimization. Layered perovskites can be structurally derived from the 3D analogue by slicing along specific crystallographic planes.  [4]  The interlayer separation and thickness of the inorganic layers can be controlled through the choice of organic cations.  [5]  The inorganic layers of most layered perovskites comprise a single sheet (n = 1) of corner-sharing metal-halide octahedra sandwiching layers of organic cations.  [4]  These 2D materials do not have electronic properties typically associated with good solar-cell absorbers. Along with larger bandgaps compared to the 3D analogue (n = 1), the spatial confinement of the 2D structure and dielectric mismatch between organic and inorganic layers lead to strongly bound excitons with low mobility.  [6]  Such tightly bound excitons are difficult to dissociate into free carriers at room temperature and the localized charge carriers are unlikely to reach the electron/hole selective contacts in a typical solarcell geometry. To access the more favorable electronic properties of the 3D structure, we sought an intermediate structure between the n = 1 and n = 1 materials. We synthesized the n = 3 member of the series (PEA) 2 (MA) nÀ1 [Pb n I 3n+1 ] (n = number of Pb-I sheets in each inorganic layer), by combining (PEA)I, (MA)I, and PbI 2 in a 2:2:3 stoichiometric ratio in a solvent mixture of nitromethane/acetone. Slow solvent evaporation afforded dark red crystals of (PEA) 2 (MA) 2 [Pb 3 I 10 ] (1), the first crystallographically characterized n = 3 lead perovskite (Figure  1 ). Decreasing the dimensionality of the inorganic components from the 3D structure causes an increase in the bandgap and the exciton binding energy. The reported n = 1 and 2 structures have bandgaps of 2.57 and 2.32 eV, respectively, and exciton absorption bands at 2.35 and 2.15 eV, respectively.  [7]  Their exciton binding energies can be estimated as the difference between bandgap and exciton absorption energies to be 220 and 170 meV for the n = 1 and 2 structures, respectively.  [7]  Absorbance measurements of 1 show the exciton band at 2.06 eV, which lies close to an estimated bandgap of approximately 2.1 eV, indicating that the exciton binding energy is significantly smaller and close to the value of 2 (circa 40 meV).  [6]  The bandgap of 1 is larger than that of 2 (1.61 eV)  [8]  and larger than the ideal value of 1.34 eV calculated by Shockley and Queisser for the highest efficiency obtainable by a single-junction solar cell (circa 34 %).  [9]  However, 1 can absorb a significant fraction of the solar spectrum to afford a theoretical PCE of approximately 20 %. The bandgap of 1 is also close to the ideal value (1.9 eV) for the higher bandgap absorber in a dual-absorber tandem device,  [10]  which can exceed the Shockley-Queisser limit.  [11]  High-quality films of 1 can be deposited from precursor solutions through one-step spin coating. Similar processing of 2 does not afford continuous films (see Figure  S1  in the Supporting Information). The layered structure of 1 likely aids film formation: unlike 2 that crystallizes as rhombic dodecahedra at room temperature,  [12]  1 forms plates (Figure  S2 ). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of films of 1 show reflections indicating a preferential orientation of crystallites (Figure  2 , top). To confirm the n = 3 perovskite structure in these films, we scraped the films into a powder, loaded it into a glass capillary, and obtained unoriented PXRD patterns (Figure  2 , middle). These unoriented PXRD data show the reflections calculated from the single-crystal Xray structure of 1 (Figure  2 , bottom). The absorption spectrum of films of 1 shows exciton absorption bands at 2.06, 2.19, and 2.41 eV (Figure  S4 ). We assign the peak at 2.06 eV to the n = 3 material. The peaks at 2.19 and 2.41 eV match the exciton absorption energies of the n = 2 and n = 1 structures, respectively.  [5c, 13]  These phases are not visible in the PXRD patterns of films of 1, suggesting defect layers of less than n = 3 within the structure. Small amounts of n = 1 and 2 phases can show in the absorption spectrum because of the high oscillator strength of excitons in these materials.  [13]  Slight shoulders at 1.94 and 1.87 eV may be caused by trace amounts of n = 4 and 5 phases, respectively. The absorption spectrum does not show peaks corresponding to 2 (Figure  S4 ). When excited at 2.54 eV, the emission spectrum of 1 shows a peak at 1.68 eV (Figure  S5 ). This energy lies between the emission maxima for 2D perovskites with lower values of n (n = 1 at 2.36 eV  [13]  and n = 2 at 2.15 eV  [14]  ) and the 3D perovskite (n = 1 at 1.58 eV). A weak emission at 2.36 eV is likely because of photoluminescence (PL) from n = 1 layers. Devices utilizing 1 as the absorber were constructed employing TiO 2 as the electron-selective contact and 2,2',7,-7'-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as the hole-selective contact. Films of 1 were deposited from a N,N-dimethylformamide solution containing stoichiometric quantities of PbI 2 , (MA)I, and (PEA)I using a single spin-coating step. Importantly, devices containing 1 can be processed in humid air, which does not affect film quality or device performance. In contrast, devices with 2 must be processed under low-humidity levels for optimal performance. High-quality films of 2 also require high-temperature thermal evaporation  [2b]  or multistep deposition methods, such as heat-assisted conversion of spincoated PbI 2 films to the perovskite through exposure to (MA)I solution  [15]  or vapor,  [2a]  or simultaneous deposition of PbCl 2 and (MA)I and high-temperature annealing.  [16]  A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a fully constructed device is shown in Figure  3  A. Typical thicknesses of TiO 2 , 1, spiro-OMeTAD, and gold layers are 50, 425, 125, and 75 nm, respectively. We obtained current-voltage (JV) curves of these devices using simulated AM1.5G solar illumination (Figure  3 B ). The open-circuit voltages (V oc ) for these devices  routinely exceed 1.0 V; the best device shows a value of 1.18 V. Owing to the larger bandgap of the 2D material, these V oc values are higher than for cells containing 2 (highest reported V oc = 0.924-1.07 V).  [2a-c, 15]  The increase in V oc value of approximately 0.1 eV correlates well with the measured 0.1 eV increase in the peak PL energy (Figure  S5 ), indicating that carriers are extracted from the same energy levels where radiative recombination occurs. The JV curve characteristics of these devices are sensitive to measurement speed. Faster scan rates afforded a maximum current density of 11.53 mA cm À2 , a V oc value of 1.21 V, and a PCE of 7.02 %, but the forward and reverse scans showed a large hysteresis (Figure  S8 ). Similar effects have been detected in thin-film devices with 2.  [17]  To minimize these effects, the current densities were measured at each voltage after a delay period (70 s) to allow the current to approach steady-state conditions (Figure  S9 ). Even at this slow measurement rate, there is a slight overestimation of photocurrent near the maximum-power point as a result of slow, capacitive effects. We therefore fit the data to the characteristic solar-cell equation (Figure  S9 ) in order to obtain more reliable values of 0.60 for the fill factor (FF) and 4.73 % for the PCE. The current density under short-circuit conditions (J sc ) is 6.72 mA cm À2 . The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum matches the profile of the absorption spectrum of 1 (Figure  S10 ). The integrated current from the EQE spectrum yields a net current density of 7.47 mA cm À2 , corroborating the J sc value obtained through steady-state measurements. We calculate an internal quantum efficiency of 70 %, assuming 10 % parasitic absorbance by non-absorber components of the device. This indicates that charge extraction could be limited, caused likely by the layered structure of 1, which has no direct path between adjacent inorganic layers. Low-dimensional inorganic materials have previously been effectively used in photovoltaic devices,  [18]  and device optimization should afford improvements in J sc values and overall efficiency. Upon exposure to ambient humidity at room temperature, opaque black films of 2 convert into a translucent yellow solid.  [12b, 19]  Finished devices containing 2 can be encapsulated to avoid exposure to water. However, inherent stability to moisture will likely be necessary for large-scale manufacture or for achieving the long lifetimes required for broad commercialization. To compare the stability of 1 and 2 to moisture, we exposed spin-coated films of both materials to humidity-controlled environments. Because direct spin coating results in poor-quality, discontinuous films of 2 (denoted 2 a), we also formed higher-quality films of (MA)[PbI 3 ] (denoted 2 b) by depositing a 1:3 molar ratio of PbCl 2 :(MA)I and annealing the films at 100 8C.  [16]  All films were exposed to a relative humidity level of 52 % for up to approximately 40 days and their PXRD patterns were periodically recorded (Figure  4 ). Upon humidity exposure, the PXRD patterns of 2 a and 2 b show a new phase after circa 4-5 days, which can be indexed to the PXRD pattern of PbI 2 (Figure  S11 ). These new reflections completely dominate the PXRD patterns after approximately 40 days. Absorption spectra of 2 a and 2 b show a decrease in absorbance near the bandgap and an increase in absorbance above 2.4 eV (Figures  S12  and 13 ) as the higherbandgap PbI 2 phase grows as yellow patches on the films (Figure  S14 ). In contrast, the PXRD pattern of 1 does not show additional reflections over a period of 46 days of humidity exposure and the absorption spectra show no significant changes over this time (Figure  S15 ). We show that a layered Pb-I perovskite can act as a solarcell absorber. The n = 3 perovskite takes an intermediate  position between n = 1 perovskites with strongly bound excitons and n = 1 perovskites with weakly bound excitons. Strongly bound excitons in n = 1 Pb-I perovskites lead to green PL,  [20]  and green electroluminescence,  [14, 21]  and we recently reported on broadband white PL from Pb-Br perovskites.  [22]  In contrast, weakly bound excitons and shallow trap states could contribute to the unusually long carrier diffusion lengths seen in n = 1 perovskites.  [23]  These dramatic changes in electronic properties as a function of the structural evolution from n = 1 to n = 1 are of both fundamental and technological interest. Solar cells containing 1 display PCEs up to 4.73 %. Though devices containing 2 have exceeded PCEs of 15 %,  [2a-c]  their moisture sensitivity remains a concern for large-scale device fabrication or their long-term use. The layered structure of 1 aids the formation of high-quality films that show greater moisture resistance compared to 2. The larger bandgap of 1 also affords a higher V OC value of 1.18 V compared to devices with 2. Further improvements in material structure and device engineering, including making appropriate electronic contact with the anisotropic inorganic sheets, should increase the PCEs of these devices. In particular, higher values of n as single-phase materials or as mixtures may allow for lower bandgaps and higher carrier mobility in the inorganic layers while the organic layers provide additional tunability. For example, hydrophobic fluorocarbons could increase moisture stability, conjugated organic layers could facilitate charge transport, and organic photosensitizers could improve the absorption properties of the material. We are focused on manipulating this extraordinarily versatile platform through synthetic design. ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""methylammonium lead iodide"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""4.73"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.18"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""methylammonium lead iodide"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""4.73"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.18"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
1102,108_6," Stability test for solar cells For the thermal stability test, unencapsulated perovskite solar cells were placed in an oven at 85 ℃ under 15 to 25% relative humidity (RH) in the dark and in an ambient air. Unencapsulated perovskite solar cells having CuPC as hole transport layer were placed on hotplate kept at 150 ℃ in 15 to 25% RH and in ambient air. The stability test at continuous maximum power point operation under 1 Sun, AM 1.5G illumination was carried out in an ambient condition by fixing the voltage at VMPP and then tracking the current output.  where D is the crystallite size, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, β is the corrected full-width at halfmaximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak, and θ is the diffraction angle), C. full-width at halfmaximum at (001) plane of powders and thin films.          Table  S1 . Carrier lifetime with different x values in (FAPbI3)1-x(MC)x (here MC is an abbreviation that means that MDA 2+ and Cs + are mixed in the equimolar fraction). High-efficiency lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been fabricated with a-phase formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) stabilized with multiple cations. The alloyed cations greatly affect the bandgap, carrier dynamics, and stability, as well as lattice strain that creates unwanted carrier trap sites. We substituted cesium (Cs) and methylenediammonium (MDA) cations in FA sites of FAPbI 3 and found that 0.03 mol fraction of both MDA and Cs cations lowered lattice strain, which increased carrier lifetime and reduced Urbach energy and defect concentration. The best-performing PSC exhibited power conversion efficiency >25% under 100 milliwatt per square centimeter AM 1.5G illumination (24.4% certified efficiency). Unencapsulated devices maintained >80% of their initial efficiency after 1300 hours in the dark at 85°C. T he lead halide perovskite structure is represented by the general chemical formula APbX 3 , where A denotes an organic ammonium or inorganic cation such as methylammonium (MA + ), formamidinium (FA + ), or Cs + ; and X denotes a halide (I -, Br -, or Cl -). Corner-shared PbX 6 octahedra form a cuboctahedral cage to accommodate the A cation that satisfies the steric requirements and stabilize three-dimensional perovskite structure. The optoelectrical properties of APbX 3 perovskites are dominated by the inorganic lead halide lattice, while the cation in the A site contributes to the stabilization of the structure  (1) . Therefore, the bandgap of the perovskite depends primarily on halides and is relatively less affected by the A cation. Thus, the factors affecting device performance, such as dielectric properties (2) and distortion (3), can be easily controlled by the proper selection or combination of A cations without compromising the bandgap. Although MA + , FA + , and Cs + are the most well studied A cations for the APbI 3 perovskite with the narrowest bandgap capable of absorbing a wide range of sunlight (4-7), it is difficult to use APbI 3 with FA + and Cs + cations in a solar cell because it is thermodynamically unstable at room temperature and crystallizes into the d-phase (a very wide bandgap nonperovskite) from the a-phase  (6, 8, 9) . Although the structural stabilization of lead halide perovskite with various cations was explained by the Goldschmidt tolerance (t) factor [t ¼ r A þ r I ¼ ffiffi ffi 2 p ðr Pb þ r I Þ , where r A , r Pb , and r I are the radii of the A cation, Pb cation, and I anion, respectively] (1, 10), it can be achieved by distorting PbI 6 octahedron or by N-H⋯I hydrogen bonding with organic cations (1). Currently, high-efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are predominately fabricated with FAPbI 3 , for which phase stabilization is achieved by controlling t through the synergistic entropic effect of mixing MA + , Cs + , and Br -  (5, (11) (12) (13) (14) . However, as the composition of FAPbI 3 is changed to stabilize the perovskite structure of the a-phase, the bandgap may widen. Moreover, the local strain can increase because of the distortion of the ideal structure, including tilting, deformation, expansion, and shrinkage of the octahedral network  (15) (16) (17) . The residual strain in halide perovskites substantially affects the performance of PSCs by reducing structural stability  (18, 19) , decreasing the carrier mobility  (20) , and suppressing atomic vacancies  (21) . Lattice strain was directly related to increased defect concentration and nonradiative recombination, which is associated with the efficiency  (22) . Huang and colleagues reported the reduction of residual strain by thermal annealing of perovskite films produced by a solution process enhanced the intrinsic stability of the films under illumination by decreasing ion migration  (23) . Chen and colleagues  (24)  demonstrated that a-FAPbI 3 can be stabilized by growing a single crystal on the substrate and that the bandgap and hole mobility changed when a compressive strain was applied. Alloyed mixed-halide perovskites are nonuniform because of the phase separation through segregation of ions, which causes local lattice mismatch and leads to residual deformation. The efficiency was increased by improving carrier transport and extraction at the interface of the perovskite absorber and hole transport material (HTM) by controlling the vertically strained gradient with flipped annealing method  (24) . Xue et al.  (25)  observed that the stability considerably improved with added compressive strain by using an HTM with a high coefficient of thermal expansion for the perovskite film. Tsai et al.  (26)  reported improved PSC device performance under continuous light illumination owing to the uniform lattice expansion in the perovskite film. The strain in APbI 3 perovskite can also be reduced by substituting some of the Pb 2+ ions with isovalent Cd 2+ ions of a small ionic radius  (21, 27) . As a result, both the efficiency and stability improved with the relaxation of the local lattice strain. Similarly, it was shown for mixed (FASnI 3 ) 0.5 (MAPbI 3 ) 0.5 PSCs that the addition of 2.5 mol % of Cs + ions led to the relaxation of the lattice strain, resulting in a lower concentration of defects, which in turn improved efficiency  (28) . Therefore, the strain engineering of lead halide perovskites has attracted attention as a method to further improve both the efficiency and stability of PSCs. Recently, we reported the stabilization of a-FAPbI 3 by substituting FA + with the slightly larger methylenediammonium (MDA 2+ )  (29) . Compared with stabilizing a-phase by adding MA + or Cs + (both of which have a smaller ionic radius than FA + ), the change in the bandgap resulting from MDA 2+ substitution is very small (~0.01 eV), and a high short-circuit current (J sc ) was obtained with relatively better stability (retaining >90% of initial performance over 600 hours of irradiation). Nevertheless, substituting only MDA 2+ cations with a larger ionic radius, or Cs + with a smaller ionic radius, than FA + can distort Pb-I-Pb bonds by tilting the PbI 6 octahedron. One of the most common strain-compensation strategies is to introduce larger and smaller ions together to reduce the local tensile and compressive strain in the perovskite lattice. In this study, we used the dual substitution of FA + sites with MDA 2+ and Cs + in the same molar ratio to relax the lattice strain of MDAstabilized a-FAPbI 3 . The alloyed FAPbI 3 with 0.03 mol fraction of both MDA and Cs cations effectively reduced the lattice strain and the trap density in the PSCs, resulting in the fabrication of PSCs with 24.4 and 21.6% certified efficiency for small and large (1 cm by 1 cm) cells, respectively, through the suppression of nonradiative carrier recombination. Moreover, the corresponding devices exhibited superior thermal stability and maintained >80% of their initial efficiency after 1300 hours in storage at 85°C (at 15 to 25% relative humidity). The (FAPbI 3 ) 1-x (MC) x perovskite thin films (with x = 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, or 0.04 mol fraction) were deposited by our solvent engineering process (29, 30) using precursor solutions that dissolved the FAI and PbI 2 with the desired number of MDA 2+ and Cs + cations. Here, MC is an abbreviation that means that MDA 2+ and Cs + were mixed in equimolar amounts (i.e., MDA:Cs = 1:1). Figure  1A  shows the x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples with different x values for the perovskite thin layers prepared directly on a mesoporous-TiO 2 (mp-TiO 2 ) electron-transporting layer. In the XRD patterns, two dominant peaks could be seen at about 14°and 28°, which we assigned to the characteristic (001) and (002) crystal planes of the a-FAPbI 3 phase, and no d-phase appeared at 11.6°. As x increased in (FAPbI 3 ) 1-x (MC) x , the diffraction intensity of the two peaks also increased, and no new peaks appeared, which was likely caused by preferred orientation during crystallization on the substrate from the comparison with XRD patterns of powders scraped from the films (fig.  S2A ). The average crystalline sizes and full width at half maximum of the diffraction peak at the (100) plane did not show a large variation with x and became smaller and broader with the shift of the diffraction angle to the low angle in powder case, owing to residual stress present in the films (fig.  S2,  B  and C ). Because crystallographic data measured from one-dimensional XRD typically only provide limited structural information, particularly for highly oriented perovskite films, we obtained two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns to probe changes in the crystallographic orientations of the perovskite film as x was varied. Distinct and relatively strong spots were observed in the ring patterns (fig.  S1A ) as x increased (i.e., increased substitution) in (FAPbI 3 ) 1-x (MC) x . The GIWAXS pattern for x = 0.04 (Fig.  1B ) exhibited a strong diffraction intensity and was similar to that of x = 0.03 (fig.  S1C ) but had slightly greater intensity and appeared more clearly as a mixture of scattered secondary spots and rings. The preferential crystal orientations for a-FAPbI 3 were observed out of the plane in the direction [100] c and [200] c (Fig.  1B , white arrows). We concluded that the diffraction intensity increased with increasing x because of the highly oriented crystal domains, not the improvements in crystallinity. In addition, compared with (FAPbI 3 ) 0.972 (MDACl 2 ) 0.038 (denoted as control), the peak position at ~14°gradually shifted to higher angles from 14.07°to 14.16°as x increased to 0.03, then it slightly decreased to 14.12°at x = 0.04 (Fig.  1C ). In the same crystal, because the diffraction angle (2q) reflected the expansion and contraction of the lattice, the diffraction angle could shift depending on the proportion of the relatively smaller Cs + and larger MDA 2+ cations to the FA + cations. This result suggested that the incorporation of Cs + and MDA 2+ into the lattice of FAPbI 3 formed a solid-state alloy. As shown in fig.  S3 , this shift in diffraction angle was most consistent with the change in the radius of cations calculated using the ionic radii of individual FA + , Cs + , and MDA 2+ , except at x = 0.04 and when considering the FA + vacancies for the charge balance without also considering the insertion of Cl -ions that may result from the bivalent MDA  (29) . Inferring the deviation from this trend at x = 0.04, we expected the composition of the actual perovskite thin film to differ slightly from the composition of the precursor solution. Nevertheless, the change in optical properties with x was negligible. In Fig.  1D   observed in the absorption onset as x increased, however, the shift was very small compared with the composition in which a single Cs + cation was added to pure FAPbI 3  (11) . The corresponding shifts are consistent with the PL emission peaks at 826, 825, 825, and 824 nm for x = 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04, respectively, and the peak at 827 mm for the control. Figure  2A  shows the variation in solar cell characteristics with different x in (FAPbI 3 ) 1-x (MC) x and control. The devices comprised multiple layers: glass/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/ compact-TiO 2 /thin mp-TiO 2 /perovskite/2,2',7,7'tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9'-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD)/Au. To confirm the effect of cosubstitution of MDA 2+ and Cs + on solar cell performance, at least 24 devices in each category were fabricated and evaluated in one experiment (Fig.  2A ). The statistical distribution of factors such as J sc , open-circuit voltage (V oc ), and fill factor (FF) determining power conversion efficiency (PCE) showed that a relatively better performance was noticed for x = 0.03 (denoted as target) with a narrow distribution of J sc , V oc , FF, and PCE and an average PCE of 22.72 ± 0.45%. In general, when the composition or coating process of the perovskite thin film is changed, the surface morphology may change and in turn change the efficiency. Thus, we imaged the surface morphology in (FAPbI 3 ) 1-x (MC) x and the control films using top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig.  2D ). Regardless of the amounts of additives, all films showed a similar grain size without apparent pinholes on the surface. These results indicate that the incorporation with small amounts of Cs + and MDA 2+ cations did not affect the morphological features of the perovskite layers, such as grain sizes and surface roughness. For simplicity, the control and target were compared to find out why the efficiency improved by substituting the same amount of Cs + and MDA 2+ in FAPbI 3 . Figure  2B  shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for one of the representative control and target devices. The EQE onset of the target is slightly blue-shifted, which was consistent with the tuned bandgap (Fig.  1D ). Nevertheless, as can be seen in the integrated J sc (Fig.  2B ), this small blue shift in the bandgap was not appreciable. The cross-sectional thickness of the control and target devices were compared by using SEM images (fig.  S4 ). There was no noticeable difference in the thicknesses between two representative layers (415 nm for the control and 425 nm for the target). The similarities in J sc implied that there was no substantial difference in the charge collection in the two comparison groups. The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of the best-performing control and target devices in a reverse and forward bias sweep with antireflective coatings (fig.  S5 ) on the device surface are compared in Fig.  2C . The J sc , V oc , and FF values calculated from the J-V curve of the target were 26.23 mA cm -2 , 1.168 V, and 82.15%, respectively; these factors correspond to a PCE of 25.17% under standard air mass (AM) 1.5 conditions, whereas the control exhibited a PCE of 24.48% with J sc = 26.25 mA cm -2 , V oc = 1.138 V, and FF = 81.95%. The PCE of the target devices shown in Fig.  2C  was certified by an accredited laboratory (Newport, USA) using a quasi-steady-state (QSS) method. The stabilized PCE measured by QSS was 24.37% with J sc = 26.17 mA cm -2 , V oc = 1.162 V, and FF = 80.13% for the small cell (fig.  S6 ), and 21.63% for the large cell (1 cm by 1 cm) (fig.  S7 ). Within the scope of this study, the effect of compositional changes on J sc was very limited, and most efficiency improvements were attributable to an increase in V oc . As noted earlier, because control and target devices have almost the same bandgap, surface morphology, and thickness, the large increase in V oc (low V oc loss) arose from the changes inside the crystalline perovskites. The V oc loss for x and control occurred at x = 0.03 (fig.  S8 ). Generally, V oc loss is directly related to reduction in defect concentration and nonradiative losses  (31) (32) (33) (34) . In this regard, there have been many reports that lattice strain in perovskites increases defect concentrations and nonradiative recombination  (22, 24, 28, 35) . We estimated the variation in lattice strain of perovskite films with x in (FAPbI 3 from the XRD patterns of Fig.  1A . As can be seen in Fig.  3A , the strain decreased as x increased from 0.01 to 0.03 and then increased again at 0.04. Here, the WH method considers the broadening of the peak as a function of the diffraction angle, which is assumed to be the combined effect of broadening induced by both the crystalline size and strain  (36, 37) . Furthermore, the strain of perovskite films can also be attributed from the preferred crystalline phase and oriented domain boundaries, etc. However, the change in crystallite size was not very large (fig.  S2 ), and the variation of strain obtained from the XRD patterns of powders scraped from the thin films was almost similar to that of the films (fig.  S10 ). In particular, when the mole fraction of MDA and Cs incorporated in FAPbI 3 was 3:3, the lowest strain appeared. This result proposes that 3:3 substitution of Cs + and MDA 2+ in FAPbI 3 effectively mitigated the lattice strain in the perovskite structure (fig.  S11 ). Thus, reducing the strain of the lattice minimized defect centers or traps that can capture charge carriers and negatively affect solar cell performance. Steady-state PL and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were carried out to investigate the nonradiative carrier recombination of the perovskite thin films with different x [(FAPbI 3 ) 1-x (MC) x ] and control. Figure  3B  shows PL spectra for the thin perovskite layers deposited on glass substrate. The addition of equal amounts of Cs + and MDA 2+ increased the PL intensity; the intensity maximized at x = 0.03 and then decreased again at x = 0.04. Under the same conditions, an increase in PL intensity implied a decrease in nonradioactive recombination. For a more quantitative comparison of charge recombination, TRPL was measured using time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) under low-intensity pulsed excitation, for which decay dynamics mostly reflect nonradiative trapassisted recombination. From the PL decay curves in Fig.  3C , the carrier lifetime values were obtained by using the biexponential equation Y = A 1 exp(-t/t 1 ) + A 2 exp(-t/t 2 ), where t 1 and t 2 denote the fast and slow decay time and are related to the trap-assisted nonradiative and radiative recombination processes, respectively. As seen in the average carrier lifetime (table  S1 ) measured using six different samples, both t 1 and t 2 at x = 0.03 are the longest and longer than control. This increased lifetime was consistent with the reduction of lattice strain, indicating that the relaxation of the strain suppressed nonradiative recombination by reducing the number of trap states. Changes in the lattice strain can also affect the Urbach energy (E u ). A lower E u of the perovskite film indicates a higher structural quality of the film, as well as a lower voltage loss between V oc and the bandgap voltage. Figure  3D  shows E u for the perovskite films calculated from UV-vis absorption spectra using the equation a = a 0 exp(hn/E u ), where a is absorption coefficient and hn is photon energy. The E u of the control and target films were 30.18 and 26.88 meV, respectively (Fig.  3D  and fig.  S12 ). Interestingly, the change in E u of (FAPbI 3 ) 1-x (MC) x perovskite films shows a similar trend with the change in the microstrain of the films. This result implies that the lattice strain is closely related to the trap states in the perovskite films. To further understand the total quantity and energetic levels of the trap states, thermally stimulated current (TSC) analysis was performed in complete devices. Figure  3E  presents the TSC spectra for temperatures from 120 to 300 K for (FAPbI 3 ) 1-x (MC) x -based PSCs compared with the control device. The TSC signal could be integrated to estimate the lower limit of trap densities over the elapsed time according to the equation ∫ signal I TSC dt ≤ eN T;TSC Vol where N T,TSC is the trap density, e is the elementary charge, and Vol is the volume of the perovskite layer  (38, 39) . The trap density of the control device (8.86 × 10 16 cm -3 ) was the highest, which indicates that the strain in the perovskite structure induced an increase in defects. The trap density decreased in the (FAPbI 3 ) 1-x (MC) x devices from x = 0.01 to x = 0.03, where it was smallest (4.76 × 10 16 cm -3 ), and then increased at x = 0.04 (Fig.  3F ). To extract the activation energy of the trap states, the slope of the initial rise of the TSC current, which was attributed to the start of trap release, in the Arrhenius plot for each condition was fitted to the following equation I TSC ºexp À E A k B T where E A , k B , and T are the activation energy, Boltzmann constant, and temperature, respectively  (40, 41) . For the control device, trap states with an activation energy E A1 = 150 meV were estimated (fig.  S13 ). For x = 0.01, a higher activation energy (224 meV) was observed, but it was drastically reduced at x = 0.02 (131 meV) and x = 0.03 (130 meV) and then rapidly increased to 272 meV at x = 0.04. A higher activation energy indicates traps formed deeper in the bandgap, which promotes nonradiative recombination. At very low temperatures (<250 K), the activation energy E A2 of x = 0.03 (169 meV) was slightly lower than that of the control (183 meV); however, it is speculated that the E A1 value is more critical to real operational conditions, which are higher than  room temperature (298 K). The defect analysis, PL, TCSPC, Urbach energy, and TSC results were in good agreement with the changes in the lattice strain of the (FAPbI 3 ) 1-x (MC) x perovskites, which implies that the enhanced device performance with improved V oc was closely related to defect passivation induced by the strain relaxation of the perovskite structure. Long-term stability is also very important, even if the efficiency of PSCs is improved by reducing strain. The thermal stability of PSCs with thermally stable poly(triarylamine) as the HTM were compared to rule out thermal degradation from the HTM layer for the control and target devices. Unencapsulated devices were stored at 85°C in an oven under 15 to 25% relative humidity under dark and ambient conditions. The control device retained at least 80% of its initial efficiency up to 600 hours. In contrast, the target device maintained >80% of its initial efficiency even after 1300 hours (Fig.  4A ). In addition, control and target devices using copper phthalocyanine as HTM were tested at 150°C without any encapsulation. The target device retained almost 80% of initial PCE after 20 hours, unlike the control device, for which PCE decreased to ~60% of its initial value (Fig.  4B ). This improved thermal stability by Cs + incorporation is consistent with the reported results  (4, 5, (42) (43) (44) . The long-term operational stability of an encapsulated device (using Spiro-OMeTAD as HTM) was also tested with maximum power point tracking under ambient air and full solar illumination without an ultraviolet cut-off filter (Fig.  4C ). The target device maintained >90% of its initial efficiency after 400 hours, which is comparable with other efficient mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs  (29, 45, 46) . Fig. S1 . S1 Fig. S1.

1152,138_5," Yes No Figure  4f , Supplementary Figure  26  and Supplementary Figure  28  Low-loss contacts on textured substrates for inverted perovskite solar cells Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) promise enhanced operating stability compared to their normal-structure counterparts  [1] [2] [3]  . To improve efficiency further, it is crucial to combine effective light management with low interfacial losses  4, 5  . Here we develop a conformal self-assembled monolayer (SAM) as the hole-selective contact on lightmanaging textured substrates. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that cluster formation during phosphonic acid adsorption leads to incomplete SAM coverage. We devise a co-adsorbent strategy that disassembles high-order clusters, thus homogenizing the distribution of phosphonic acid molecules, and thereby minimizing interfacial recombination and improving electronic structures. We report a laboratorymeasured power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.3% and a certified quasi-steady-state PCE of 24.8% for inverted PSCs, with a photocurrent approaching 95% of the Shockley-Queisser maximum. An encapsulated device having a PCE of 24.6% at room temperature retains 95% of its peak performance when stressed at 65 °C and 50% relative humidity following more than 1,000 h of maximum power point tracking under 1 sun illumination. This represents one of the most stable PSCs subjected to accelerated ageing: achieved with a PCE surpassing 24%. The engineering of phosphonic acid adsorption on textured substrates offers a promising avenue for efficient and stable PSCs. It is also anticipated to benefit other optoelectronic devices that require light management. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently attained a certified efficiency of 26.1% (ref. 6); however, the very highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) devices have yet to meet operating stability under accelerated ageing tests  5  . The limited device stability is attributed to the presence of mobile and hygroscopic p-type dopants in hole-transporting layers, which undermine moisture and thermal stability  7  . Inverted PSCs present a solution by utilizing undoped hole-selective contacts  8  . Recent studies have shown PCEs surpassing 25% for inverted PSCs 2 . However, when adhering to the stringent quasi-steady-state (QSS) protocol, their certified efficiency (approximately 24%) requires further improvement  3, 9  . Efforts to improve inverted PSC efficiency have focused on interface passivation  2, 9, 10  . This approach suppresses non-radiative recombination and thus improves fill factors and photovoltages  11  . Nevertheless, higher photocurrents are needed for efficiency gains. In normal-structure PSCs, this has been realized using textured fluorine-doped tin oxides (FTO) as the transparent conductive oxides (TCO)  4, 5  . The pyramidal grains on FTO minimize reflection losses and extend the length of the average optical path  4  . By contrast, inverted PSCs, often built on smooth indium tin oxides (ITOs)  9, 10  , face substantial optical losses due to the lack of light management. The discrepancy is ascribed to differences in transporting materials and deposition techniques. In normal-structure PSCs, inorganic hole-blocking layers are conformally deposited on textured substrates using spray pyrolysis and chemical bath deposition  4, 5  . However, inverted PSCs typically use ultrathin (less than 5 nm) organic hole-selective contacts on substrates  2, 3  , which can be challenging to deposit uniformly using solution processing  12  . Inhomogeneity leads to energy losses and insufficient carrier extraction  13  . Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), particularly those composed of phosphonic acid molecules with hole-selective tail groups, have shown promise in addressing this issue  14  . Phosphonic acids establish coordinative/covalent bonds with TCOs, enabling sufficient SAM coverage Article on rough surfaces  15  . This could provide a low-loss interface, uniting light management with interface passivation. Indeed, photocurrent improvements have been observed when replacing SAM-modified ITO with FTO substrates in inverted PSCs  16  . Despite their promise, achieving a high-density, closely packed SAM remains challenging, which leads to erratic interfacial properties  17  . For example, Liu and co-workers revealed that phosphonic acids failed to fully cover textured wafers, which affected the performance of tandem solar cells  18  . Even on flat substrates, the formation of SAMs tends to be non-uniform, a problem usually attributed to the limited solubility of phosphonic acids  19  and their insufficient chemical bond formation with metal oxides  20  . Several strategies have been proposed to ensure conformal SAM coverage, such as utilizing more reactive oxide surfaces (for example, nickel oxides) to promote hetero condensation  18  , using thermal evaporation for SAM deposition  21  and designing highly soluble phosphonic acid molecules  19  . However, these methods can be laborious, requiring time-intensive molecule design, synthesis and vacuum-based layer deposition. Additionally, the use of highly reactive oxides could compromise device stability owing to redox reactions with ammonium halides  22  . ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""50"", ""temperature"": ""65"", ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.3"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.95""}}"

1171,135_4," SAM design and synthesis Modulating the terminal functional group is an effective way to tune the interfacial interactions between SAMs and perovskite. For ex-ample, the introduction of two methoxy groups (OMe) into [2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (2PACz) enabled a new SAM,  [2-(3,6- dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (MeO-2PACz), which improved the interfacial contact and enabled a higher efficiency of p-i-n PSC compared with 2PACz  (10) . Nonetheless, the OMe substitution on the carbazole core also caused a decrease in dipole moment from ~2.0 D of 2PACz to ~0.2 D of MeO-2PACz, which in turn led to the offset between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the SAM molecule and the valence band maximum (VBM) of the perovskite  (10, 26) . This phenomenon can be ascribed to high planarity and symmetry of the carbazole structure; the incorporation of two OMe groups with opposite directions of dipole moment resulted in a net molecular dipole moment of MeO-2PACz close to zero (Fig.  1A ). We addressed this issue by using a non-coplanar screw-shaped dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (DBC) unit as the core to reduce the negative effect on the dipole moment when introducing OMe groups, affording a new SAM of MeO-4PADBC (Fig.  1B ). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations verified that MeO-4PADBC only has a slightly decreased dipole moment (2.   S11C ), which could induce a highly ordered one-dimensional assembly that favors a dense, tilted, highly ordered monolayer on the substrate (fig.  S11D )  (9, 27, 28) . We then calculated the interfacial binding energies between SAMs and perovskite, showing that MeO-4PADBC has a stronger binding with perovskite with a total binding energy (E b ) of -7.19 eV, compared with that of -5.27 eV for MeO-2PACz (fig.  S12 ). The main electrostatic interaction of the calculated SAMs is the O atoms from OMe groups with the Pb from perovskite, however MeO-4PADBC has a more energetically favorable contact with perovskite compared with MeO-2PACz, which can be ascribed to the more concentrated electron distribution of the coordinated OMe group on MeO-4PADBC than that on MeO-2PACz (fig.  S13 ). Moreover, Bader charge analysis also suggests a stronger Pb-O interaction between MeO-4PADBC and perovskite with a shorter calculated interaction length of 4.7 Å than that of MeO-2PACz of 4.9 Å (fig.

1198,79_4," P erovskite solar cells have attracted great attention in recent years, as their efficiency has risen from 3.8% to 22.1% via film crystal growth control, interface and device engineering  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  . Up to now, TiO 2 mesoporous structures were commonly the most successful at delivering high efficiency and stable power output for perovskite solar cells  [1] [2] [3] [4]  . However, one disadvantage of the mesoporous structure is the high-temperature (>450 • C) sintering required for the TiO 2 mesoporous layer, which is a barrier to low cost and stretchable device fabrication  [1] [2] [3] [4]  . Further interest in perovskite solar cells developed after it was realized that lead halide perovskites have charge carrier diffusion lengths on the micrometre scale and possess ambipolar properties  6, 7  . Therefore, it is possible to remove the high-temperature sintered mesoporous layer to make a simple planar-structure solar cell, in which all of the layers can be processed at low temperature  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]  . Planar devices are typically divided into either n-i-p (regular) or p-i-n (inverted) structures, depending on the bottom transporting layer  12  . The p-i-n inverted planar structure usually shows negligible hysteresis when using fullerene as the top electron transport layer  12  . However, it exhibits lower efficiency due to inferior perovskite crystallinity and imperfect interfacial band alignment  11, 12  . For regular n-i-p planar structures using a TiO 2 condensed layer as the electron transport layer, the device could show high performance under reverse scan (V OC to J SC scan), whereas the forward I-V scan usually showed much lower efficiency (J SC to V OC scan)  4, 9  , which led to difficulty in obtaining a reliable power conversion efficiency  4, 9  . Further results indicated that charge accumulation induced by ion migration in the perovskite layer could be the main cause of hysteresis  [13] [14] [15]  . It was also found that the electronic contact between perovskite and electron transport layers (ETLs) could significantly affect the behaviour of the hysteresis  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20]  (generally, hole transport layers do not affect hysteresis, because the commonly used hole transport layer, Spiro-OMeTAD, can form good electronic contact with perovskite  6  ). When the electronic contact is imperfect, the charge accumulation will become worse and aggravate the hysteresis. However, if the electronic contact is perfect and the accumulated charges can be easily extracted, the hysteresis can be alleviated or fully eliminated  17, 20  . For example, either in the regular or the inverted planar structure, on introducing a fullerene layer with a strong electron extraction ability, the devices showed stable output with reduced hysteresis  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20]  . However, fullerene is expensive, as well as unstable for practical applications  12  . Inorganic metal oxides such as SnO 2 have a bandgap above 3.6 eV, and a deeper conduction band than TiO 2 . Thus, in principle they should facilitate more efficient electron transfer  21  . Furthermore, bulk SnO 2 has a mobility of up to 240 cm 2 /(V • s), which is 100 times that of TiO 2 , making it conceptually a more likely candidate for use in high-performance electronic devices  21  . Previously, SnO 2 has been used as an electron transport layer in organic solar cells or dye-sensitized solar cells  21, 22  . Recently, it was also used in perovskite solar cells in order to increase the efficiency and to reduce the hysteresis  [23] [24] [25] [26] [27]  . During the final preparation of this Article, ref. 28 was published, reporting planar perovskite solar cells with an average PCE around 18.5% and a mild hysteresis. Here, we develop a regular n-i-p planar structure of perovskite solar cells with solution-processed SnO 2 nanoparticles as the electron transport layer. The devices show a certified efficiency close to 20%, almost free of hysteresis. Given the SnO 2 layer's deep conduction band and high electron mobility, we ascribe the elimination of the I-V hysteresis to the enhanced electron extraction caused by the reduction of the energy barrier at the perovskite/ETL interface. Furthermore, an excess PbI 2 phase was introduced to passivate the traps in perovskite (FAPbI 3 ) 0.97 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.03 and deliver high device performance. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TinOxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""20.51"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""(FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TinOxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""Lead Iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": ""18.5"", ""treated_pce"": ""20.51"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
1199,79_5," Characterization of nanoparticles and perovskite layer Transmission electron microscopy (Fig.  1a ) showed the SnO 2 particles we used are very uniform, with particle sizes around ARTICLES 3-4 nm. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy results (Fig.  1b ) indicated the SnO 2 nanoparticles are highly crystallized, which is good for reducing the number of defect traps in SnO 2 , and should also be beneficial for charge transfer when using it as a charge transport layer. Electron diffraction circles from the (110), (  101 ) and (  211 ) crystal planes of SnO 2 were observed (Fig.  1c ), indicating that the SnO 2 nanoparticles are polycrystalline. X-ray diffraction (Fig.  1d ) results further confirmed this conclusion. All X-ray diffraction peaks for SnO 2 (Fig.  1d ) are indexable to the tetragonal SnO 2 structure (space group P42/mnm, a = 0.4738 and c = 0.3187 nm), indicating the formation of pure SnO 2 crystals  29  . When spin coating SnO 2 nanoparticles solution onto glass/ITO substrate, it can form a dense, pinhole-free film (Fig.  1e ), and the film quality is much better than that of the conventionally used TiO 2 nanoparticles film (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). In addition, we found that the SnO 2 films formed showed good transparency, with transmission values greater than 95% in the visible region (Fig.  1f ), with minimized optical loss in the SnO 2 layer. NATURE ENERGY We have characterized the electronic states and band structures of SnO 2 and perovskite layers with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The Sn 3d core-level spectrum of SnO 2 nanoparticles is shown in Supplementary Fig.  2 . The peaks at binding energies of 486.9 eV and 495.3 eV correspond to Sn 3d 5/2 and Sn 3d 3/2 , respectively  30  . The Sn 3d peaks showed only one symmetric component without any shoulder, which indicates only a Sn 4+ chemical state in the SnO 2 nanoparticles. The O 1s X-ray photoelectron spectrum of SnO 2 exhibits a degree of asymmetry in its shape (Supplementary Fig.  2 ), where the peak with a lower binding energy (530.7 eV) corresponds to the O atoms of the SnO 2 crystal and the second peak (532.1 eV) can be attributed to the surface oxygen-group absorbance  30  . For comparison, the core-level spectra of TiO 2 have also been given (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), and are similar to SnO 2 (Supplementary Fig.  2 ), indicating no additional metal chemical states except for Ti  4+ (ref. 31) . The work function (W S ), valance band maximum (VBM) and bandgap (E g ) of the SnO 2 nanoparticles are 4.36 eV (Fig.  2a ), 3.74 eV (Fig.  2b ) and 3.79 eV (Supplementary Fig.  4 ), respectively. It can be calculated that the conduction band (E C ) of the SnO 2 nanoparticles is 4.31 eV, as obtained from E C = W S + VBM -E g based on the semiconductor band structure (Supplementary Fig.  5 ); this is much deeper than that of TiO 2 (3.77 eV, Fig.  2a, b  and Supplementary Figs  3  and 4 )  21  . One can also estimate that the conduction band of perovskite (FAPbI 3 ) x (MAPbBr 3 ) 1-x is 4.36 eV from Fig.  2  and Supplementary Figs  4  and 5 . In principle, the deeper conduction band of SnO 2 compared with TiO 2 could enhance charge transfer from perovskite to the electron transport layer (Supplementary Fig.  6 )  21  . The possible band alignment between (FAPbI 3 ) x (MAPbBr 3 ) 1-x and SnO 2 is shown in Fig.  2c . In addition to energy band alignment, the charge mobility of the electrons also For each material, the highest and the lowest energy levels are conduction band (E C ) and valence band (E V ), respectively. d, log(J)-log(V) plots for the SnO 2 and TiO 2 colloidal film using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model with device structure of ITO/Al/metal oxides/Al. Measurement data (circles), which were fitted by a line with a slope of 2 (blue), the intercepts of the fitted line on log(J) were used for the mobility calculation. affects the charge transfer. A low mobility of the electron transport layer indicates more traps and will slow down charge transport. This could lead to charge accumulation at the interface, which will induce an energy barrier to suppress the charge transport. We measured the mobility of SnO 2 and TiO 2 colloidal films by means of the spacecharge-limited current (SCLC) model  18  , and it was found that the mobility of the SnO 2 film is about 1.9 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 • s, which is much higher than that of TiO 2 (3.3 × 10 -5 cm 2 V -1 • s). The higher mobility of the ETL used could improve charge transport, and the higher injection current from the ITO/SnO 2 /Spiro-OMeTAD/Al device compared ITO/TiO 2 /Spiro-OMeTAD/Al could confirm this argument (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""(FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TinOxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""Lead Iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": ""18.5"", ""treated_pce"": ""20.51"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""(FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TitaniumDioxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""Lead Iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": ""18.5"", ""treated_pce"": ""20.51"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
1201,79_7," Device fabrication and performance We fabricated devices with the structure ITO/SnO 2 /(FAPbI 3 ) x (MAPbBr 3 ) 1-x /Spiro-OMeTAD/Au using SnO 2 nanoparticles as ETLs. We used a two-step spin coating method to form the perovskite layer by inter-diffusion of lead halide and organic salts  32  . Here, a mixture of perovskite layers (FAPbI 3 ) x (MAPbBr 3 ) 1-x was selected. FAPbI 3 was chosen due to its lower bandgap than that of MAPbI 3 , in order to increase light harvesting  33, 34  . A small amount of MAPbBr 3 was added into FAPbI 3 to improve perovskite phase stabilization  34  . The composition of MAPbBr 3 in the perovskite mixture was about 3%, as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Supplementary Fig.  8 ), thus giving the form (FAPbI 3 ) 0.97 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.03 . The obtained perovskite film obtained showed an excellent morphology and was free of pinholes; the crystal size was close to 1 µm. The high quality of perovskite film formation was due to the introduction of Cl and moisture during the film growth  11, 35  . There is negligible Cl in the final perovskite film (Supplementary Fig.  8 ); the Cl element should have been vaporized, inferring that the Cl acts only as an intermediate element/material for perovskite film growth  11  . Moisture can enhance perovskite film growth via recrystallization  35  . It must be noted that the 'white phase' was observed when annealing the perovskite layer at higher temperature (for example, 150 • C) (Fig.  4a ,b and Supplementary Fig.  9 ). X-ray diffraction results (Fig.  4c ) confirmed that the PbI 2 phase was formed under higher temperature annealing, which is due to partial decomposition of the perovskite layer ( FAPbI 3 →PbI 2 (s)+FAI(g)). In situ energy dispersive X-ray analysis in a scanning electron microscope further confirms that the 'white phase' is a PbI 2 -rich region (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). The longer lifetime from the perovskite film with excess PbI 2 indicated that PbI 2 could passivate the defects and reduce recombination in the perovskite film (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). The passivation could be explained as follows: while PbI 2 was formed at the grain boundary in the perovskite layer, a type-I band alignment could be formed between perovskite and PbI 2 (ref. 36), which blocks electron from entering the hole transport layer and also reduces recombination. It was found that PbI 2 passivation is beneficial for device performance, as will be shown below  36, 37  . A cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy image of the completed device is shown in Fig.  4d . The thicknesses of the electron transport layer (SnO 2 ) and the hole transport layer (Spiro-OMeTAD) are 25 nm and 150 nm, respectively. The optimized process for the SnO 2 layer can be found in Supplementary Fig.  12 . To obtain the best performance, the SnO 2 layer should fully cover the ITO substrate, but it must not be so thick as to introduce a high series resistance. Therefore, a decent thickness of SnO 2 should be considered; in our case, the optimized thickness of SnO 2 is 25 nm. In this study, we deposited a thick perovskite layer (770 nm, Fig.  4c ) to enhance the photo response of the perovskite layer in the infrared region  38  .  We compared the device performance with and without the PbI 2 phase. It was found that the perovskite with excess PbI 2 showed better device performance, taking in account all the device performance parameters (Fig.  5a ). In terms of the lifetime enhancement (Supplementary Fig.  11 ), it could be assumed that the improvement of the device performance was due to passivation of the traps, including surface or grain boundary defects in the perovskite layer, which were considered as recombination centres  39  . In inorganic solar cells, a thin layer of wide bandgap or insulating materials is usually used for passivating the surface traps; for example, a thin layer of SiO 2 or Al 2 O 3 for Si solar cells  40  and the wide bandgap of AlGaAs for GaAs solar cells  41  . Here, in our study, the PbI 2 phase is expected to have a similar role in passivation for enhancing the device performance. ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""(FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TitaniumDioxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""Lead Iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": ""18.5"", ""treated_pce"": ""20.51"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""(FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TinOxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""Methylammonium Lead Bromide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": ""18.5"", ""treated_pce"": ""20.51"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"

1265,70_2,"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have now achieved efficiencies in excess of 22%, but very little is known about their long-term stability under thermal stress. So far, stability reports have hinted at the importance of substituting the organic components, but little attention has been given to the metal contact. We investigated the stability of state-of-the-art PSCs with efficiencies exceeding 20%. Remarkably, we found that exposing PSCs to a temperature of 70 °C is enough to induce gold migration through the hole-transporting layer (HTL), spiro-MeOTAD, and into the perovskite material, which in turn severely affects the device performance metrics under working conditions. Importantly, we found that the main cause of irreversible degradation is not due to decomposition of the organic and hybrid perovskite layers. By introducing a Cr metal interlayer between the HTL and gold electrode, high-temperature-induced irreversible long-term losses are avoided. This key finding is essential in the quest for achieving high efficiency, long-term stable PSCs which, in order to be commercially viable, need to withstand hard thermal stress tests.","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null}"

1331,83_41," Fabrication of the planar homojunction PSC The proposed homojunction structure is composed of two perovskite layers with different doping, p-type and n-type perovskites, placed in junction with one another. A built-in electric field is therefore established at the p-n junction. Theoretical simulations and experimental evidence show that perovskites can be either p-type or n-type depending on the growth conditions and the ratio of the main precursors  [33] [34] [35] [36] [37]  . The MAPbI 3 films with Pb 2+rich/MA + -deficient/I --deficient precursors are n-doped and those with MA + -rich/Pb 2+ -deficient precursors are p-doped, due to the presence of the defects induced by vacancies or interstitial elements. Previously, we have demonstrated that self-doping in perovskites can be tuned serially by controlling the process conditions, such as annealing temperatures  39, 40  . Hence, it is feasible to fabricate a perovskite homojunction structure. We integrate the homojunction into PSCs based on the standard planar p-i-n  41, 42   structure are displayed in Fig.  1a, b . Figure  1c  presents a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a homojunction PSC, where a smooth and uniform n-type MAPbI 3 layer can be clearly observed. Meanwhile, the dense and small-grain p-type MAPbI 3 layer with a thickness of ~60 nm is deposited on the top of the ~480 nm n-type MAPbI 3 layer. To realize the perovskite homojunction structure, we propose a combined deposition method that combines a one-step spincoating method for the deposition of the bottom n-type perovskite layer on top of the TiO 2 compact layer and a vacuum vapour deposition followed by a dipping step for the deposition of the top p-type perovskite layer over the n-type perovskite layer. The one-step spin-coating method allows control of the morphology, coverage, roughness and grain size of the n-type perovskite film. By varying the stoichiometry of the PbI 2 /MAI precursor ratio (1, 1.05, 1.10 and 1.15, respectively), we are able to induce the n-type doping in the perovskite. The deposition of the top p-type perovskite layer of the homojunction should not degrade the bottom n-type perovskite layer. While spin-coating would dissolve the bottom layer, vacuum vapour deposition has been reported to avoid damage of the organic/inorganic thin films underneath while enabling highquality films  22, 43, 44  . We therefore choose this technique for depositing PbI 2 thin films on top of the n-type perovskite layer, followed by a dipping step in MAI/isopropanol solution to form MAPbI 3 . By adjusting the dipping time, we control the amount of MAI and thus the p-type doping. Finally, we choose the top p-type perovskite layer with a PbI 2 thickness of 60 nm followed by a dipping time of 60 s, whose precursor ratio is measured at ~0.91 (PbI 2 /MAI). The SEM images, X-ray diffraction patterns and high-resolution transmission electron microscope images (Supplementary Note 1) of perovskite layers are shown in Supplementary Figs.  1 2 3 , respectively. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN""}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TitaniumDioxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN""}"
1332,83_42," Carrier generation and recombination in homojunction PSC Figure  2a  shows a schematic energy level diagram and the working principle of the homojunction PSC and how carriers are transported across the layers. As photons are absorbed by both the p-type and n-type perovskites, the photo-induced carriers are generated in two perovskite layers. Then, the electrons and holes at the homojunction drift in opposite directions. Finally, the electrons are injected into the compact TiO 2 layer, the electron transport layer (ETL), and transported to the FTO cathode whereas the holes are injected into the spiro-OMeTAD layer, the hole transport layer (HTL), and transported to the Au anode. In PSCs with the standard p-i-n structure, the carrier transport in the perovskite film has no preferred direction, which can lead to unwanted carrier recombination. The extraction of photo-induced electrons and holes mostly occurs at the perovskite/ETL and the perovskite/HTL interfaces, respectively  27  . Hence, we design the homojunction structure to provide an extra built-in electric field in the perovskite film, in which electrons and holes move in opposite directions towards the ETL and the HTL, respectively, as shown in Fig.  2b , with a view to reducing carrier recombination. To verify the reduction in carrier recombination losses, carrier generation and recombination in PSCs is simulated with wxAMPS, which has been used to simulate thin-film solar cells  39, 45, 46  . The simulated structures for these two PSCs are shown in Supplementary Fig.  4a . In Fig.  2c , under short-circuit conditions, the rates of carrier generation are similar for both devices whereas the carrier recombination rate for PSCs with the homojunction is dramatically reduced near the p-type/n-type perovskite interface. We suggest that this is due to the electric field (Supplementary Fig.  4b ) induced by the homojunction that favours the oriented transport of electrons and holes. As a result of the influence of the homojunction, the concentration of the free holes increases in the p-type perovskite region away from the interface, whereas the concentration of the electrons decreases (Supplementary Fig.  4c, d ), providing evidence for carrier oriented transport. Besides, the simulated photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) curve (Supplementary Fig.  5  and Supplementary Note 2) in the homojunction PSC shows an obvious enhancement in open-circuit voltage (V OC ). ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TitaniumDioxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN""}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TitaniumDioxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN""}"
1357,44_4," Experimental details and simulation The samples for the dark current-voltage (I-V) measurements were made on commercially available 0.2-2 Ω cm 170-μm n-type Cz c-Si wafers. The sample preparation involved surface damage removal with 25% tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) solution at 85 °C, followed by RCA chemical cleaning and SiO x tunnel silicon oxide (SiO x ) growth in 68 wt% HNO 3 acid at 110 °C for 15 min. The resulting tunnel SiO x thickness was ~1.4 nm, determined by spectral ellipsometry. Next, a 40 nm thick phosphorus-doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (n + -α-Si:H) layer was deposited on one side using a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposited (PECVD), followed by an 820 °C annealing for 30 min in an inert atmosphere to facilitate crystallization and dopant activation to turn the n + -α-Si:H into n + -poly-Si. After annealing, the front side metal contacts was realized by thermally evaporated Al dots through a shadow mask with various circular openings for different electrode areas and the back electrode was covered by GaIn to form an Ohmic contact with the n-type c-Si wafer. The sample structures were GaIn/n-c-Si/SiO x /n + -poly-Si/Al and GaIn/n + -c-Si/SiO x /Al, as described in Fig.  1 (a), (b). Similarly, the samples for the minority carrier lifetime (τ) measurements were made with the same SiO x and n + -poly-Si fabrication process on both sides of the wafers but without the metal contact as shown in Fig.  1(c ). The dark I-V characteristics were measured by a Keithley-4200 multi-function meter at the room temperature. The lifetime of the samples with different passivation layers were measured using a Sinton (WCT-120) system and the single-side reverse saturated recombination current density (J 0 ) and implied open-circuit voltage (iV oc ) were extracted from the measured photoconductive decays. The crystalline structure of the n + -poly-Si layer was measured using a Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia-reflex) with 325 nm excitation laser to ensure the laser only probes the coating layer and the influence from the substrate c-Si wafer is minimized. The active phosphorus profile in the TOPCon structure was determined using an electrochemical capacitance-voltage (ECV) system (Buchanan, CVP21). The TOPCon solar cells fabricated within this study have a designated area of 2 cm × 2 cm and are made of 0.2-2 Ω cm 170-μm n-type Cz c-Si wafers. The solar cell structure is shown in Fig.  1(d) . The front side of the solar cells features an alkaline textured (random-pyramids) surface with a boron-doped p + emitter (80 Ω/□). Next, the ∼ 1.4 nm tunnel oxide and the 40 nm n + poly-Si layers were grown on the rear side according to the process described above. Then a thin Al 2 O 3 was deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and a capped SiN x :H film was deposited by PECVD for front surface passivation and anti-reflection coating. The rear-side full-area electrode was fabricated by thermally evaporated Ag; the front-side grids were realized by lithography technology cooperating with an e-beam evaporated Cr/Pd/Ag seed layer and then thickened by electroplating. The solar cell performance was characterized by one-sun light J-V measurements under a Class AAA solar simulator (Oriel, Sol3A) under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW/cm 2 ) at 25 °C. C-AFM imaging  [19] [20] [21]  was based on the contact mode of AFM (Veeco D5000 and NSV controller) setup in an Ar glove box to prevent oxidation of the Si samples under a bias voltage during the imaging. The Si probe coated with Ti/Pt (Asylum Research AC240TM) was pressed onto the sample surface in a moderate force (~50 nN), and the current was measured using a low noise sensor in a current range of 1 pA-100 nA. The sample was biased in Vs = 0.5 V, and the probe was virtually grounded. The contact mode AFM and current images were simultaneously obtained. We used the AFORS-HET V2.5 simulation program to perform the numerical simulation  [22, 23]  of the transport properties of the designed devices as shown in Fig.  1 (a) and the light J-V curve of the TOPCon solar cells as shown in Fig.  1(d) . The structures and the parameters of the transport model and the TOPCon solar cell are presented in Table  1 (a) and (b), respectively. The optical absorption is described by the multiple reflections and coherence model. The carrier transport through the SiO x layer is described by the thermionic-emission/thermionic-field model and the quantum tunneling model. The default parameters of the electrical and optical layers are generally referred to the published work  [8, 9] . The definition of the pinhole is demonstrated as follows. The pinhole of SiO x is the micro hole through the ultrathin SiO x in essence, which is caused by the impurity diffusion or by the high-temperature annealing  [14, 15] . A proportion of bulk carriers will leak through the oxide because of pinholes. Mathematically, the pinhole density can be considered as the proportion of the carriers that leak through the oxide layer, which turns the 2D physics issue into the 1D mathematics manipulation. where t is the thickness, SRV the surface recombination velocity, N a and N d the acceptor concentration and donor concentration, τ the lifetime, Chi the electron affinity energy, E g the band gap, dk the relative dielectric constant, m e and m h the relative effective mass of electron and hole, D ph pinhole density through the insulator layer (dimensionless unit) as described above, and w/o means without. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN""}"
1358,44_5," Results and discussion We first checked the passivation quality of our TOPCon structure. Fig.  2 (a), (b) plot an example of photoconductive decay and lifetime distribution as a function of injection intensity of our optimized doubleside TOPCon passivated sample, from which τ = 1.24 μs (at n = 1 × 10 15 cm -3 ), J 0 = 6 fA/cm 2 and iV oc = 731 mV were obtained, indicating a high quality of surface passivation. Fig.  2(c)  and (d)  show the Raman spectra and the P doping profile, respectively. The Raman spectra show that the n-a-Si:H is in a pure amorphous phase without detectable crystalline features, it is fully crystallized with very little amorphous component remaining after the high temperature (820 °C) annealing. The ECV profile reveals that the P doping concentration in the n + -poly-Si is about 4 × 10 20 cm -3 and a tail extends into the n-c-Si wafer as normally observed in TOPCon structures  [24] . From the analyses, we conclude that the TOPCon structure studied here could be a good rear side contact for high efficiency solar cell. Because the passivation is of high quality, the characterization results from this structure are meaningful for device analysis and optimization. We have systematically optimized our TOPCon solar cell design and fabrication processes and improved the cell efficiency to over 21%. Fig.  3  shows the light J-V and EQE curves of our best solar cell with an efficiency of 21.12%. The details of the solar cell optimization will be reported elsewhere. The primary purpose of showing the cell performance here is to demonstrate that the SiO x /n + -ploy-Si/Al TOPCon structure is indeed a device grade carrier-selective passivation junction and a reasonable good structure to study the carrier transport. We first take a simple approach to examine the carrier transport through the ultrathin SiO x layer in the TOPCon structure by dark J-V measurements. The two kinds of samples as described in the previous section were measured, where the GaIn layer forms a low resistance Ohmic contact with the n-type c-Si wafer. Thus, the J-V characteristics are dominated by the transport mechanism through the top contact formed by the n-c-Si/SiO x /n + -poly-Si/Al or n-Si/SiO x /Al, as shown in Fig.  1(a) . The carrier transport through such structures has been very well studied theoretically and experimentally because of the application of tunneling metal oxide semiconductor diodes (MOS or MIS)  [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . It has been shown that the J-V characteristic should have a diode behavior when the tunneling process through the SiO x layer can provide a high enough transport path and the current is limited by the junction in the semiconductor layer; but when the tunneling process current is smaller than the diode current at a higher positive bias and comes the limiting factor for the transport, the J-V curve would level off from the diode characteristic and become linear. However, if the carrier transport through pinholes is the main path, one would expect a linear behavior as if the pinholes are considered as micro-resistors. Therefore, by measuring the dark J-V characteristics of the structures mentioned above, one could find out if the tunneling is the only transport mechanism or additional transport paths exist. Accurately measuring the dark J-V is very tricky on the samples with high conductivity substrate and a special attention must be paid on We normalized the measured J-V with the electrode areas and obtained J-V curves and found that the curves do not coincide and large separations still exist even between the relatively large area electrodes, which indicates the current spreading has a large influence on the J-V characteristics. By comparing the slope of the I-V curves as shown in Fig.  4 (a), one can obtain the specific contact resistance or called contact resistivity from the plot of measured resistance versus the inverse of electrode area (1/S) as shown in Fig.  4(c ). For the sample used in Fig.  4 (a), the contact resistivity is 7.7 mΩ.cm 2 from the GaIn/n-c-Si/ SiOx/n + -poly-Si/Al sample, which is reasonably small and good enough for high efficiency TOPCon solar cells. Similarly the contact resistivity could be also obtained even if the I-V curves are not linear by taking the derivatives of the I-V curves at the low bias near zero. For the GaIn/n-c-Si/SiOx/Al sample, the contact resistivity is 771 mΩ cm 2 , which is larger than the sample with the n + -poly-Si contact layer. The most important observation is that a perfect linear Ohmic behavior is observed from the GaIn/n-c-Si/SiO x /n + -poly-Si/Al sample, but non-linear curves from the GaIn/n-c-Si/SiO x /Al sample. The results indicate that the carrier transport in the GaIn/n-c-Si/SiO x /n + -poly-Si/ Al structure is not a pure tunneling transport, while the J-V curve of the GaIn/n-c-Si/SiO x /Al looks like a mixture of a linear curve with a diode characteristic. The difference between the two samples is one with the n + -poly-Si contact layer and the other without the n + -poly-Si layer. We speculate that the nonlinear behavior from the GaIn/n-c-Si/SiO x /Al is caused by the band bending in the n-c-Si induced by the Al contact because of the different work functions, which normally forms a MOS diode. The imperfect of the diode characteristic in the sample without the n + -poly-Si layer is an indication of a second carrier path exists, and it could be through pinholes even without the n + -ploy-Si contact layer.  While the band bending occurs in the n + -poly-Si/Al interface in the sample with the n + -poly-Si layer, where Ohmic contact forms because the doping concentration in the n + -poly-Si is much higher than in the n-Si wafer. In addition, the diffusion of P through the SiO x into the c-Si wafer might also promote to form an Ohmic contact, which contributes to the difference between the samples with and without the n + -poly-Si layer. The key point is that the carrier transport through the ultrathin SiO x layer exhibits an Ohmic behavior, which confirms that the carrier transport through the ultrathin SiO x is not a simple tunneling process and additional paths such as through pinholes should be involved. To find out the additional transport channels through the insulating ultrathin SiO x layer, we did c-AFM measurements on the sample surface of c-Si/SiO x /n + -poly-Si without the Al contact. Fig.  5  shows an example of the c-AFM images. First, some current spikes are observed on the surface, which we believe the high current areas are the transport through the pinholes, or weak-insulating oxide areas where charge carriers can transport by hopping through defect state in the ultrathin SiO x layer, however, the weak-insulating areas are also referred ""pinhole"" through the paper. Second, the sizes of the pinholes are highly non-uniform, generally 2-10 nm in diameter. These measured pinhole sizes should be larger than the actual pinhole sizes because current routes through the pinholes spread out with a distance away from the pinholes in the n + -poly-Si layer. The measurements were taken with a small scan size of 120 nm by 120 nm to have a high resolution on the pinholes. Third, there are some non-uniformities from locations to locations on a sample, and therefore the statistics for estimation of the pinhole density is not very reliable, but a rough estimation gives the pinhole density in the order of 10 10 /cm 2 . Nevertheless, we may conclude that there are indeed some pinholes in the ultrathin SiO x in our TOPCon structure, which was used in real high-efficiency solar cells. We note that the surface morphology in this small scan area is relatively flat, with the roughness less than 2 nm and overall corrugation about 5 nm. This flat surface does not generate artifact of the current spikes as shown in the images that no correlation of the current and topography was observed. Although we have confirmed that quantum tunneling is not the only mechanism for carrier transport in the TOPCon solar cells and the transport through pinholes indeed exists, a remaining question is whether the transport through pinholes benefits for solar cell performance. If the pinholes are good for the solar cell performance, it needs to understand how much carrier transport through pinholes is the optimum for solar cell efficiency; but if the transport through pinholes is harmful to the cell performance, it is desired to figure out the tolerance level for the transport through pinholes. For this purpose, we did a systematic simulation study on the carrier transport in the TOPCon structure and the solar cell performance as a function of pinhole transport. Actually many simulation works have been reported in the literature  [23, 32, 33] . Steinkemper et al.  [32]  did a systematic simulation study of TOPCon solar performance as a function of various material and structure parameters such as the surface recombination speed and SiO 2 thickness with the assumption of the transport through tunneling only without considering the transport through pinholes. The contribution from Peibst et al.  [33]  considered the transport through pinholes, and studied the correlation between recombination saturation current J 0 and contact resistivity without the correlation to TOPCon solar cell performance. Here we are aiming the effluence of carrier transport through both tunneling and pinholes and study the correlation of TOPCon cell performance as a function of the degree of pinhole transport. First, we examine the case without any pinholes with the assumption of the pure tunneling transport. From the experimental results, we learned that TOPCon solar cell performance is affected by the SiO x properties such as fabrication process and layer thickness significantly, which agrees with the reported ones in the literature  [34] . Fig.  6  presents a set of simulation results for the carrier transport in the TOPCon structures as used for the J-V measurement in Fig.  4 (a), (b), where (a) and (b) are for the sample without the n + -poly-Si contact layer in the linear and semi-logarithmic, respectively; (c) and (d) are the same plots for the sample with the n + -ploy-Si contact layer. Noted that the simulation is one dimensional calculation and does not consider the lateral transport, and therefore no current spreading effect is included. For the sample without the n + -poly-Si layer, a set of diode characteristics is obtained for different SiO x thicknesses with the turn-on voltage increasing with the increase of the SiO x layer thickness. A perfect linear behavior in the low positive voltage in the semi-logarithmic plot indicates a perfect diode characteristic, and it levels off at high positive biases, indicating the tunneling cannot provide a high enough transport path and becomes the limiting factor for the current flow. This result agrees well with the analysis from Shewshun et al.  [26] ; the reverse saturated current density decreases significantly with the increase of the SiO x thickness; finally, for the case of no SiO x layer, an Ohmic  straight line is obtained. The situation for the sample with the n + -poly-Si contact layer shows three major differences from the results of no n +poly-Si contact layer sample. First, the forward current turns on at a much smaller voltage; second, the forward curves are no longer in a linear form in the semi-logarithmic plot, indicating an imperfect diode characteristic; third, the magnitude of the reverse saturated current density is significantly higher than from the sample without the n +poly-Si contact layer. The key points that we learned from the simulation results are that a non-linear rectification behavior is obtained when an ultrathin SiO x is inserted between the c-Si wafer and the back metal contact, and the transport property is sensitive to the thickness of the SiO x layer. As observed experimentally, a linear behavior forms in the TOPCon contact with the SiOx layer that produces a good solar cell performance (Fig.  4 ), and the transport through pinholes exists from the c-AFM measurements (Fig.  5 ), we simulated the transport properties in the TOPCon structure including the transport through pinholes. Fig.  7  plots the simulated dark J-V curves of two sample structures as shown in Fig.  6  with various possibilities of transport through pinholes, where the SiO x thickness is fixed at 1.4 nm which is consistent with the value used in our real TOPCon solar cells. The plots of Fig.  7(a), (b ) are for the sample without the n + -poly-Si contact layer, where the introduction of the transport through pinholes shifts the turn-on voltage to small values, increases the reverse saturated current, and keeps the similar shape of the curves as if the SiO x layer is reduced by the pinholes. In addition, a linear part in the negative bias appears as the pinhole current increase, and it extends to large voltage range to form a linear Ohmic characteristic when the transport possibility through pinholes reaches to 10 -2 . Similar to the case of different SiO x thicknesses, the J-V curves of the GaIn/n-c-Si/SiO x /n + -poly-Si/Al sample do not show the perfect diode characteristics; a small magnitude of pinhole transport increases both the forward and reverse currently noticeably (10 -7 ); the linear behavior appears with a much smaller possibility of transport through pinholes than in the GaIn/n-c-Si/SiO x /Al sample, as shown in Fig.  7(c), (d) . When the possibility of pinhole transport is larger than 10 -4 , all of the simulated curves come together, implying the transport is limited by the bulk of the c-Si instead of the junction. From the simulation results, we find that although the transport through pinholes is one of the transport channels, and a small amount of pinhole transport already affects the dark J-V characteristics significantly, the major transport is still through the quantum tunneling, which is consistent with the recent dark J-V measurements at different temperatures  [18] . We also simulated the double-side passivated sample structure with 1.4 nm SiOx. The J 0 and iVoc values with different transport probabilities through pinholes are listed in Table  2 , with the comparison of measured values. It shows that the transport through pinholes increases the J 0 and reduces the iVoc, which means it degrades the passivation quality. From the transport study, we learn that in addition to the tunneling, the transport through pinholes affects the J-V characteristics of the junction significantly. Therefore, it is logical to expect the transport through pinholes could affect the real TOPCon solar cell performance. For this purpose, we simulated the solar cell performance as a function of the possibility of carrier transport through pinholes.  ), when the solar cells are with a SiO x layer of equal to or less than 1 nm, the FF is not affected by transport through pinhole. In this case, the ultrathin SiO x layer provides high enough tunneling current to allow most of the photo-carrier passing through the SiO x layer freely. However, when the solar cells have a SiO x layer of more than 1.4 nm, the FF will be changed significantly by the transport through pinholes. For the solar cells with relatively thick SiOx (1.4 nm and 1.6 nm), the pure tunneling transport cannot provide enough transport channels, limits the current flow, and results in a high series resistance (Rs) and a poor FF. With the introduction of the transport through pinholes, the Rs decreases and FF increases, hence efficiency increases as well to reach the maximum at the pinhole transport probability around 10 -5 to10 -4 . In the high pinhole transport region (> 10 -3 ), increasing the pinhole transport further, all of the three performance parameters (V oc , J sc , FF) start to drop for all of the SiO x thicknesses and leads to a decrease of efficiency. The observations can be explained by the simulation results of the transport through the TOPCon contact as an example shown in Fig.  7  with 1.4 nm SiOx. With the pure tunneling transport, the non-linear J-V characteristic shows a high derivative resistance, corresponding to a high series resistance, therefore results in a poor FF. When pinholes are included, in addition to the transport through tunneling, the carriers can also pass the ultrathin SiO x in TOPCon junction through pinholes, which reduces the Rs, and therefore, improves the FF and efficiency until reaching the maximum. However, increasing the pinhole transport further equivalently adds a shunt path and reduces the carrier built up at the junction under the open circuit condition, therefore reduces the V oc . Furthermore, the exceeding pinholes could also reduce the passivation quality, increase the interface recombination, and degrade the cell performance in reality. From the simulation study, we learn that a proper amount pinholes in the ultrathin SiO x passivation layer are needed for highefficiency TOPCon solar cells with a thick enough SiO x such as 1.4 nm, which is essential for improving the FF, however, a low V oc in real solar cells could indicate too much transport through pinholes in addition to other causes such as a poor passivation. Experimentally, how to select a proper SiO x thickness and control the pinhole density with the compromising the effective passivation, which needs a minimum SiO x thickness, to reduce the interface defect state and control the P diffusion through the SiO x layer into the c-Si bulk is a kind of technical art, and a significant effort is needed for the optimization of the material properties and device structure. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN""}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""21.12"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
1359,44_6," Summary In summary, the dark J-V measurements show a linear Ohmic behavior of carrier transport in the high-quality TOPCon junction used in our high-efficiency solar cells, implies that a separated transport path exists in addition to the quantum tunneling. The c-AFM measurements reveal some high current spikes over the area of the TOPCon junction, which are reasonable to be assigned to the transport through pinholes. Therefore, we conclude that the transport through pinholes is one of the transport mechanisms in TOPCon solar cells. From the dark J-V simulation studies, we learn that 1) as expected, the pure tunneling transport in the TOPCon structure without pinhole results in a diode characteristic in the low bias, indicating the tunneling can provide enough transport in this low bias condition, and levels off from the diode characteristics due to the limited tunneling possibility, which is in consistent with the theoretical analysis  [26] ; 2) the SiO x thickness affects the transport significantly; 3) the introduction of transport through pinholes increases both the forward and reverse current largely and essentially changes the transport into a linear Ohmic behavior; 4) the insertion of the n + -poly-Si contact layer increases both the tunneling current and the current through pinholes, which leads to the transition from rectification to linear at a much lower possibility through pinholes than the case without the n + -poly-Si contact layer. Furthermore, from the simulation of TOPCon solar cell performance as a function of pinhole transport, we observed that for the solar cells with a relatively thin SiO x (≤ 1.0 nm), the cell performance is not affected by the transport through pinholes in the low pinhole transport probability (< 10 -3 ) regime, but declines at the high hole transport probability (< 10 -3 ) regime. With a relatively thick SiO x (≥ 1.0 nm), the TOPCon solar cell without pinhole transport shows a poor FF with a high Rs. The introduction of pinholes improves the FF by reducing the Rs, and hence improves the efficiency. In our case, the possibility of transport through pinholes in 10 -4 results in the highest efficiency. Increasing the transport through pinholes further leads to a reduction of all performance parameters and efficiency. In the real experiments, how to select the SiOx thickness and control the pinhole density and the amount of transport through pinholes is a great challenge for high-efficiency TOPCon solar cells.

In the PL mapping images, the intensity of LOS film in the whole 10 × 10 µm 2 region was higher than that of control film (Supplementary Fig.  11 ), clarifying that the PbC 2 O 4 uniformly passivates the perovskite film. The carrier lifetimes are determined through fitting the TRPL decays to a mono-exponential function (Fig.  4b ). The LOS film shows a carrier lifetime of 5.2 μs which is much longer than the control film with a carrier lifetime of 0.9 μs, demonstrating the reduced nonradiative recombination at the surface. To study the effect of lead oxalate layer on the device performance, a conventional n-i-p structure of FTO/TiO 2 /SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au was adopted. We used formamidinium chloride (FACl) as the additive instead of methylamine hydrochloride (MACl) in the perovskite precursor to achieve better device performance since FACl can result into better crystalline quality and avoid broadening the bandgap of FAPbI 3  35  (detailed comparisons are shown in Supplementary Figs. 12-14). The IPA was selected as an antisolvent since it resulted in better crystal quality and higher preferred orientation in perovskite films in comparation with the diethyl ether (DE) or chlorobenzene (CB)  36  (Supplementary Figs.  15  and 16 ). The thickness of PbC 2 O 4 was carefully optimized through regulating the oxalic acid concentrations to well balance the defect passivation and charge transport (Supplementary Fig.  17 ). The cross-sectional SEM images of the post-optimized control and LOS devices are shown in Supplementary Fig.  18 . The typical current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the control and LOS devices are shown in Fig.  4c , with the extracted parameters given in Supplementary Table  3 . The control cell had a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.43% (22.94%) with a J sc of 25.75 mA cm -2 (25.74 mA cm -2 ), a V oc of 1.16 V (1.16 V) and a fill factor (FF) of 78.40% (76.69%) from reverse (forward) scan. The LOS PSC had a maximum PCE of 25.39% (24.79%) with a J sc of 25.77 mA cm -2 (25.77 mA cm -2 ), a V oc of 1.18 V (1.18 V) and an FF of 83.50% (81.52%) from reverse (forward) scan. The LOS device achieved a certified photovoltaic performance of 24.92% at a credible third-party photovoltaic laboratory (Supplementary Fig.  19 ). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) yielded an integrated J sc of 24.90 mA cm -2 for the control and 25.18 mA cm -2 for the LOS PSCs, respectively, which matched well with the measured J sc under AM 1.5 G standard  As shown in Fig.  4e , the relationship between V oc and light intensity was calculated to investigate the effect of PbC 2 O 4 on trapassisted surface recombination. The slope of the fitting line for LOS device was 1.16 k B T/q, which was lower than that of control device (1.31 k B T/q), confirming that LOS was beneficial to suppress the trapassisted surface recombination. We employed the space charge limited current (SCLC) technique to quantitatively measure the defect densities of the perovskite films through measuring the dark I-V curves of hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/spiro-OMe-TAD/Au), as shown in Fig.  4f . The trap densities were calculated through employing the formula of N t = 2ε 0 εV TFL /eL 2 , where ε is the relative dielectric constant of perovskite film, ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, V TFL is the trap filled limit voltage, e is the charge, and L is the thickness of the perovskite film (650 nm). The defect density of LOS device was calculated to be1.450 × 10 15 cm -3 , which was lower than that of the control device with 1.795 × 10 15 cm -3 . ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""formamidinium lead iodide"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""lead oxalate"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""550"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.39"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.92""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""formamidinium lead iodide"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""tin dioxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""lead oxalate"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""550"", ""control_pce"": ""23.43"", ""treated_pce"": ""25.39"", ""control_voc"": ""1.16"", ""treated_voc"": ""1.18"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.92""}}"

1471,2_59," Performance and stability of PSCs Figure  4a  shows the current density-voltage (J-V) curves and a summary of the cell parameters, such as the short-circuit current density (J SC ), V OC and fill factor for both the control and SIG60 devices with a FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/ Au structure (where spiro-OmeTAD is 2,2ʹ,7,7ʹ-tetrakis(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9ʹ-spirobifluorene and FTO is fluorinedoped tin(iv) oxide). The SIG60 device shows considerably improved V OC compared with the control device, thus yielding an improvement in the PCE from 22.39% to 24.59%. It also shows negligible J-V hysteresis and a stabilized power output at the maximum power point (Fig.  4a  and Supplementary Fig.  12 ) and a certified efficiency in terms of the J-V PCE (24.59%; J SC , 24.70 mA cm -2 ; V OC, 1.185 V; fill factor, 83.90%) and quasi-steady-state PCE (24.35%; J SC , 24.83 mA cm -2 ; V OC , 1.173 V; fill factor, 83.59%) without any encapsulation by Newport (Supplementary Fig.  13 ). As the 2D perovskite layer thickness increased from 0 nm (control) to 40 nm (SIG30) and 80 nm (SIG60), the V OC increased from 1.098 V to 1.117 V and 1.185 V, and the PCE increased gradually (Supplementary Table  4 ). The J SC values were similar-regardless of the thickness of the SIG-2D film-and were in accordance with the integrated J SC values from the external quantum efficiency spectra (Supplementary Fig.  14 ).

1490,124_7," Photovoltaic performance The photovoltaic performance of inverted p-i-n PSCs with control and polymer-modified perovskite films is shown in Fig.  3 . The device architecture is glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/ self-assembled [2-(3,6-dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (MeO-2PACz)/ perovskite/  [6, 6] -phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC 61 BM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/silver (Ag) (fig.  S17 ). Typical current-voltage (J-V) curves for the PSCs (Fig.  3A ) were measured with a device area of 18 mm 2 . The control PSCs had a PCE of 22.3%, with short-circuit current den-sity (J sc ) of 24.7 mA/cm 2 , V oc of 1.13 V, and fill factor (FF) of 80.2%. With b-pV2F, the device performance improved with a V oc of 1.18 V, a J sc of 24.8 mA/cm 2 , and a FF of 84.3% for a PCE of 24.6%. The target PSCs' reverse-and forward-sweep J-V curves (fig.  S18 ) had negligible hysteresis. A PCE of 24.2% for an aperture area of 9.6 mm 2 was obtained from the independent accredited certification institute of Test and Calibration Center of New Energy Device and Module, Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology (SIMIT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (fig.  S19 ). We also recorded a PCE of 23.1% for devices with a working area of 1 cm 2 (Fig.  3B ). From the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig.  3C ), we calculated an integrated J sc of 24.3 and 24.4 mA/cm 2 for control and target devices, respectively, comparable to the values extracted from the J-V curves. The optical bandgaps of both perovskite absorbers determined by the x axis intercept of the EQE linear are shown in fig.  S20    (31, 32) . The statistical distribution of the device parameters collected from 38 devices shows an improved PV performance and increased reproducibility with b-pV2F (fig.  S21 )  (33) , which we explain with better charge extraction and reduced nonradiative recombination  (27) . The stabilized power outputs at the maximum power point (MPP) are plotted in Fig.  3D . The control device showed a persistent attenuation in efficiency under continuous 1 equivalent sun illumination for 400 s. By contrast, the tracked target device yielded highly stable power output and even progressively improved performance, which we attributed to the lightsoaking effect  (34) . The stability of unencapsulated devices under working conditions shows that target PSCs retain 96% of the initial PCE after continuous MPP tracking for 1000 hours. By contrast, control PSCs decay to 84% of their original PCE (Fig.  3E ). Device stability statistics (n = 12) are presented in fig.  S22 . After heating the device to 75°C, 88% PCE was retained in the target device in contrast to only 56% in the control (fig.  S23 ). We further evaluated device stability against temperature variations. The J-V curves in fig.  S24  show that the control device's PV parameters (J sc , FF, and V oc ) exhibited large fluctuations when tested at temperatures ranging from -60°to +80°C (table  S1 ). However, this variation was suppressed in the target device (fig.  S25  and table S2 ). Furthermore, compared with the control, the target device had reduced hysteresis and its hysteresis factor was relatively stable under temperature variations (fig.  S26 ).

Sargent 1,2,7 * Inverted (pin) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) afford improved operating stability in comparison to their nip counterparts but have lagged in power conversion efficiency (PCE). The energetic losses responsible for this PCE deficit in pin PSCs occur primarily at the interfaces between the perovskite and the charge-transport layers. Additive and surface treatments that use passivating ligands usually bind to a single active binding site: This dense packing of electrically resistive passivants perpendicular to the surface may limit the fill factor in pin PSCs. We identified ligands that bind two neighboring lead(II) ion (Pb 2+ ) defect sites in a planar ligand orientation on the perovskite. We fabricated pin PSCs and report a certified quasi-steady state PCE of 26.15 and 24.74% for 0.05-and 1.04-square centimeter illuminated areas, respectively. The devices retain 95% of their initial PCE after 1200 hours of continuous 1 sun maximum power point operation at 65°C. T he certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has reached an impressive 25.7% (1). Nevertheless, the most-efficient PSCs, fabricated in the nip architecture, have yet to achieve the needed operating stability under accelerated aging tests (1, 2). Inverted (pin) PSCs, which do not rely on p-type dopants in their hole-transporting layers (3-7), have seen progress but, until now, still lag behind their nip counterparts: Their stabilized PCE has so far reached only 25.1%  (8) . The interfaces between the perovskite and the chargetransport layers limit the PCE of pin cells (9-11) through band misalignment  (12)  and energylevel pinning  (11) . These problems are aggravated by the presence of surface defects. For example, undercoordinated Pb 2+ ions  (13) (14) (15)  result in nonradiative recombination at the perovskite-charge transport layer interface, which limits photovoltage and fill factor (FF). Surface passivation of the perovskite active layer is used to suppress interface nonradiative recombination  (14, 16) . The efficacy of bulk additives as well as solution-based treatments with ammonium ligands is now well estab-lished  (17, 18) . However, these ligands bind at a single active binding site to the perovskite structure, and this has the potential to produce dense packing of passivants aligned perpendicular to the surface, introducing an unwanted resistive barrier between the perovskite and the electron transport layer (ETL)  (16, (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . We sought routes to passivate undercoordinated Pb 2+ at the surfaces and grain boundaries of the perovskite with passivator ligands aligning parallel to the perovskite surface instead. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": ""24"", ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""65"", ""time"": ""1200"", ""control_pce"": ""24"", ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""95%""}}"
1535,0_12," Optoelectronic characterization of perovskite films and device stacks To evaluate the passivation efficacy of each ligand, we studied photoluminescence (PL) of neat control and treated perovskite films. We observed an increase in PL quantum yield (PLQY) for each of the treated films and the full device stack (Fig.  2C ), with 4Cl-BZS exhibiting a twofold increase in PLQY (41%) compared with control films (20%), which corresponded to a projected 20-mV increase in quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS). The PLQY of full-device stacks [FTO/SAMs/perovskite/C 60 , where FTO is fluorinate tin oxide and SAMs (self-assembled monolayers) are mixtures of 2PACz and Me-4PACz] revealed a substantial improvement after 4Cl-BZS treatment-5% for 4Cl-BZS compared with 0.6% for the control, corresponding to 1.17 and 1.1 V in QFLS for 4Cl-BZS and the control device, respectively. This improvement was consistent with reduced interface losses. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) revealed a similar increase in carrier lifetimes after treatment. Specifically, 4Cl-BZS-treated films exhibited a weighted-average lifetime of 3.0 ms compared with 0.6 ms for the control film (Fig.  2D  and table  S1 ). We fabricated partial and full perovskite/ ETL device stacks to probe interface recombination and charge transfer. First, we conducted TRPL measurements of perovskite/C 60 stacks, wherein decay was dictated by nonradiative surface-bulk recombination (monoexponential decay), radiative recombination (second-order decay), and charge extraction effects, which could be distinguished if the time constants for each process differed sufficiently  (38) . The first interval at shorter times was dominated by the transfer of electrons from the bulk into the C 60 , and the second interval at longer delay times was dominated by interfacial recombination  (39) . The sharp drop in emission for 4Cl-BZS/C 60 indicated efficient electron transfer at the interface, and the longer second-order decay time was indicative of a reduced trap density compared with BZS and 4CH 3 -BZS (fig.  S7 ). This effect of this reduction was especially evident in fits to the TRPL traces to compute the differential lifetime as t = -{d ln[f(t)]/dt} -1 (Fig.  2E ), where f(t) is the time-dependent PL photon flux, because the sharpness of the rise implied the speed of the electron transfer from perovskite to C 60 . Transient photocurrent measurements of full device stacks in which we used mixed SAMs as the hole-transport layer (see methods) revealed a similar trend. Both BZS and 4CH 3 -BZS resulted in slower photocurrent decay, whereas 4Cl-BZS treatment led to faster photocurrent decay (Fig.  2F ). This observation suggested that electron extraction became more efficient. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) revealed an increased conduction band offset with C 60 that was caused by a Fermi-level upshift after BZS and 4CH 3 -BZS treatment, whereas 4Cl-BZS caused a Fermi-level downshift and reduced conduction band offset (figs. S8 and S9). This trend was further confirmed by kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements (fig.  S10  and table S2 ) and DFT calculations (fig.  S11 ). ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Cs 0.05 FA 0.85 MA 0.1 PbI 3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (4Cl-BZS)"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""65"", ""time"": ""1200"", ""control_pce"": ""24"", ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""95%""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Cs 0.05 FA 0.85 MA 0.1 PbI 3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""2PACz and Me-4PACz"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (4Cl-BZS)"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""65"", ""time"": ""1200"", ""control_pce"": ""24"", ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""95%""}}"
1537,0_16," Solar cell fabrication Single-junction normal bandgap device. Prepatterned Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses were cleaned using acetone and isopropanol each for 20 min in an ultrasonic bath, followed by ultraviolet ozone treatment for 30 min. The hole transport layer (HTL) was fabricated by using the mixed SAM solution of 2PACz and Me-4PACz in a glovebox. The 2PACz concentration is 0.17 mg ml -1 and Me-4PACz concentration is 0.33 mg ml -1 . The SAM in ethanol solution was spincoated on FTO at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by annealing at 120℃ for 10 min. The perovskite solutions were spin-coated at 1000 r.p.m for 10 s (acceleration rate 500 r.p.m./s) and 5000 r.p.m. for 35 s (acceleration rate 1000 r.p.m./s), respectively. At the last 15 s of the second step, 150 μL anisole was dropped as antisolvent. The films were then annealed at 120°C for 10 min. For the bimolecular passivation (BMP) treatment, 12 mM 3MTPAI and 6 mM PDAI2 was dissolved in 1 mL isopropanol/chlorobenzene (1:1 v/v) solvent and filtered before use, 120 μL mixed solution was spin-coated on the perovskite films at 4000 r.p.m for 25 s, followed by annealing at 100°C for 5 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the substrates were transferred to the evaporation system and a 25 nm C60 film was subsequently deposited on top by thermal evaporation at a rate of 0.2 A s -1 , after finishing the C60 deposition, the substrates were then transferred to the atomic layer deposition (ALD) system (Picosun) to deposit 20 nm SnO2 at 90 º C using precursors of tetrakis(dimethylamino) tin (iv) (99.9999%) and deionized water. Finally, 140 nm Ag electrode was evaporated by thermal evaporation. Single junction wide bandgap perovskite solar cells. NiOx nanocrystal (5 mg ml -1 in H2O and 2-Propanol mixed solvent with volume ratio of 3:1) layers were first spin-coated on ITO substrates at 3,000 rpm for 25 s in air without any post-treatment, then the substrates were immediately transferred to the glovebox. The NiOx nanoparticles were prepared via the hydrolysis reaction of nickel nitrate referring to our previous work  (3) . Me-4PACz (0.5 mg ml -1 ) in ethanol was spincoated on the NiOx film at 3,000 rpm for 25 s and then annealed at 100 o C for 10 min. For the perovskite film fabrication, the substrate was spun at 4000 rpm for 32 s with an acceleration of 1000 rpm, 100 μL Anisole was dropped onto the substrate during the last 8 s of the spinning. The substrates were then transferred onto a hotplate and heated at 100 °C for 15 min. For electron transport layer (ETL), 25 nm C60 was thermally evaporated on the perovskite films at a rate of 0.2 A s -1 under a high vacuum of ~10 -7 Torr, followed by 7 nm BCP evaporation as a hole-blocking layer. Finally, 140 nm Ag electrode was evaporated by thermal evaporation. Single junction Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells. PEDOT: PSS was spin-coated on ITO substrates at 6,000 rpm for 30 s and annealed on a hotplate at 160 °C for 20 min in ambient air. After cooling, we transferred the substrates immediately to a nitrogen-filled glovebox for the deposition of perovskite films. The perovskite films were deposited with a two-step spin-coating procedure: (1) 1,000 rpm for 10 s with an acceleration of 200 rpm s -1 , (2) 3800 rpm for 45s with an acceleration of 1000 rpm s -1 , 300 µl CB was dropped onto the spinning substrate during the second spin-coating step at 20 s before the end of the procedure. The substrates were then treated on hotplate for 10 min at 100 o C. 25 nm C60, 7 nm BCP and 140 nm Ag were sequentially deposited on top of the perovskite layer by thermal evaporation. Device testing. The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination from a solar simulator (Newport, Class A) with a light intensity of 100 mW cm -2 (checked with a calibrated reference solar cell from Newport). The J-V curves were measured in a nitrogen atmosphere with a scanning rate of 100 mV s -1 (voltage step of 10 mV and delay time of 200 ms). The active area was determined by the aperture shade mask (0.049 cm 2 for small-area devices, 1.04 cm 2 for large-area devices) placed in front of the solar cell. A spectral mismatch factor of 1.0 was used for all J-V measurements. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured in ambient air using the solar-cell-spectra-response measurement system (QE-R, EnliTech). Stability testing. Devices were placed in a homemade stability-tracking station. The illumination source is a UV-free white-light LED with its intensity calibrated to match 1-Sun conditions. The spectrum of the white-light LED simulator used in MPP stability tracking is in Supplementary Fig.  33  of our previous work  (26) . For the ISOS-L-3 ageing test, the device chamber was left open in a room with 50 ± 10% relative humidity, and the solar cell was mounted on a metal plate kept at 65 ˚C using a heating element. A thermal couple attached to the metal plate was used to monitor and provide feedback control to the heating element to ensure temperature consistency. For thermal stability tests, the encapsulated cells were heated at 85℃ in nitrogen. The device performance was evaluated periodically. Encapsulation was performed using a capping glass slide, with ultraviolet-adhesive (Lumtec LT-U001) as sealant. Crystallographic characterizations. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were measured on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer at room temperature using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 A) at 40 kV and 40 mA. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) was conducted on perovskite films at the Brockhouse X-ray Diffraction and Scattering Sector Low Energy Wiggler (BXDS-WLE) beamline of the Canadian Light Source (CLS) using a photon energy of 15.12 keV (λ = 0.82 Å). A Rayonix MX300 detector 328.04 mm away from the sample was used for collecting patterns. Other characterizations. NMR spectra were recorded by Bruker Avance III HD500. Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was collected by IONTOF M6 instrument using a primary 30 keV Bi ion source with an analysis area of 50 × 50 μm 2 . SEM images were collected by JEOL JSM-7900FLV microscope using a 5 keV and 10 keV electron beam for surface and cross-section images, respectively. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were carried out using a Horiba Fluorolog time-correlated single photon counting system with photomultiplier tube detectors. A pulsed laser diode (634 nm, 110-140 ps pulse width) was used as the excitation source for steady-state and transient measurements. The luminescence quantum yield was measured by a LuQY Pro System (Quantum Yield Berlin) under the excitation of 532 nm laser (100 mW). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were performed on Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi with an X-ray spot size of 500 μm. The XPS instrument was calibrated using silver metal, with the Ag 3d5/2 peak set at 368.2 eV. The sampling depth is 10 nm, and the spectrum remains unaffected by the underlying substrate. Throughout the XPS analysis, a low-energy electron gun was employed to flood the analysis area, neutralizing surface charges. In the post-processing phase, we standardized the adventitious carbon peak at 284.8 eV to calibrate all spectra and mitigate surface charging effects. We utilized an XPS optical microscope and observed particle aggregation on the substrate. The Xray spot, with a diameter of 400 µm, was precisely focused on an aggregated region with a thickness of several micrometers. The influence of the underlying substrate should be omitted from the analysis. Each sample was connected to the grounded sample holder using copper conductive tape. Additionally, charge compensation was performed prior to each measurement. Transient photocurrent (TPC) was conducted by the Fluxim Paios system. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) images were generated using an Asylum Cypher S atomic force microscope (Oxford Instruments) with a Ti-Ir-coated ASYELEC.01-R2 cantilever and k = 4 ± 0.5 N m -1 (Asylum Research). Scans were performed over 2 µm at 512 pixels and 0.5 Hz in a two-pass nap method, the first pass in tapping mode and the second in KPFM mode with a tip potential of 5 V and surface clearance of 5 nm. NMR analysis. We find (Fig.  S6A ) that C1 connecting the SO3 -unit shows the largest chemical shift. This we attribute to electron-withdrawal from the substituent. C4, located at the para position, shows the second largest chemical shift, which we assign to the conjugating effect. After the introduction of PbI2, the chemical shift of C1 moves to a higher field (-0.4), which we ascribe to the decrease of the electron-withdrawing capability of the substituent following coordination with PbI2. In contrast, the C4 peak shifts to a lower field (+0.22), which we ascribe to the enhancement of the conjugating effect after the coordination of SO3 -and PbI2  (40, 41) . Similar changes are observed for the methyl-substituted molecule (Fig.  S6B ). The change of the chemical shift is indicative of the strong interaction between SO3 -and PbI2. For the molecule with chlorine substituent Cl-BZS-PbI2, the change of the chemical shift of C1 and C4 after the interaction with PbI2 is reduced (-0.36, +0.1), indicating that the chlorine atom influences the electron density of the carbon atoms. To study the effect of the chlorine substituent in particular, we studied the NMR spectrum of chlorine benzene. As shown in Fig.  S6D , the peak of C4 connecting to the chlorine atom moves to a higher field after the addition of PbI2 (-0.09). This can be ascribed to the interaction between chlorine and PbI2 that reduces the electronwithdrawing character. The peak of C1 moves to lower field due to the enhancement of the conjugating effect (+0.03). These shifts indicate interactions between the chlorine and lead, as expected. For the molecule with both chlorine and SO3 -substituents (Fig.  S6C ), the movement of the chemical shift is reduced compared to BZS-PbI2, and the overall movement of the peak position in 4Cl-BZS+PbI2 is almost consistent with the sums of the shifts observed for single SO3 -and Cl substituents  (42) . This indicates the interaction of both SO3 -and Cl with PbI2. First-principles calculations. First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)  (43) . For the exchange-correlation functional, the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional (PBE) (44) was adopted. DFT-D3 method was used for the van der Waals (vdW) correction  (45) . Dipole corrections were taken into consideration in the work function calculations. The plane-wave cutoff energy was 400 eV. The energy and force convergence criteria were set to 10 -5 eV and 0.03 eV• Å -1 , respectively. The adsorption energies (Eads) of C60 with different molecules (BZS, 4CH3-BZS and 4Cl-BZS) adsorbed perovskite surface were calculated as E(C60@perovskite)-E(C60)-E(perovskite). The electrostatic potentials (φ) of the passivators were calculated in the Gaussian 09 package at the B3LYP/def2TZVP level with DFT-D3.

1584,13_2,"Introduction Metal halide perovskite materials have attracted enormous attention from both the academic and industrial communities due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. After a decade of intensive research, the best certified efficiency of a single-junction perovskite solar cell (PSC) has already reached 25.7%.  [1]  In addition, the broadly tunable bandgaps (≈1.17-3.10 eV) of perovskites make them ideal materials for constructing tandem solar cells (TSCs), which is a feasible approach to exceed the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit for single-junction solar cells.  [2]  The past 5 years have witnessed a rapid advance in perovskite-based TSCs, surpassing the highest efficiency of single-junction building blocks.  [3]  For instance, monolithic perovskite/Si TSCs have achieved a certified power conversion Among various types of perovskite-based tandem solar cells (TSCs), all-perovskite TSCs are of particular attractiveness for building-and vehicle-integrated photovoltaics, or space energy areas as they can be fabricated on flexible and lightweight substrates with a very high power-to-weight ratio. However, the efficiency of flexible all-perovskite tandems is lagging far behind their rigid counterparts primarily due to the challenges in developing efficient widebandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells on the flexible substrates as well as their low open-circuit voltage (V OC ). Here, it is reported that the use of self-assembled monolayers as hole-selective contact effectively suppresses the interfacial recombination and allows the subsequent uniform growth of a 1.77 eV WBG perovskite with superior optoelectronic quality. In addition, a postdeposition treatment with 2-thiopheneethylammonium chloride is employed to further suppress the bulk and interfacial recombination, boosting the V OC of the WBG top cell to 1.29 V. Based on this, the first proof-of-concept four-terminal all-perovskite flexible TSC with a power conversion efficiency of 22.6% is presented. When integrating into two-terminal flexible tandems, 23.8% flexible all-perovskite TSCs with a superior V OC of 2.1 V is achieved, which is on par with the V OC reported on the 28% all-perovskite tandems grown on the rigid substrate. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""2-thiopheneethylammonium chloride"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.29"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
1585,13_3," (2 of 12) efficiency (PCE) of 31.3%, and perovskite-based thin-film TSCs, such as perovskite/organic, perovskite/copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), and perovskite/perovskite (all-perovskite) tandem solar cells (TSCs) also reached certified efficiencies of 23.4%, 24.2%, and 28%, respectively.  [1, 4]  Among these perovskite-based tandem technologies, all-perovskite TSCs are of particular interest as they could be deposited on flexible and lightweight substrates using low-temperature solution processing methods (such as slot-die coating, inkjet printing, etc.), which are compatible with high throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing, and thus promises very low manufacturing cost and low carbon footprint.  [5]  However, there are two major challenges that need to be overcome to realize efficient all-perovskite solar cells on flexible substrates. First, the uniform deposition of functional layers onto the flexible substrates is more challenging than on the rigid glass due to the generally rougher surface and inferior mechanical robustness of flexible substrates. Up to now, there are only two reports on flexible all-perovskite TSCs which yielded 21.3% and 24.4% (certified) efficiency, respectively, much lower than the best value of an all-perovskite TSC (28%) reported on a rigid glass substrate.  [4, 6, 7]  Another major challenge is the notable loss in open-circuit voltage (V OC ) in the widebandgap (WBG) PSCs, which largely limits the progress of allperovskite TSCs.  [8]  The large V OC -deficit (defined as E g /q-V OC ) in WBG PSCs is commonly attributed to the relatively low initial radiative efficiency of the cells due to the high defect densities within the perovskite absorber layer and at the perovskite/charge selective layer interface. Over the past years, many approaches, including compositional engineering,  [9] [10] [11] [12]  additive engineering,  [13] [14] [15]  interfacial engineering,  [16] [17] [18]  and mixed-dimensional engineering,  [19] [20] [21] [22]  have been explored and the V OC -deficit has been reduced to values as low as 0.37 V in PSCs with bandgap (≈1.72 eV) suitable for perovskite-Si tandems.  [23]  However, extending these strategies to mitigate the V OC -deficit in perovskites with even wider bandgaps (≈1.80 eV) that are required for two-terminal (2T) all-perovskite tandems remains very challenging. This manifests as the relatively large V OC -deficit of ≈550 mV in WBG perovskite subcell used in the recently reported 26.4% monolithic all-perovskite TSCs.  [24]  Here, we report a V OC -deficit of merely 480 mV in nearinfrared (NIR) transparent WBG PSCs grown on flexible polymer foil by simultaneously reducing the V OC losses in perovskite bulk and at charge selective layer/perovskite heterojunctions. By replacing the conventional hole transport layer (HTL) poly-triarylamine (PTAA) with [2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl] phosphonic acid (2PACz),  [25]  the perovskite absorber deposited on a flexible polymer foil shows better optoelectronic quality and uniformity, translating to ≈40 mV gain in V OC for flexible NIR-transparent PSCs. Further passivating the perovskite with a postdeposition treatment (PDT) with 2-thiopheneethylammonium chloride (TEACl), the V OC of the flexible devices was improved by ≈100 mV. With optimized TEACl PDT, we achieved a maximum efficiency of over 15% with a V OC of 1.29 V for a flexible NIR-transparent WBG PSC with a 1.77 eV bandgap, corresponding to a low V OC -deficit of 480 mV. To the best of our knowledge, this is the lowest V OC -deficit that has been achieved with a bandgap of ≈1.80 eV on both rigid and flexible substrates. Combined with a flexible narrow bandgap (NBG) PSC, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept four-terminal (4T) TSC with a best PCE of 22.6%. Furthermore, we also achieved an all-perovskite 2T TSC with a remarkable V OC of 2.1 V and a PCE of 23.8%. We note that this is the highest V OC for 2T flexible allperovskite TSCs reported so far, demonstrating a further step toward achieving high-performance lightweight TSCs with a reduced V OC -deficit. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""2-thiopheneethylammonium chloride"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.29"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""2-thiopheneethylammonium chloride"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.29"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}, ""test_1_2"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""23.8"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.29"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
1587,13_6," (4 of 12) at this magnification. The dashed rectangular area highlights the uniform film formation of PCBM and ZnO layers, which can also be distinguished by the signals of C and Zn in the EDX mapping. Here, chloroform (CF) was used as the solvent for the PCBM instead of commonly employed chlorobenzene (CB), as we observed a nonuniform deposition of the PCBM layer with CB. The analogous HAADF-STEM image and EDX mapping results for the cross-section of the device based on CB-processed PCBM are shown in Figure  S5  (Supporting Information). A thick PCBM layer was obtained with CF as a solvent while CB-processed PCBM is mostly thinner with a poor coverage. A possible explanation could be that CF exhibits a much lower boiling point (61.2 °C) than that of the CB (131.0 °C), which contributes to much faster evaporation during the fast spin-coating and forms a thicker and smoother PCBM layer.  [28]  Importantly, the better PV performance in case of the CF-processed PCBM is consistent with the improved morphology of the PCBM layer (Figure  S6 , Supporting Information). After the optimization of both the HTL and the ETL, we now targeted a reduction of interfacial recombination losses between these transport layers and the perovskite by means of surface passivation. In this regard, 2D perovskites are known to be very effective at reducing the interfacial recombination losses and to improve the performance of PSCs.  [29]  To form a 2D perovskite on top of our 1.77 eV perovskite, we implemented the molecule TEACl, which has been previously used to create a 2D perovskite on top of a 1.68 eV perovskite.  [22]  Briefly, the TEACl PDT is performed by directly spin-coating TEACl solution onto the perovskite film, followed by a short annealing to dry the film (100 °C for 3 min). To optimize the performance, we varied the concertation of the molecule in an isopropanol solution and found that the PV performance of the devices was strongly affected, especially the V OC and the short-circuit current density (J SC ). The box charts of the PV parameters extracted from reverse scan of J-V curves are presented in Figure  S7  (Supporting Information). As shown in Figure  S7A  (Supporting Information), an ≈100 mV V OC improvement is observed for all the post-treated devices, indicating that TEACl PDT, regardless of the concentration, can effectively mitigate certain nonradiative pathways. Moreover, the J SC of the device increased significantly with an increasing concentration of TEACl PDT of up to 0.5 mg mL -1 , and then gradually decreased at higher concentrations (>0.5 mg mL -1 , Figure  S7B , Supporting Information). This change of the J SC is confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements, as shown in Figure  S8  (Supporting Information). Overall, 0.5 mg mL -1 of TEACl PDT effectively increases the PCE of the flexible NIR-transparent WBG PSC, mainly due to the largely improved V OC . As the J-V curves shown in Figure  1D , the best PCE from this group (hereafter referred to as PDT) is 15.1%, with a V OC of 1.29 V, a J SC of 15.0 mA cm -2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 77.9%, while the best device without TEACl PDT (hereafter referred to as reference) has an efficiency of 13.1%, with a V OC of 1.191 V, a J SC of 14.6 mA cm -2 , and a FF of 75.4% from the reverse scan. It is worth to note that the device from the PDT group show a negligible hysteresis while for the reference device the hysteresis factor is 4.6%. The relatively large hysteresis for the reference device is mainly due to the large FF difference from the reverse and forward scans (75.4% vs 72.6%). The much reduced FF difference of the PDT device (77.9% vs 77.8%) can be attributed to an improved charge transportation between perovskite and PCBM due to the insert of TEACl. The dark current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics are provided in Figure  S9  (Supporting Information). The superior V OC of 1.29 V for the PDT device is the highest value reported so far for a perovskite bandgap around 1.80 eV. The steady-state power output at the maximum power point (MPP) of the reference and PDT devices, shown in Figure  S10  (Supporting Information), is consistent with the results from J-V scans. With light-intensity dependent V OC measurements (Figure  S11 , Supporting Information), we extracted a smaller diode ideality factor n = 1.25 for the PDT device than that of the reference device (n = 1.45), which suggests a better diode quality and less nonradiative recombination for the device after a TEACl PDT.  [30]  In addition to the enhanced PV performance, the optimized device also shows good NIR-transparency. Figure  1E  shows the transmittance and reflectance spectra of the PDT device. The average visible transmittance of our flexible NIR-transparent device has been calculated to be 4.6%.  [31]  The full device demonstrates a high transmittance in the range of ≈720-880 nm (>80%) and ≈880-1100 nm (>70%), suggesting its great potential in the application of TSCs. Compared with previously reported V OC values of WBG (≈1.80 eV) PSCs used in all-perovskite TSCs, our flexible and NIR-transparent device delivers the highest V OC and the lowest V OC -deficit as shown in Figure  1F ; and Table  S2  (Supporting Information). We also checked the thermal and light-soaking stability of the encapsulated reference and PDT devices (see the Experimental Section for more details) as shown in Figure  S12  (Supporting Information). For the thermal stability test performed at 60 °C in ambient air, the PDT device retained ≈92% of its initial PCE after 265 h of thermal stressing, whereas the reference device only kept ≈82% after same period of testing. With continuous maximum power point tracking (MPPT), we observed that the PDT device could maintain ≈80% of its initial efficiency after ≈195 h, while the reference showed much faster degradation (T80: ≈9 h). These results clearly show that TEACl PDT not only helps to stabilize the device at a relatively high temperature, but also significantly improves the photostability of the device under light-soaking condition. To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of TEACl PDT on the performance of our WBG PSCs, we performed a detailed study on the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite films and devices with various concentration of TEACl. From the absorption spectra and Tauc plots (Figure  S13 , Supporting Information), an identical bandgap (≈1.77 eV) was obtained from perovskite films with and without 0.5 mg mL -1 TEACl PDT due to the negligible contribution of the surface layer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images indicate a negligible effect of the PDT on the perovskite domain sizes. But at high TEACl concentrations (1.5 and 2 mg mL -1 ), some black areas are observed on top of the perovskite films (Figure  S14 , Supporting Information), which indicates that there are regions of different work function. These could be an accumulation of unreacted TEACl molecules on the surface. From atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization, we found that the TEACl PDT tends to result in a rougher perovskite surface (Figure  S15 , Supporting Information).

1589,13_9," (7 of 12) by using linear extrapolation. The determined energy level diagrams of the perovskite film surface are presented in Figure  2G . In particular, we observe a change in surface bandgap by REELS from 1.86 eV (reference) to 2.43 eV (2 mg mL -1 TEACl PDT), whereby the latter value is in good agreement with optical measurements for bulk TEA 2 PbI 4 , which has a reported bandgap of 2.33 eV.  [22]  The modification of the surface band structure of the perovskite with the 2D phase is likely beneficial to suppress the charge recombination at the interface between the perovskite and electron transport layer. To gain a better understanding on whether the TEACl stays only on the perovskite film surface or there is any diffusion to the bulk, we performed XPS depth profiling for the perovskite film with the TEACl PDT. As evident from Figure  3A , the sulfur, which is exclusively found in the TEA + moiety, was only detected within the near surface area of the film and the signal quickly vanished with sputtering, indicating there is no TEA present in the bulk. In contrast to this, the Cl was detected not only at the perovskite surface but also found throughout the perovskite film. To confirm this observation, we further performed time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) depth profiling, which has a higher sensitivity than XPS for small amounts of different elements. As shown in Figure  3B , the S -signal shows again a sharp decay at the surface, while Cl -has diffused into the bulk of the perovskite, fully consistent with the XPS depth profiling results (Figure  3A ; and Figure  S21 , Supporting Information). We therefore can conclude that the TEA + moiety, represented by the S element, is confined to the surface where it likely forms a 2D perovskite phase on top of the perovskite film. While the majority of the Cl seems to stay on the surface as well, some diffuse throughout the perovskite film and might lead to an improvement of the quality of the bulk perovskite.  [36, 37]  Having clarified the effect of the TEACl treatment on the composition and electronic structure of the perovskite film, it is of interest to gain insight into the influence of TEACl PDT on the recombination kinetics of the perovskite films. Therefore, we measured the steady-state PL and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) for the perovskite films with and without 0.5 mg mL -1 TEACl PDT. As shown in Figure  3C , the perovskite film with PDT showed a much stronger PL emission than the reference one, manifesting an effective defect passivation effect with TEACl. The TRPL results in Figure  3D  further confirmed this since the fitted effective carrier lifetime for the PDT film was 474 ns, which presents a significant increase compared to 278 ns for the reference film. This strongly indicates a reduced nonradiative recombination for the perovskite film with TEACl PDT. The improved carrier lifetime indicates that the TEA + moiety at the surface is likely to be effective in suppressing the defective states at the perovskite surface.  [38]  For Cl, both surface and bulk passivation are possible, considering the extended diffusion of Cl into the layer and its well-reported passivation effect.  [39]  In addition, absolute PL measurements for different stack layers were carried out to break down the effect of the TEACl PDT on the V OC improvement. As shown in Figure  3E , we see that TEACl PDT improves the QFLS for all the stacks, both partial and full. The perovskite grown on the PEN foil exhibits a QFLS value of 1.34 V. After the TEACl PDT, the QFLS increases to 1.39 eV, consistent with the suppression of nonradiative recombination on the perovskite surface. However, for the partial cell stacks with both the HTL (2PACz), and the ETL (PCBM) present, the QFLS values are much lower than the bare perovskite layer on glass, indicating that both the interfaces limit the V OC , in particular, the perovskite/PCBM interface imposes the biggest QFLS deficit in both the reference and the PDT sample, which is also consistent with the fact that the QFLS of the pin-stack with both transport layers present is nearly identical to the QFLS of the perovskite/ETL stack. Clearly, the PDT is very effective at reducing the recombination induced by the ETL layer which leads to the enhanced V OC .  [40]  Moreover, Figure  3E  shows that there is a significant difference between the QFLS value of the reference pin sample and the V OC of the complete device. This behavior can for example be explained by an internal bending of the electron quasi-Fermi level, which affects primarily the V OC of the complete device rather than the QFLS in the perovskite layer. Considering that the internal QFLS value is significantly higher than the external V OC in the reference device, an energy misalignment between the perovskite and PCBM layer is suggested. With the application of the TEACl PDT, the QFLS-V OC difference is strongly reduced, which suggests an improved energy alignment between the perovskite and PCBM.  [41]  Finally, to demonstrate the potential of the flexible NIRtransparent WBG PSCs, we integrate them into flexible allperovskite TSCs in both 4T and 2T configurations. Figure  4A  shows the schematics of a 4T tandem device structure. NBG PSC used in 4T tandems is based on an architecture of PEN/ ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(FASnI 3 ) 0.6 (MAPbI 3 ) 0.4 /C 60 /BCP/Cu and it shows a PCE of 18.2%. An overall tandem PCE of 22.6% (15.1% from the top cell plus 7.5% from the filtered bottom cell) has been achieved. The J-V curves of the 4T tandem are shown in Figure  4B  with detailed PV parameters summarized in Table  S3  (Supporting Information), and the MPP tracking efficiency of the 4T tandem is shown in Figure  S22  (Supporting Information). The corresponding EQE spectra are also depicted in Figure  4C  with integrated J SC values inserted. Notably, we report the best efficiencies for both the 1.24 and 1.77 eV bandgap single-junction flexible PSCs as compared in Figure  S23  (Supporting Information). To go one step further, we also fabricated 2T all-perovskite flexible TSCs. Figure  4D  shows a SEM image for the cross-section of our 2T flexible tandem device. The top cell and bottom cell are connected using atomic-layerdeposited SnO 2 and sputtered ITO. Figure  4E  presents the J-V curve of our best-performing 2T flexible TSC (0.09 cm 2 ). Benefiting from the significantly suppressed V OC -deficit with TEACl PDT for the WBG subcell, a high V OC of 2.1 V has been achieved in the 2T all-perovskite flexible TSC with a J SC of 15.1 mA cm -2 , a FF of 75.1% and a PCE of 23.8%. The steady-state power output of the 2T device shown in Figure  S24  (Supporting Information), is consistent with the J-V efficiency. We have also cross-checked the J-V performance of the 2T device at EPFL PV-lab as shown in Figure  S25  (Supporting Information). Notably, the V OC of 2.1 V of our flexible 2T TSC is higher than the V OC of the best performing rigid tandem (2.03 V) and flexible (2.0 V) tandem devices reported to date.

Samples for optical absorption spectrum measurements were performed with perovskite films and corresponding TEACl PDTs on white glasses. Device Fabrication for WBG PSC: Prepatterned PEN/ITO substrates were first fixed onto rigid substrates with UV epoxy and then cleaned with ethanol and dried with N 2 flow. Before device fabrication, the substrates were further cleaned by UV/Ozone treatment (Jelight Company Inc.) for 30 min. 2PACz precursor (0.3 mg mL -1 in ethanol, preheated at 55 °C) was spin-coated onto the cleaned ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s after 1 min resting on the substrate. The same spin-coating step is performed twice to ensure a full coverage of 2PACz on the substrate, followed by an annealing at 100 °C for 5 min to remove the solvent. As a comparison, PTAA (5 mg mL -1 in CB) was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate at 5000 rpm for 30 s, followed by an annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling, perovskite solution was spin-coated onto the substrate by a two-step spin-coating. The first step is 2000 rpm for 10 s with a ramp-up of 200 rpm s -1 . The second step is 6000 rpm for 40 s with a ramp-up of 2000 rpm s -1 . Diethyl ether (300 µL) was dropped onto the spinning substrate at the 20 s of the second step. The substrate was then annealed at 60 °C for 2 min and 100 °C for 7 min. TEACl PDTs were carried out by dissolving TEACl in IPA with varied concentration (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 mg mL -1 ) and spin-coating onto the perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by an annealing at 100 °C for 3 min. After cooling, PCBM in CB or CF was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 50 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Thereafter, ZnO nanoparticles was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 50 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 1 min. The substrates were then transferred to sputter chamber for the deposition of IZO electrode at a pulsed DC power of 200 W.

After the perovskite deposition, the samples were transferred into vacuum chamber for the thermal evaporation of C 60 (20 nm) and BCP (7 nm) layers, finished by evaporation of Cu (100 nm). For each substrate there are four devices. The designed contact area of each device is 0.1024 cm  2  . The illuminated area of the device was defined with a patterned mask (0.09 cm 2 ). All spin-coating was carried out in N 2 -filled glove box. Device Fabrication for NBG PSC: The prepatterned PEN/ITO substrates were first fixed onto rigid substrates with UV epoxy and then cleaned with ethanol and dried with N 2 flow. Before device fabrication, the substrates were further cleaned by UV/Ozone treatment (Jelight Company Inc.) for 30 min. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the cleaned substrate at 4000 rpm for 50s and then annealed at 120 °C for 20 min. Then the substrates were transferred into N 2 -filled glove box. (FASnI 3 ) 0.6 (MAPbI 3 ) 0.4 perovskite precursor was prepared as reported in previous work.  [42]  The FASnI 3 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 372 mg SnI 2 , 172 mg FAI, and 7.84 mg SnF 2 in 424 µL DMF and 212 µL DMSO. The MAPbI 3 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 461 mg PbI 2 and 159 mg MAI, and 11.3 mg Pb(SCN) 2 ) in 630 µL DMF and 70 µL DMSO. Before mixing, the precursors were filtered with 0.22 um hydrophobic PTFE filters. Then stoichiometric amounts of FASnI 3 and MAPbI 3 perovskite precursors were mixed to obtain the (FASnI 3 ) 0.6 (MAPbI 3 ) 0.4 precursor solution. The perovskite solution was spin-coated onto the substrate by a two-step spin-coating. The first step is 1000 rpm for 10 s with a ramp-up of 1000 rpm s -1 . The second step is 5000 rpm for 50 s with a ramp-up of 10 000 rpm s -1 . Diethyl ether (700 µL) was dropped onto the spinning substrate at the 5 s of the second step. The substrate was then annealed at 65°C for 3 min and 105 °C for 7 min.

The samples were then encapsulated with cavity glasses and UV epoxy. Device Fabrication for 2T Tandem: All the procedures are the same for the WBG subcell until PCBM deposition is finished. The substrates were then transferred to ALD chamber for SnO 2 deposition (≈20 nm) at relative low temperature (100 °C) by periodic pulse of tetrakis(dimethylamino) tin(IV) (99.9999%, Nanjing Ai Mou Yuan Scientific Equipment Co., Ltd) and deionized water. After ALD-SnO 2 deposition, the substrates were transferred to the magnetron sputtering system to sputter 100 nm ITO at a 30 W power under an Ar pressure of 0.4 Pa. Then, PEDOT:PSS diluted with IPA (volume ratio 1:1) was spincoated onto the sputtered ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 50 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 5 min in air. Next several steps to fabricate 2T tandem devices were consistent with those of fabrication of NBG PSCs. Film Characterization: The SEM images were taken with Hitachi S-4800 Scanning Electron Microscope using 5-10 kV acceleration voltage. The XRD patterns were measured on an X″Pert Pro (PANanalytical) in Bragg-Brentano geometry using Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), scanning from 2° to 60° (2θ) with a step interval of 0.0167°. The AFM images were obtained using an AFM microscope (Bruker ICON3) in air. A silicon nitride tip (ScanAsyst-air) with a radius of 10 nm was used as the probe. The cantilevers″ spring constant and resonant frequency were 0.4 N m -1 and 70 kHz, respectively.

1625,133_37," Photovoltaic performance of PSCs Experimentally, we took five bifunctional PH anions with higher E b for further investigation. We dissolved PH anion salts in a solution of isopropanol (IPA), which we spin coated on perovskite films at 0.5 mg ml -1  (Supplementary Fig.  12 ) and then annealed at 100 °C (Methods). We then fabricated inverted PSC devices without and with PH anion treatments (Fig.  4a ). We employed Cs 0.05 FA 0.9 MA 0.05 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 perovskite with a bandgap of 1.55 eV as the absorber. The PSCs had an inverted device architecture of ITO/NiO x /Me-4PACz/perovskite/C 60 /BCP/Ag, where ITO is indium tin oxide, Me-4PACz is [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carb azol-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid, C 60 is fullerene and BCP is bathocuproine. In PSCs with an inverted (p-i-n) device structure, the interface between the perovskite layer and the electron transport layer (ETL) has been proven to be the most crucial to device performance due to substantial interfacial non-radiative recombination  22, 23  . This motivated us to focus on the use of a PH anion passivation layer at the perovskite/ ETL interface. Figure  4b  shows the current density-voltage (J-V) curves for control versus five PH anion-treated devices under forward and reverse scanning. It reveals that sodium thioglycolate (ST) performed the best, though all five PH anions showed improved performance over controls. This we attributed to the optimal bifunctional passivation effect of thioglycolate. Both control and PH anion-treated devices exhibit low hysteresis. Figure  4c  shows device performance statistics using five different PH anion treatments (ST (ligand 14); sodium chlorate (SC) (ligand 2); potassium bicarbonate (PB) (ligand 7); sodium hydroxyacetate (SH) (ligand 13); and monosodium methylphosphonate (MMP) (ligand 12)). We found that the V OC and PCE of these five PH anion-treated devices followed the order: ST best, SC worst, and SH, MMP and PB were in between. This sequence is consistent with the order of the calculated ΔE f (I Pb ) of Fig.  3a : ST > SH > MMP > PB > SC. The role of sodium was discussed in Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Figs.  13  and 14 . In ST-treated devices, V OC and the fill factor (FF) were the basis of the improvement, with J SC remaining effectively unchanged. V OC improved from 1.14 V in control to 1.19 V in ST-treated devices and FF increased from 81.9% to 83.6% (see detailed photovoltaic (PV) parameters in Fig.  4b ). The ST-treated devices had a considerably higher stabilized power output of 24.2% compared with 22.5% for the controls (Supplementary Fig.  15 ).

1662,129_42," Yes No For thermal stability, the unencapsulated devices were aged under continuous heating at 65±5 °C in N2 atmosphere. The long-term operational stability of the unencapsulated cells were tracked through the high throughput solar cell lifetime test system from CRYSCO cooperation with maximum power point tracking under LED simulated AM 1.5 spectrum in an N2-filled glovebox. Duration between two test is 300 s. Improving the intrinsic film quality of metal halide perovskites is very critical to increase the power conversion efficiency and long-term stability of perovskite solar cells. Here we report a multifunctional, non-volatile additive that can be used to modulate the kinetics of perovskite film growth through a hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate phase. The additive enables the formation of large perovskite grains and coherent grain growth from bottom to the surface of the film. The enhanced film morphology results in significantly reduced non-radiative recombinations, thus boosting the power conversion efficiency of inverted (p-i-n) solar cells to 24.8% (24.5% certified) with a low energy loss of 0.36 eV. The unencapsulated devices exhibit improved thermal stability with a T 98 lifetime beyond 1,000 h under continuous heating at 65 ± 5 °C in a nitrogen-filled glovebox.

1697,36_2,"Introduction Since their discovery in 2009 perovskite solar cells have spurred enormous interest due to highly impressive power conversion efficiencies (in excess of 25%)  [1]  with the use of far less stringent manufacturing techniques and more impure materials than other technologies. In order to achieve such high performance, the community has adopted the key principle that to reach the full potential of perovskite solar cells, one must minimize nonradiative recombination in the device.  [2, 3]  This will in turn decrease dark currents and increase open circuit voltage (V OC ). In general, perovskite solar cells can be classified into two architecture types, nip and pin, where the difference is defined by the order of deposition of the electron Perovskite semiconductors are an attractive option to overcome the limitations of established silicon based photovoltaic (PV) technologies due to their exceptional opto-electronic properties and their successful integration into multijunction cells. However, the performance of single-and multijunction cells is largely limited by significant nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/organic electron transport layer junctions. In this work, the cause of interfacial recombination at the perovskite/C 60 interface is revealed via a combination of photoluminescence, photoelectron spectroscopy, and firstprinciple numerical simulations. It is found that the most significant contribution to the total C 60 -induced recombination loss occurs within the first monolayer of C 60 , rather than in the bulk of C 60 or at the perovskite surface. The experiments show that the C 60 molecules act as deep trap states when in direct contact with the perovskite. It is further demonstrated that by reducing the surface coverage of C 60 , the radiative efficiency of the bare perovskite layer can be retained. The findings of this work pave the way toward overcoming one of the most critical remaining performance losses in perovskite solar cells. and hole selective contacts relative to the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrate. The highest performing cells are currently made in the nip architecture;  [1]  however, pin-type perovskite solar cells are also of significant interest due to their high operational stability  [4]  and their successful integration into multijunction tandem solar cells with other established and emerging photovoltaic technologies.  [5, 6]  The success of pin type cells in this regard can be largely attributed to the simple processability of the charge transport layers, which can be fabricated at low temperatures (≈100 °C) or by thermal evaporation without the need for chemical dopants which could negatively affect the device stability.  [7]  As such, pin-type perovskite cells are currently the preferred platform for high efficiency tandems.  [5]  However, it is well known that even the highest performing pin cells are limited by substantial nonradiative recombination induced by the electron transport layer.  [8]  The highest efficiency silicon/perovskite and perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cells to date all use fullerene electron transport layers, which are likely the limiting factor to their performance.  [5, 9, 10]  As we show in Figure  1a , a C 60 -induced nonradiative loss is limiting the performance of most of the metal halide perovskite systems we have studied, including hybrid organic/inorganic metal halides with mixed cation and halide compositions over a large range of bandgaps, inorganic perovskites, and even 2D/3D perovskites. Figure  1a  summarizes reported photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) values (where the generation current, J G = 1 sun) obtained on bare perovskite and perovskite/C 60 films and complete cell stacks, for mono, double, and triple cation perovskites with different bandgaps, inorganic and 2D/3D layered perovskites. In all systems, the recombination loss induced by the C 60 layer greatly outweighs the recombination in the neat layer by 1-3 orders of magnitude, and dominates the PLQY losses of the complete devices in all cases. Moreover, the PLQY of the perovskite/C 60 stack layers ends up at low values (<1 × 10 -3 ), quite irrespective of the perovskite composition, although the PLQY of C 60 stacks was found to decrease with higher Br or MAPbBr 3 content.  [11]  Contrastingly, cells in the nip configuration can have an external radiative efficiency of nearly 10%, where the injected current is equal to the short circuit current density (J injected = J SC ).  [12]  Particularly important for tandem cells applications is the low PLQY in presence of C 60 in case of the triple cation perovskites with a bandgap between  [8,11,13-18].) C 60 appears to lower the PL yield (PLQY) to ≈1 × 10 -4 -1 × 10 -3 of the neat layer, relatively independent of the composition. We note that these different perovskites are denoted as methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ), double cation is denoted as FA 0.8 MA 0.2 PbI 3 , triple cation perovskite (Cs 0.05 FA x MA y Pb(I x Br y ) 3 ) is abbreviated as ""TC,"" where the x:y ratio reflects the molar ratio of FAPbI 3 versus MAPbBr 3 , 2D/3D perovskites are denoted by the spacer cation butylammonium (BA) and the number of layers of octahedra between spacer cations, e.g., n = 4 is BA4. b) PLQY of an 83:17 TC perovskite on different transport layers, showing that fullerenes limit the performance of pin cells and spiro-OMeTAD limits nip cells; overall the pin cells are more limited by interface recombination. Dashed line indicates the PLQY of the neat perovskite on glass. c) Possible recombination pathways at the C 60 interface (C 60 -induced surface trap states, across-interface recombination, and recombination within the C 60 layer directly at the interface or in the bulk). 1.63 eV to 1.88 eV. Figure  1b  further highlights that with the use of self-assembled monolayers and also poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA): poly(9,9-bis(3'-(N,Ndimethyl)-N-ethylammoinium-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9dioctylfluorene))dibromide (PFN) one can achieve no additional losses compared to the nonradiative bulk recombination in case of a triple cation perovskite, and that the use of metal oxides in nip type cells with a triple cation perovskite layer also cause less losses compared to C 60 . However, despite the huge importance of the C 60 -induced recombination losses in determining the radiative efficiency of pin-type solar cells, the origins of nonradiative recombination at this interface and the interfacial recombination pathways have not been widely explored yet and remain elusive today. In principle, as shown in Figure  1c , there could be four pathways for nonradiative recombination when the C 60 is in contact with the perovskite: I) Interface recombination within the perovskite layer, where both the electrons and holes recombine in the perovskite via new surface traps which are created due to changes in surface stoichiometry or reactions with the C 60 (mechanism 1); II) Across-interface recombination, where the electron is extracted to the C 60 and it recombines with a hole in the perovskite via trap states (mechanism 2); III) Interface recombination within the C 60 , where the electron and hole are extracted to the C 60 and recombine at the interface via trap states in the C 60 (mechanism 3); IV) Recombination within the bulk of C 60 , where electrons and holes are extracted to the C 60 and recombine via trap states in the C 60 (mechanism 4). This is distinct from mechanism 3 as the holes can travel throughout the C 60 also introducing the possibility of recombination at the electrode. Each of these mechanisms will have different implications for optimization pathways to circumvent the loss. Thus, to further advance single-and multijunction cells, we need to understand if, or to what extent each mechanism contributes. In this work, we disentangle the involvement of each of these mechanisms to the increased nonradiative recombination in perovskite/C 60 systems. We first performed ultrasensitive photovoltaic external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements of conventional and lateral devices which revealed a large increase in trap state density when interfaced with C 60 . We then measured the PLQY in perovskite/C 60 films as a function of the C 60 thickness or C 60 coverage (from sub-nm to 30 nm). These experiments revealed a remarkable direct correlation between the loss of PLQY and the C 60 thickness in a regime where the C 60 only partially covers the perovskite surface, ruling out bulk C 60 recombination (mechanism 4). By examining the highest molecular orbital (HOMO) features of the sequentially deposited C 60 layers using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), we demonstrate that the PLQY drops to its lowest value, once the perovskite surface is completely covered with the C 60 . Following this, we are able to develop a quantitative model based on PLQY being inversely proportional to C 60 surface coverage which fits our experimental data very well. We then performed confocal microscopy and hyperspectral PL imaging, which confirmed that the decrease in PL intensity was homogenous in the XY plane. After this, in order to understand the possibility of C 60 -induced mid-gap states on the perovskite surface, we modeled the perovskite-C 60 interaction for different terminated surfaces, showing no formation of mid-gap states in the perovskite, considering two different surface terminations. This, in combination with the EQE and additional PL measurements on perovskite/C 60 stacks allowed us rule out increased nonradiative recombination in the perovskite (mechanism 1). We then compared the PL emission of C 60 films, with perovskite/C 60 stacks. These measurements revealed the presence of excitonic states in the C 60 which could be well aligned with the valence band of the perovskites, facilitating hole transfer (mechanism 3). However, we did not observe any C 60 photoluminescence or electroluminescence in the photovoltaic devices which ruled out this theory. This indicates that the remaining acrossinterface recombination (mechanism 2) is the operational loss mechanism. With further UPS measurements and modeling of the perovskite/C 60 interaction, we propose either C 60 density of states (DOS) broadening creating low lying states or a charge transfer state is the source of additional traps at this interface. Finally, strategies are proposed to reduce the nonradiative loss at this interface. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN""}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""buckminsterfullerene"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN""}"
1698,36_4," Location of Nonradiative Recombination With strong evidence of traps when C 60 is in contact with the perovskite, we attempt to better determine the precise spatial location of the recombination. We evaporate C 60 with varying thickness onto the TC perovskite and measure the PLQY (inset Figure  3a ). Intriguingly we observe that the majority of the PLQY loss with respect to the neat occurs in samples with only 1 nm of C 60 and we see no further loss beyond samples with 4 nm. We repeat this experiment on a double cation (DC) perovskite (FA 0.8 MA 0.2 PbI 3 with a bandgap of 1.54 eV and cells with a PCE of around 21%, performance parameters, Figure  S1 , Supporting Information) which we recently reported to have a PLQY in neat films of up to 0.2 and a Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) lifetime over 10 µs.  [14]  This will afford us a larger dynamic range to investigate PLQY losses (Figure  3a ). In this case, we find the same result where almost all loss occurred in the first nm, and, the loss is very large (5 × 10 -3 after 1 nm). Therefore, to better resolve the range where the PLQY drops rapidly, we investigate the sub-nm regime of C 60 thickness on the DC and TC perovskites, with high resolution using multiple samples and measurements for each thickness (Figure  3b ).  ). The relative trap density appears to be reduced if the LiF layer is inserted between perovskite and C 60 , which improves the device performance from ≈20% to 21% through a better V OC (40 mV) and better FF (≈2%).  [8]  The inset shows a simplified solar cell device stack. b) Sensitive EQE of triple cation perovskite devices fabricated in photoresistor architecture plotted as a function of photon energy, and compared for the case with (blue) and without (red) a C 60 layer. The inset shows a simplified device stack, where the triple cation layer is sandwiched between glass and top electrodes (gold). We observe that there is an initial plateau of the PLQY with very low thicknesses of C 60 (<0.01 nm), followed by a decrease inversely proportional to the C 60 thickness until ≈3 nm and then remaining constant until an operational C 60 thickness of ≈30 nm. If we consider the unit cell of crystalline C 60 , it adopts a face centered cubic (FCC) structure with a lattice parameter a = 1.41 nm (Figure  3c ). Assuming a perfectly smooth surface, we should expect full surface coverage at ≈1 nm (the interplanar spacing of the hexagonally close packed planes is 1 nm). Hence, a nominal sub-nm C 60 thickness (as determined by the rate and duration of thermal evaporation), should be considered as a partial coverage of the perovskite layer. This saturation of the quenching with increased thickness beyond 3 nm is very interesting and indicative of a surface mediated process. However, all of the recombination did not happen in precisely the first nm as would have been predicted above. As we deposit C 60 via thermal evaporation and the perovskite surface is multicrystalline, it is likely that film growth occurs through the formation terraces and islands of C 60 on the perovskite surface rather than epitaxiallly.  [20]  In addition to this the perovskite film has a root mean square roughness of 21.5 nm.  [17]  As such, we hypothesize that full surface coverage of C 60 on the perovskite will not be complete at 1 nm and that the PLQY is related to the surface coverage, saturating when it is complete. In order to investigate this, sequentially deposited C 60 layers on the DC perovskite were studied by UPS. Given the very surface sensitive nature of UPS, the photoemission spectra are expected to consist of perovskite valence bands and C 60 highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) features until the surface is fully covered by C 60 molecules. It is clearly shown in Figure  3d  that the C 60 HOMO features start to dominate and saturate at the thickness of 2.3 nm, indicating a complete coverage of C 60 molecules on the perovskite surface already at 2.3 nm. The same experiment was also performed on the TC perovskite, which showed the same result with the C 60 feature dominating from 2.3 nm onward (Figure  S2 , Supporting Information). We now seek to accurately describe our PLQY versus C 60 thickness data by developing a numerical model based on known recombination kinetics in metal halide perovskites. To this end, we consider that the PLQY is the ratio of the radiative recombination rate (k 2 n 2 ) to the total recombination rate (k 1 n + k 2 n 2 ), which is the sum of all nonradiative recombination rates (k 1 n) and the radiative rate, neglecting Auger recombination which occurs at ≈1000 suns in perovskites  [21, 22]   PLQY 2 2 1 2 2 = + k n k n k n (1) The first-order nonradiative recombination rate constant depends in turn on the number of trap states N traps k N v 1 t raps th σ = (2) where v th σ is the product of the capture cross-section and the thermal velocity; we do not attempt to measure v th σ, but simply note that the nonradiative recombination rate is proportional to the trap density (N traps cm -3 ). We will call these intrinsic traps (N traps(intrinsic) ), which (together with v th σ) determine the PLQY of our control films (1 × 10 -2 and 2 × 10 -1 for TC and DC, respectively). In our model, as we deposit C 60 on the surface, we are increasing the total number of traps (N traps(total) ) by introducing extrinsic traps N traps(external) . When the number of C 60 molecules is low, then k 1(intrinsic) >> k 1(extrinsic) and there is little effect on the PLQY; this is characterized by the plateau region of the PLQY in Figure  3b . There is then a transition until k 1(extrinsic) >> k 1(intrinsic) upon which there is an inversely proportional relationship between C 60 surface coverage and the PLQY. Finally, the PLQY will saturate when full surface coverage is achieved as no more surface traps can be created. Using this simple model and a thickness for complete surface coverage of 2.3 nm (from UPS) we can closely fit the experimentally obtained PLQY data (red lines Figure  3b ). Therefore, with the combination of the PLQY, UPS and a close fit of the model we conclude that all of nonradiative recombination happens exactly at the surface allowing us to exclude mechanism 4 (predominant recombination in the bulk of C 60 ). The fact that the PLQY decays inversely with the number of C 60 molecules (PLQY α N C60 -1 ), indicates that N traps ∝ N C60 . Additionally, this type of recombination analysis is only valid for deep traps indicating that C 60 is making deep rather than shallow traps at the surface. The correlation of surface coverage and PLQY opens up possibilities to improve device performance by reducing contact area of the C 60 with the perovskite through the use of a patterned interlayer; this ""point contacts"" strategy is well known for silicon  [23]  and has been demonstrated on the substrate side for nip perovskite solar cells.

1699,36_5," Origin of Interfacial Traps A possible origin of traps can be found in Figure  S3  (Supporting Information) where we observe the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is positioned ≈100 meV below the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the perovskite at the interface and upon increasing the thickness of C 60 , the LUMO bends upward (by ≈0.3 eV). This low lying LUMO of the C 60 at the interface could potentially introduce trap states which cause the increased nonradiative recombination. Such an effect has been previously observed in organic semiconductors in contact with inorganic materials,  [25]  and attributed to broadening of the organic DOS at the interface because of spatial variation (inhomogeneity) in the electrostatic potential of the inorganic material.  [26]  Note, a broad DOS throughout the C 60 could also be related to packing faults or impurities causing energetic disorder. To test the packing fault hypothesis we try solvent and thermal annealing the C 60 electron transport layer (ETL) in case of a TC absorber layer to increase crystallinity and order as reported for PCBM by Shao et al.  [27]  (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information) which showed, however, no improvement. We then fabricate TC/C 60 stacks with different purities of C 60 which showed that the PLQY was the same for all samples, ruling out recombination via impurity defects (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information). Therefore, the observed pinning of the C 60 LUMO below the conduction band is more likely due to the C 60 DOS broadening through inhomogenous electrostatics of the perovskite surface. As we have pinned down the location of the recombination to the interface, we now inspect samples of our DC and TC Adv. Energy Mater. 2022, 12, 2103567 perovskite with subsurface coverage of C 60 with confocal microscopy (Figure  4 ) and hyperspectral imaging (Figure  S6 , Supporting Information) to see if there was any heterogeneity in PL intensity in the xy-plane for subsurface coverage samples. Through this technique, we can potentially resolve the length scale of the clustering/islands of C 60 by the evolution of darker or brighter regions in the PL maps (confocal PL can have a high spatial resolution ≈100 nm). However, these measurements revealed that the multicrystalline surface of the DC and TC films displays the same degree of heterogeneity of the PL signal (within our resolution limit) irrespective of surface coverage. While these results do not demonstrate any heterogeneity (or clustering of C 60 ), they reveal individual grains (especially for the DC perovskite) and would warrant further research in the future if point contact methods are found to improve the PLQY at this interface. Now that we have identified the location of the recombination to the interface, we seek to determine whether the traps originate from the perovskite or the C 60 . First, we discuss the possibility that C 60 induces deep traps on the perovskite surface (i.e., mechanism 1). In general, the closed shell nature of C 60 should make it relatively unreactive to redox reactions on the surface and it is an apolar molecule so there should be no electrostatic repulsion of ions causing a change of surface stoichiometry. Nevertheless, we investigate whether the reduction in PLQY was surface independent. To do this we fabricate samples of TC perovskite where the perovskite is either deposited on top of a glass/C 60 substrate, or, C 60 is deposited on a glass/perovskite substrate (Figure  S7 , Supporting Information). We measure the PLQY of these samples with incidence of the excitation light from both sides in order to account for the generation of carriers either next to or away from the C 60 . We find that the PLQY is almost identical between these two samples when the illumination pathway is matched, e.g., through the perovskite. We note that the bottom and top surfaces of the perovskite film are different in chemical nature; for example, the surface of 83:17 TC perovskite can be effectively passivated with tri-octyl phosphine oxide which results in a PLQY in excess of 0.2, indicating that the trap concentration of the bottom interface is much lower.  [13, 28]  This, therefore, supports the hypothesis that the C 60 -induced loss does not significantly depend on the surface chemistry. To further investigate possible trap states induced by the C 60 -perovskite interactions, we perform first principle calculations. The interaction of C 60 with the MAPbI 3 perovskite surface has been previously modeled by Quarti et al.  [29]  Here we consider two surface terminations representing a more stable/ less reactive MAI-terminated surface (Figure  S8b , Supporting Information) and a less stable/more reactive PbI 2 -terminated perovskite surface (Figure  S8a , Supporting Information). These interfaces were geometry optimized by Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE),  [30]  including D3 dispersion corrections.  [31]  The alignment of energy levels was determined by accurate hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) calculations  [32]  including spin-orbit coupling (hereafter HSE-SOC). All calculations were carried out by the Quantum Espresso program package.  [33]  The HSE-SOC calculated electronic DOS is reported in Figure  S8  (Supporting Information) for both surface terminations. Firstly, both simulations do not show the formation of mid-gap states in the perovskite further ruling out mechanism 1. For both systems, a C 60 /perovskite shortest C-Pb distance of ≈3Å is calculated, with an interaction energy of ≈0.5 eV dominated by the dispersion term. Moreover, the simulations of the noninteracting and interacting DOS show appreciable interfacial electronic coupling (200 meV) and in the case of the PbI 2 terminated surface, a stabilization of the C 60 LUMO by 200 meV. Therefore, a lower energy charge transfer state could exist at this interface and a DOS broadening of the C 60 LUMO from electrostatic variations of the perovskite surface potential is also possible; both could be a source of traps at the perovskite/C 60 interface. ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""FA0.8MA0.2PbI 3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""buckminsterfullerene"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN""}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""FA0.8MA0.2PbI 3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""buckminsterfullerene"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""tri-octyl phosphine oxide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"

1724,116_7," T o achieve better and cheaper alternative energy, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been the front runner among emerging next-generation solar cells. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 25% (1) has been achieved in laboratory-scale PSCs by improving the perovskite material formulations (2-5), the device fabrication routines (6-9), and the high-quality film-formation methodologies  (10) (11) (12)  on the basis of a comprehensive understanding of the charge dynamics at the interfacial layers. Most high-performance PSCs have a sandwich structure composed of a perovskite absorber between a metal oxidebased electron-transporting material (ETM) and an organic hole-transporting material (HTM)  (3, 7, 13, 14) . Because high-quality perovskite and ETMs can be obtained from various processing methodologies, HTMs are considered to be fundamentally important in further improving PSC performance. Despite efforts to develop better HTMs to replace Spiro-OMeTAD [2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene] (15-17), this compound, which was developed by Grätzel et al. for solidstate dye-sensitized solar cells more than two decades ago  (18) , is still recognized as the most efficient HTM in PSCs owing to its amorphous nature, high compatibility with dopants, and energy levels matching those of perovskite. However, it must be chemically doped with hygroscopic dopants to attain efficient hole extraction and sufficient conductivity. Such doping negatively influences the stability of ambient PSCs, thus presenting a major obstacle to truly commercializing PSCs despite PCE being sufficient for practical applications  (19) (20) (21) . Therefore, the PSC community is actively investigating candidate HTMs to replace Spiro-OMeTAD and ultimately achieve stable PSCs simultaneously exhibiting the same or improved performance. Notably, the latest research on cesium cation (Cs + )-  (22, 23) , carbon electrode-  (24) (25) (26) , and dopantfree-based PSCs  (27, 28)  can bring the benefits in improving the device stability but lower PCE levels when compared with that of the Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC. Considering the multiple possible aspects of fluorination of the conjugated materials (e.g., lowering energy levels and enhancing molecular packing and hydrophobicity through the induced dipole along the C-F bond), we developed two fluorinated isomeric analogs (Spiro-mF and Spiro-oF) of Spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs for PSC fabrication and compared their device performance with that of the optimized Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC. Not only do we report a PCE of 24.82% (certified PCE of 24.64% with 0.3-V loss) achieved from the device fabricated with Spiro-mF, but we also show the long-term stability of fluorinated HTM-based devices without encapsulation on exposure to high relative humidity (RH) (87% PCE retention after 500 hours). Furthermore, the Spiro-mF-based PSC, with an area of 1 cm 2 , represents an efficiency of 22.31%. Figure  1A  presents the chemical structures of the parent Spiro-OMeTAD and its fluorinated analogs (Spiro-mF and Spiro-oF). The two fluorinated isomeric HTMs were synthesized through two Buchwald-Hartwig C-N cross-coupling reactions; detailed synthesis and molecular characterization are described in figs. S1 to S7 and materials and methods. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis revealed that the synthesized HTMs exist in both amorphous and crystalline states, as evidenced by the observation of glass-transition and melting temperatures (fig.  S8 ). The ultravioletvisible absorption (UV-Vis) spectra in Fig.  1B  show that, in addition to the absorption band from 300 to 450 nm, the three HTMs feature a slight redshift as the solution transitions to the solid state, which is commonly observed in many organic semiconductors  (29) (30) (31) . Relative to the Spiro-OMeTAD, both new fluorinated isomeric HTMs, especially Spiro-oF, display obvious blue-shifted absorption maxima and onsets, thus leading to the net widening of their optical bandgaps (E g opt ), which is attributed to the fluorine atoms generating an inductive electron-withdrawing effect on the aromatic rings of the conjugated backbone  (32) (33) (34) . Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on the HTMs to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels (fig.  S9 ); the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were derived from the HOMOs and E g opt . The CV and E g opt -derived HOMO and LUMO energies are -4.97 and -2.03, -5.19 and -2.23, and -5.06 and -2.04 eV for Spiro-OMeTAD, Spiro-mF, and Spiro-oF, respectively, thus demonstrating that fluorination can simultaneously lower the HOMO and LUMO levels (Fig.  1C  and table  S1 ). These results agree well with the trend estimated from density functional theory (DFT) calculations by using the generalized gradient approximation with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional (figs. S10 and S11). The same trend is observed for the HOMOs of the doped HTMs (fig.  S12 ). Therefore, in addition to reasonably estimating the enhanced oxidation stability of both fluorinated HTMs, more efficient interfacial hole-transport kinetics are observed compared with that of Spiro-OMeTAD. Moreover, the UV-Vis spectra and CV data indicate a strong fluorine positioning effect, the constitutional isomeric effect, on the optical and electrochemical properties. We also observe clear differences in the DFT-calculated structural conformations and electron distributions of Spiro-mF and Spiro-oF (Fig.  1D ). After deciphering their intrinsic properties, we used Spiro-mF and Spiro-oF as HTMs in PSCs fabricated with the conventional n-i-p configuration, specifically fluorine-doped tinoxide substrate/compact TiO 2 /mesoporous TiO 2 / perovskite layer/HTM/Au (fig.  S13 ); FAPbI 3 was selected as the perovskite layer because of its narrow bandgap (1.48 eV), thus making it suitable for the absorption of near-infrared light and promoting thermal stability  (35, 36) . For a comparative study, we also prepared a control device under the same conditions, using Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. The HTM chlorobenzene solution containing 4-tert-butylpyridine, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, and tris[2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine]cobalt(III)-tris[bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide] as dopant additives was deposited by spincoating on the FAPbI 3 layer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the neat FAPbI 3 (fig.  S14 ) show strong diffraction peaks at 14.1°and 28.2°, corresponding to the (001) and (002) crystal planes, respectively, and confirming a dense and ordered perovskite crystal structure. Similar results were observed after the films were spin-coated with the doped HTM solutions, indicating that the HTM processing did not damage the perovskite crystal quality. The optimized thicknesses of the FAPbI 3 and HTM layers were ~750 and ~270 nm, respectively. Because PSC performance is sensitive to the dopant type and doping conditions, independent device optimization was also undertaken by carefully screening the ratios and amount of dopant additives. Details about the device fabrication and all device data examined herein are included in the supplementary materials. Figure  2  shows the current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the best PSCs for each given HTM under AM 1.5 G simulated solar illumination at 100 mW cm -2 ; the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in table  S2 . A tiny hysteresis was observed in the J-V scans between reverse and forward scans in all cases. First, under optimized conditions, the control device fabricated with Spiro-OMeTAD achieved a maximum PCE of 23.44% for an area of 0.0819 cm 2 with a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 26.04 mA cm -2 , an open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.152 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 78.13%; this value is fairly comparable to the previously reported highest PCE of the PSCs in single-junction devices  (37) (38) (39) . Compared with the control device fabricated with doped Spiro-OMeTAD, both fluorinated HTM-based PSCs exhibited nearly identical (J SC ) values of 26.34 to 26.35 mA cm -2 and slightly superior V OC values over 1.16 V, thus reflecting the lower-lying HOMO levels observed in the CV data. The Spiro-mF-based device produced a somewhat higher FF (80.90%) than that of the other devices, ultimately resulting in the best PCE of 24.82%. The slightly lower performance in the forward scan is mainly due to the low FF. The small standard deviation of the PCEs among the tested devices points toward excellent reproducibility (Fig.  2D ). PSC performance is highly sensitive to environmental conditions. Thus, to provide accuracy and reproducibility of the device performance metrics reported in Fig.  2D  and table  S2 , we fabricated each device under the same conditions: at 25°C and below 30% RH, with exclusion of strong light and oxygen. One of the best Spiro-mF-based devices was sent to an independent solar cell-accredited laboratory (Newport, Irvine, CA, USA) for certification, where a stabilized PCE of 24.64% (with V OC = 1.1814 V, J SC = 26.1783 mA cm -2 , and FF = 79.6%) was confirmed (fig.  S16 ). On the basis of the bandgap of FAPbI 3 (1.48 eV), the obtained V OC value quantifies the V OC loss as 0.3 V, thus being close to the theoretical minimum value based on the radiative limit defined by the Shockley-Queisser theory  (40, 41) . Because the radiative limit is the near-maximum theoretical PCE of the solar cell, these results suggest that the nonradiative recombination of the device is largely suppressed in the Spiro-mF-based PSC, which is directly evidenced by external electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EL-EQE) measurement (fig.  S17 )  (42) . The reported 0.3-V V OC loss is, to the best of our knowledge, the lowest reported value to date for PSCs in any type of device. To demonstrate practical applicability and scalability of the Spiro-mF-based device, we also prepared a large-area cell with an area of 1 cm 2 , yielding the highest PCE of 22.31% with corresponding V OC , J SC , and FF of 1.178 V, 25.51 mA cm -2 , and 74.22%, as shown in Fig.  2E . By using space charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements, the hole mobility (m) of the pristine HTMs is in order of Spiro-OMeTAD (6.5904 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) < Spiro-oF (7.2902 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) < Spiro-mF (7.4748 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) (fig.  S18 ). The higher m in Spiro-mF can be explained by denser solid-state packing through noncovalent inter-and intra-interactions induced by F atoms  (43, 44) , corresponding to the slightly enhanced J SC and FF values of the Spiro-mF-based PSC. By contrast, in Spiro-oF, the outward appended F atoms of the central HTM unit may act as a steric hindrance such that intermolecular interaction is dampened, hence making it more difficult for the charge to hop between molecules (the more bent structure of Spiro-oF core relative to that of Spiro-mF is shown in the DFT study results). We also evaluated the charge dynamics occurring at the perovskite-HTM interface using steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay measurements. Figure  S19A  shows that upon depositing HTM on the perovskite film, the intensity of the steadystate PL spectrum was largely reduced, and the quenching efficacy followed Spiro-mF > Spiro-oF > Spiro-OMeTAD, which is consistent with the hole mobility trend. Figure  S19B  shows the TRPL spectra of the devices based on the each HTM as recorded with the peak emission at 800 nm. The TRPL decay data were modeled by a bi-exponential formula [Y = A 1 exp(-t/t 1 ) + A 2 exp(-t/t 2 )] (45-47), as listed in table  S6 , where fast (t 1 ) and slow (t 2 ) decay components are related to nonradiative and radiative recombination, respectively. The fitted decay lifetimes (t 1 , t 2 ) are (  1438  enhanced mobility and conductivity (the electrical conductivity data in fig.  S20 ), the presented data demonstrate that the best parameters occur in the Spiro-mF-based device. To directly ascertain the degradation processes occurring in perovskite films, we conducted long-term stability tests on the three devices without encapsulation under ~50% RH. The PCE of Spiro-OMeTAD-based control device dropped from 23.21 to 13.74%, corresponding to ~60% of its initial PCE after 500 hours; however, the PCE of both fluorinated HTM-based devices was quite stable, resulting in very high PCE retention (>87%) over the same measurement period. The PCE trends are presented in Fig.  3 , and detailed photovoltaic parameters are found in tables S7 to S9. XRD patterns were tracked at regular intervals to estimate the morphological degradation of the device layers (Fig.  3C ). The Spiro-OMeTAD-based device exhibited a clear deterioration of the typical perovskite XRD peaks after 500 hours, whereas no apparent impurity peaks were ob-served in the XRD patterns of devices fabricated with fluorinated HTMs. Moreover, after 3 weeks of storage, no deterioration was observed. From the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis with varying times (fig.  S21 ), relative to Spiro-OMeTAD-based device, the fluorinated HTM-based devices, especially for Spiro-mF, one discloses smaller EIS resistance values, providing additional proof of their better morphological robustness and charge-transfer behavior. Contact-angle measurements were conducted to determine the surface water resistance of the neat and doped HTM layers on perovskite. As shown in Fig.  3D  and table S10, the water droplet contact angle on fluorinated HTM films is larger than that on Spiro-OMeTAD film, indicating reduced hygroscopicity of the fluorine-doped Spiro-mF and Spiro-oF HTMs. The presence of fluorine atoms induces the creation of kinetic barriers that slow the intrusion of O 2 and H 2 O. The increased hydrophobicity generated by using fluorinated Spiro-type HTMs is a key factor contributing to the enhanced stability of PSC devices. We also conducted in-depth atomistic simulations of the DFT-optimized molecular structures of the three HTMs. When examining the free molecular structures, Spiro-mF exhibited a more unfolded structure regarding the angle between the centers of spirobifluorene and two fluorinated methoxyphenyl groups when compared with that of other HTMs (Fig.  4A ). We also noticed that the fluorine atoms at the ortho-sites caused steric hindrance regarding the free movement of the methoxyphenyl groups. The adsorption state of each HTM on the perovskite surface was investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (see the ""simulation details"" section in the materials and methods, as well as Fig.  4B ). Spiro-mF and Spiro-oF adsorbed closer to the perovskite surface than Spiro-OMeTAD, as determined by observing the radial distribution function (RDF) of all phenyl groups on the perovskite surface (fig.  S22 ). In particular, the fluorene units of Spiro-mF were found more on the perovskite surface than that of Spiro-oF (Fig.  4C ), implying that the adsorbed structure of Spiro-mF and Spiro-oF could be different. We noticed that Spiro-mF featured a specific RDF peak from the perovskite surface due to the stretched structure of fluorene and phenyl groups on the surface; each peak represents the adsorbed components of Spiro-mF (phenyl and fluorene groups) (fig.  S23 ). On the basis of the configurations sampled from the MD simulations, fluorene and phenyl groups of Spiro-mF adsorbed together on the perovskite surface, whereas those of Spiro-oF often did not adsorb on the perovskite surface together (Fig.  4D ). The unfolded structure of Spiro-mF on perovskite is also described by the centerto-end distance (R cte ) of the molecule, where the R cte of Spiro-mF and Spiro-oF was ~6. transport  (17) . Along with the detailed atomistic simulations, a comparative investigation of Spiro-OMeTAD versus its fluorinated analogs demonstrates that the fluorination of HTMs with controlled isomerism is a promising strategy to simultaneously achieve high performance and excellent device stability, thus advancing the realization of commercial PSCs.

Before depositing perovskite films, the PTAA film was pre-wetted by spinning 80 µl DMF at 4,000 rpm for 15 s to improve the wetting property of the perovskite precursor solution. The perovskite precursor solution composed of mixed cations (lead (Pb), cesium(Cs), formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA)) and halides (I, Br) was dissolved in mixed solvent (DMF/DMSO = 4:1) with a chemical formula of Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45.

1779,47_13," Model for Radial Distribution Function (RDF) analysis To evaluate the RDF of the PbSO4 when interacting with perovskite surface we set up a bulk model involving 2 × 2 × 5 PbI2-terminated perovskite bulk interacting with a 3 × 2 × 7 PbSO4 bulk, see Fig.  S6 . The 3 × 2 × 7 PbSO4 layer was generated from the Anglesite experimental bulk structure. In this case, we adopt the full coverage to evaluate the energetics of the interface formation with a lattice matching of 85% along a and 104% along b. The a and b cell parameters are 17.7112 Å while the c dimension was set as sum of the encumbrance of the separated parts (51 Å). The interface has been optimized using CP2K program, using PBE functional, DZVP basis set, DFT-D3 dispersion interactions and a cutoff of 300 Ry.               S4 . Photovoltaic parameters of the phosphate-treated device with different sweeping rates and directions. All the J-V curves were at a simulated AM 1.5 G solar irradiation with a scan rate of 0.  We show that converting the surfaces of lead halide perovskite to water-insoluble lead (II) oxysalt through reaction with sulfate or phosphate ions can effectively stabilize the perovskite surface and bulk material. These capping lead oxysalt thin layers enhance the water resistance of the perovskite films by forming strong chemical bonds. The wide-bandgap lead oxysalt layers also reduce the defect density on the perovskite surfaces by passivating undercoordinated surface lead centers, which are defect-nucleating sites. Formation of the lead oxysalt layer increases the carrier recombination lifetime and boosts the efficiency of the solar cells to 21.1%. Encapsulated devices stabilized by the lead oxysalt layers maintain 96.8% of their initial efficiency after operation at maximum power point under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 G irradiation for 1200 hours at 65°C. T he power conversion efficiency (PCE) of laboratory-scale metal halide organic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has reached a certified value of 24.2%, exceeding those of cells that are based on cadmium telluride (CdTe) and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) (1). However, PSCs face long-term instability issues under realistic operation conditions, which remains a critical hurdle to be overcome before their commercialization  (2) (3) (4) . Lead halide perovskites generally suffer from instability under stimuli of heat, oxygen, moisture, light irradiation, and electric field (4-6). Tailoring the composition, crystallinity, and internal material strain have been shown to substantially improve the materials' intrinsic stability under different stimuli, but their instability from moisture and oxygen is still an outstanding issue to be solved  (7) (8) (9) (10) .

1780,47_14," III-V Multijunction Cells Perovskite degradation is generally initialized from the defect sites at surfaces and grain boundaries, which are more reactive toward water and oxygen  (11) (12) (13) . Many organic molecules and poly-mers have been applied to chemically passivate the perovskite surface defects, and physical covering of some structural defects with hydrophobic organic materials can also enhance the stability of the perovskites  (14) (15) (16) (17) . For example, C 60 and its derivatives have been reported as passivation layers, enhancing device efficiency and reducing current hysteresis in PSCs  (14) . The surface under-coordinated Pb sites can be passivated by Lewis base electron donors, such as thiophene and pyridine, which saturate the lead coordination sphere  (15) . Zwitterions, bearing both negative and positive components, are shown to have a superior dual-passivation effect, leading to enhanced stability of unencapsulated perovskite films under ambient conditions  (16) . Despite these initial successes, limitations exist in using these passivation agents as postsynthesis perovskite treatment for efficiency and stability enhancement. The secondary bonding between these passivation molecules and the perovskite surface is generally too weak to protect the material from attack from moisture and oxygen. Not all structural defects are electronic defects, so some structural defects that may initialize the film degradation might not be covered by passivation molecules. The passivation strategies reported for halide perovskites are fundamentally different from those effectively used in silicon solar cells, in which passivation mainly involves primary chemical bonding. For silicon technology, surface structural defects are generally passivated by silicon oxide, silicon nitride, or aluminum oxide, which form strong covalent bonds to silicon. Oxides and nitrides are mechanically strong, compact, and chem-ically stable, which protect the underlying silicon from degradation. Wide-bandgap oxides and nitrides passivate the surface defects by eliminating silicon dangling bonds and thus enhance device efficiency. We demonstrate a general passivation strategy for lead halide perovskites by forming a thin, compact inorganic lead oxysalt layer on the perovskite surface through in situ reaction with selected inorganic anions. The surface lead oxysalt layer formed strong chemical bonds with the perovskite and afforded much better resistance to many detrimental stimuli under ambient atmosphere and light irradiation. Its passivation effect enhanced the PSC efficiency. The concept of metal halide perovskite surface passivation by using compact inorganic layers is illustrated in Fig.  1A . Inorganic layers for surface passivation of metal halide perovskite should have a large bandgap to reduce surface recombination velocity and be chemically stable in ambient air, especially under humid conditions. The lead salts that are insoluble in water are ideal candidates for perovskite surface stabilization. For example, the solubility of PbSO 4 , Pb 3 (PO 4 ) 2 , and PbCO 3 in water is merely 0.0443, 0.00014, and 0.0011 g liter -1 at 20°C, respectively  (18) . By contrast, PbI 2 has a much higher solubility of 0.756 g liter -1 in water. Another requirement for the surface inorganic layers is that they must bond strongly to the perovskite surface so that the coating is mechanically strong. We formed PbSO 4 and Pb 3 (PO 4 ) 2 as surface inorganic layers through the facile chemical reaction of perovskite with SO 4 2--and PO 4 3-containing salts dissolved in solvents that do not dissolve halide perovskites, such as isopropanol or toluene-in this case, (C 8 H 17 NH 3 ) 2 SO 4 and (C 8 H 17 NH 3 ) 3 PO 4 . Triple-cation perovskite was used in our study with a chemical composition of Cs 0.05 FA 0.81 MA 0.14 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45 (CsFAMA perovskite, where MA is methylammonium and FA is formamidinium). The oxyacid ions reacted with halide perovskite when perovskite films were dipped into (C 8 H 17 NH 3 ) 2 SO 4 and (C 8 H 17 NH 3 ) 3 PO 4 solutions for 30 to ~60 min followed by thermal annealing, according to the following chemical equations APbX 3 þ SO 2À 4 → A þ þ 3X À þ PbSO 4 ð1Þ 3APbX 3 þ 2PO 3À 4 → 3A þ þ 9X À þ Pb 3 ðPO 4 Þ 2 ð2Þ where A = MA, FA, Cs, or a mixture thereof, and X = Br, I, or mixed halide ions. This reaction yielded stable white-colored PbSO 4 and Pb 3 (PO 4 ) 2 films, as shown in the photographs and verified with x-ray diffraction patterns in figs. S1 and S2. Using the same method, a thin lead sulfate layer can be generated on the surface of the CsFAMA perovskite films by reducing the reaction time. Because PbSO 4 is electrically insulating, the reaction time and precursor concentration were carefully optimized to be 20 s and 4 mM, RESEARCH respectively, which yields a layer thickness of <5 nm that can maintain efficient charge transport (fig.  S3 ). Perovskite films or devices with lead sulfate layers, hereafter referred to as lead sulfate samples, were obtained through octylammonium sulfate treatment if not specified otherwise. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images in figs. S4 and S5, A and B, show that the topography of the perovskite films was well maintained after the surface reaction, indicating a conformal coating of lead sulfate on the perovskites. Cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) (Fig.  1B ) further revealed a uniform and compact lead sulfate layer that was closely stacked between the fullerene (C 60 ) and perovskite films. The lead sulfate layer had a thickness of 3 to 4 nm, whereas the C 60 layer was crystalline. We used scanning TEM characterization to verify the homogeneity of the sulfate layer on the top of perovskite films. We tested various perovskite/ C 60 interface regions (fig.  S5C ) and observed a thin but continuous lead sulfate layer both on the surface and at grain boundaries of the perovskite film, suggesting complete coverage of lead sulfate on the top surface of perovskite films. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) transmission spectra of CsFAMA perovskite powders before and after surface treatment were collected to probe the interactions of sulfate ions with the perovskite. The tetrahedral symmetric sulfate ions typically present one broad peak at ~1100 cm -1 of the triply degenerate v3 band  (19) . The occurrence of v1 band (945 cm -1 ) and split v3 bands (950 to ~1200 cm -1 ) (Fig.  1C ) suggests a distortion of the tetrahedral structure of sulfate ions and formation of strong ionic bonds between Pb 2+ and SO 4 2ions  (20) . The characteristic vibration peaks of the sulfate-treated sample were at the identical frequency (950 to ~1200 cm -1 ) to those of pure PbSO 4 powder (fig.  S6 ), which implies the similar IR vibration behavior of the surface layer on the perovskite surface. We performed x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to further characterize the perovskite surface composition after surface treatment. The Pb 4f spectrum exhibited two contributions, 4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 (Fig.  1D ), located at 138.6 and 143.5 eV for the film without any treatment (control), respectively  (21) . The shift of the Pb peaks toward higher binding energies is evidence for the formation of stronger ionic bonding between Pb 2+ and SO 4 2-ions  (22) . The S/Pb atom ratio was estimated to be 1.03 by the integrated area of corresponding peaks (Fig.  1E ). We performed first-principles density functional theory (DFT) computational analyses of the interaction between MAPbI 3 and PbSO 4 using a slab model of both materials and investigated the nature of their interface by means of ab initio Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics (CPMD). We initially considered a (001) MAI-terminated MAPbI 3 surface covered by eight PbSO 4 units arranged in a network similar to that of the perfect PbSO 4 crystal but matching the lattice of MAPbI 3 . We evolved the system dynamics at 350 K for several picoseconds and observed the structural inter-face rearrangement. Starting from the ordered interface (Fig.  2A ), we observed the progressive replacement of a surface MAI unit with a PbSO 4 unit within a few picoseconds (Fig.  2 , B to D), suggesting a stronger interaction between surface Pb atoms of MAPbI 3 and SO 4 -units to form PbSO 4 . We further monitored whether a stronger interaction could exist between the PbI 2terminated surface and PbSO 4 . We thus compared the energetics of interface interaction between PbSO 4 and the two MAPbI 3 surface terminations considering a more closely packed PbSO 4 slab composed by 12 PbSO 4 units (Fig.  2, E  and F , and table  S1 ). These simulations also suggest that interaction between the PbI 2 -terminated surface and PbSO 4 is significantly favored compared with MAI-terminated surface, and the theoretical studies are consistent with the experimental results that show a strong preferential interaction of sulfate anions with perovskite lead atoms. In all cases, bulk PbSO 4 is more stable compared with the formation of a MAPbI 3 -surface PbSO 4 thin film (table  S1 ), which is consistent with the complete perovskite conversion to PbSO 4 observed upon prolonged exposure to sulfate anions. To further investigate the structure of the PbSO 4 phase at the interface with MAPbI 3 , we built a larger model in which the PbI 2 -terminated MAPbI 3 slab was interfaced with several layers of PbSO 4 (fig.  S7A ). The O-S and O-Pb radial distribution functions showed no substantial changes from pure PbSO 4 to the interface with MAPbI 3 (fig.  S7, B  and C ), which suggests the possibility for retention of a crystalline PbSO 4 phase with good lattice matching. The experimental conditions may not favor the crystalline PbSO 4 formation because of the speed of the reaction, but the amorphous PbSO 4 layer was still effective in protecting perovskite surfaces. Solar cells were fabricated with a p-i-n planar heterojunction configuration structured as indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate/poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA)/CsFAMA perovskite/C 60 /2,9-dimethyl-4, 7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP)/Cu. The solar cell device with a lead sulfate surface layer delivered a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 22.63 mA cm -2 , an open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.16 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.804, yielding a PCE of 21.1% under a reverse scan rate of 0.1 V s -1 (Fig.  3A  and table  S2 ). No notable photocurrent hysteresis was observed under forward and reverse sweeps, which suggests good passivation by the lead sulfate layer. The J SC value obtained from the current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics was also verified by measuring the external quantum efficiency (EQE) obtained through integration of the spectral response (fig.  S8 ). Additionally, the best device was further held at maximum power point (MPP) with a voltage of 0.99 V to track the stabilized power output. The photocurrent stabilized at ~21.2 mA cm -2 (Fig.  3B ), corresponding to a stabilized PCE of 21.0%. We measured J-V characteristics of champion devices with different surface treatment under simulated sunlight of air mass (AM) 1.5 G (Fig.  3C ). The control device had a J SC of 22.51 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.07 V, and a FF of 0.796, yielding a PCE of 19.16%. The photovoltaic parameters of the devices with and without octylammonium sulfate treatment were analyzed, and the statistical distribution is shown in fig.  S9 . The To quantify how much cation passivates the perovskite surface, we fabricated solar cells with different cations and anions, and detailed statistical analysis on the device parameters are summarized in table  S3 . Octylammonium iodide treatment increased the mean V OC of the cells from 1.06 to 1.08 V, implying that there is a small but distinct contribution from alkylammonium cations to the passivation of perovskite surface. However, when anions were changed by replacing octylammonium iodide with octylammonium sulfate, the mean V OC of the cells increased from 1.08 to 1.14 V. Moreover, a high mean V OC of 1.13 V could be maintained if methylammonium sulfate was used instead of long-chain alkylammonium cations, implying that sulfate anions dominated in surface passivation. We infer that the perovskite films are mostly covered by the lead sulfate layer after treatment because of the preferential reaction between Pb cations and sulfate anions, as indicated by the results of DFT simulations, so octylammonium cations have less interaction with the perovskite surface. We further demonstrated the universality of this synthetic strategy of using phosphate ions to form a Pb 3 (PO 4 ) 2 surface layer and examined the device performance. One solar cell device based on phosphated CsFAMA perovskite exhibited a J SC of 22.54 mA cm -2 , V OC of 1.14 V, and FF of 0.813, yielding a PCE of 20.87% without hysteresis (fig.  S10  and table S4 ). Trap density of states (tDOS) of the control and sulfate-treated devices was measured with thermal admittance spectroscopy. A device with sulfate top layers had a lower tDOS almost over the whole trap depth region (Fig.  3D ). The density of shallower trap states (0.35 to 0.42 eV) of the sulfate-treated device was only about 10% that of the control device. Our previous characterizations have revealed that the shallow traps mainly locate at the grain boundaries  (23) . Thus, sulfate ions can effectively reach the grain boundaries during the treatment and passivate them, subsequently increasing the device V OC . The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the control CsFAMA perovskite film show a biexponential decay with a fast and a slow component (Fig.  3E ). The surface layer mainly affected the fast PL decay process. The fast-component of the recombination process from the control and sulfate-treated films were fitted to be 3.2 and 24.7 ns, respectively, which is consistent with the enhanced steady-state PL results (Fig.  3F ). The enhanced PL intensity and PL decay lifetime illustrate that the nonradiative recombination of photo-generated carriers in perovskite films is reduced by the formation of lead sulfate surface layers  (24, 25) . Devices were then irradiated under AM 1.5 G simulated illumination, and weak laser pulses (337 nm, 4 ns) were used to modulate V OC to measure the decay of transient photovoltage signals. As seen in Fig.  3G  and fig.  S11 , the chargerecombination lifetime under 1 Sun illumination was increased from 0.27 ms for the control device to 0.58 and 0.47 ms for sulfate-and phosphatetreated devices, respectively. The lower charge trap density and longer carrier recombination lifetime of samples with lead sulfate top layers indicate that the reaction of sulfate and phosphate ions with defective perovskite surface reduces the surface defect density, in addition to the charge compensation effect of these ions. The widebandgap lead oxysalt layer should also contribute to the reduced surface charge recombination rate, similar to the passivation of silicon by oxides  (26) . We performed long-term stability tests of encapsulated CsFAMA perovskite devices under a plasma lamp with light intensity equivalent to AM 1.5 G (fig.  S12 ), without ultraviolet filter in air (relative humidity ~60 ± 10%). All devices were loaded with a resistance so that they worked at MPP at the beginning of the tests. The J-V curves were automatically recorded with a reverse scan rate of 0.1 V s -1 every 6 hours. We frequently checked the stabilized efficiency during the test and did not find obvious differences between the stabilized efficiency and that from J-V scanning. Most importantly, instead of monitoring device stability at a reduced temperature of 20 to 25°C that may cause the overestimation of solar cell stability, we conducted the stability testing at real operation temperature and used a light source with a substantial ultraviolet component. The temperature of the devices under illumination was measured to be ~65°C, which is typical of the thermal heating effect of light. The PCE of the encapsulated control device degraded rapidly from 18.2 to 8.54% after testing for 474 hours (Fig.  3H ). For the devices with the lead sulfate layer, the PCE slightly improved during the first 120 hours of testing and then degraded linearly with both reduced J SC and FF over time. After 1200 hours of testing, the efficiency slightly dropped to 96.8% of the initial value. This CsFAMA perovskite device is one of the most stable reported when tested at MPP conditions (table  S5 ). In ambient conditions, hydration and oxidization of perovskites are among main paths for the degradation of perovskite films  (13, 27) . We studied the water resistance of perovskites with lead sulfate surface layers on MAPbI 3 single crystals. MAPbI 3 crystals were treated with the sulfate precursor solution followed by thermal annealing at 100°C for 10 min (supplementary materials). When dipped in water, the control MAPbI 3 crystal without any treatment quickly turned yellow within 10 s because of fast decomposition of MAPbI 3 with water, forming PbI 2 or other hydrates, whereas the sample with a sulfate layer remained black after dipping in water for >60 s (Fig.  4A  and movie S1). The much later appearance of yellow PbI 2 from perovskite single crystals showed that the lead sulfate top layer was compact enough to slow down the permeation of water into perovskite. We tested the water resistivity of the lead sulfate layer by dripping water on top of the devices with and without sulfate treatment. A device with the lead sulfate layer remained black for 3 min after dripping water, whereas the control device quickly decomposed to yellow-colored PbI 2 (fig.  S13 ). We also tested the protection effect of lead sulfate layer on polycrystalline films that had the same stacking structure of the devices but without metal electrodes. The perovskite film with lead sulfate layer was sandwiched between PTAA and phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) layers. We recorded the  absorbance changes at 740 nm during the stability test to quantify the material degradation. The control sample lost 84.2% of its absorbance after illumination for 504 hours, whereas the sample with a lead sulfate layer only lost 16.8% (Fig.  4B  and fig.  S14 ). Ammonium cations have also been reported to enhance the stability of perovskites  (28) . We tested another set of perovskite thin films in air under illumination without any charge transport layers to study which species-specifically, ammonium or sulfate ions-play the dominating role in stabilizing perovskite films. The CsFAMA perovskite film treated with octylammonium iodide fully bleached after testing for 4 days, only slightly preventing the decomposition of the perovskite film as compared with the control sample without any treatment (fig.  S15 ), but perovskite films with sulfate treatment remained black after 4 days. About 56 and 64% of the films' absorbance at 740 nm remained for films treated with methylammonium sulfate and octylammonium sulfate, respectively. The result verified that the stabilization was mainly derived from sulfate rather than ammonium ions. Mass transport of ions is another critical issue that limits the stability of the encapsulated perovskite devices. Ion migration is significantly enhanced under illumination  (29) , which may change the composition and morphology of perovskite films by forming pinholes in addition to causing the degradation of charge transport layers and electrodes  (30) . We also showed that ion migration is much easier at extended defects such as film surface and grain boundaries  (31) . We expect that the formation of a layer of lead oxysalt with strong ionic chemical bonding should stabilize the perovskite surface and suppress the ion migration through it. We measured with temperature-dependent electrical conductivity the activation energy (E a ) for ion migration of perovskite films. Lateral structure devices were fabricated by means of thermal evaporation of two Au electrodes on PTAA/ perovskite/PCBM films. The activation energy can be extracted from the Nernst-Einstein relation: s(T) = (s 0 /T)exp(-E a /k B T), where k B is the Boltzmann constant, s 0 is a constant, and T is temperature. The applied electric field was fixed at 0.4 V/mm, which was near the operational electric field in solar cell devices. For the CsFAMA perovskite films, ionic conductivity began to dominate the total conductivity, with an E a of 0.288 eV when the temperature was increased to 314 K in the dark (Fig.  4C ). When illuminated at 0.1 sunlight intensity, the transition temperature was reduced to 273 K, accompanied with a lower E a of 0.104 eV. This observation agrees well with our previous results that light would facilitate the ion migration  (29) . For the sulfate-treated perovskite film, we did not observe such a transition from electronic to ionic conductivity when the temperature was increased to 330 K both in the dark and under illumination (Fig.  4D ). A constant slope was obtained with an E a of 0.036 eV, which we ascribed to electronic conduction. We also measured E a of individual MAPbI 3 single crystals to isolate the influence of untreated grain boundaries in polycrystalline films, which act as the main channel for ion migration  (31) . Similar phenomena were observed for the single crystals (Fig.  4 , E to F). We thus conclude that ion migration is efficiently suppressed by the lead sulfate top layer on the surface of perovskite, possibly because surface defects such as vacancies were immobilized by the strongly bonded lead sulfate layer, which also explains the restrained morphological variation of perovskite films with the presence of the lead sulfate layer (fig.  S16 ). Generally, ion migration through grain boundaries is much slower than at the surface, so the exclusion of ion migration at a film surface should also indicate the absence of ion migration through sulfated grain boundaries.  Fig. S1 . S1 Fig. S1. XRD patterns of perovskite films reacted with octylammonium sulfate precursor solution for 30 min, followed by 10 min annealing at 100 o C.

1802,95_4," (2 of 8) recombination. Therefore, although defect passivation of the 3D surface depending on the alkyl type of the alkylammonium cation forming the 2D layer is expected to be similar, it is believed that there will be a change in the electric field through the change in electrical properties caused by the difference in the dipole moment. Eventually, the type of alkylammonium cation constituting the 2D layer on the 3D surface may lead to differences in humidity stability, charge separation and transport in addition to the defect passivation. In this study, power conversion efficiency (PCE) and humidity stability of the 3D perovskite [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MA PbBr 3 ) 0.05 ] post-treated with butylammonium iodide (BAI), octylammonium iodide (OAI), and dodecylammonium iodide (DAI) with alkylammonium of different chain lengths were compared. Moreover, the influence of the electrical properties of the 2D layer on the PCE of the 3D/2D bilateral structure was also compared by device simulation. As the length of the alkyl chain increased from BA to OA to DA, the difference in electron blocking and resistance to humidity increased significantly for BA and OA, but the corresponding difference in the case of DA was not large. The PSC post-treated with OAI showed slightly higher than those with BAI and DAI, achieving a certified stabilized efficiency of 22.9%. 3D perovskite thin films were deposited on a 150 nm thick nanostructured TiO 2 electrode (ns-TiO 2 ) by the solvent engineering process reported by us previously.  [39]  Post-treatment of the as-deposited perovskite layer was performed by pouring the solutions of BAI, OAI, and DAI in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) on the perovskite thin film, followed by heat treatment at 100 °C for 5 min. Figure  1a  shows the electron microscope image of the surface before and after the surface treatment. It can be seen that there is little change in the morphology of the surface even after post-treating the perovskite layer with BAI, OAI, and DAI. This suggests that the surface treatment in this study does not alter the surface morphology of the underlying perovskite or form a secondary phase with a new shape. Therefore, small amounts of BA, OA, and DA may be incorporated into the perovskite 3D structure. Figure  1b  shows the UV-vis absorbance, which demonstrates that the perovskite surface treatment does not change the optical properties of the perovskite except at the shoulder, where the absorbance increases in the region of ≈560 nm. As can be seen from the inset in Figure  1b , the absorbance of the shoulder is more clearly observed in the case of OAI or DAI than BAI. This means that the surface treatment causes the formation of 3D/2D mixture or a 3D/2D bilayer with new light absorption properties on top of or inside the perovskite layer. Organic ammonium cations with alkyl chain lengths longer than the ionic size that can be spatially coordinated with PbI 6 octahedrons, such as methylammonium (MA) or formamidinium (FA) cations, are well known to form 2D perovskite structures. In this regard, BA, OA, and DA will form a 2D perovskite structure, and it is clear that the absorption shoulders shown in the UV-vis spectra are related to this. Perovskite surface treatment with BA, OA, and DA was also studied by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), which confirmed the formation of 2D structures. In Figure  1c , the addition of BA, OA, and DA reveals a new diffraction spot in the inner circle of the GIWAXS, indicating the formation of an out-of-plane 2D structure at low angles, which appears clearer. Some of the already structured 3D perovskite can be easily converted into 2D by post-treatment of long alkylammonium, resulting in higher formation energy of the 2D structure than that of the 3D. In fact, there have been many reports that mixing a certain amount of long alkyl ammonium halides in a perovskite precursor solution easily creates a 3D/2D mixed hybrid structure.  [12] [13] [14]  Similarly, a quasi-2D structure expressed by the general formulae A′ 2 A n-1 B n X 3n+1 (〈n〉 = 1 to ∞) can also be formed.  [23, 43]  The 〈n〉 value represents the number of [BX 6 ] 4-octahedra layers stacked between two organic spacers; the thickness of the inorganic layers can be tuned by carefully adjusting the stoichiometric ratio of A′ and A organic cation in the precursor solution. In contrast, the amount of this 2D structure in the 3D/2D hybrid increases with the amount added, but adding more than the critical amount will cause the 3D perovskite to be oriented in a particular direction. In particular, it is interesting that the smallest amount that cause the 3D perovskite to be oriented depends on the type of alkylammonium added to the precursor solution. It is also known that the 2D perovskite is distributed mainly near the grain boundaries rather than being uniformly distributed in the perovskite films.  [14, 44, 45]  Figure  1d  shows the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images of perovskite post-treated with OA. The 2D structure on the surface of the perovskite shows the diffraction spots from the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) due to the crystalline phase, although the thickness of the 2D layer on 3D is thin that clear indexing is not easy. Thus, although both addition of alkylammonium halides to the precursor solution and post-treatment of the perovskite layers result in a 3D/2D mixed structure, only post-treatment results in an out-of-plane 2D structure. The presence of an out-of-plane 2D structure may be undesirable because the charge generated by the light transfers in a direction perpendicular to the perovskite film. However, it would be desirable if the 2D structure, which is chemically more stable than the 3D structure, exists parallel to the thin film to effectively block the penetration of external corrosion factors. The properties of the 2D structure present on the perovskite surface depend on the type of alkyl ammonium halide, which is expected to affect the performance and stability of the PSCs owing to the differences among BA, OA, and DA as spacers. As several studies have already reported, the post-treatment of long-alkylammonium halide on the perovskite layer reduces the charge recombination owing to the passivation effect of defects on the surface of the perovskite. In this work, we compared the passivation ability of different alkylammonium iodides by surveying the photoexcited charge dynamics using time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). Figure  2a  shows the TRPL decays of the perovskite films before and after  ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TitaniumDioxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""octylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""22.9"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
1803,95_5," (4 of 8) post-treatment with BAI, OAI, and DAI. Typically, the TRPL curves are analyzed by fitting the decay curves of the PL transients using the two exponential functions in Equation (  1 ) and then extracting the associated lifetimes  [2, 4, 11, 30, 32, 33, 36, 46]  = + τ τ - - y A e Ae t t 1 / 2 / 1 2 (1) where τ 1 and τ 2 represent fast and slow decay time constants and are associated with radiative recombination and trap-assisted nonradiative recombination. The long lifetime reflects the high quality of the perovskite film. The lifetimes due to nonradiative recombination in pristine perovskite and perovskites posttreated with BA, OA, and DA are 0.49, 0.92, 1.08, and 1.15 µs, respectively. As expected, the steady-state PL of the posttreated samples also shows a stronger PL intensity (Figure  S1 , Supporting Information). We found in the TRPL that the post-treatment of the pure perovskite layer resulted in a significant improvement in the carrier life, especially with longer alkyl lengths of alkylammonium iodide. This is consistent with the result that post-treatment with alkyl ammonium exceeding the size of the organic cations that make up the 3D perovskite effectively passivates the defects on the 3D surface, creating a 2D structure on the surface. The fact that the post-treatment of perovskite thin films with alkyl ammonium iodide increases carrier life owing to the reduction of defects is also supported by evaluating the space charge limit current (SCLC) region in the I-V measurements. The onset voltage for the trap-filled limit (V TFL ) of SCLC is linearly proportional to the density of the trap states. As shown in Figure  S2  (Supporting Information), the post-treatment of perovskite layers by alkylammonium iodides resulted in slight decrease in V TFL , which indicated a reduction in trap concentration. Thus, posttreatment of the perovskite thin films with alkylammonium iodides is expected to improve the efficiency of the device. Figure  2b  shows the I-V characteristics of devices fabricated by depositing a perovskite thin layer on a ns-TiO 2 ETL, followed by post-treatment with BAI, OAI, and DAI, and coating of the Au metal electrodes. The device with only Au metal electrodes without post-treatment of the perovskite thin layer with alkylammonium iodide works well, as we reported earlier, but it has very low efficiency.  [38]  On the other hand, when perovskite is post-treated with alkyl ammonium iodide, the efficiency of the device is greatly increased to 10.5, 13.4, and 15.1% for BAI, OAI, and DAI, respectively. In particular, it can be seen that the efficiency of the device post-treated with DA is almost three times higher than that (5.9%) of the pristine device. Interestingly, the value of the short-circuit current density (J sc ) is almost constant and the increase in efficiency is only caused by the simultaneous increase in the opencircuit voltage (V oc ) and fill factor (FF). The almost identical J sc indicates that the post-treatment of the perovskite layers by alkyl ammonium iodide has little effect on the extraction and transfer of charges generated by light absorption of the perovskite. This result suggests that 2D perovskites with a wider bandgap than the 3D perovskite have little interference in the hole transfer. More specifically, it can be considered that the 2D structure on the 3D perovskite surface (illustrated in Figure  1 ), obtained after post-treatment of the perovskite layer by alkylammonium iodide, functions as a barrier layer for electrons without disturbing the hole transport. In this respect, the electron-blocking properties of the 2D structure are believed to be more effective with regard to increasing the bandgap of the 2D structure along the length of the alkyl ammonium group. Considering the effective defect passivation observed in the PL testing and the electron-blocking ability, the post-treatment of alkyl ammonium iodide is expected to be most effective in the case of DA, which has relatively long alkyl chains. We compared the I-V characteristics of the full devices fabricated with N2,N2′,N7,N7′-tetrakis(9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-N2,N2′,N7,N7′-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9′-spirobi[fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetraamine) (DM)  [4]  as the HTL on top of the perovskite post-treated with BA, OA, and DA. As shown in Figure  2c  (the inset table), and Figure  S3  (Supporting Information), the PCE values obtained from the average J-V curves for the BA, OA, and DA-treated perovskites reveal that although the difference between the photovoltaic characteristics of the devices is very small, the device post-treated with OAI has the highest PCE. In terms of defect passivation and electron blocking, it is expected that the efficiency of the device will be the highest in the PSC post-treated with DAI, but it is very interesting that the highest efficiency is actually observed in the device treated with OAI. Indeed, the overall PCE is the sum of all the factors affecting the efficiency. To gain a better understanding of the microscopic effect of the 2D structures formed with BAI, OAI, and DAI on the overall performance, we investigated the recombination process electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measured at a bias of 0.9 V under dark condition. To properly interpret or analyze the impedance spectrum of the PSCs, the experimental data must be fitted using a suitable equivalent circuit model based on the continuity equation. However, there is yet to be an agreement on the exact equations governing PSCs owing to their complex electronic and ionic conductivities. The Nyquist (Z′-Z″) plots in Figure  2d  show a semicircle corresponding to a parallel RC circuit against frequency. At low frequencies, the impedance of the capacitor is infinite because the complex impedance of the capacitor C follows the relation ZC = -j/wC. At high frequencies, the capacitor acts as a short circuit, and Z is zero across the origin. At medium frequencies, the RC circuit has a maximum peak point, which generally corresponds to the time constant t during charging and discharging. Therefore, the radii of the impedance semicircle relate to the internal resistance for recombination rate of the PSC.  [10, 17, 47]  As shown in Figure  2d , the semicircle radii of the PSCs post-treated with BAI and OAI are significantly larger and then decreased in DAI. The behavior is consistent with the increase of carrier lifetime observed in TRPL and the V oc of PSCs post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI. Although the highest V oc occurs in the DAI-treated PSC, the corresponding PCE is not the highest, owing to a slight decrease in FF, which is 81.8% for OAI and 81.0% for DAI. This indicates that the internal resistance for recombination rate of the devices containing a HTL is the highest in the case of OAI, which means that the interface between 2D/HTL should be taken into account depending on the type of alkylammonium. Here, note that all devices are fabricated by the same process except for the alkylammonium iodide used in the process, and the interfacial resistance in the charge transfer dynamics of the PSCs is associated with the charge recombination resistance (R rec ). Accordingly, we deduce from time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) and EIS that perovskites post-treated with longer alkylammonium chain lengths have more effective defect passivation, but the interface between the 2D structure and the HTL also affects the charge transfer dynamics. As discussed previously, DA, which has alkyl groups longer than those of OA and BA, enhances the electron-blocking effect by increasing the bandgap of the 2D structure. However, it also increases the series resistance by increasing the distance between the 2D interlayers from the comparison of the series resistance from the high-frequency region (≈1 MHz) of the Nyquist plot, although the difference in values is very small. Furthermore, this may be due to the increasing mismatch of energy levels by 2D located between the 3D perovskite and the HTM, because longer alkyl chains in the alkylammonium iodide on the 3D perovskite resulted in lower HOMO levels, as can be seen from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information). Consequently, PSCs based on perovskite layers post-treated with the alkylammonium iodides have simultaneously higher shunt and series resistances, as the chain length of the alkyl group increases in addition to passivation of the surface defects. This may be related to the wider bandgap of the 2D phase produced by the post-treatment of alkyl ammonium iodide in comparison with the 3D phase; the longer the alkyl chain, the larger is the bandgap. It can be deduced from the above that the energy level of the 2D phase produced by posttreatment with alkylammonium iodide does not significantly interfere with hole transport or block electron leakage, but it can affect the efficiency of full devices containing an HTL. In addition to the changes in the energy levels, attention was paid to the effect of the changes in the dielectric properties of the 2D phase generated over the 3D phase along the length of the alkyl group.  [48] [49] [50]  The 2D structure formed with larger alkylammonium ions will have higher dielectric properties owing to the longer alkyl chain, as longer alkyl groups have higher partial charge and related dipole moments. We simulated the carrier movement using finite element analysis to understand the effect of the dielectric properties of the 2D structure present on top of the 3D structure on the efficiency. SILVACO ATLAS  [51]  was used as the simulation software. The parameters in Table  1  were used as the input data for the simulation. In addition, the lifetime due to Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination and the doping concentration of the HTL (Spiro-OMeTAD) were adjusted by using the V oc and FF of the PSC fabricated with pristine perovskite, and then used for the simulation of PSCs post-treated with alkylammonium iodide. Figure  3a  shows the change in the recombination rate with increasing electron density at perovskite/HTL interface. The x-axis was set according to the thickness of the device. The interface between the ETL and perovskite of the studied device was close to 0.05 µm and the interface between perovskite and HTL was close to 0.4 µm. The red line representing the highest recombination rate corresponds to the negative charge density of 3 × 10 9 cm -2 at the interface. The values toward the bottom are the result of the recombination rate when the electron density is 3 × 10 11 and 3 × 10 12 cm -2 . The more the electrons donated from the 2D layer, the lower is the recombination rate. Perovskite being an insulator, the charge carriers can move out of the constraint of an atom when they receive energy from the outside. Carriers excited by the absorption of light travel by the mechanism of diffusion or drift. At the band-bending ETL/ perovskite interface, electrons move rapidly due to differences in the energy levels as well as diffusion and drift (in addition to diffusion and drift, band bending causes the movement of electrons to move quickly at the ETL/perovskite interface). In a real device, the effect of drift will decrease as the carrier moves away from the ETL/perovskite junction, whereas the diffusion caused by the carrier density difference will increase. In particular, as the dielectric constant of the 2D structure on the 3D structure is increased, the electron density increases, and the diffusion in the ETL direction is more active. At the red line (Figure  3a ), most of the electrons in the HTL interface will recombine without spreading fast enough.  [57]  On the other hand, the recombination rate at the interface decreases when sufficient electrons are supplied to the 2D perovskite. In turn, the overall recombination is reduced if the difference in the electron density increases across the device depths. The resulting J sc , V oc , FF, and final PCE are shown in Figure  3b, c . As can be seen in Figure  3b , J sc showed a slight increase by electron donation, but there was no significant change in its value. As expected from the reduction in the recombination rate, both V oc and FF significantly increased (Figure  3c ). Note that we only assumed an increase in the negative charge density of the interface without considering the increase in the series resistance by the 2D layer because the physical properties of the 2D structure formed with BA, OA, and DA are not yet understood clearly. In this simulation, we believe that if the 2D layer over the 3D layer functions as an electron donor, the FF can be maintained even if the series resistance by the 2D layer increases slightly; this can be used as a strategy for achieving higher FF in the future. Although longer alkyl groups in alkyl ammonium cations act as electron donors to increase the negative charge density, the difference in V oc and FF obtained in the simulation is only possible at high dielectric constants of the 2D/3D layers. In other words, materials with low dielectric properties are not expected to reduce the Electron/hole mobility [cm 2 V -1 s -1 ] 0.02 11.8/12.5  [53] [54] [55]  0.0002 SRH lifetime, τ e = τ h [s] 6 × 10 -10 6.5 × 10 -7  [56, 57]  6.5 × 10 -7 Auger recombination coefficient [cm 6 s -1 ] 0 8.8 × 10 -30  [56, 57]  0 1902740 (6 of 8) recombination even if sufficient carriers are supplied at the interface. To obtain accurate boundary conditions, the relative electrical permittivity of the present perovskite was measured by EIS. As shown in Figure  S5  (Supporting Information), the relative dielectric constant has a value of ≈70 in the range of 100-10 000 Hz, and becomes large at low frequencies.  [58]  This is consistent with the reported results. Therefore, it is expected that the dielectric properties of the alkyl group constituting the 2D layer sensitively affect the efficiency of the device under the DC condition in which the solar cell operates. Figure  3d  shows the I-V curves measured in the reverse and forward modes for one of the best-performing devices fabricated by post-treatment with OAI on perovskite thin film. The PCE is 23.3% with short-circuit current (J sc ) of 24.99 mA cm -2 and V oc of 1.13 V, and the FF is 82.75% in the reverse mode. The equivalent values in the forward mode are efficiency of 22.04% with J sc of 24.87 mA cm -2 and V oc of 1.10 V, and 80.77% FF. As is well known, the two measurement modes have a difference in efficiency, called hysteresis, which is mainly caused by the difference between V oc and FF rather than J sc . Recently, the stabilized method, that is, ≈10-point IV sweep configuration, wherein the bias voltage is held constant until the measured current attains a constant value, has been applied for determining the efficiency with higher accuracy. Thus, one of the efficient devices was certified by an accredited testing laboratory (Newport Corporation Technology and Application Center Photovoltaic Lab). As shown in Figure  S6  (Supporting Information), the efficiency under full sun was 22.91%, which is more close to the value measured in the reverse mode. Finally, the stability of the PSCs under humid conditions was investigated. In our experiments, all PSCs without encapsulation were stored in a humidity control box at room temperature (RT) with 85% relative humidity (RH), and 65 °C with 65% RH. The humidity resistance of perovskite thin films post-treated with different lengths of alkyl ammonium halides can be highly dependent on the length of the alkyl chain. Indeed, the comparison of hydrophobicity of the surface of perovskite post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI shows an increase in hydrophobicity owing to the increase in the length of the alkyl chain, as shown in Figure  S7  (Supporting Information). The surface of the pristine perovskite has a contact angle of 52.91°. On the other hand, the surfaces post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI have contact angles of 56.25°, 61. 5°, and 85.78°, respectively; in particular, the surface treated with DAI exhibits a very high contact angle. Therefore, the humidity stability of devices fabricated with perovskite post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI is expected to show a large difference depending on the length of the alkyl chain. To more accurately understand the dependence of the resistance to moisture on the length of the alkyl chain, the change in PL over time at 65 °C under 65% relative humidity was monitored after post-treating with alkylammonium iodide perovskites deposited on ns-TiO 2 electrode. As expected, it can be seen that with increase in time under the test conditions, the difference in the PL intensity, which was initially small, becomes larger. As shown in Figure  4a , the PL intensities of the perovskite thin films post-treated with BA, OA, and DA are different. Therefore, the PL intensity measured for each thin film was compared with the normalized value. This is consistent with the tendency of increasing hydrophobicity with increasing  chain length of the alkyl ammonium used in post-treatment of the perovskite, which indicates that long alkyl chains are effective in protecting the perovskite. Figure  4b  shows the change in efficiency measured with 100 h of exposure at 65 °C under 65% humidity for devices fabricated with perovskite layers posttreated with BAI, OAI, and DAI. The efficiencies of pristine and BAI-treated perovskite drop to ≈20% of the initial efficiency after 100 h of exposure under the experimental condition; therefore, BA has very low humidity resistance. On the other hand, perovskite devices treated with OAI and DAI showed no significant degradation; especially, DAI maintained 80% of its initial efficiency without encapsulation. At low temperatures under high humidity (Figure  4c ), the degradation behavior along the alkyl chain length is the same, even at 85% relative humidity, and the device post-treated with DAI maintains more than 90% of its initial efficiency after 100 h of exposure. Interestingly, as shown in Figure  4d , the full devices, including organic HTL, which can act as an additional protective layer against moisture, show more severe degradation at 25 °C temperature and 85% humidity. This may be due to the effect of hygroscopic additives such as tert-butylpyridine and Li-salt added to increase the hole conductivity of DM used as the HTL. Therefore, considering the long-term stability of PSCs, especially humidity stability, it is very important that the alkyl group of alkyl ammonium and the HTL should be selected such that they do not significantly impair the efficiency. In summary, we investigated the PCE and humidity stability of PSCs fabricated from 3D perovskite post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI. The performance of the PSCs was compared by device simulation by considering the electrical properties of the 2D layer in the 3D/2D bilateral structure. The electron-blocking ability and moisture resistance increased with increasing length of the alkyl chain, but the highest PCE was obtained in the OAI-treated PSC, which showed a certified stabilized efficiency of 22.9%. 1:1 molar ratio of synthesized MABr and PbBr 2 (Aldrich) in 6 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF).

1818,12_2,"wide-bandgap organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (WBPs) exhibiting a bandgap of E G ∼ 1.7-1.8 eV are a key focus of current research since they are ideally suited for the top absorber material in tandem PV architectures based on established low-bandgap PV technologies, such as the market-dominating crystalline Si waferbased solar cells or copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) thin-film devices. [11][12][13][14] In recent years, the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite/Si tandem solar cells rose quickly, reaching 26.4% for perovskite/Si tandem solar cells in 4-terminal configuration and 27.3% in 2-terminal configuration. A PCE of 23.9% was reported for perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cells. [12,15,16]  Moreover, WBPs are of key relevance for the emerging perovskite/perovskite thin-film tandem PV technology. [17]  For all of these perovskite-based multijunction solar cell technologies, promising first steps toward the upscaling to solar modules architectures have been demonstrated. [15,[18][19][20] In order to enable perovskite-based multijunction PV technologies to significantly outperform the market-dominating crystalline Si single-junction solar cells (record PCE of 26.6%), further advancement of WBP solar cells with regard to stability In this work, the authors realize stable and highly efficient wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells that promise high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) and are likely to play a key role in next generation multi-junction photovoltaics (PV). This work reports on wide-bandgap (≈1.72 eV) perovskite solar cells exhibiting stable PCEs of up to 19.4% and a remarkably high open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.31 V. The V OC -to-bandgap ratio is the highest reported for wide-bandgap organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells and the V OC also exceeds 90% of the theoretical maximum, defined by the Shockley-Queisser limit. This advance is based on creating a hybrid 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure. By spin coating n-butylammonium bromide on the doublecation perovskite absorber layer, a thin 2D Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite layer of intermediate phases is formed, which mitigates nonradiative recombination in the perovskite absorber layer. As a result, V OC is enhanced by 80 mV.","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""butylammonium bromide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
1819,12_3,"(2 of 10) and PCE is of uppermost importance.  [9, 10, 21]  WBPs conventionally consist of organic-inorganic mixed-halide lead perovskites, represented by the crystal structure ABX 3 . The bandgap (E G ) of these perovskites can be tuned by changing the stoichiometric ratio of Br and I at the halogen anion site X as well as the incorporation of Sn at the Pb cation site.  [22] [23] [24] [25] [26]  In order to circumvent the instabilities in WBPs with high Br content due to phase segregation, compositional engineering of the A cation site using methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), Cesium (Cs), or Rubidium (Rb) was proven to be successful. Starting from double-cation (FA/Cs) compositions at the A cation site, a large variety of different A cation compositions has shown high PCE and enhanced stability, including both triple-cation (FA/MA/Cs) and quadruple-cation (FA/MA/Cs/Rb) compositions.  [12, 14, [27] [28] [29] [30]  In addition to the compositional engineering of the perovskite structure, several complementary strategies have been explored to further advance the stability and PCE, e.g., i) by controlling the crystallization of the perovskite film; ii) the incorporation of additives, such as Pb-(SCN) 2 , potassium or formamide; and iii) the use of surface passivation layers, such as quaternary ammonium halide anions or fullerenes like C 60 .  [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38]  Recently, 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures have emerged as a new concept to further enhance the stability and increase the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of multication perovskite solar cells by employing alkylammonium organic cations (e.g., butylammonium (BA), phenylethylammonium iodide) in the perovskite structure.  [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47]  The resulting 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures mitigate nonradiative recombination, resulting in an impressive V OC of 1.24 V for a bulk perovskite absorber bandgap of 1.72 eV.  [41]  There is virtue of layered perovskite materials that can be explored in the future for the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) or 2D Dion-Jacobsen (DJ) families of perovskites.  [48, 49]  Despite the remarkable progress, the maximum V OC of all WBP solar cells in the optimal optical bandgap range for perovskite-based tandem PV (1.7-1.8 eV) remains limited to 1.24 eV (see Figure  1 ) and a PCE of 17.2%.  [50, 51]  In this work, a significant advance is demonstrated in this regard, making use of 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures. By depositing n-butylammonium bromide (BABr) on the 3D perovskite surface, a hybrid 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure is created at the interface toward the hole-extracting layer of the WBP solar cells (E G ∼ 1.72 eV). For very thin 2D perovskite layers, an unprecedented stable power output conversion efficiency (SPCE) of 19.4% and a V OC up to 1.31 V in planar architecture WBPs solar cells is demonstrated (see Figure  1  and Figure  S1 , Supporting Information). The WBP solar cells in focus of this study employ a doublecation perovskite absorber layer based on the cations FA and Cs in the composition Cs 0.17 FA 0.83 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 , exhibiting a bandgap of 1.72 eV (see Figure  S2 , Supporting Information), as first reported by McMeekin et al.  [27]  The devices were fabricated using the following planar device architecture: glass substrate, indium tin oxide (ITO) front electrode, nanoparticle-based SnO 2 electron transport layer (ETL), double-cation perovskite absorber layer (Cs 0.17 FA 0.83 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 ), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N, N′-di-p-methoxy phenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) hole transport layer (HTL) and Au back electrode (see Figure  2a ). The detailed device fabrication is presented in the Experimental Section. The reference device (without interlayer) exhibits a SPCE under constant illumination at AM 1.5G for 5 min of 16.7% and a V OC of 1.23 V (see Figure  2b, c ). By spin coating BABr dissolved in isopropanol (2 mg mL -1 ) on top of the perovskite absorber layer, an interlayer is introduced in between the bulk perovskite layer and the HTL. As shown later, this interlayer is likely composed of 2D-RP perovskite in intermediate phase of n = 2, resulting in a thin 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure at the hole-extracting side of the solar cell. The device incorporating the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure demonstrates a very high PCE of 19.8% and SPCE of 19.4% with less hysteresis under continuous illumination of one-sun irradiation intensity (AM 1.5G with 1000 W m -2 ) (see Figure  2b ,c and Figure  S3 , Supporting Information). Moreover, an enhancement in V OC of up to 80 mV is observed, leading to a stable unprecedented V OC for WBPs (E G ∼ 1.72 eV) of up to 1.31 eV (see Figures  1  and 2b,d ). This V OC reaches >90% of the maximum V OC attainable for this bandgap according to the Shockley-Queisser limit (S-Q limit) and represents the highest ratio of qV OC /E G (0.76) reported for any perovskite solar cell of PCEs > 13% (see Figure  1  and Table  S1 , Supporting Information). It shall be noted that the E G is determined in different ways for the various references provided in Figure  1 , which introduces a small inaccuracy (<2%) in the comparison of qV OC /E G . In this work, we determine the bandgap from a Tauc plot, which is sufficient considering the sharp absorption edge of perovskites (see Figure  S2 , Supporting Information). While the ratio qV OC /E G serves as a coarse but convenient figure-of-merit to quickly examine the quality of any PV absorber material, the ratio of the experimental V OC to the maximum attainable V OC according to the S-Q limit represents a fundamental comparison to a hypothetical perfect solar cell Adv.

1820,12_4," (3 of 10) that exhibits exclusively radiative recombination and no nonradiative recombination losses.  [52] [53] [54]  Thus, the demonstrated high experimental V OC manifests the high quality of the presented 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure in the wide context of PV materials. Along with the improved V OC , the fill factor (FF) also increases (up to 0.78), without any loss in short-circuit current density (J SC ), indicating that the efficiency of charge extraction at low external fields is also very good. The stable and reproducible performance of the perovskite solar cells employing the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure is proven further by providing data on the statistics of a number of devices (>29) that all demonstrate a significant V OC enhancement compared to the 3D reference perovskite devices (see Figure  2e ). Besides, devices with 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure exhibit stable V OC over time if kept under one-sun illumination (see Figure  2f ) and stable power output up to 20 h (see Figure  S3 , Supporting Information). The high V OC and PCE of WBP solar cells require optimization of the thickness of the 2D-RP perovskite interlayer, as presented in Figure  3 . Here, the statistics of the PV characteristics of several devices using 2D-RP perovskite interlayers processed by spin coating of BABr solution with various concentrations (2, 5, and 7.5 mg mL -1 ) are provided. The V OC increases up to 1.32 V for a concentration of 5 mg mL -1 , but drops for higher concentrations. The FF and J SC increase slightly for an optimal concentration of 2 mg mL -1 compared to the reference case and decrease strongly for higher concentrations along with a significant increase in series resistance (see Table  S2 , Supporting Information). This trend is attributed to the low conductivity of the disordered 2D-RP perovskite interlayers and the expected increase in thickness of the interlayers with increasing BABr concentration (2, 5, and 7.5 mg mL -1 ), which is indicated in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the surface of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information) and cross-sectional SEM images (Figures S5 and S6, Supporting Information).  [55, 56]  In addition, the absorptance spectra (Figure  S7 , Supporting Information) show a thickness reduction of the 3D perovskite layer explained by the increasing 2D-RP perovskites interlayer thickness along with increasing BABr concentration, which in turn also accounts for a reduction in short-current density. It should be noted further that the J SC derived from external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements of the 3D reference perovskite and 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure solar cells treated with different BABr concentrations (2, 5, 7.5 mg mL -1 ) are 18.4, 18.6, 17.4, and 11.8 mA cm -2 , respectively, which is in good agreement (± 0.8 mA cm -2 ) with the J SC obtained from the J-V scans of the corresponding devices (see Figure  S8 , Supporting Information). In order to confirm that the interlayer formed by spin coating BABr solution on top of the perovskite is indeed a 2D-RP perovskite, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed. The as-prepared double-cation perovskite thin-film exhibits the typical XRD peaks resulting from perovskite crystal plane diffraction of (100), (110), (111), and (200), corresponding to the Cs 0.17 FA 0.83 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 perovskite lattice (see Figure  4a ).

1824,12_8," (7 of 10) the enhancement in V OC . Recent literature has established that the V OC is highly sensitive to interfacial recombination at the spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite interface (which in turn is sensitive to the concentration of dopants and additives in spiro-OMeTAD), and to the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH)-type nonradiative recombination in the bulk.  [66, 67]  In a first step, the ideality factor (n id ) of the perovskite solar cells with and without 2D-RP perovskite interlayer is examined by light intensity-dependent V OC measurements, in accordance with established procedures.  [67]  For the reference solar cells without 2D-RP perovskite interlayer, the n id is found to be ≈1. 35 (Figure  S15  and Table  S3 , Supporting Information), representing a low dependence of V OC on the light intensity in the reference device (≈78 mV dec  -1  ). An n id in the range of 1 and 2 indicates that at least two (likely three) dominant recombination mechanisms with n id = 1 and n id = 2 coexist. Among the recombination mechanisms leading to n id = 1, radiative recombination as well as surface recombination are prominent candidates.  [67]  The recombination mechanism that leads to an n id = 2 in perovskite solar cells is typically assigned to bulk SRH recombination.  [66]  The n id decreases to 1.18 for the solar cells using a thin 2D-RP perovskite interlayer prepared by the low concentration BABr solution (2 mg mL -1 ). Given that the solar cell parameters are broadly comparable for both the samples, the decrease in n id indicates that the recombination mechanism that leads to n id = 2 (bulk SRH) is mitigated by the thin 2D-RP perovskite interlayer, which again is consistent with the enhanced V OC in these devices (see Figure  2 ) and the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) discussed below. In order to understand the extent to which the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure can help to reduce nonradiative recombination and enhance the lifetime of the charge carriers in the device, both steady-state and transient PL spectroscopy were performed. For these measurements, the samples were prepared on glass substrates to avoid lifetime quenching due to electron extraction. In Figure  7a , the PL spectra from films of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures that were processed by the deposition of different concentrations of BABr are compared with a reference 3D double-cation perovskite layer. In all cases, the PL intensity is increased by the 2D layer, the peak position of the PL is shifted to higher energy (from 1.70 to 1.72 eV), and the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) is narrowed (from 0.128 to 0.115 eV). This is consistent with a reduction of nonradiative recombination, and also fewer tail states below the absorption edge. In addition to the PL from the low-bandgap material, Figure  7b  confirms that higher energy PL peaks centered around 2.3 eV (540 nm) are observed for the 2D-RP perovskite interlayer prepared from high-concentrated BABr solutions (5 and 7.5 mg mL -1 ) for an excitation with 3.1 eV (400 nm) photons. The PL spectra feature two emission maxima (2.2 and 2.4 eV). This points toward a more complex scenario such as: i) two intermediate phases; ii) the appearance of exciton states; or iii) reabsorption Adv. Energy Mater. 2019, 9, 1803699 Figure  7 .

1845,89_1,"We further analyze the underlying film growth mechanism in a theoretical point of view. And we assume the same interdiffusion process between the organic and inorganic species for either the α-phase (cubic) and δ-phase (hexagonal) of FAPbI3 reasonably, due to the same preparation method. The conversion process might be influenced by the alkalinity of additives. And we calculate the activation energies with existence of OH  ions in the synthesis of the α-phase (cubic) and δ-phase (hexagonal) of FAPbI3. The formation energies of both phase in normal condition and alkaline condition have been considered and the corresponding reactions of FAPbI3 are shown as follows: PbI2 + FAI → FAPbI3 (2) PbI2(OH)n + FAI → FAPbI3(OH)n (3) where the constant n represents the concentration of OH  ions in the synthesis. The OH  molecule has been inserted into the PbI2 model and FAPbI3 unit cells with different ratio n (n = 0.1 ~ 0.5) to represent the different concentration, which can be referred as ""#/unit cell"" in this simulation. The formation energies in normal condition of α-and δ-phase of FAPbI3 have been calculated as 0.157 eV and -0.271 eV, respectively. Such results indicate δ-phase of FAPbI3 is thermodynamically favored in normal synthesis conditions, in which the combination of both phase in the corresponding thin film is likely to be observed. After the introduction of OH  during film formation, the activation energy changes for the two phases follow different patterns, as is summarized in Fig.  3e  (main text). At the low OH  concentration, the δ-phase FAPbI3 has shown much higher activation energy of 5.352 eV, which is 1.834 eV higher than that of α-phase. As the OH  concentration increases, the activation energies of δ-phase FAPbI3 will experience an evident drop around 0.7 eV meanwhile α-phase FAPbI3 will undergo a subtle increase (<0.1 eV) of the activation energies. Notably, the variations of activation energy of α-phase FAPbI3 are relatively inert to the OH  concentration at low level. On contrary, the activation energy of δ-phase FAPbI3 is very sensitive, which decrease around 1 eV from n = 0.1 to n = 0.33 that is 10 times to the variation of α-phase FAPbI3. Nevertheless, when the OH  concentration reaches a high level (n = 0.5), the activation energy of these two phases will meet a cross, in which the δ-phase FAPbI3 will keep decreasing to 4.143 eV. The α-phase FAPbI3 will suddenly experience an obvious increase from 3.660 eV to 4.293 eV, which becomes larger than that of δ-phase FAPbI3. All the above-mentioned results suggest that the OH  concentration exhibits substantial influence to the formation of two phases of FAPbI3. As the OH  concentration increases, the formation of α-phase will gradually lose its advantage, and finally will be suppressed by the formation of δ-phase FAPbI3 at high OH  concentration. This preliminary result is in consistent with the observation of experiment above, illustrating the importance of control of OH  in the synthesis of different phase of FAPbI3. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""FAPbI3"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
1847,89_5," Results Suppression of I 2 impurity via alkaline additives. Precise control of precursor solutions is crucial for perovskite film deposition. Generally, the organic precursors are hygroscopic and unstable in air or under illumination. In particular, formamidine iodide (FAI) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) can be easily oxidized to form I 2 and/or other by-products, which induces the nonstoichiometric ratio in the precursor solution. It further leads to defect states in perovskite films that eventually deteriorate device performance. The degradation mechanism involves the formation of I 2 , which is thoroughly studied in previous work  30  . Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy was conducted to semiquantitatively investigate the formation of iodide species in the precursor solution  [27] [28] [29] 31  . As shown in Fig.  1a , the organic cation solution used to prepare the perovskite films shows a characteristic peak at 360 nm. It is often attributed to the absorption of I 3 -, stemmed from I -reacting reversibly with I 2 . Interestingly, the peak intensity equals to that of 10 -4 M I 2 in isopropanol, indicating the trace amount of I 2 in the organic cation precursor solution. To eliminate the incident I 2 in the precursor solution, we propose to create an alkaline environment by introducing additives in the precursor solution. A series of alkaline additives with different alkalinity were employed, such as formamidine acetate (FAAc, pK a ~7.64), sodium acetate (CH 3 COONa, pK a ~9.24), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 , pK a ~10.33), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, pK a ~14.56), and potassium hydroxide (KOH, pK a ~14.7), to create the full spectrum of alkalinity precursor environment in the context of the alkalinity (see Supplementary Notes 1 and 2 for details). Take the alkaline solution of FAAc/ ethanol for example, we observed that along with an increasing amount of FAAc, the absorbance at 360 nm for precursor solution was dramatically reduced (Fig.  1a ). Similarly, reduced absorbance at 360 nm was also observed when FAAc was added to the iodine solution (10 -4 M, Supplementary Fig.  1 ). This indicates that the diminishing absorbance at 360 nm in the precursor solution is due to the reduction of incident I 2 . Furthermore, CH 3 COONa, NaHCO 3 , NaOH, and KOH took the same effects as expected when added to the precursor solution (Fig.  1b-e ). Meanwhile, the addition of pure ethanol does not reduce the absorption peak of I 3 -(Supplementary Fig.  2 ). The disappearance of I 3 -(mostly related to I 2 ) in the alkaline environment possibly suggests a disproportionation reaction in the precursor solution, wherein I 2 is converted into iodate and iodide  32  (see Supplementary Note 3). In addition (Fig.  1f ), we found that the alkalinity of additives would largely influence the disproportionation reaction. It requires less amount of NaOH or KOH to eliminate the I 2 peak of precursor solution than that of FAAc, CH 3 COONa, or NaHCO 3 , mostly because the former ones are 'strong' alkaline in the context of conventional inorganic chemistry. Morphology, phase, and carrier lifetime analysis. The typical two-step approach was employed to fabricate the perovskite films (see details in the Methods section). We named the two-step processed reference perovskite film ((FA,MA,Cs)Pb(I,Br) 3 ) as the PVSK film. To ascertain the impact of alkaline additives on the morphology and crystallographic structure of the resultant films, we performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements accordingly. Compared with the PVSK film, the perovskite films with CH 3 COONa or FAAc additive exhibited enlarged grain size (Fig.  2a-c ), while those with NaOH or KOH remain the same grain size (Fig.  2d , Supplementary Fig.  3 ). It possibly indicates the different crystallization kinetics during film growth induced by the alkaline additives. Upon the employment of CH 3 COONa or FAAc, volatile acetate ions are reported to facilitate grain growth for better film quality  33  , which might account for the relatively enlarged grain size. On the contrary, perovskite films with the introduction of NaOH or KOH showed similar grain size, but a distinct crystalline grain morphology, as compared with the reference. It is often ascribed to the fact that Na + or K + is too small to incorporate into the perovskite lattice according to the Goldschmidt tolerance factor  34  . However, we cannot fully rule out the influences for crystal growth in the kinetics perspective, given the different chemical environments introduced by different alkalines, which will be discussed later. Furthermore, XRD results showed a dominating α-phase perovskite in all films (Fig.  2e ), indicating that all these additives do not impact the thermodynamics of crystal growth substantially. However, PbI 2 conversion process was affected by additives, as inferred from the formation of δ-phase perovskite, as well as the residual PbI 2 . We purposely controlled the stoichiometry in all samples with a bit excessive of PbI 2 for efficient passivation  35, 36  (see also Supplementary Note 4). We observed that perovskite films with mild alkaline additives (CH 3 COONa or NaHCO 3 ) only exhibited a relatively stronger PbI 2 peak, while a distinct δ-phase perovskite peak occurred when strong alkaline additives (NaOH or KOH) were added during film fabrication. It suggests that the alkalinity of the additives would affect the formation of the by-products, where the stronger alkaline would promote the formation of the δ-phase and suppress the formation of the α-phase perovskite as well. To confirm our speculation, MA (pK a = 10.62)/ethanol was introduced into the precursor solution (Fig.  2f ). We found a considerable amount of δ-phase perovskite in the resultant perovskite film. As predicted, the formation of the α-phase perovskite was suppressed substantially when the content of MA/ethanol was twice more. Interestingly, compared with the other additives, the weak alkaline FAAc resulted in the desirable phase quality, with significantly improved film crystallinity and less PbI 2 content, as compared with that of the reference and other additives. The intrinsic defects in perovskite films affect the photogenerated carrier behavior and device performance, which also would be affected by the alkalinity of the additives. We therefore conducted time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analysis to study the dynamics of carrier recombination. The perovskite films were deposited on glass by using a precursor solution with different alkaline additives. The TRPL decay curves (Fig.  2g ) were fitted with the bi-exponential rate law (Supplementary Table  1 ). We found that the perovskite films with addition of a weak alkaline possessed a longer carrier lifetime than those with the addition of a strong alkaline. The prolonged lifetime of perovskite films with a weak alkaline additive, compared with that of the PVSK film, was attributed to the suppression of incident I 2 in precursor solution and the desired film features, e.g., morphology and phase. Among all samples with alkaline additives, the perovskite film with FAAc exhibited the longest lifetime for both fast and slow recombination (τ 1 = 132.7 ns and τ 2 = 802.2 ns), indicating its lowest non-radiative recombination centers. To be noted, the introduction of Na + or K + also could possibly deform the perovskite crystal structure, which may lead to shallow defect sites or off-bandgap defects in perovskite films  [37] [38] [39] [40]  (see Supplementary Note 5). Crystallization kinetics control via alkalinity. We further investigate the underlying crystallization kinetics of the formation of the α-phase perovskite by developing an in situ UV-vis absorption measurement. In a typical experiment, the organic cation solution was spin-coated onto the annealed PbI 2 layer, which was further characterized by a UV-vis absorption spectrometer immediately. By varying the alkalinity in precursor solution (Fig.  3a ), we clearly observed that the formation of the αphase perovskite, whose main absorption peak ranged from 450 to 800 nm, was suppressed substantially when the alkalinity gets stronger. To be noted, the absorption before 450 nm might stem from the PbI 2 or the δ-phase perovskite. Moreover, we judiciously selected two typical alkaline additives, e.g., FAAc (weak alkaline) and NaOH (strong alkaline), and continuously tracked the conversion evolution from PbI 2 to the α-phase perovskite. Compared with the reference (Fig.  3b ), the weak alkaline does not affect the formation of the α-phase perovskite, as expected. Accordingly, the absorption peak of the α-phase perovskite in the main range (450-800 nm) is increased continuously as time grows. The inset figure in Fig.  3b  provides a visualization of the improved absorption in the range of 450 and 800 nm, suggesting the continuous formation of the α-phase perovskite. On the contrary (Fig.  3c ), the formation of the α-phase perovskite with a strong alkaline was suppressed substantially. Even over time, only small changes occurred, as visualized in the inset figure of Fig.  3c . Based on the above analysis, we confirmed that the crystallization kinetics of the transformation from PbI 2 to the α-phase perovskite, namely the activation energy, was influenced by the alkalinity of additives. As shown in scheme (Fig.  3d ), when the alkalinity in the precursor gets stronger, the activation energy becomes larger, leading to an increased barrier for the transformation from the PbI 2 to the α-phase perovskite. The results suggest that while incident I 2 could be effectively eliminated via a disproportionation reaction under various alkaline environments, the alkalinity of the additives is also crucial to fabricate highquality perovskite films with a desired phase. Because of the enrichment of the OH -anion when alkalinity gets stronger, we speculate that the oxygen in the OH -anion could participate in the coordination with lead iodide with stronger bonding. This may facilitate the structural transformation from PbI 2 to the δphase perovskite, leading to an increased energy barrier for the transformation of PbI 2 to the α-phase perovskite. To verify the argument, we further performed the DFT simulation to analyze the exact activation energy for the formation of both the α-phase and δ-phase of the FAPbI 3 perovskite in different conditions. The Calculation setup was given in Methods and Supplementary Note 6. As shown in Fig.  3e , two converse trends of the activation energy change are observed upon the introduction of OH -into synthesis. At the low OH -concentration, the δ-phase FAPbI 3 has shown a much higher activation energy of 5.352 eV, which is 1.834 eV higher than that of the α-phase. As the OH -concentration increases, the activation energies of δ-phase FAPbI 3 decline from 5.352 to 4.143 eV. However, the activation energies of α-phase FAPbI 3 increase from 3.518 to 4.293 eV, and finally exceed that of δ-phase FAPbI 3 . It clearly suggests that the formation of the α-phase perovskite is only preferred at a low OH -concentration. With the increase of OH -concentration, δ-phase FAPbI 3 is more preferred kinetically, which is in consistent with the observation of the experiments above. Weak alkaline additives to reduce defect state density. To generalize the above findings, we selected three alkalines with a weak alkalinity, such as FAAc, triethanolamine hydrochloride The results demonstrate that the additives with a weak alkalinity could successfully decrease the trap state density of iodine-based perovskite films via effectively inhibiting incident I 2 in the precursor solution. Combining the influence for alkalinity on the crystallization kinetics of perovskite films, the resultant devices show improved photovoltaic efficiency. To obtain an in-depth understanding of the influence of a weak alkaline on the defect state of the perovskite, we chose the FAAc as an example and named the corresponding two-step processed perovskite film ((FA,MA,Cs)Pb(I,Br) 3 -FAAc) as the PVSK-FA. At first, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of PVSK and PVSK-FA over a temperature from 78 to 350 K were obtained and investigated (Fig.  4a, b ). Within the temperature range of interest, the emission peak of PVSK-FA exhibited a distinct red shift as compared with PVSK, which was consistent with the UV-vis absorption results (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). It indicates a higher ratio of FA + incorporated into the PVSK-FA due to the addition of an additive in the precursor. It was documented that the MAPbI 3 film exhibited a broadening inhomogeneous multi-peak emission feature from a lowtemperature phase, partially attributed to additional charge or exciton trap states only activated in low temperature  41  . However, in Figure  4a , b, we did not observe the above-mentioned multipeak feature at a low temperature in the PVSK and PVSK-FA, indicating the characteristics of less traps. With temperature increasing, we observed a broadening of the emission line due to the electron-phonon coupling near room temperature, which was a consistent recent study in the FAPbI 3 film 42 . Interestingly, the PL spectra of the PVSK-FA exhibited a better symmetry than the PVSK with temperature increasing from 250 to 350 K (Fig.  4c ). On the one hand, the absence of an asymmetric feature in this film may suggest significant reduction of defect states near the band edge. It is believed that reduced grain boundaries may lead to reduced defects  43  , which is consistent with the morphology analysis of larger grains in the corresponding films (Fig.  2a, b ). On the other hand, better symmetry in the PL peak indicates the absence of shoulder peaks often attributed to the slight phase segregation in the mixed perovskites  37  . It is thus implied that PVSK-FA possibly exhibited a retarded phase segregation and decreased defect states, when compared with the PVSK. We further carefully examined the luminescence efficiency of the absorber, which serves as an important measure to identify a high-quality semiconductor  [44] [45] [46]  . Generally, deep-level defects serve as non-radiative recombination centers to capture the photogenerated charge carriers, thereby dramatically cutting down the quantum efficiency of photoluminescence and photovoltaic efficiency in solar cells. To be noted, a good solar cell has to be a good light-emitting diode  44  . According to Shockley-Queisser equation, the V OC of the device decreases when the luminescence quantum efficiency of the absorber decreases. Here, the PL quantum efficiency (PLQE) of the perovskite film was examined as a function of excitation power (Fig.  4d ). The PLQE was relatively small for either PVSK or PVSK-FA at low excitation power, but rapidly went up with the increase of excitation power. It indicates that the radiative recombination prevails at high optical injection levels, wherein non-radiative recombination centers were filled up, which have been further discussed in Supplementary Note 8. Notably, the PLQE of PVSK-FA achieved 61% when the excitation power was 100 mW cm -2 (close to the device working condition), which is more than twice as that of PVSK (PLQE = 25%). It further revealed obvious enhancement of PLQE compared with PVSK To find the defect energy level in the perovskite films, we conducted thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) analysis. It is widely adopted in perovskite solar cells to extract the native defect state-level information through the identification of junction capacitance. Given a p-type perovskite semiconductor, the defect activation energy (E a ) is approximately the depth of defect state energy level relative to the valance band of the perovskite  47, 48  . Here, TAS measurement was carried out from 250 to 350 K with a step of 10 K to obtain the temperature-dependent admittance spectra for PVSK and PVSK-FA-based devices (Fig.  4e, f ). The characteristic transition angular frequency (ω 0 ) was extracted from the derivative of the capacitance-frequency spectrum. The relationship between E a and ω 0 follows the equation: ω 0 = βT 2 exp(-E a /kT), where β is a temperature-dependent parameter, k is the Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. The Arrhenius plot (Fig.  4g ) derived from the temperature-dependent ω 0 and fitted curves revealed that the E a of PVSK and PVSK-FA devices were 0.282 and 0.238 eV, respectively. Moreover, attempted to illustrate the energetic profile regarding the trap density of states (tDOS) in the perovskite absorber (Fig.  4h ). It could be derived from the equation N T (E ω ) = -ωV bi /qkTW × dC/dω and E ω = kT ln(βT 2 /ω), where q is the elementary charge, ω is the angular frequency, V bi is the built-in potential, and W is the depletion region, respectively  49  . The V bi and W were obtained from the Mott-Schottky analysis (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). As expected, the PVSK device exhibited a relatively large density of defect states, especially around the deep defect level at 0.282 eV. Previous DFT calculation study  26  reported that this defect-state level (0.282 eV) could potentially be ascribed to iodine interstitials (I i ), which was the deep-level defect state and dominating non-radiative recombination centers in devices. Interestingly, the PVSK-FA device exhibited a striking reduction of the deep-level defect state at 0.282 eV for two orders of magnitude. In addition, the shallow defect states (0.1-0.2 eV) were also suppressed. Considering the analysis above, we reasonably claim that the introduction of a weak alkaline additive could effectively suppress the incident I 2 in the precursor solution and significantly reduce the I i defect states and achieve a much smaller defect activation energy in the resultant perovskite films. In this case, our iodine suppression approach looks contradictory with the previous research  29  ; however, we argue that the discrepancy in these two approaches of iodine management is mostly due to different physiochemical properties in the corresponding absorber layers. It likely stemmed from the two film growth techniques applied and different material compositions, which is further discussed in Supplementary Note 9. Beside of defects at the deep energy level, tail defects at the band edge were further investigated. Urbach tail profiles of perovskite films were calculated according to the formula equation: α = α 0 exp(hv/E U ), where α 0 is a constant, E U denotes Urbach energy, and α is an absorption coefficient. The absorption coefficient versus energy plots were presented in Supplementary Fig.  6 . As is reported  33, 50  , low E U is highly desirable for semiconductor devices, indicative of less electronic disorders in the crystal lattice (or less impurities). Accordingly, the E U values were estimated to be 31.22 and 29.64 meV for PVSK and PVSK-FA, respectively. Assuming the same level of thermal disorder, the smaller E U value obtained from PVSK-FA demonstrated a lower level of electronic disorder at the band edge. To quantitatively assess the concentration of defects across the entire device, the current density-voltage curves under the dark state for capacitor-like devices with indium tin oxide (ITO)/ perovskite/gold (Au) configuration were measured (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). The linear current density-voltage relation at the low bias suggested an ohmic response, and the transition point was considered as the voltage at which all the traps were filled (trapfilled limit voltage: V TFL ). The concentration of defects was determined by the equation N defects = 2εε 0 V TFL /qL 2 , where q is the elementary charge, ε is the relative dielectric constant, ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, and L is the thickness of the perovskite films obtained from the cross-sectional SEM images of the ITO/ perovskite/Au devices (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). It is reasonable to assume that the slight introduction of an additive would not affect the relative dielectric constants of perovskite films significantly  51  . The defect density N defects was estimated to be 1.38 × 10 16 and 0.47 × 10 16 cm -3 for PVSK and PVSK-FA devices, respectively. It clearly confirms that the defect density in the perovskite absorber has been significantly reduced to nearly an order of magnitude by the addition of a weak alkaline additive. Moreover, we have conducted femtosecond optical measurements  52  and confirmed that PVSK-FA exhibited a lower defect density than the PVSK film, which is the same order of magnitude as the above result (Supplementary Note 10). Weak alkaline additive to improve photovoltaic performance. The significant reduction in intrinsic defect density within the perovskite film was expected to suppress the non-radiative recombination channel effectively and improve the device performance. To prove it, we fabricated the planar heterojunction devices using the structure ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMe-TAD/Au (Supplementary Fig.  9 ) and studied the impacts of weak alkaline additives on photovoltaic performance. Figure  5a  presents the current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the optimized perovskite devices measured under standard AM 1.5 G at ambient condition. The typical PVSK device yielded a PCE of 19.97% with a V OC of 1.102 V, a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 23.83 mA cm -2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 76.05%. Meanwhile, the best PVSK-FA device exhibited a significantly improved performance with a V OC of 1.145 V, a J SC of 24.05 mA cm -2 , a FF of 76.31%, and the corresponding PCE of 21.01%. One of our best devices was sent to the accredited PV calibration laboratory (Newport, USA) and the certified PCE was 20.87% (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). The slightly enhanced J SC value was attributed to improved lightharvesting capacity and a slightly red shift of the absorption onset. The major improvement in device performance was contributed from V OC enhancement, thanks to the high-quality perovskite thin film with significantly reduced intrinsic defect density by the addition of a weak alkaline additive. To be emphasized, in the present study, the addition of FAAc could slightly reduce the bandgap of the resultant film from 1.57 eV to 1.56 eV but increase V OC from 1.102 to 1.147 V in the resulting device. It is interesting that although the bandgap of the perovskite film decreased, the V OC of the relevant solar devices actually improved (Fig.  5b ). It thus reveals one vital feature for this high-efficiency device, which is the small V OC deficit (defined as E g /q -V OC , where E g is the optical bandgap and q is the elemental charge). V OC deficit is an essential indicator to measure the potential of the photovoltaic material and the maturity of the relevant technology. Current V OC deficit for c-silicon, GaAs, and organic solar cells are around 400, 300, and 600 mV, respectively  53  . Surprisingly, the corresponding V OC deficit in our device decreased to 413 mV upon FAAc addition, wherein both the V OC (1.147 V) and the bandgap (1.56 eV) were certified through a third party. The V OC deficit of 413 mV is one of the smallest certified value for planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells to date. It further implies substantially reduced non-radiative recombination losses in the PVSK-FA device, which was consistent with the high PLQE measured previously. In addition, we did not observe an appreciable J-V hysteresis in the corresponding device, and the average PCE of 20.91% was achieved (Fig.  5c  and Supplementary Fig.  10 ). The integrated photocurrent density gave a calculated value of 23.47 mA cm -2 from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum (Supplementary Fig.  11 ), which was comparable with the result from J-V   measurement. In addition, a steady-state current density of 21.89 mA cm -2 and a stabilized PCE of 20.80%, were also achieved by holding the voltage at the maximum power point (0.95 V) for the PVSK-FA device (Fig.  5d ). To probe the reliability and repeatability, 20 individual devices were fabricated with the identical processing condition and the corresponding statistical distribution of the PCE values was presented (Supplementary Fig.  12 ). The average efficiency for the PVSK and PVSK-FA devices were 19.34% and 20.63%, respectively. Furthermore, we have investigated the long-term stability of the PVSK and PVSK-FA-based devices, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  13 . The reference without further encapsulation degraded to be around 80% within 1500 h of storage in an N 2 glove box, whereas the PVSK-FA-based devices exhibited less degradation. It is possibly because of the higher thin-film quality of PVSK-FA with reduced defect states, which inhibits the penetration of undesirable water or oxygen molecules that further decompose perovskite films. Meanwhile, it may also correlate to the elimination of incident I 2 , which has been demonstrated to induce the chemical chain degradation of the perovskite  31  . To gain further insights into the carrier dynamics across the device, we measured transient photocurrent (TPC) and photovoltage (TPV) decays of PVSK and PVSK-FA-based devices on the microsecond scale  54  . The PVSK-FA-based device exhibited a faster decay than that of the PVSK-based device, and the charge transport lifetime (τ t ) derived from TPC measurements (Supplementary Fig.  14 ) was decreased from 4.13 to 1.97 μs, indicating a dramatic improvement of charge transport capability for the PVSK-FA-based device. The TPV curves were correlated to the carrier recombination rates under the open-circuit condition in the full cell. We observed that the PVSK-FA-based device demonstrated a much slower decay, when compared with that of the PVSK-based device (Fig.  5e ). The charge recombination lifetime (τ r ) derived from the TPV curves was significantly prolonged from 12.40 to 19.37 μs, suggesting that the carrier recombination was predominately prohibited in the device. It indicates that the prolonged lifetime constant τ r contributed from substantially reduced defect density in the perovskite material by the addition of weak alkaline additives. Furthermore, we measured the V OC change as a function of illumination intensity to elucidate the carrier recombination mechanism during device operation. For both PVSK and PVSK-FA-based devices, the V OC increased monotonically with incident light intensity (Fig.  5f ). According to the equation V OC = nkT/q ln(I SC /I 0 + 1), the values of the ideality factor were calculated to be 1.51 and 1.02, respectively. Generally, the ideality factor derails from unity if Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination occurs  55  . In our study, the ideality factor for the PVSK-FA-based device showed a significant reduction from 1.51 to 1.02, when compared with that of the PVSK-based device. It demonstrates that trap-assisted SRH recombination was suppressed substantially due to the reduced intrinsic defect density, which was in good agreement with previous results. ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""BA2MA3PbI13"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""FAPbI3"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""20.87"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""BA2MA3PbI13"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""FAPbI3"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""20.87"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.145"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
1858,55_2,"Solar cells based on organic-inorganic halide perovskites have recently shown rapidly rising power conversion efficiencies, but exhibit unusual behaviour such as current-voltage hysteresis and a low-frequency giant dielectric response. Ionic transport has been suggested to be an important factor contributing to these effects; however, the chemical origin of this transport and the mobile species are unclear. Here, the activation energies for ionic migration in methylammonium lead iodide (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ) are derived from first principles, and are compared with kinetic data extracted from the current-voltage response of a perovskitebased solar cell. We identify the microscopic transport mechanisms, and find facile vacancyassisted migration of iodide ions with an activation energy of 0.6 eV, in good agreement with the kinetic measurements.

1859,55_3,"the field-switchable photovoltaic effect to the drift of charged ions or vacancies, although they provided no direct evidence for ion diffusion. In addition to ion migration, ferroelectric and charge-trapping effects have also been suggested as possible mechanisms  13  . Recent analysis of quasielastic neutron scattering data  23  , as well as polarization and piezoresponse force microscopy measurements  38  suggests that ferroelectric behaviour in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism behind the observed hysteresis. Simple capture and release of photogenerated charges in bulk or interfacial defects is also unlikely due to the magnitude and duration of the changes in photocurrent during relaxation following biasing. Previous electronic structure calculations have been used to examine band structures, spin-orbit coupling and intrinsic defects in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 (refs 39-51). The defect studies  45, 46  suggest that Pb 2 þ , I À and CH 3 NH 3 þ (MA þ ) vacancies create shallow donor or acceptor levels. Recent simulation work  41  shows the prevalence of ionic over electronic disorder in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 with low formation energies for Schottky-type defects associated with anion and cation vacancies, shown in the following reaction in the Kro ¨ger-Vink notation for the full Schottky defect, nil !

Macroscopic conductivity or diffusion experiments, however, have so far not enabled the mobile defect species or the atomistic transport mechanism to be identified. Here, we investigate key issues related to intrinsic defect migration in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 using first-principles techniques combined with kinetic experiments monitoring the photocurrent relaxation of devices, extending our previous work on hybrid perovskites  [39] [40] [41]  and ion transport in perovskite-type oxides  33, 52  . We have carried out a detailed examination of the pathways and relative activation energies for the vacancy-mediated migration of I À , Pb 2 þ and CH 3 NH 3 þ ions, and compared these values directly with kinetic data extracted from a working CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 solar cell.

1960,85_2,"Perovskite solar cells typically comprise electron-and hole-transport materials deposited on each side of a perovskite active layer. So far, only two organic hole-transport materials have led to state-of-theart performance in these solar cells 1 : poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) 2-5 and 2,2ʹ,7,7ʹ-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9ʹspirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) 6,7 . However, these materials have several drawbacks in terms of commercialization, including high cost 8 , the need for hygroscopic dopants that trigger degradation of the perovskite layer 9 and limitations in their deposition processes 10 . Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is an alternative hole-transport material with excellent optoelectronic properties 11-13 , low cost 8,14 and ease of fabrication 15-18 , but so far the efficiencies of perovskite solar cells using P3HT have reached only around 16 per cent  19  . Here we propose a device architecture for highly efficient perovskite solar cells that use P3HT as a hole-transport material without any dopants. A thin layer of wide-bandgap halide perovskite is formed on top of the narrow-bandgap light-absorbing layer by an in situ reaction of n-hexyl trimethyl ammonium bromide on the perovskite surface. Our device has a certified power conversion efficiency of 22.7 per cent with hysteresis of ±0.51 per cent; exhibits good stability at 85 per cent relative humidity without encapsulation; and upon encapsulation demonstrates long-term operational stability for 1,370 hours under 1-Sun illumination at room temperature, maintaining 95 per cent of the initial efficiency. We extend our platform to large-area modules (24.97 square centimetres)-which are fabricated using a scalable bar-coating method for the deposition of P3HT-and achieve a power conversion efficiency of 16.0 per cent. Realizing the potential of P3HT as a hole-transport material by using a wide-bandgap halide could be a valuable direction for perovskite solar-cell research. Despite the potential advantages of P3HT as an organic hole-transport material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells (Extended Data Table  1 ), the resulting devices have a low open-circuit voltage (V OC ) due to additional non-radiative recombination at the perovskite/P3HT interface 20 . It has also been suggested that strong electronic coupling between the flat P3HT molecules and the perovskite results in a relatively lower","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Poly(3-hexylthiophene)"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""HTAB"", ""humidity"": ""0.85"", ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1370"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""22.7"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.95""}}"
1961,85_3,"Letter reSeArCH electron lifetime (as compared with spiro-OMeTAD  21  ), and physically poor contact hampers efficient hole transfer from the perovskite to P3HT  22  . To overcome these issues, here we introduce a double-layered halide architecture (DHA) in which an ultrathin wide-bandgap halide (WBH) is stacked onto a narrow-bandgap-halide (NBH) light-absorbing layer, prior to deposition of the HTM (Fig.  1a ). The aim of inserting the WBH layer is to effectively reduce recombination at the perovskite/ P3HT interface. This DHA concept is analogous to that of a heterojunction with an intrinsic thin-layer structure, which is a successful strategy for high-performance silicon-based solar cells  23  . The WBH layer is formed simply by the in situ reaction of n-hexyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (HTAB) on the perovskite surface. The HTAB molecule comprises a functionalized moiety (N + (CH 3 ) 3 -) and an aliphatic moiety (C 6 H 13 -), the latter of which could enable favourable van der Waals interactions between the organic HTM and the perovskite. In particular, when P3HT is deposited onto the surface of the DHA, interdigitation of its alkyl chains and the analogous alkyl chains of HTAB (C 6 H 13 -) should promote the self-assembly of P3HT. Moreover, it has previously been reported that the N + (CH 3 ) 3 -moiety renders a perovskite surface more resistant to degradation under humid conditions  24  . Figure  1b , c shows 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns of the control perovskite (NBH) and DHA (WBH/NBH). Compared to the control, a distinct signal at a q z of 0.39 Å -1 along the perpendicular direction to the substrate was detected for the DHA. Another intense signal was observed at a q xy of 0.67 Å -1 along the direction parallel to the substrate, which could be associated with lateral ordering in the WBH layer of the DHA (Extended Data Fig.  1 ). The distinct crystalline phase forms only at a composition of HTAB 0.3 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 (where FAPbI 3 is formamidinium lead iodide and MAPbBr 3 is methylammonium lead bromide; Extended Data Fig.  2a ). Figure  1d , e shows scanning electron microscopy images of the surface of the control and the DHA samples. In the DHA sample, the surface of the perovskite is fully covered with the WBH layer, which is thin enough to discern the grain boundaries underneath it. The concentration of the HTAB solution is a critical factor in the fabrication of the WBH layer (Extended Data Fig.  3 ). In order to distinguish the two different halide layers, a cross-section of the DHA was observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (Fig.  1f, g ). As compared to a cross-sectional HRTEM image of the control, a thin WBH layer with a thickness of around 12 nm could be clearly discerned. The results obtained from high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning TEM and energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy show that the WBH layer contains a lower content of lead atoms as compared with the underlying NBH layer; this is a result of the lower proportion of lead in the WBH due to the incorporation of HTAB molecules (Extended Data Fig.  4 ). The energy levels of each layer in the DHA device were determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy (Extended Data Figs.  2b, 5 ). The enhanced V OC of HTMfree DHA-based perovskite solar cells and the longer charge lifetime in the DHA device demonstrate that the WBH layer effectively passivates charge traps on the perovskite surface (Extended Data Fig.  6 ). We next investigated the effect of the aliphatic moiety of HTAB in the WBH on the deposition of P3HT. We observed the morphology of the P3HT layer on top of a pristine perovskite (NBH) and in the DHA (WBH/NBH) using atomic force microscopy (Fig.  2a, b ). In the control sample, the P3HT layer showed a smooth morphology along the perovskite grains. In the DHA sample, a fibril structure of selfassembled P3HT was observed. The charge-transporting properties of the P3HT polymer are known to be highly dependent on the morphology  12, 13  ; amorphous P3HT has a low charge mobility  13  of the order of 10 -5 cm 2 V -1 s -1 , whereas self-assembled P3HT nanofibrils with strong π-π interactions lead to a considerably higher mobility of 0.1 cm 2 V -1 s -1 without any dopants  12  . The different morphologies of the P3HT layer on the control and the DHA surface were also confirmed by other analytical methods. Raman spectra of both the control and the DHA samples covered with P3HT show a symmetric C=C stretch (around 1,446 cm -1 ) and a  ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Poly(3-hexylthiophene)"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""HTAB"", ""humidity"": ""0.85"", ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1370"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""22.7"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.95""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""HTAB 0.3 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Poly(3-hexylthiophene)"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""HTAB"", ""humidity"": ""0.85"", ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1370"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""22.7"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.95""}}"
1979,77_5," Publication of your CIF in other journals Please refer to the Notes for Authors of the relevant journal for any special instructions relating to CIF submission. Phenethylammonium (PEA + ) and butylammonium (BA + ) are widely used in three-dimensional (3D) perovskites to form two-dimensional perovskites at film surfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) for defect passivation and performance enhancement. Here we show that these cations are unstable with 3D formamidinium (FA + )-containing perovskites under high-temperature light soaking. PEA + and BA + are found to deprotonate to amines, which then react with FA + to produce (phenethylamino) methaniminium (PEAMA + ) and (butylamino)methaniminium (BAMA + ), respectively, severely limiting device high-temperature photostability. Removing these cations greatly improves the photostability but compromises device efficiency by leaving non-fully passivated surfaces and GBs. Ammonium cations with a high acid dissociation constant (pK a ), including PEAMA + (pK a = 12.0) and BAMA + (pK a = 12.0), can replace PEA + or BA + for passivation and are stable with FA-based perovskites due to their resistance to further deprotonation. P-i-n structure solar cells with PEAMA + additive maintained over 90% of their initial efficiency after light soaking at open circuit and 90 °C for 1,500 hours. Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites have many interesting physical properties due to confinement effects that three-dimensional (3D) perovskites do not have, including exciton dynamics, spin dynamics and electron-phonon coupling  [1] [2] [3]  . Generally, 2D perovskites are considered to be much more stable than their 3D counterparts due to better moisture resistance of the hydrophobic organic cation  4, 5  , larger energy barrier to ion migration  6, 7  and increased tolerance to structural stress  8, 9  . As a result, they have been widely applied in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to improve device efficiency and stability in various ways  4, [10] [11] [12]  . To overcome their poor carrier transport along the out-of-plane direction, a thin layer of 2D perovskite can be stacked on top of 3D perovskites via sequential deposition, which not only protects but also passivates the 3D perovskite surface  10, 13  . They can also be incorporated into the grain boundaries (GBs) of 3D perovskites by adding the large organic cations into the precursor solution  14  . The much larger size of these organic cations causes them to be excluded form the 3D lattice to GBs which, in return, stablizes the GBs  5, 15  . Additionally, high layer number (n) phase-pure quasi-2D perovskites have been developed to retain both the advantages of 3D perovskites-such as good charge transport and carrier lifetimes-and 2D perovskites, such as good stability, but neither their efficiency nor stability have reached the parity of other multi-dimensional perovskites  16, 17  . ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""90"", ""time"": ""1500"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.9""}}"
1983,77_11," Passivation additives with high pK a Although completely removing PEA + ions from the precursor solution improves the high-temperature photostability of the devices, it also reduces the device efficiency because of the exposed unpassivated film surfaces and GBs. A passivator is still needed to enhance the device efficiency. The passivator needs to meet three criteria: (1) it should have a suitable terminal size to fit into A-site vacancy at the perovskite surfaces and GBs; (2) it should have a high pK a to resist deprotonation; (3) it should not react with FA + itself. Fortunately, we found that the reaction product of PEA 0 and FA + , that is, PEAMA + , perfectly meets these criteria. It terminates with an amidinium group with the same size as FA + , it keeps delocalized electron structure of FA + , making it difficult to deprotonate, and its lack of deprotonation prevents further reactions with FA + . We calculated the pK a of PEAMA + to be 12.0, which is higher than the PEA + benchmark. To better understand this cation, we synthesized PEAMAI by the reaction of PEA 0 with FAI, generating white powders. The single crystals of this salt can be formed by the recrystallization process, with a photograph of the crystal shown in Fig.  3d . The crystal structure obtained from single-crystal XRD confirmed the crystal is PEAMAI co-crystallized with two FAI (Supplementary Table  1 ). The bond lengths of C1-N1 and C1-N2 in PEAMAI are 1.30 Å, which is same as in FAI, indicating the resonance stabilization as we expected (Supplementary Table  2 ). The 1 H,  13  C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in Supplementary Figs.  8  and 9  confirmed the chemical structure of the obtained salt. The BAMAI was synthesized by the reaction of BA 0 and FAI confirmed by the 1 H,  13  C NMR in Supplementary Figs.  10  and 11 . The BAMA + showed a similar pK a value of 12.0 with PEAMA + . In addition, the synthesized co-crystal was mixed with PbI 2 in dimethylformamide (DMF) to fabricate films by spin coating. The XRD pattern in Supplementary Fig.  12  verified that PEAMAI-FAI reacted with PbI 2 to form a low-dimensional perovskite phase with XRD peaks at 7.1° and 14.2°, and BAMAI-FAI reacted with PbI 2 to form a low-dimensional perovskite phase with XRD peaks at 7.9° and 15.7°. To evaluate if PEAMAI is capable of passivating FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 , we used PEAMAI as a surface treatment for FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . Different from using PEAMAI as additive, using PEAMAI as a surface treatment avoids a perovskite morphology change as shown by the SEM included in Supplementary Fig.  13 . The optimized surface treatment using PEAMAI resulted in a 57% increase of steady-state photoluminescence (PL) intensity, accompanied by a small blue shift of the PL peak (Fig.  4a ).

1985,77_13," Device efficiency and high-temperature photostability The impact of PEAMA + on the performance of FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 PSCs was investigated. Figure  5a  shows typical current density (J)-voltage (V) curves of PSCs with and without PEAMA + under both forward and reverse scans. The control PSCs had a PCE of 21.2% with a J SC of 24.7 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.07 V and a fill factor (FF) of 80.2%. PEAMA + -PSCs had a PCE of 24.1% with a J SC of 25.8 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.14 V, and a FF of 82.1%. The statistical distributions of the V OC , J SC , FF and PCE are shown in Fig.  5b .

2033,37_3," Reviewer Comments & Author Rebuttals Reviewer Reports on the Initial Version: Referees' comments: Referee #1 (Remarks to the Author): The reduction of open circuit voltage (Voc) deficit in perovskite solar cells is a common issue for the community, especially for wide-bandgap bromine-rich perovskite solar cells. In this work, Chen et al. report a diammonium molecule, 1,3-propylene diammonium (PDA), to regulate surface potential and improve open-circuit voltage of wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells. The authors demonstrate that the PDA molecule has a much better ability for surface passivation/treatment, compared to the common monoammonium molecules. Consequently, tandem solar cells using the PDA-treated widebandgap perovskite solar cells deliver a very impressive NREL-certified efficiency with a very high Voc. Overall, the results are well discussed and solid. This work presents a highly important advance for the perovskite photovoltaic field. Therefore, I would recommend publishing this work after some revisions. Comments to the authors: 1) In Line 133, the authors claim no indication of reduced-dimensional perovskite formation nor of a perovskite polymorph. While I was wondering if the PDA cation can enter the perovskite lattices. The same or similar cation was reported to extend the unit cell and form a 3D ""hollow"" perovskite structure (","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""1,3-propylene diammonium"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"

While the authors should also comment on that why use this PDA molecule not other diammonium molecules with longer or shorter chains. Response: We now compare the effects of perovskite post-treatments with similar concentrations of 1,2-ethane-diammonium iodide (EDA) and 1,4-butane-diammonium iodide (BDA), diammonium ligands with a shorter and longer chain length, respectively. We now report the PLQY of the treated films on ITO/HTL substrates with and without a C60 layer deposited onto the perovskite. Of these diammonium ligands, only PDA resulted in the retention of PLQY after the deposition of C60 (Figure  R3 ).

However, the large-area solar cells are also recommended to be included. Response: We have added the J-V curve and stabilized power output (SPO) data for a largerarea 1 cm 2 device (Figure  R1  above). The device delivered a PCE of 26.0% (25.1% SPO).

Response: We now provide MPP tracking under 1-sun illumination of the single-junction widebandgap cells in the revised supplementary materials (Figure  R4 , Supplementary Fig.  S21 ). The following discussion was added to the revised manuscript: ""We followed the output of a PDA-treated WBG cell operating for 700 hrs at the maximum power point (MPP) to determine the impact of PDA on device stability (Supplementary Fig.  S21 ).

Response: We thank the reviewer for this advice and have replaced BTA with BA in the revised manuscript. 6) In Line 92, the authors claim that BA and PDA make the surface more p-type and n-type, respectively. This description is inaccurate because both of the films are still p-type. One should be a stronger p-type and the other one should be a weaker p-type. Response: We have updated our description in the revised manuscript as follows: ""To understand how both treatments affect interface energetics we used ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and found that BA induces a Fermi level downshift, whereas PDA induces a Fermi level upshift, resulting in stronger and weaker surface p-type doping, respectively.""

The order is reversed. Please correct it. Response: We have corrected this error (Supplementary Fig.  S5 ). 9) J-V etc. should be italic. Response: We italicized J-V, VOC, and JSC in the revised manuscript. 10) Figures in Supplementary materials should be discussed sequentially.

2112,97_22," PV performance of AAL-treated perovskites The improved carrier transport in AAL-treated films motivated us to investigate whether this enhancement in basic properties 17  16   Cut-off region Binding energy (eV) Figure  2b  shows the typical J-V characteristics of CsFAMA devices with AALs of different alkyl-chain lengths. The pristine devices show a typical PCE of 20.5% with a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 24.2 mA cm -2 , an open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.06 V and a fill factor (FF) of 80%. The performance of the CsFAMA devices with short-alkyl-chain AALs (BA or PEA) slightly improved to 20.8% (BA) and 20.9% (PEA), benefiting from ~30 mV V OC enhancement. The PEA-concentrationdependent J-V characteristics of CsFAMA devices with PEA are shown in Supplementary Fig.  7 . The champion device with PEA shows a V OC and PCE of 1.15 V and 21.3%, respectively. By contrast, the devices with long-alkyl-chain AALs (OA or OAm) show a remarkably enhanced PCE, resulting from a strong V OC improvement up to 110 mV. The devices with OAm show an average PCE around 22.0% with a J SC of 24.1 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.17 V and an FF of 78.2%. The champion devices with OAm deliver a PCE of 23% with a J SC of 24.1 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.17 V and an FF of 81.6%, as shown in Fig.  2c . The statistical PCE values from 100 devices (50 pristine devices and 50 devices with AALs; Fig.  2e ) demonstrate the reproducibility of the performance enhancement associated with the use of AALs. The PCEs of the devices with OA are similar to those of the devices containing OAm, confirming the advantage of using long-alkyl-chain AALs over AALs with short chains. This is also in accordance with the trend of film quality as deduced from TRPL. E B, max E F E B, The voltage deficit is defined by (E g /q) -V OC , where E g is the optical bandgap. Since the optical bandgap is 1.56 eV, the voltage deficit is only 0.39 V for devices based on long-alkyl-chain AALs. When fine-tuning the concentration of long-alkyl-chain AALs from 0.05 wt% to 0.2 wt%, we did not observe an appreciable variation in device performance (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). Further increasing the AAL concentration to 0.4 wt% leads to a severe PCE drop. Unencapsulated CsFAMA devices with AALs were certified at an accredited laboratory (Newport Photovoltaic Testing and Calibration Laboratory). The PCE certification protocol uses a quasi-steady-state (QSS) I-V sweep, instead of the normally used forward and reverse I-V scans, to ascertain a device's PV characteristics. Ten voltage points were collected in the QSS measurement, with each bias voltage applied and held until the measured current stabilized (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). The devices show a certified stabilized PCE of 22.34% with a J SC of 23.9 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.14 V and an FF of 82%, representing a record PCE for p-i-n-structured devices. The certified QSS I-V curve and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Supplementary Fig.  10 . To identify the major factors responsible for the efficiency enhancement, we started by comparing the morphology (by top-view and cross-sectional SEM images) of the pristine perovskite films and the films with AALs (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). Both the pristine perovskite films and the films with AALs are compact with similar grain sizes. The full width at half maximum values of the (100) XRD peaks of pristine films and of films with AALs are 0.09° and 0.10°, respectively; that is, they are nearly identical. We can therefore rule out a major influence of perovskite grain size and crystallinity in this study. To investigate the influence of surface passivation while avoiding effects related to perovskite film orientation, we subjected readyformed pristine perovskite films to a post-treatment using AALs with alkyl chains of various lengths (BA, PEA and OAm). XRD patterns (Supplementary Fig.  12a ) show that the films post-treated with AALs of different lengths had similar orientations to the pristine films. We then fabricated the devices based on these films with similar orientations. The devices with post-treatment surface passivation enabled by AALs show higher PCE values than the pristine devices, and the long-chain AALs show better passivation, something we assign to stronger hole blocking at the interfaces between perovskite and C 60 (Supplementary Fig.  12b )  31  . The V OC and PCE of the devices with long-chain AALs increased to 1.12 V and 21.1%, respectively, posttreatment. However, in contrast with the devices fabricated by adding AALs into the precursor (V OC of 1.17 V and PCE of >22%), the V OC and PCE of devices with AAL surface passivation are still lower, indicating that surface passivation alone does not fully explain the performance improvement, and that tuning the orientation of the perovskite films plays a crucial role. We conclude that the combined effect of both surface passivation and orientation tuning leads to the dramatically improved V OC and PCE for the devices with AALs (mixed in the precursor). This result is rationalized by the facet dependence of the surface-defect density, and it highlights the crucial role of controlling the film orientation. To further test the carrier lifetime in fully operating devices, transient photo-voltage decay measurements were conducted. As seen in Fig.  2d , the carrier lifetime (τ) increased from 0.67 μs to 1.5 μs after introducing AALs. Light-intensity-dependent V OC was measured and the diode ideal factor (n) was derived, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 16. When purely radiative recombination is present, n equals 1. The devices with AALs show n closer to 1 compared with the pristine devices, arising from the suppressed nonradiative recombination achieved by AALs. AALs have the potential to suppress trap density directly by filling in A-site vacancies and modifying grains and interfaces. Additionally, they have the potential to provide a similar benefit by promoting the (100) orientation of grains in perovskite films  46  , which may have a different susceptibility to surface-defect formation than other random orientations in the pristine perovskite films  47, 48  . To further investigate this possibility, we studied the dependence of trap density on the surface crystallographic facets using density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on a cubic FAPbI 3 model  49, 50  . The corresponding slabs exposing the (100), (110), (111), (  210 ) and (211) surfaces were considered. From the projected density of states (PDOS) of all the slabs, as shown in Fig.  4  and Supplementary Figs.  17  and 18 , we find that the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) are mainly composed of I-5p, Pb-6s and Pb-6p orbitals. According to these modelling results, some surfaces are less benign than others; the (110) (Fig.  4c ), (111) (Fig.  4d ) and (211) (Fig.  4e, f ) surfaces show trap states that are more likely to adversely affect device performance. However, there are no trap states that appear for the (100) surface in either FAI-rich or PbI 2 -rich termination cases (Fig.  4a, b ). Thus, it can be concluded that the (110), (  111 ) and (211) surfaces would introduce additional trap states, while in the case of the (100) surface, the delocalized electronic distributions of the VBM and the CBM are retained in a similar configuration to that of bulk FAPbI 3 . The electronic structure of films with AALs was investigated by work function (WF) and VBM measurements using UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS; Fig.  3c ). The WF was determined from the secondary electron cut-off, and we observed a change in WF from 4.58 to 4.41 eV after AAL modification. The VBMs were located at 1.1 and 1.3 eV below the Fermi level (E F ) for pristine films and AAL-modified films, respectively. The energy-level diagrams for the films based on the UPS and optical absorption measurement are shown in Fig.  3d . The VBM and CBM of AALmodified films are nearly identical to those of pristine films; however, the WF shifts by about 170 meV towards the vacuum level (E VAC ), and the E F shifts by 200 meV towards the CBM, indicating that the AAL-modified films become more n-type, which is likely attributable to the change of the surface termination after AAL modification  51  . Perovskite films that are more n-type have a larger number of filled electron traps, which are the predominant trap species  13, 52  , and this can lead to a further decrease in trap-assisted recombination events  13  . Moreover, perovskite films that are more n-type enable more efficient charge transfer between the perovskite and the electron transport material (C 60 )  51, 53  . We summarized the likely mechanisms behind the device efficiency enhancement in Fig.  5 . The long-chain AALs assemble on the perovskite grains, restricting the grains' tilt during growth and eventually resulting in a (100)-orientation-dominant film that is of lower defect density than a randomly oriented film (Fig.  5a, b ). As the growth proceeds, the long-chain AALs are finally expelled to the perovskite film surface, as indicated by water-contact-angle measurements. The ligand layer on the perovskite film's surface provides effective surface passivation because a long-chain AAL layer enables strong hole blocking between the perovskite and C 60 interfaces (Fig.  5c, d )  31  . ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""22.3"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""1""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""oleylamine"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": ""20.5"", ""treated_pce"": ""22"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""1""}}"

The patterned ITO/glass substrates were sequentially cleaned with soap, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol under ultrasonication. The ITO/glass substrates were then dried with N 2 blowing and treated with UV ozone for 15 min. The perovskite films were fabricated by the anti-solvent crystallization approach in a N 2 glove box. In a typical procedure, a hole transport layer of ∼10 nm thickness made of PTAA with a concentration of 2 mg ml -1 dissolved in toluene was spin coated at a speed of 6,000 r.p.m for 35 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. The perovskite precursor solution (1.4 M) composed of mixed cations (Pb, Cs, FA and MA) and halides (I and Br) was dissolved in mixed solvent (DMF/DMSO = 4/1) according to a formula of Cs 0.05 (FA 0.92 MA 0.08 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.92 Br 0.08 ) 3 . A trace amount (0.1 wt%) of alkylammonium ligands (BA, PEA, OA and OAm) was added into the precursor solution. A two-step spin-coating procedure with 2,000 r.p.m. for 10 s and 4,000 r.p.m. for 50 s was adopted for the preparation of perovskite films. Chlorobenzene (150 µl) was dropped on the spinning substrate during the 45 s of the second spin-coating step. Subsequently, the sample was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. The devices with an area of 10 mm 2 were finished by thermally evaporating C 60 (20 nm), BCP (3 nm) and Cu (80 nm) in sequential order by using a thin-film deposition system from Angstrom Engineering under high vacuum.

2123,115_2,"Solution processing of semiconductors is highly promising for the high-throughput production of costeffective electronics and optoelectronics. Although hybrid perovskites have potential in various device applications, challenges remain in the development of high-quality materials with simultaneously improved processing reproducibility and scalability. Here, we report a liquid medium annealing (LMA) technology that creates a robust chemical environment and constant heating field to modulate crystal growth over the entire film. Our method produces films with high crystallinity, fewer defects, desired stoichiometry, and overall film homogeneity. The resulting perovskite solar cells (PSCs) yield a stabilized power output of 24.04% (certified 23.7%, 0.08 cm 2 ) and maintain 95% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 2000 hours of operation. In addition, the 1-cm 2 PSCs exhibit a stabilized power output of 23.15% (certified PCE 22.3%) and keep 90% of their initial PCE after 1120 hours of operation, which illustrates their feasibility for scalable fabrication.

2124,115_3," S olution processing of semiconductors is a promising approach for the fabrication of cost-effective electronics and optoelectronics  (1, 2) . Recently, metal halide perovskites based on a solution process have been shown to have electronic and optoelectronic properties applicable in various device applications, particularly photovoltaics (PV)  (3) (4) (5) (6) . These perovskites have reached a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.5% within just one decade of research  (7)  and are therefore regarded as promising candidates for next-generation PV. Reviewing the development of this family of materials, early investigations of device physics revealed that the perovskite crystal quality (e.g., crystallinity, morphology, stoichiometry, etc.) profoundly influenced cell and module efficiencies  (8, 9) . The operational lifetime of high-efficiency cells has been prolonged to several thousand hours during accelerated aging tests, gradually approaching the requirements for practical use  (10) . In the context of device aging courses, the crystal quality again has become a research focus with an emphasis on its time evolution  (11) , which is governed by thermodynamic and kinetic factors, including components, chemical potential, structure, phase transition and segregation, ion migration, and defect concentrations  (10) . To promote the commercialization of perovskite PV, it is important to develop a scalable solution process with sufficient reproducibility. Research should expand the investigation of crystal quality in the spatial perspective  (12) , aiming at precise control of perovskite crystallization kinetics over the entire film at any atmosphere. However, there will be substantial difficulties in achieving this. First, perovskite formation includes a reaction between Lewis acids and bases that occurs quickly and spontaneously even at low temperature  (13) . Second, halide perovskites for practical use are often mixtures  (14)  in which the different components exhibit different reactivity and diffusivity during film growth. In addition, the precursor reactants are sensitive to moisture and common solvents  (15, 16) , which leads to considerable variance with each slight change in processing conditions. High-quality crystalline perovskite films generally have a large grain size, which is achieved by retarding nucleation and promoting crystal growth according to the LaMer model  (17) . Several strategies have been successfully applied to decrease the nucleation rate  (18, 19) , which effectively influences crystallization kinetics. In addition, higher annealing temperature and/or prolonged annealing time are reported to increase the crystallinity of perovskites by increasing crystal growth rate or inducing a recrystallization process  (20, 21) . However, coincident defects caused by unfavorable volatile component loss are often found, accompanied by substantial inhomogeneity in the film over a larger area  (22, 23) . Moreover, local fluctuations in processing atmosphere leads to films with varied quality  (15, 16)  and thus poor reproducibility. Therefore, it is challenging to develop a simple, controllable, and effective annealing technology that meets the requirements for scalable and reproducible fabrication. Here, we demonstrate liquid medium annealing (LMA) as a method of effectively modulating the crystal growth of halide perovskite materials. Rather than merely raising the annealing temperature, LMA adopts omnidirectional heating, particularly an extra ""top-down"" heat transfer on the film to accelerate crystal growth with a higher heating rate. In addition, the liquid medium extracts residual solvents from precursor films to mitigate their disturbance for crystal growth. Moreover, the liquid medium creates a microenvironment for crystal growth to prevent volatile component loss from the desired stoichiometry over the entire film. Consequently, LMA leads to excellent film homogeneity, which is also less dependent on the processing atmosphere and applicable for all-weather in-house fabrication. Small-area devices (0.08 cm 2 ) using LMA exhibited a stabilized power output of 24.04% (certified 23.7%) and maintained 95% of their initial PCE after 2000 hours of stabilized power output (SPO) tracking. The corresponding large-area solar cells (1 cm 2 ) achieved a stabilized power output of 23.15% (certified PCE of 22.3%) and kept 90% of their original PCE after 1120 hours of SPO tracking. To our knowledge, this is the smallest efficiency gap between smalland large-area devices ever reported. Our findings provide a reproducible technology with which to fabricate high-quality and homogeneous perovskite films for the production of efficient and stable large-area solar cells or other perovskite-based optoelectronics. Fine control on the annealing process, especially in the early stage, is crucial to modulating the crystallization dynamics and quality of perovskite films. In contrast to most annealing technologies, which are generally performed under certain atmosphere, we used LMA to fabricate perovskite films in which the asdeposited film is annealed in the preheated liquid (Fig.  1A ). The liquid medium in use (anisole in this work) needs to exhibit a high thermal conductivity and low viscosity with the appropriate organic solvent extraction ability but negligible reactivity with perovskites. Different from the traditional annealing (Ref) method, LMA (Fig.  1B ) uses the liquid to transfer heat and create a reaction microenvironment that produces substantially different crystallization dynamics of perovskite films mainly by affecting the heating mode and solvated intermediates. In traditional annealing, heating is ""bottomup,"" meaning that heat transfers from hotplate to glass substrate to perovskite films (Fig.  1D ). This results in delayed heating at the film surface, where the directional crystallization has already begun  (24) . This heating transfer is in the opposite direction from crystallization, which may impede the crystal growth because of the limited diffusion of the reactants. LMA provides omnidirectional heating, in particular an extra ""top-down"" heat transfer, which allows fast heating of the film surface once it is in contact with the hot liquid (Fig.  1C ). This top-down heating mode is in line with the crystal growth direction of perovskite polycrystalline films. To illustrate the heating mode, we performed finite element analysis to simulate the thermal field and the annealing time in two processes (Fig.  2, A  and B ). Keeping the heat source at 150°C, the Ref film required ~13 s to reach 140°C at equilibrium upon bottom-up annealing (Fig.  2A ). The retarded heating rate was attributed to the heat transfer delay of glass and the considerable thermal convection between perovskite and air. By contrast, the perovskite film by LMA took only ~4 s to reach 141°C (Fig.  2B ) because the top-down heating mode allowed immediate heating of the entire perovskite film in a hot liquid. In addition, the liquid medium could form a relatively stable thermal field on perovskite films by avoiding unfavorable thermal convection with air. We investigated the temperature evolution in perovskite films and found that LMA exhibited a much faster heating rate of 32.7°C/s compared with that of Ref at 8.7°C/s (Fig.  2C ). Also, the temperature variation along the vertical direction of perovskite film was negligible for annealing (Fig.  2C , inset) because of the extremely thin thickness of the film compared with the substrate. Overall, the higher heating rate in the initial stage could potentially accelerate the diffusion of reactants (such as organic cations, Pb-I octahedra, etc.) and thus promote the grain growth rate, which will be discussed later. Anisole is an ideal liquid medium for perovskite fabrication because of its high thermal conductivity (0.137 W/m K) and relatively low viscosity (0.99 mPa/s at 20°C). In addition, it has a poor solubility in water but is miscible with most organic solvents (fig.  S2  and sup plementary text S1). Thus, the residual solvent [e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] in precursor films can be easily extracted, which potentially provides sufficient reactants to participate in crystal growth. To confirm this, we prepared PbI 2 (DMSO) and MA 2 Pb 3 I 8 •2DMSO intermediate powders (where MA is methylammonium), the major components in precursor films  (24) , to assess the solvent extraction ability of anisole. The relative intensity ratio of PbI 2 /PbI 2 (DMSO) signals from x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement is summarized in fig.  S3 . After immersing PbI 2 (DMSO) powder in anisole for 20 min at 20°C, the PbI 2 /PbI 2 (DMSO) intensity ratio doubled compared with that in air (Fig.  2D ). When conducting LMA at 150°C for 10 s, no appreciable PbI 2 (DMSO) residue was observed. By contrast, the sample annealed in air retained a considerable amount of PbI 2 (DMSO) after heating at 150°C for 10 s. Similar results were observed when annealing MA 2 Pb 3 I 8 •2DMSO at either 20°C or 150°C (Fig.  2E  and fig.  S4 ): LMA resulted in a quicker conversion to MAPbI 3 . LMA thus improves solvent extraction from solvated intermediate, especially at high temperatures. To quantify the perovskite film growth rate by LMA, we monitored triple-cation perovskite film growth of FA 1-x-y MA x Cs y PbI 3-z Br z (where FA is formamidinium) in two-step deposition by ex situ ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The absorbance at 780 nm was used as an indicator for perovskite formation. The LMA sample exhibited an overall higher absorbance than Ref at the same time in the range of 40 to 100°C (fig.  S5 ). The change of absorbance was plotted as a function of time to obtain the growth rate (k) at each temperature (fig.  S5  and supple mentary text S2). LMA led to a significantly larger k than that of Ref (Fig.  2F ), and the rate difference (Dk) increased with temperature (from 5.49 × 10 -4 s -1 at 40°C to 1.28 × 10 -2 s -1 at 100°C; Fig.  2F, inset ). LMA resulted in a substantially different film morphology and quality. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that LMAprepared perovskite film had a larger grain size of 2.25 ± 0.66 mm (Fig.  2H   (Fig.  2G  and fig.  S6A ). This could be attributed to the accelerated crystal growth rate, which is positively correlated with grain size  (25)  High-quality perovskite films produced by LMA are likely related to the modulated crystal growth dynamics in the following aspects. First, increased grain size is often achieved at high temperature annealing  (20) , when the grain growth is overwhelmed by promoting the diffusion of reactant. Because of its high heating rate in LMA, precursor films experienced much shorter periods of low temperature (Fig.  2C ), which results in en-larged crystal size. Second, during traditional annealing, the wet precursor film preferentially crystallizes from the surface because of solvent evaporation driven by surface tension near the air-liquid interface  (24, 26) . As a result, residual solvents entrapped underneath the solidified surface are likely to interrupt the construction of perovskite structure  (26) . Moreover, reactive components are prone to react at the air-liquid interface, which changes the stoichiometry of the crystal. During LMA, however, the air-liquid interface is replaced by liquid-liquid contacts, and thus residual solvents are quickly extracted by liquid medium across the entire film thickness. This not only mitigates the disturbance of crystal growth from residual solvents but also prevents undesired side reactions during ambient processing, which leads to polycrystalline films with fewer defects and desired stoichiometry (discussed below). Last, LMA creates a spatially uniform chemical environment by efficient extraction of residual solvents and isolation from ambient conditions and a temporally uniform heat field by fast ""top-down"" annealing. It further ensures superior uniformity of the resultant films. Grain boundaries (GBs) in a polycrystalline film usually exhibit different optoelectronic properties from the grain bulk  (27) . LMA results in larger grains in the as-prepared film, which reduces the GBs and improves the absorber uniformity with respect to their optoelectronic characteristics. As evidenced by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy measurement, LMA-treated perovskite films exhibited smaller distribution, with a surface potential difference of ~25 mV (10 × 10 mm 2 area), whereas that of Ref was >40 mV (Fig.  3,  A  and B   and supplementary text S3), and the fluorescence lifetime mapping was collected in the 10 × 10 mm 2 region of the perovskite films. In traditional annealing, the volatile and chemically reactive components such as MA + /FA + and I -can easily evaporate or react with ambient molecules (e.g., H 2 O, O 2 , etc.)  (28) , which causes local element loss and non-stoichiometry at the film surface  (22) . The liquid medium creates a robust microenvironment in which to inhibit volatile component evaporation from desired stoichiometry during annealing (Fig.  1E  and fig.  S9 ). To demonstrate this, methylammonium distribution [the infrared frequency of 1480 cm -1 represents the C-N stretching (n C-N ) absorption of the MA + ion] was probed by peak force infrared (PFIR) mi-croscopy (Fig.  3, E  and F ). The results showed that LMA-prepared perovskites exhibited an overall slightly increased IR response compared with the Ref sample, along with the more concentrative signal distribution without local low-signal regions (blue regions in Fig.  3E ). Stronger IR signal represents better preservation of organic components in the film  (29) , which indicates that LMA could protect this volatile component from escaping to produce more uniform component distribution. We also performed x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to examine I - 3d and Pb 2+ 4f signals from corresponding perovskite films. The LMA sample exhibited the same binding energy with respect to I - 3d and Pb 2+ 4f peaks as that of Ref (fig.  S10A ). However, the I/Pb ratio in the LMA perovskite was 2.92, whereas that in Ref was only 2.74 (fig.  S10B ). This means that the I -ions are largely preserved during LMA, resulting in a more stoichiometric structure to alleviate the formation of vacancy defects. We also probed XPS mapping in an area of 50 × 50 mm 2 and found that the binding energy variation of perovskite I -and Pb 2+ ions was reduced by LMA (fig.  S11  and supplementary text S3). Therefore, LMA has great potential to produce spatially uniform perovskite films, which is beneficial for the scalable fabrication of larger-aperture area PSCs with improved efficiency and stability. We have revealed that LMA leads to the improved crystallinity and spatial uniformity of component and/or chemical distribution in the resultant films, which corresponds to the defect behavior that determines the corresponding device performance. We first performed PL quantum efficiency (PLQE) measurements on the perovskites at different light intensities (Fig.  3G ). The LMA-treated sample exhibited a higher PLQE of 19.6% compared with Ref (4.0%) under 100 mW/cm 2 irradiation. In addition, its PLQE increased more rapidly with enhancing laser intensity, indicating that the nonradiative recombination centers were more quickly filled  (30, 31) . PLQE also allows the perovskite solar cells to operate as lightemitting diode (LED) devices. The electroluminescence (EL) signal appeared at a low applied voltage of ~1.1 V, with the emission peak located at ~800 nm, which is consistent with other reports (32) (fig.  S12 ). The maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) reached 8.15% for an LMA-based device at 1.6 V bias voltage, whereas Ref only obtained 0.90% (Fig.  3H ). This result shows that the defects related to nonradiative losses in the perovskite absorber were significantly suppressed by the LMA process. Moreover, temperaturedependent PL emission, transient photovoltage and photocurrent decays, and space-chargelimited current measurements (figs. S13 to S16 and supplementary text S4) further confirmed the lower charge carrier recombination rate and improved carrier transport and extraction in the LMA-fabricated device. We extensively applied the LMA process to other perovskite systems (e.g., MAPbI 3 and FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 ) and observed improved crystallinity and grain size (fig.  S17  and supplemen tary text S5), as well as marked enhancement of carrier lifetime in LMA samples (Fig.  3I ). The spatial uniformity of different perovskite systems was also characterized by PL mapping measurements (fig.  S18  and supplementary text S5). Variations in PL emission peak positions were all reduced with the LMA process (Fig.  3I ), indicating the uniform composition distribution of LMA samples regardless of perovskite system. We also found that LMA is feasible for one-step deposition to achieve improved carrier lifetime and reduced variation in PL peak positions (Fig.  3J ), which leads to improvements in other optoelectronic properties (fig.  S20  and supplementary text S6). Finally, to illustrate the applicability of LMA technology on larger-scale perovskite films, we fabricated perovskite films (FA 1-x-y MA x Cs y PbI 3-z Br z , 6×6 cm 2 ) and found that their quality and uniformity could also be improved by LMA (figs. S22 to S25 and supplementary text S7). From these results, we conclude that LMA technology can be universally applied to the fabrication of uniform perovskite films with high quality. We then fabricated perovskite solar devices (ITO/SnO 2 / FA 1-x-y MA x Cs y PbI 3-z Br z /Spiro-OMeTAD/Au) using LMA to investigate their photovoltaic performance. Statistical analyses on 100 individual devices for each condition were summarized. Both the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) and the short-circuit current density (J SC ) of PSCs were slightly improved by LMA (average V OC of 1.151 V and J SC of 24.66 mA/ cm 2 compared with Ref at 1.145 V, 24.52 mA/ cm 2 , respectively), which was consistent with the corresponding EQE measurements (fig.  S29 ), whereas the fill factor (FF) was substantially enhanced from 77.58 to 81.18% on average (fig.  S30 ). The improved photovoltaic parameters could be attributed to higher crystallinity and fewer defects in LMA-prepared perovskite films. The corresponding PCE achieved 23.24% on average compared with Ref at 21.80% (Fig.  4A ). The best device (with an aperture area of 0.08 cm 2 ) gave a stabilized power output of 24.04% (with a reverse scan PCE of 24.27% and a forward scan PCE of 23.17%; Fig.  4B ) and obtained a certified power output of 23.7% under steady-state tests at maximum power point (fig.  S31 ). LMA leads to uniform perovskite films, which is expected to be beneficial for largearea devices. We fabricated devices with a 1 cm 2 active area based on the same perovskite composition and device architecture. The V OC and J SC of the LMA device (1.155 V and 24.38 mA/cm 2 on average, respectively) and Ref (1.152 V and 24.47 mA/cm 2 on average, respectively) showed similar trends with corresponding small-area devices (fig.  S32 ). When the FF for Ref was reduced to 72.42%, that for LMA achieved 78.54% on average, closer to that of the corresponding small-area devices. It has been reported that FF is reduced with increases in the device area  (6, 33, 34) , likely because of the increase of parasitic resistive losses. LMA leads to excellent film uniformity in large areas, which provides large shunting resistance and small series resistance over the entire thin film device (fig.  S33 ). As a result, the LMA-fabricated large-area PSCs exhibited an average PCE of 22.17% (obtained from 80 individual devices), whereas that of Ref was 20.38% (Fig.  4A ). The best LMA device (with an aperture area of 1 cm 2 ) gave a stabilized power output of 23.15% (with a reverse scan PCE of 23.35% and a forward scan PCE of 22.54%; Fig.  4C ) and yielded a certified PCE of 22.3% (average value from a reverse scan PCE of 22.6% and a forward scan PCE of 22.0%) (fig.  S34 ). To our knowledge, this PCE is the highest ever reported for a 1-cm 2 device. The efficiency difference of the best-performing cell between the small (~0.1 cm 2 ) and large (1 cm 2 ) area was reduced from 1.37% (Ref sample; tables S8 and S9) to 0.92% (LMA sample; Fig.  4D ), and is the smallest reported thus far (fig.  S35 ), which implies promising potential for the scalable fabrication of perovskite solar cells by LMA. To investigate the stability of the resultant devices with the desired composition, the performance evolution under different kinds of stressors was monitored. The thermal stability test (stored at 85°C under nitrogen atmosphere following the ISOS-D-2I protocol) was performed first. LMA devices retained 95.2% of their initial PCE after 2184 hours of aging, whereas Ref retained 75.8% (fig.  S36 ). In addition, we investigated the operational stability of unencapsulated devices at one-sun LED irradiation with SPO tracking in a nitrogen atmosphere. This revealed that the LMA device only experienced a 5% PCE loss after 2000 hours of aging, whereas a PCE loss of up to 20% was found in Ref (Fig.  4E ). According to the degradation mechanisms of PSCs during operation  (10) , high-crystallinity perovskites with ideal stoichiometry and fewer GBs in the film are beneficial for suppressing ion and defect migration, which prolongs the operational lifetime of the device. We also monitored the operational lifetime of 1-cm 2 PSC devices. Although the Ref devices suffered aggravated PCE reduction of up to 39% after 1120 hours of aging, LMA devices only exhibited 10% PCE loss (Fig.  4F ). Perovskite films with fewer defects and high uniformity largely reduce the degradation sites at the initial state, which extends the operational lifetime of the corresponding devices profoundly. Therefore, perovskites produced by LMA have a great potential to be adopted in larger-area solar devices with enhanced efficiency and lifetime. In general, reproducible processing under variable ambient conditions is one of the primary criteria for the commercialization of perovskite PV to ensure low manufacturing costs. However, perovskite has been demonstrated to be moisture sensitive, which causes variations in performance when fabricated at different humidity levels  (15, 35, 36) . Even when annealing perovskites in moisture-free surroundings (e.g., in the glove box), the crystal quality can be significantly influenced by various volatile organic compounds.  (16)  Instead of laboriously and expensively controlling the annealing atmosphere, the LMA method is less dependent on the fabrication climate (in-house) because of the robust microenvironment created by the liquid medium. We also investigated its reproducibility under all-weather in-house conditions. The perovskite solar cells (FA 1-x-y MA x Cs y PbI 3-z Br z as absorber) were fabricated in four quarters with varied humidity in the laboratory (the average temperature/humidity for spring, summer, autumn, and winter were ~20°C/ ~30% RH, ~35°C/~65% RH, ~25°C/~40% RH, and ~15°C/~15% RH, respectively). The traditional annealing method was strongly dependent on weather, resulting in an average PCE of >22% in winter and 19% in summer with poor reproducibility. There was no obvious performance difference in LMA devices (fig.  S37 ), with most having a PCE of >23% (Fig.  4G ) because of the liquid medium, which effectively blocks interference from the ambient conditions (Fig.  1E ). This result shows the all-weather adaptability of LMA technology for the widespread fabrication of perovskite photovoltaics. We also fabricated solar cells with different perovskite compositions (e.g., MAPbI 3 , FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 , and FASn 0.5 Pb 0.5 I 3 ) and multiple processing (e.g., one-step spin-coating) to determine the generality of LMA technology. The LMA process was associated with a noticeable performance improvement (fig.  S19, S21 , and S27 and supplementary text S5, S6, and S8). Furthermore, the liquid medium can be expanded from anisole to trichlorobenzene and Dowtherm A (fig.  S38 ), for example, highlighting the extensive opportunities to further improve LMA technology for perovskite thin film fabrication. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""2000"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""24.04"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.95""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""2000"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""24.04"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.95"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.8""}, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSD2"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""85"", ""time"": ""2184"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.952"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.758""}}"

2180,132_12," Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41566-022-01111-x   We observed a faster degradation, with another 16% drop, for the control device after 24 h, whereas the DDT device shows a slower degradation with only another 5% drop. More test results on thermal stability are provided in Supplementary Table  11 . In XRD measurements (Fig.  5b ), no impurity peaks in either the control or the DDT-treated device are observed after 144 h, suggesting that the drop in performance is probably related to deterioration of the doped HTMs rather than the perovskite. This was confirmed by AFM, where we observe the formation of a crystalline fibril structure with valleys after 144 h in the control samples (Fig.  5c ). In comparison, DDT-treated films excel by largely retaining their initial morphological features, although with some enlarged pinholes (Fig.  5d ). In microscopy results (Fig.  5e, f ), the DDT film exhibits a suppressed crystalline coverage with smaller domain sizes. Crystallization of doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM films has a negative influence on device performance  44  , leading to decreased adhesive and cohesive fracture resistance  45  and the formation of an undesired layer that causes an energy barrier for charge extraction  46  . In the TOF-SIMS results (Fig.  5g ,h and Supplementary Fig.  20 ), the control device shows more Li + and TFSI -accumulation at the Au/ HTM interface. Lithium cations have been reported to migrate into the perovskite stack via bulk or domain boundaries  13, 18  . Contrastingly, the DDT-treated sample maintains overall good dopant homogeneity and higher concentration across the HTM. Capturing mobile lithium ions is critical for improving the thermal stability of HTMs  47  . We attribute the better results for capturing mobile lithium ions in DDT-treated samples to the strong interaction between DDT and the lithium compound. To confirm that the performance loss is arising mainly from the deteriorating HTM rather than the perovskite stack, we redeposited new doped spiro-OMeTAD HTMs on aged samples. The device performance could be recovered to ~19% (Supplementary Fig.  21 ). We also applied DDT-treated spiro-OMeTAD HTMs to FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 PSCs. Thermally Article  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41566-022-01111-x  stable FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 could avoid the degradation factor from the perovskite absorber  48  . Supplementary Fig.  22  and Supplementary Table  12  further confirm the benefits of DDT for thermal stability. Illumination stability. We investigated the impact of DDT on illumination stability by conducting continuous illumination stress experiments (AM 1.5, 30-35 °C, N 2 atmosphere, open-circuited, and SPO at MPP) on unencapsulated PSCs (Fig.  6a, b ). The best control device shows a decrease as large as 90% with respect to the peak performance after 2,000 h while open-circuited. In great contrast, the best DDT device has a high performance retention of up to 93% over the same measurement period. The DDT device also demonstrated a good stability result for SPO at MPP, retaining 90% of its peak performance after 1,000 h. More results on the light stability test are shown in Supplementary Table  13 . Continuous illumination deteriorates both the perovskite stack and the HTM in the control device, but the DDT-treated samples demonstrate improved stability. From XRD measurements (Fig.  6c ), the control devices are seen to exhibit a much stronger impurity peak (PbI 2 ) after 2,000 h than the DDT devices. The appearance of a PbI 2 peak could be ascribed to the loss of organic cations. Using AFM, small crystalline grains and valleys are observed for the control HTM after 2,000 h (Fig.  6d ), whereas most regions retain the initial amorphous characteristic in the DDT-treated sample, although with a few small crystalline grains on the surface (Fig.  6e ). Unlike the large crystalline domains caused by thermal stress, the crystalline grains caused by illumination stress are too tiny to be observed in the microscopy results. Nevertheless, apparent cracks can be observed for the control (Fig.  6f ), but not the DDT-treated sample (Fig.  6g ). From TOF-SIMS (Fig.  6h ,i and Supplementary Fig.  23 ), Li + and TFSI -ions are observed to accumulate severely at the interfaces in both control and DDT-treated devices. We notice the appearance of MA + cations at the Au/spiro-OMeTAD interface after 2,000 h in the control devices, which can be ascribed to ion migration of MA + from the perovskite to the Au contact via spiro-OMeTAD HTM; however,    ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Cs0.05(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""DDT-treated spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSD"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""50"", ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""430"", ""control_pce"": ""22.7"", ""treated_pce"": ""23.1"", ""control_voc"": ""1.171"", ""treated_voc"": ""1.198"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.97"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.68""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""50-85"", ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.95""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Cs0.05(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""DDT-treated spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSD"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""50"", ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""430"", ""control_pce"": ""22.7"", ""treated_pce"": ""23.1"", ""control_voc"": ""1.171"", ""treated_voc"": ""1.198"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.97"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.68""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""50-85"", ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.95""}, ""test_3"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""2000"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.93"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.1""}}"
2217,98_3,"[6, 7]   The highest reported electroluminescent (EL) external quantum efficiencies (EQE EL ) of PLEDs have surpassed >20%.  [8] [9] [10] [11]  Due to the similar device architectures for PSC and PLED, one attractive possibility is to develop photovoltaic/ electroluminescent (PV/EL) bifunctionalities in the same device. However, there is a fundamental tradeoff between solar cell (SC) and light emitting diode (LED) due to the inverse photoelectricity interconversion process and this concept is thus rarely demonstrated yet with high performance.  [12] [13] [14]  Based on the detailed balance (Shockley-Queisser, S-Q) theory, the voltage loss in SC can be attributed to the two basic factors shown in Equation (1)  [15, 16]   where E g is the bandgap energy; V OC the open-circuit voltage; q the elemental charge, k is the Boltzmann constant; and T is the Kelvin temperature. V V , oc rad oc nonrad ∆ ∆ are V OC losses via radiative recombination and nonradiative recombination, respectively. The first term due to the radiative recombination is unavoidable for SC and the energy loss is around 0.28 eV for the PSCs.  [17, 18]  According to Equations ((1) and (  2 )), the same approach to S-Q limit for SC and LED performance is to reduce the nonradiative recombination. In PLED, it is found that near 100% internal quantum efficiencies can be achieved by minimizing interfacial and bulk nonradiative losses.  [11]  In PSCs, the EL metrics can be used to monitor the photovoltage loss, for example, high EQE EL always means high-voltage for SC.  [16, 19, 20]  Several methods have been reported to improve the EQE EL of PSCs, such as improving the perovskite crystal quality by antisolvent engineering, suppressing nonradiative defects by small excess of PbI 2 and using a solution-processed secondary growth (SSG) technique.  [12, 14, [21] [22] [23]  Notably, the EQE EL of PSCs has reached 3.8% through incorporation of rubidium cation into perovskite due to enhanced optoelectronic properties.  [3]  Very recently, surface passivation by PEAI layer has also improved the EL properties of PSCs.  [44]  In principle, nonradiative recombination in perovskite device mainly originates from the interfacial defect states at various interfaces and the native defects.  [24] [25] [26]  In the state-of-the-art perovskite device, recombination in the bulk seems to be negligible since the high quality of perovskite absorber materials have been achieved through morphological control and defect management, confirmed by the long carrier lifetime and diffusion length.  [27, 28]  It is reported that TOPOpassivated MAPbI 3 films can achieve a quasi-Fermi-level splitting as high as 1.28 ± 0.01 eV.  [29]  If such perovskite films could be successfully implemented in a SC device with appropriate selective contacts, it is possible to deliver a V OC of 1.28 V with only 0.04 V loss to S-Q limit, which corresponds to an encouraging EQE EL of ≈21.5% according to Equation (2). Therefore, in principle, it is possible to develop PV/EL PBDs with high comprehensive performance. Except for high quality perovskite films with low defect states, the main challenge is to reduce the energy band barrier at the interface between the perovskite and charge transport layers, which determine the charge extraction or injection loss.  [24]  For the SC, it requires light-generated electron-hole pairs being effectively separated from the perovskite layer and therefore prefers to the type II (staggered gap) charge extraction band alignment as shown in Scheme 1a.  [30]  Inversely, the LED with charge injection alignment is shown in Scheme 1b (straddling gap, type I alignment), to enhance the electron/hole recombination through charge confinement in the active layer.  [7]  Therefore, the energy driving forces in SC and LED are inverse to each other. However, if we can modulate the energy offset at the interface approaching to zero and ensure a barrier free bidirectional charge transfer as shown in Scheme 1c, it is possible to minimize the V OC loss and maximum the EL performance.

We firstly reveal that the serious surface states of perovskite show n-type and thus uplift the Fermi energy of adjacent HTLs using Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM) measurement. Such perovskite/HTLs interface energy band shows a downward band-bending misalignment, leading to serious nonradiative recombination at interface. The FN-Br can turn the n-type perovskite surface into p-type and lower the Fermi level (E F ) of HTL as well. The tailed device forms a well-defined N-I-P heterojunction structure to approximate the Scheme 1c, and hence reduces the energy offset at the perovskite/HTLs interface. The best-performing MAPbI 3 devices achieve a maximum PV efficiency of 21.54% and an improved EQE EL of 4.3%, which is among the highest comprehensive performance so far for PBDs. Due to nondestructive additives, our unencapsulated devices show an excellent stability and maintain >92% of their initial PV performance after continuous operation for 500 h at maximum power point (MPP) under 1-sun illumination. We demonstrate it is a general interface energy band engineering for efficient and stable perovskite photoelectric device. The structure of N-I-P planar PBDs in our study is ITO/ SnO 2 /perovskite/HTLs/Au, showing a switchable dual functionality of SC and LED (Figure  1a ). Here, we blend small amount of FN-Br additive into spiro-OMeTAD to form composite HTLs and the chemical structure is shown in Figure  1a . We assume that there is a thin interlayer formed at the perovskite/HTL interface due to self-organization of -N(CH 3 ) 2 functional group. In order to achieve stable SC/LED PBDs, we use dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD (DFS) as HTLs, without the humidity sensitive additives of LiTFSI and detrimental 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) which are generally thought to be necessary for high performance PSCs. Interestingly, we find that the PV efficiency of devices based on DFS can be improved largely through reducing the DFS thickness which dominates the series resistances in PBD (Figures  S1-S3 , Supporting Information). The highest PCE of 17.29% with a V OC of 1.05 V, a fill factor (FF) of 72.6%, and a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 22.70 mA cm -2 can be achieved when the thickness of DFS is ≈80 nm (Figure  1b ; Table  S1 , Supporting Information). After introducing FN-Br, the device based on DFS (DFS:FN-Br) achieves an improved V OC of 1.16 V and reaches an efficiency of 19.31% (Figure  1b ; Table  S1 , Supporting Information). To understand the improvement of V OC , we estimated the ideality factor (n), which is an indicator of the dominant recombination mechanism occurring within a working device. The n values of the control and DFS:FN-Br based devices are 1.76 and 1.34, respectively, through fitting the J SC dependence of the V OC curves using the equation S1 in the Supporting Information  [31]  (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information). The much smaller n value indicates that the serious interfacial recombination has been effectively reduced by FN-Br. To achieve high V OC in a SC, not only external photoluminescence of the perovskite should be maximized, but also any additional nonradiative losses at the interface in the devices must be minimized.  [28]  Figure  1c ,d compares the EL intensity of the perovskite devices based on the same structure with and without FN-Br. We can indeed observe enhanced EL intensity which is the consequence of a significantly improved hole injection at the perovskite/HTL interface (Figure  1d ). However, in the control device without FN-Br, current injection is much lower and EL becomes weaker (Figure  1c ). To find the physical mechanism for the improved V OC of SC mode and enhanced EL of LED mode, we measured the work function (WF) of the perovskite layer and DFS HTLs by using KPFM. As shown in Figure  2a ,b, we perform the surface potential mappings of MAPbI 3 -Au interface on a HTLfree device with the structure of ITO/SnO 2 /MAPbI 3 (with and without treating by FN-Br solution)/Au and MAPbI 3 /DFS-Au interface on a complete device with the structure of ITO/SnO 2 / MAPbI 3 /DFS(with or without FN-Br additive)/Au, respectively. It is noticed that the Au electrode should be freshly prepared without contamination, which has a WF of ≈5.1 eV calibrated by highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) electrode and thus can be used as a reference to investigate the energy level change of perovskite and DFS in practical device. We observe that both the pristine MAPbI 3 and MAPbI 3 /DFS have a large surface potential gap with Au electrode, which are ≈0.69 and ≈0.58 eV, respectively (Figure  2a, b ). The WF of DFS (4.52 eV) on the perovskite is even lower than its intrinsic value of ≈4.9 eV, which suggests that the surface state of perovskite influences the WF of DFS (Figure  2b   Based on these measurements, we deduce the band diagram at the interface between perovskite and DFS with/without FN-Br (Figure  2d, e ). First, our results show that the pristine perovskite surface is n-type because its E F (-4.41 eV by KPFM; -4.3 eV by UPS) is closed to the conduction band (E C ) (-4.2 eV), which can be seen from the energy band of MAPbI 3 perovskite (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information). In previous study, it was demonstrated that the n-type character of crystal perovskite is caused by donor-type surface states (Pb 0 )  [32]  (Figure  2d ). The formation of surface state on the perovskite film seems to be inevitable, since the periodic array of lattice is broken at the terminal of crystal, and meanwhile organic component of perovskite shows relatively low thermal stability during annealing.  [33]  Under thermal equilibrium, the energy bands show a downward bending at the perovskite surface since the crystal perovskite is close to an intrinsic semiconductor in the bulk  [32, 34]  (Figure  2d ). The electron concentration of perovskite and hole concentration of DFS have been attained by Hall measurement, which are ≈8.0 × 10 16 and ≈1.1 × 10 15 cm -3 , respectively. When contacting with the perovskite active layer, the DFS will also show downward band bending on the perovskite layer side, and the MAPbI 3 /DFS interface form an N-P -junction (Figure  2d ). It can be attained that the depletion region will distribute in the side of DFS according to the equation D >> N A ) N x N x A p D n = (3) where the N D is the electron concentration; N A is the hole concentration; x P , x n are the widths of the positive and negative space charge region, respectively. Namely, in thermal equilibrium the hole concentration in DFS will largely decrease due to the diffusion of electron from perovskite surface, leading to the reduction of WF in DFS. It could be verified by the Boltzmann relation  [35]  p N E E kT exp V V F = × -       ( 4 ) where p is the number of holes (occupied valence-band levels); E V is the valence-band edge; N V is the effective density of states in the valence band; k is the Boltzmann constant; and T is the Kelvin temperature. This interfacial band structure of N-P -junction would block the hole and trap electron at the interface between perovskite and HTLs, leading to serious recombination (Figure  2d ). As the FN-Br is dipole molecule with electron-rich sites on the side of -N(CH 3 ) 2 functional group, the lone electron pairs at the N can be delocalized to the empty 6p orbits of positive metal center (Pb 2+ ). The binding energy of the FN-Br on the MAPbI 3 surface was estimated to be 44.3 kJ mol -1 by density function theory calculation (Figure  S10 , Supporting Information). The molecular adsorption of FN-Br can be used to indicate the elimination of donor-type states (Pb 0 ) on perovskite surface. Figure  S11  in the Supporting Information shows Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra for FN-Br, PbI 2 /FN-Br, and MAPbI 3 /FN-Br film. Stretching frequency of C-N appears at 1270 cm -1 for the bare FN-Br, which is shifted to 1253 and 1249 cm -1 for PbI 2 /FN-Br and MAPbI 3 /FN-Br, respectively. The decreased C-N stretching frequency of PbI 2 /FN-Br indicates that the CN bond strength is decreased due to the interaction with Pb 2+ ions and we find that there exists the similar stretching frequency of C-N in PbI 2 /FN-Br and MAPbI 3 /FN-Br, indicating the coordination between MAPbI 3 and FN-Br. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted to investigate the surface composition for perovskite films. For the pristine perovskite film, two additional peaks can be observed at 138.0 and 142.9 eV, which can be attributed to metallic lead on the surface  [36]  (Figure  S12 , Supporting Information). After treating by FN-Br, the metallic lead peak almost disappears. Excess FN-Br at the interface even may attract mobile holes to compensate for the negative charge and then p-dopes the surface of perovskite, resulting in a slight upward band bending (Figure  2e ). In the HTLs, the FN-Br incorporation can also lower the E F of DFS toward a deeper level as well (Figure  2c ; Figure  S8 , Supporting Information), which will reduce the energy barrier at the perovskite/DFS interface. Based on these results, we deduce that the FN-Br can effectively tune the band structure of device from N-[N]-I-[N]-P -to N-[N]-I-[P]-P ([] represents the interface). This adjusted energy band structure is beneficial to suppress the interfacial nonradiative recombination both for photogenerated electron/hole extraction in SC and electron/hole injection in LED (Figure  2e ). Figure  2f  gives the Mott-Schottky (MS) plots 1/C 2 versus voltage attained by EIS measurements for the control and FN-Br device. According to the Equation (  5 ), the slope gives the charge concentration of the substrate (-2/qɛN), and the intercept of 1/C 2 = 0 gives the built-in potential (ψ bi -2kT/q)  [35, 37]   C A q N V kT q bi 1 2 2 2 2 0 ε ε ψ = --       (5) where C is the depletion-layer capacitance; ψ bi the built-in potential at equilibrium; q the unit electronic charge (1.60 × 10 -19 C), V the applied voltage, A the active area, ɛ the relative permittivity ( = 32), ɛ 0 the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10 -12 F m -1 ), N the charge concentration. By fitting the voltage dependence of the 1/C 2 curves, we find that the slope of the FN-Br devices is one order of magnitude higher than control devices, illustrating the much lower charge density at the perovskite/HTL interface due to the passivation of FN-Br (Figure  2h ). Meanwhile, it is clear that the intercept at 1/C 2 = 0 based on the device with FN-Br is much larger than that based on control device. It illustrates that the built-in potential in device is improved due to adjusted energy band structure, leading to the improved V OC in SC mode. In addition, it is found that this tailed N-I-P structure can achieve a better charge injection balance when the device is operated as a LED mode. As shown in Figure  2g , we measured the J-V characteristics of electron-only devices (ITO/SnO 2 / perovskite/PCBM/Au) and hole-only devices (ITO/PTAA/ perovskite/with or without FN-Br/DFS/Au). The results show that electrons dominate injection into the devices, whereas the FN-Br can improve the hole injection and balance the charge injection which is critical for the PLED. We find that adding the FN-Br into DFS can achieve a better PV performance and reproductivity than spin coating the FN-Br and DFS on the perovskite layer in sequence (Figure  S13  and Table  S2 , Supporting Information). It is possible that a thin FN-Br interlayer could form well through self-organizing on the perovskite surface due to the chemical bonding between the functional group -N(CH 3 ) 2 and under-coordinated Pb as aforementioned, and the FN-Br incorporation can shift the E F of spiro-MeTAD toward a deeper level (Figure  2c ). We systematically optimized the FN-Br concentration dependent performance, as shown in Figure  S14  in the Supporting Information, which suggested that FN-Br could increase the V OC in small concentration. In order to further improve the device efficiency, we added slight FK209 (≈0.5 wt%) into the HTLs and it results in a mild improvement for V OC and J SC , and an obvious enhancement for FF (Figure  S15 , Supporting Information). In previous reports, FK209 was usually used as a p-dopant to enhance the hole transport and overall efficiency.  [38, 39]  In this study, the FK209 additive plays the similar role for improving the device performance. The J-V curves of the champion device after optimization are shown in Figure  3a . The device exhibits a V OC of 1.186 V, a J SC of 23.25 mA cm -2 , and a FF of 78.2%, achieving an overall PCE of 21.54% under reverse scan (V OC to J SC ) and an overall PCE of 20.88% with a V OC of 1.188 V, a J SC of 23.28 mA cm -2 , and a FF of 75.6% under forward scan. It shows a rapid increase in stabilized output PCE to a value of 21.4%, confirming the little hysteresis in our device. The superior performance of our MAPbI 3 -based PSCs is mainly attributed to the improved V OC , which shows an average value of 1.168 V, much higher than those of device doped by conventional LiTFSI/TBP (Figure  S16  and Table  S2 , Supporting Information).  [40, 41]  The J SC value obtained by integrating the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum is 22.8 mA cm -2 , which is consistent with the measured value (Figure  3b ). In some devices, we have measured a record V OC of 1.208 V and it has been confirmed by the V OC over time (Figure  3c ). The only 0.39 V loss-in-potential is one of the lowest energy losses recorded in PSCs and 91.5% of the S-Q limit in potential, implying the effectivity of our strategy. To verify our device efficiency measurements, we sent one of our unsealed devices to the National Institute of Metrology, China, for independent certification and obtained a PCE of 20.24% (V OC = 1.151 V, J SC = 23.16 mA cm -2 , and FF = 76.15%) (Figure  S17 , Supporting Information). It has been demonstrated the universality of our strategy to different HTLs, including poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), poly(9,9-dioctyl-fluorene-co-N-(4-butylphenyl)diphenylamine) (TFB), and poly (diketopyrrolopyrrole-terthiophene) (PDPP3T). It can be seen that all the PSCs based on FN-Br additive exhibits the V OC in a range of 1.1-1.2 V, which is much higher than those of referenced PSCs, with a value around 1 V (Figure  S18 , Supporting Information). The MAPbI 3 is used because it has a single phase and constant bandgap which are beneficial to exactly determine the V OC loss in device. At present, mix-cation based PSCs with a tunable bandgap show an efficiency advantage than MAPbI 3 based PSCs.  [4, [42] [43] [44]  Encouragingly, it is found that our strategy is effective regardless of composition of perovskite materials (Figure  S19 , Supporting Information). The results show that all of the devices based on double cation (MAFA, CsFA) or triple cation (CsMAFA) achieve an improvement of V OC through interfacial energy band management (Figure  S20 , Supporting Information). The device based on triple-cation (CsFAMA) perovskite exhibits a highest PCE of 20.6% with an improved V OC of 1.20 V from 1.06 V (Figure  S20 , Supporting Information). One of these devices even reaches a high V OC of 1.247 V (Figure  S21 , Supporting Information). However, compared with the MAPbI 3 based devices, our mix-cation based PSCs show a relative low performance mainly due to the reduced J SC or FF parameters (Figure  S20 , Supporting Information). It is because that halide segregation usually occurs during the device preparation, which leads to bandgap instabilities in mixed-halide perovskite systems, and thus reduces the performance and reproductivity of device (Figure  S22 , Supporting Information). The tailored N-I-P energy band configuration also delivered an improved EL performance when the MAPbI 3 -based PBDs were operated as LED mode under a bias voltage (Figure  3d ). The EQE EL -V characteristics of the best-performing PBDs show a maximum EQE EL of 4.3% at 2.3 V, which is among the highest values reported so far in PSCs  [12, 14, [19] [20] [21] [22] 45, 46]  and the EL emission peak is located at 772 nm. The EQE EL value can maintain above 4% at a high current density from 150 to 350 mA cm -2 mostly due to the improved balance of the electron/hole injection. Owing to the low interfacial energy barrier, the EQE EL of 2.6% can be attained for a driving current density of around the J SC of 23.2 mA cm -2 (Figure  3e ) and a nonradiative V OC loss of 98 mV has been achieved according to Equation (2). Figure  3f  shows the J-V and radiance versus voltage (L-V) characteristics of the champion bifunctional device, showing a high radiance and current density with a low driving voltage of 1.3 V due to the reduced energy losses from carrier injection and transport. We present a video in the SM showing that the device with FN-Br displayed an obviously visible red emission under ambient light. In Figure  S23  and Table  S3  in the Supporting Information, we give the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decays for the MAPbI 3 and MAPbI 3 /HTLs films with/ without FN-Br, which was fitted to a biexponential equation: Y = A 1 exp(-t/τ 1 ) + A 2 exp(-t/τ 2 ). We attributed quenching of the short PL lifetime to defect-induced nonradiative recombination and of the long PL lifetime to radiative recombination. When contacting the HTLs, the DFS can lead to PL quenching of perovskite due to charge extraction. Obviously, it is found that the suppression of the interfacial defect states by FN-Br can improve both short and long decay times in MAPbI 3 and MAPbI 3 /HTLs films, illustrating a reduced nonradiative recombination. It can be double confirmed by the improved external photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQYs) in FN-Br based films (Table  S4 , Supporting Information). The stability is the most important for the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaic device. Compared with the PSCs based on conventional additives TBP/LiTFSI, our PBDs show much better photovoltaic stability (Figure  4a, b ) since FN-Br is corrosion-free for the perovskite active layer (Figure  4c -f; Figure  S24 , Supporting Information). The unencapsulated devices stability has been tested under AM1.5 G Sun illumination at maximum power point (MPP) tracking in ambient air with ≈60% humidity (Figure  4a ). The device based on TBP/LiTFSI doped spiro-OMeTAD shows a rapid loss of PCE and only remains ≈30% initial value. However, the device with FN-Br/FK209 has an excellent stability, maintaining 95% of their initial performance after continuous operation for 4 h. In a nitrogen atmosphere, the control device showed a rapid loss of PCE within 2 h and retained >85% of their initial PCE after continuous MPP for 25 h (Figure  S25 , Supporting Information), indicating that the additives of TBPs and Li-salt in spiro-OMeTAD play a vital role in stability. It has been demonstrated that the TBP can react with perovskite or evaporation, thus become the source of degradation  [47, 48]  (Figure  4c, e ). Encouragingly, as seen from the XRD results, no decomposition product was observed in perovskite film after FN-Br treatment (Figure  S26 , Supporting Information). As a result, the device based on FN-Br can maintain 92% of its initial photovoltaic performance after continuous operation for 500 h of MPP under 1-sun illumination. These results demonstrate the importance of corrosion-free interfacial materials for the stability of perovskite devices. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of interfacial energy band engineering using FN-Br for reducing the nonradiative recombination and maximizing the luminescence which are crucial for high PV as well as EL. FN-Br can turn the n-type surface of perovskite into p-type to form a welldefined N-I-P structure for device and thus tailor the interfacial energy band misalignment. The resultant SC/LED PBD achieves a high PV efficiency of up to 21.54% (certified 20.24%) and 4.3% EQE EL . Furthermore, by using nondestructive additives, the unsealed devices can maintain >92% of their initial photovoltaic performance for 500 h under continuous operation at their maximum power point. Therefore, this corrosion-free interfacial energy band engineering opens an attractive route for the realization of high PV/ EL comprehensive performance of PBD with excellent stability. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""methylammonium lead iodide"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""60"", ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""4"", ""control_pce"": ""17.29"", ""treated_pce"": ""19.31"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.95"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.3""}}"
2252,103_9," Computational method We carried out the first-principles pseudopotential total energy calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) within the generalized gradient density approximation (GGA) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)  (45) (46) (47) (48) . The electron-ion interactions are described employing the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) method (  49 ) and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional is used for GGA exchange correlation potential  (50) . To simulate stoichiometric and MDA-and Cl-doped FAPbI3 in α-phase  (33) , we used a 3x3x3 supercell for all the calculations. A kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV and only Γ k-point for Brillouin zone integration is employed. All the atomic positions and lattice parameters are fully relaxed until the total energy is converged within 10 -4 eV.       Table  S1 . Photovoltaic parameters of control and target, measured in reverse and forward mode, as extracted from Figure  2B .     In general, mixed cations and anions containing formamidinium (FA), methylammonium (MA), caesium, iodine, and bromine ions are used to stabilize the black a-phase of the FA-based lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) in perovskite solar cells. However, additives such as MA, caesium, and bromine widen its bandgap and reduce the thermal stability. We stabilized the a-FAPbI 3 phase by doping with methylenediammonium dichloride (MDACl 2 ) and achieved a certified short-circuit current density of between 26.1 and 26.7 milliamperes per square centimeter. With certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 23.7%, more than 90% of the initial efficiency was maintained after 600 hours of operation with maximum power point tracking under full sunlight illumination in ambient conditions including ultraviolet light. Unencapsulated devices retained more than 90% of their initial PCE even after annealing for 20 hours at 150°C in air and exhibited superior thermal and humidity stability over a control device in which FAPbI 3 was stabilized by MAPbBr 3 . P erovskite solar cells (PSCs) have increased power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) with broader solar-light absorption through narrower bandgaps. Among lead halide perovskites (LHPs), the narrowest bandgap is afforded by the formamidinium (FA)-based lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) [1.45 to 1.51 eV (1-3) in thin films], which also affords improved thermal stability (4) relative to MAPbI 3 (where MA is methylammonium) because of its elevated decomposition temperature. However, FAPbI 3 readily transforms from the desired trigonal black a-phase into the undesired wide-bandgap d-phase with hexagonal symmetry under ambient conditions at room temperature  (5) . We have shown that modification of FAPbI 3 with MAPbBr 3 stabilized the a-FAPbI 3 phase and subsequently improved the device efficiency to >18% in (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15  (6) . Efforts to improve the stability of FAPbI 3 have focused on mixed cation-anion hybrid LHPs that incorporate several cations, anions, or both, such as the FA x MA 1-x double cation or the FA 1-x-y MA x Cs y triple cation. This incorporation is achieved by the partial replacement of FA + , MA + , Rb + , Cs + , Br -, and I -(7-11). Nevertheless, when MA and Br are alloyed in FAPbI 3 , various problems such as low thermal stability (4) caused by the addition of MA, phase separation  (12)  caused by the presence of mixed halides, and reduced photon absorption arise, thereby resulting in low current density owing to an undesirable increase in the bandgap. Although the a-FAPbI 3 phase without MA can be stabilized by incorporating phenylethylammonium lead iodide  (13)  through surface functionalization  (14)  or by using both Rb and Cs  (15) , the resulting PCE is still low when compared with that obtained with the use of the FA x MA 1-x double cation. To further increase the PCE by enhancing the photocurrent density resulting from increased light harvesting, a new composition is needed that stabilizes the a-phase while maintaining the inherent bandgap of FAPbI 3 . The ionic radii and molecular configuration of methylenediammonium [ + H 3 N-CH 2 -NH 3 + (MDA), 262 picometers (pm), calculated] and FA ( + H 2 N=CH-NH 2 , 256 pm) are comparable except for the valence-state difference. However, MDA has more hydrogen atoms than FA and even MA, which means that it can form a greater number of H bonds with I -. Thus, MDA could structurally stabilize the a-FAPbI 3 in even smaller amounts than does MA. Some studies have reported the incorporation of divalent cations into monovalent A-site cations  (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) , but most of the divalent diammonium cations reported have been used to realize twodimensional (2D) or 2D/3D LHPs. Safdari et al. ) that used complementary solidstate grinding and solution methods as a 2D/ 3D mixture has also been reported  (21) . The use of 2D or 2D/3D mixed-perovskite-containing diammonium cations increased the stability of perovskite materials by strengthening electrostatic interactions between the layers that rigidify the structure. However, larger organic cations in 2D structures can inhibit charge transport by creating insulating spacing layers between conductive inorganic slabs, so it would be desirable to fabricate 3D LHPs without the 2D perovskite layer. We report highly efficient and stable PSCs fabricated with MA-, Cs-, and Br-free a-FAPbI 3 by incorporating a small amount of MDACl 2 . The resulting FAPbI 3 :3.8 mole % (mol %) MDACl 2 structure stabilized the a-phase with only a slight change in the bandgap. We achieved a short-circuit current density (J sc ) of between 26.1 and 26.7 mA cm -2 (certified), which is the highest reported for PSCs fabricated from FA-based LHPs. The device exhibited a PCE of >24% (certified stabilized 23.7%) and long-term stability compared with the control [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 ], which itself shows the highest efficiency among mesoporous (mp)-TiO 2 -based PSCs. We deposited a thin film of FAPbI 3 incorporating MDACl 2 with a process similar to that reported previously for state-of-art mixed perovskites (9-11) but adding MDACl 2 instead of MAPbBr 3 (see the experimental section in the supplementary materials). The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of FAPbI 3 :xMDACl 2 (x = 0, 1.9, 3.8, and 5.7 mol %) slightly blue-shifted with increasing amounts of MDACl 2 (Fig.  1A ) and were nearly identical to that of a thin film without the addition of MACl (fig.  S1 ) as a mediator  (22) (23) (24) (25) (26)  for high-crystallinity perovskite. This result is consistent with the corresponding shifts of photoluminescence (PL) emission peaks (Fig.  1A  and fig.  S2 ) from 826 nm to 824, 822, and 820 nm, and 816 nm for the control. This result suggests that MACl almost completely disappeared during the annealing process, as previously reported  (27, 28) . The presence of MDA in the perovskite was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (fig.  S3 ) and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (fig.  S4 ). Thus, MDACl 2 may have been incorporated into the perovskite lattice within the experimental x-value range. The bandgap changes in FAPbI 3 caused by the introduction of MDACl 2 were calculated using density functional theory and compared for two cases as per Eqs. 1 and 2: FA vacancy :ðFA þ1 1À2x MDA þ2 x ÞPb 2þ I À1 3 Cl À1 2x → ½ðFA þ1 1À2x MDA þ2 x ÞPb 2þ I À1 3 þ V xFA þ 2xFACl ð1Þ Cl i insertion :ðFA þ1 1Àx MDA þ2 x ÞPb 2þ I À1 3 Cl À1 2x → ½ðFA þ1 1Àx MDA þ2 x ÞPb 2þ I À1 3 Cl À1 x þ Cl xi þ xFACl ð2Þ Equations 1 and 2 represent compositions that assume the FA cation vacancies and the insertion of Cl -with a small ionic radius, respectively, upon the addition of MDACl 2 . The bandgap (1.47 eV) with the FA vacancy (V FA ) composition as per Eq. 1 is slightly greater than that of pristine FAPbI 3 (1.45 eV) and the Cl interstitial composition (Cl i ) based on Eq. 2 yielded an increased bandgap of 1.69 eV (Fig.  1B ). We expected that the addition of MDACl 2 to FAPbI 3 would mainly result in FA defects and the possible induction of PL quenching. However, adding 3.8 mol % MDACl 2 to FAPbI 3 enhanced the PL quantum yield as measured with an integrated sphere, but was greatly reduced with further MDACl 2 addition. This result implies that the FA defects did not act as deep electron traps. As reported previously (4, 29), pristine FAPbI 3 thin films annealed at high temperatures exhibited a black a-phase that absorbed long-wavelength light. However, the a-phase transitions to the yellow d-phase within 10 days at room temperature and within 1 day under high-humidity conditions (5, 30) because the metastable polymorphs stabilized at high temperature are preferably converted back to the thermodynamically stable phase below 120°C. The structural stabilization of the a-phase in FAPbI 3 with added cations can be explained by several factors. First, the a-phase stabilization by smaller cations such as Cs + can be understood from the Goldschmidt tolerance factor t approaching 0.9, which is similar to that of MAPbI 3 , by mixing FAPbI 3 (t ~1) and CsPbI 3 (t ~0.8)  (31) . Second, cation mixing in the FA sites affords entropic stabilization through the resulting entropic gain and small internal energy input to form their solid solution  (32) . Third, the stabilization of a-FAPbI 3 with MA cations can be explained by the presence of strong H bonds between the I -and H-N groups  (33) (34) (35) . The a-FAPbI 3 phase can be more easily stabilized when MA, Cs, or both is used with Br -of small ionic radii, and highefficiency PSCs are normally fabricated using a-FAPbI 3 stabilized by mixed cations and anions. We expected that MDA could stabilize a-FAPbI 3 through the partial replacement of FA sites because MDA has more H groups with an ionic radius similar to that of FA and a stronger ionic interaction of its divalent state. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of FAPbI 3 :xMDACl 2 (x = 0, 1.9, 3.8, and 5.7 mol %) and the control layers exposed to 80% humidity for 24 hours after annealing of the coatings of precursor solution at 150°C for 10 min (Fig.  1C ) show two peaks characteristic of the a-FAPbI 3 phase at 14.3°and 28.6°assigned to the (001) and (002) crystal planes, respectively, and one peak at 11.6°corresponding to the d-phase. The as-annealed films (fig.  S5 ) exhibited a pure a-phase for all compositions, but after exposure to high humidity for 24 hours, pure FAPbI 3 completely converted to the d-phase and FAPbI 3 with 1.9 mol % MDACl 2 exhibited a strong phase transition, with the control also exhibiting a certain amount of the d-phase. By contrast, FAPbI 3 incorporating 3.8 and 5.7 mol % of MDACl 2 retained the a-phase. Furthermore, as shown in fig.  S5 , the overall signal intensity increased for MDACl 2 addition up to 3.8 mol % without any impurity peaks. The incorporation of >3.8 mol % MDACl 2 may result in increased crystallinity because of the reduced lattice strain at FA defects (fig.  S6 ). As can be inferred from Eqs. 1 and 2, the perovskite structure may contain defective FA + or interstitial Cl -to satisfy the electrical neutrality rule with the release of FACl as a by-product when MDA 2+ ions are substituted into the FA sites in FAPbI 3 . The addition of MDACl 2 likely formed FACl or substituted residual MDACl 2 . However, the final annealed perovskite films did not exhibit any impurity peaks such as those of FACl and MDACl 2 . This result implies that MDACl 2 was successfully incorporated into the FAPbI 3 perovskite lattices, and the resulting FACl was eliminated by annealing at 150°C for 10 min, because FACl easily volatilized during heat treatment. The structural phase of FAPbI 3 with and without the substitution of the representative 3.8 mol % MDA and the presence of other phases such as FACl or MDACl 2 was further characterized using grazing-incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS). In The PbI 2 components remaining in both perovskite layers showed similar out-of-plane orientations. The GIWAXS ring patterns of a-FAPbI 3 :xMDACl 2 (x = 0 and 3.8 mol %) did not exhibit appreciable differences, and the fitted azimuthal circular average GIWAXS 1D full spectra were also nearly identical, without showing any peaks related to FACl or MDACl 2 . This result indicated that MDA is substituted into the FAPbI 3 lattice, as estimated from the conventional XRD analysis. Point defects corresponding to V FA or Cl i expressed by Eqs. 1 or 2, respectively, could decrease the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) and the fill factor (FF) rather than the current density J SC , although V FA defects form shallow traps near the conduction band  (37) . Fig.  4 . We used copper phthalocyanine (CuPC) as the hole-transporting material (HTM) to prevent degradation by hygroscopic dopants and spiro-OMeTAD itself at 150°C. The initial device parameters and J-V curves are presented in table S2 and fig.  S12 , respectively. The target device exhibited higher humidity stability, retaining >90% of the initial PCE after 70 hours under high humidity [85% relative humidity (RH), 25°C], than the control PCE, which reduced to 40% of the initial value (Fig.  4A ). The thermal stability monitored at 150°C and ~25% RH (Fig.  4B ) indicates that the control device PCE degraded gradually, reaching <20% of the initial PCE after 17 hours due to MA evaporation. The target device maintained >90% of its initial PCE and exhibited greatly improved thermal stability. In addition, the long-term photostability (encapsulation and ambient condition) of the PSC, including spiro-OMeTAD as HTM, was tested with maximum power point tracking under full solar illumination without a UV filter (Fig.  4C ). Despite the use of a TiO 2 photoelectrode with high photocatalytic effect, the target device exhibits very high photostability, maintaining ~90% of its initial PCE (>23.0%) over 600 hours of irradiation. This result can be attributed to both the high centration of Cl ions in the interface between photoelectrode and perovskite  (42)  and the stabilization of the a-phase on FAPbI 3 by MDACl 2 .

2317,54_11," Extraction of Mobile Ion Concentrations in Multiple Perovskite Devices We now use our model to extract the ion concentration from ionic charge measurements. We measured the ionic charge for 6 different perovskite solar cell compositions. The fabrication process for these devices is detailed in the Experimental Procedures. Note that we tested opaque and semi-transparent (no metal contact) devices and checked that our data was not affected by metal ion diffusion within the absorber.  40, 41  As explained in a previous study,  14  we measured Q ion by first letting the devices equilibrate at 0.8 V in the dark. We then removed the applied bias and measured the resulting dark current transient until the cell reached equilibrium steady state at 0 V. By doing so, we could probe the ionic current only since there is no electronic injection at 0 V and electronic carriers initially present in the absorbers at 0.8 V are swept away within the first few micro-seconds. By integrating the ionic current during re-equilibration (we removed the fast-electronic capacitive discharge), we could calculate the ionic charge that was moved at the electrodes between 0.8 and 0 V, DQ ion , (see Figure  S4 ). With the experimental value of DQ ion , we extract N 0 assuming V bi = 1.2 V using Equation  15 (derived using Equation  12 ): DQ ion = ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi qN 0 e 0 e r V T 8 r ""  15 ) 1 + 16 V bi V T 1=2 À 1 + 16 V bi À V app V T 1=2 # : (Equation Note that the extracted ion concentration is independent of the value of the initial applied voltage (here V app = 0.8 V), as shown in a previous study.  14  Another way of measuring the mobile ion concentration is to resort to Mott-Schottky experiments, which allow capacitance measurements of the vacancy-depleted region (C dl ).  42  Note that the selective contacts are in practice not perfect and part of the voltage drops at the contacts.  15, 43  If we assume $20% of the voltage drops at the contacts, the error on the ion concentration is within $50% as shown in Figure  S5 . This error is on the order of the cell to cell variation in Figure  S4 . In Table  2 , we provide the background ion concentration and the widths of the vacancy-depleted and accumulation regions (w À and w + ) we measured for each composition. Interestingly, the ion concentrations for all of the cells fall in the same range (7 3 10 16 À 5 3 10 17 cm À3 ). Note that we have also measured several devices that show vacancy concentrations > 10 19 cm À3 . However, in general, these devices were fabricated with the p-i-n architecture (instead of the n-i-p architecture reported here) and had low efficiencies. Further investigation is underway to investigate highly efficient devices with different architectures. We remark that the ion concentrations reported here are very similar for perovskite absorbers with and without methylammonium. This suggests that the prevalent mobile ion is not methylammonium but rather halide species (vacancies or interstitials). In addition, for all the compositions, w À $ 83À211 nm and w + $ 6À16 nm. An immediate consequence is that the electric field is confined within 20%-50% of the absorber and drops linearly (Figure  2B ). Therefore, at maximum power point (MPP) for 300-to 500-nm-thick devices, the field in a perovskite solar cell can reach values as high as 8 V/mm at MPP and 55 V/mm at reverse bias (À3 V) at the contacts (Figure  S6 ). In the following, we discuss the implications of this non-uniform and concentrated electric field. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP""}"

And then, the FAI/MABr/MACl solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 1800 rpm for 30 s, followed by pre-annealing inside the N 2 glove box at 90 °C for 1 min and annealing outside the glove box at 150 °C for 10 min with 40% humidity. For the preparation of all-inorganic CsPbI 2 Br perovskite thin film, the precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.5 mM PbI 2 , 0.5 mM PbBr 2 and 1 mM CsI in 250 µL DMSO and 750 µL DMF.

The spin -coated film was heat-treated at 65 °C for 1 min, followed by 260 °C for 10 min. To prepare perovskite thin films with the conjugated organic ammoniums, 5 mM PRA/IPA:CB, PRMA/IPA:CB or PREA/IPA:CB solution was drop casted at 4000 rpm on the as-fabricated perovskite thin film noted above. The volume ratio of IPA and CB is 1:1. The film was annealed at 100 °C for 3 min. Perovskite solar cells were fabricated with the following device structure: indium tin oxide (ITO)/SnO 2 /(FAPbI 3 ) x (MAPbBr 3 ) 1-x /Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag or Au. The ITO glass was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol and treated in ultraviolet-ozone for 20 min.

2376,8_15," Supplementary Text S3 Additional characterizations of perovskite thin film with and without organic ammonium cations Two-dimensional Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (2D-GIWAXS) was performed to gain insights into the structure of the ammoniums on perovskite thin films. As shown in Fig.  S8 , no obvious signal at q z value below 0.9 Å -1 was observed for all the perovskite thin films with different ammoniums, indicating no 2D perovskite was formed in the thin films. We performed grazing angle (~70°) polarization dependent IR reflection absorption to investigate the molecular orientation of the ammonium cations on the surface. In the polarized IR method, the IR light is polarized parallel (s) or perpendicular (p) to the sample surfaces. By taking the difference of (p-s)/(p+s), we could identify molecular orientation component perpendicular to the surfaces. As shown in Fig.  S9 , when PRA, PRMA, PREA are attached to the perovskite surfaces, we observed a peak near 1240 cm -1 , which is possibly related to the C-N stretching. We have also examined near 1700 cm -1 (the C=N stretching in FA) to verify this method is not sensitive to bulk vibration (no peak near 1700 cm -1 ). Therefore, the polarized IR study confirms that the molecular orientation has a perpendicular component to the perovskite surfaces. The thermogravimetric analysis results for the perovskite thin films with PRA is shown in Fig.  S10 . Before the decomposition of perovskite at elevated temperature, there is no observed weight loss from other species, suggesting Pyren-1-aminium iodide did not decompose during the annealing. The significant different in the device performance of PRA-treated samples can be attributed to the mismatched energy level as discussed below. We performed UPS measurements on pure PRA, PRMA, and PREA. As shown in Fig.  S11 , none of these samples showed any signals, confirming the additional peaks observed around the band tail is due to the incorporation of these organic cations. On the other hand, these pyrene molecules are not conductive, so they are detectable in UPS measurement by themselves. This in turn can be regarded as further evidence that the new features observed is due to the incorporation of the cations in the lattice rather than physico-adsorption. Kramer-Kronig transformed transient reflection spectra is shown in Fig.  S12  to provide additional evidence. With the incorporation of PREA, the center of the excitonic bleach, which is related to the band-edge position shows a slight red shift in position. Such a shift can be an evidence showing the PREA slightly changed the band-edge position of perovskites which is consistent with Fig.  1D . The energy diagrams (Fig.  S13 ) of the modified and unmodified perovskite thin films are drawn by the UPS data (Fig.  S14 ). Perovskite surfaces modified with PRMA and PREA showed very similar band diagram. Since the drift current in a solar cell device is correlated with the carrier density, mobility, and the electrical field, the mobility enhancement would make nonnegligible contributions to the improved hole collection probability when the driving forces i.e. the energy offset between perovskite surface and hole transporting layer are quite similar. Time-resolved PL measurements were performed to further study the carrier dynamics of the perovskite thin films. As shown in Fig.  S15 , PREA and PRMA treated thin film showed similar PL decay profile to that of the reference film, indicating similar bulk carrier lifetime and electron-phonon interactions. PRA treated sample exhibited a much faster PL decay, suggesting a prominent carrier transfer, which is consistent with our UPS data showing an increase in the VBM after PRA treatment. This higher VBM resulted in a mismatched energy level with the hole transporting layer (Fig.  S16 ), leading to the significant V oc reduction as observed in the photovoltaic devices. We assessed the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite films prepared with and without the ammoniums by fabricating devices with the ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au configuration. Current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the photovoltaic devices with and without ammoniums are compared in Fig.  3D , and the photovoltaic parameters of best performing devices are summarized in Table  S2 . The PCE of the asfabricated perovskite solar cells with PREA exhibited the largest enhancement from 20.1 % to 23.0% with an obvious increase in the J sc (from 23.90 mA/cm 2 to 24.91 mA/cm 2 ) and FF (from 0.723 to 0.784) due to the largest enhancement of hole mobility. The lower PCE of PRMA based device (20.9%) was consistent with the less improved hole mobility, which could be attributed to the distorted intercalation configuration of the ammoniums generating energy disordering in the lattice. For the PRA based device, instead, a decreased PCE of 19.5% was obtained, due to the significantly reduced V oc (from 1.160 V to 1.066 V), which could be attributed to the unmatched energy level as revealed by the UPS results. (Fig.  S16 ) Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) was conducted to study the effect of the different ammoniums on the optical property of the perovskite films. As shown in Fig.  S18 , no obvious difference in the UV-Vis spectra was observed, which further supports that the enhancement of the photovoltaic performance originates from the improved hole mobility. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""Tin Oxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP""}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""Tin Oxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""pyrene-based ammonium"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""19.5"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.066"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
2383,8_25," Table S1 The extracted mobility from transient reflection kinetics (interaction distance model) and transient THz spectra Sample D ab (cm 2 s -1 ) µ ab The band edges of metal-halide perovskites with a general chemical structure of ABX 3 (A, usually a monovalent organic cation; B, a divalent cation; and X, a halide anion) are constructed mainly of the orbitals from B and X sites. Hence, the structural and compositional varieties of the inorganic B-X framework are primarily responsible for regulating their electronic properties, whereas A-site cations are thought to only help stabilize the lattice and not to directly contribute to near-edge states. We report a p-conjugation-induced extension of electronic states of A-site cations that affects perovskite frontier orbitals. The p-conjugated pyrene-containing A-site cations electronically contribute to the surface band edges and influence the carrier dynamics, with a properly tailored intercalation distance between layers of the inorganic framework. The ethylammonium pyrene increased hole mobilities, improved power conversion efficiencies relative to that of a reference perovskite, and enhanced device stability. (cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) µ DC (cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) µ h (cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) µ e (cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) T he band-edge electronic structure of hybrid metal-halide perovskites (ABX 3 , where A is usually a monovalent organic cation, B is a divalent cation, and X is a halide anion) develops from the orbitals of B and X sites (1) and can be tuned through the compositional and structural flexibility of the B-X framework  (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . By contrast, the A-site cations are generally not thought to directly affect electronic structure near the band edges because their electronic states lie far from the inorganic band edges  (13) . Instead, different A-site cation sizes can induce indirect effects by causing structural deformation of the inorganic B-X framework, such as unit volume variation, octahedral distortion, and dimensional reduction  (14) (15) (16) (17) . We now show that the electronic states of the A-site cations can be extended and directly contribute to the frontier orbitals of the hybrid perovskite through a combination of a large p-conjugated structure and a tailored intercalation distance between layers of the inorganic framework, which provides additional degrees of electronic tunability to near-edge electronic configuration. The carrier dynamics could be rationally tuned in accordance with the device architecture by modifying the A-site organic structure. We designed a polycyclic aromatic tail with large p-conjugation that was attached to an ammonium A-site cation. The chemical structures of the as-synthesized organic cations featured different lengths of the tethering alkylammonium group-namely PRA, PRMA, and PREA for pyrene-based ammonium, methylammonium, and ethylammonium, respectively (Fig.  1A ; see synthesis details in supplementary text S1). When these organic cations were assembled with the inorganic framework, the extent to which the positively charged ammonium head group intercalated into the octahedral cavity depended on the length of the bridging alkyl chain. Electron delocalization in the large conjugated pyrene structure lowered the frontier orbital separation of the organic molecule and enabled orbital overlap with the inorganic moiety  (18) . The alkyl chain length affected the electronic interaction between the two moieties. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy of PRMA and PREA cations assembled onto the surface of the Pb-I framework of a formamidiniumbased perovskite thin film (Fig.  1B ) revealed additional electronic states near the tail of the valence band (the Fermi energy has been aligned for better comparison). However, a perovskite thin film with the PRA moieties attached exhibited similar band-tail characteristics to that of the reference, indicating a lack of electronic contribution from PRA to the surface band edges. First-principles calculations of the partial density of states revealed electronic states near the surface band edges (Fig.  1C ). As the alkyl chain of the ammonium group became longer, the electronic states from the organic components at the valence band were pushed to a higher energy level. The electronic states from PRA were as much as 0.34 eV below the valence band maximum (VBM), but PRMA and PREA had electronic states near the VBM. The distribution of the electronic states of the organic ammonium cations with respect to the inorganic band structure (Fig.  1D ) showed that the orbitals of PRMA and PREA greatly overlapped with the inorganic VBM, with the highest unoccupied orbitals only 0.02 eV below and 0.01 eV above the VBM, respectively. Thus, the band structure of PRA resembled that of the reference film, with the VBM consisting of I 5p and Pb 6s orbitals. However, for PRMA and PREA, the VBM had contributions from the orbitals of both inorganic and organic components. The participation of PRMA and PREA in the surface band-edge construction was also observed in all-inorganic CsPbI 2 Br perovskite (supplementary text S2), indicating the generality of this concept. The discrepancy in the surface band-edge configuration originated from different chemical interaction modes between the inorganic framework and the ammonium cations with different alkyl chain lengths; theoretical modeling of the assembly of these organic ammoniums on the surface of the Pb-I framework is shown in Fig.  2A . We used time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry and grazingangle polarization-dependent infrared reflectionabsorption spectroscopy to verify the vertical assembly of the ammonium cations on the surface (supplementary text S2 and S3). Both PRMA and PREA could anchor into the octahedral cavity through electrostatic interactions between the ammonium cations and the PbI 6 2-octahedra. However, PRMA, which has a shorter alkyl chain length between the ammonium head and the pyrene tail, exhibited a distorted intercalation configuration because of the structural rigidity and pronounced steric hindrance induced by the pyrene ring. The elongated alkyl chain in PREA enabled more flexibility with less steric hindrance and displayed almost vertical intercalation of PREA into the inorganic layers. The conjugated tails of PREA were stacked nearly perpendicular to the plane of the inorganic layer. With a reduction in the length of the tethering alkylammonium group, the orientation of PRMA tilted away from the vertical direction by ~30°, which disrupted the p-p stacking and reduced the electronic delocalization. By contrast, PRA, which lacked a flexible alkyl chain, failed to relieve the steric hindrance of the pyrene group when anchoring into the Pb-I framework. Its binding mode to the inorganic surface would be more accurately described as adsorption rather than anchoring, as also evidenced by the vertically oriented pyrene tail in PRA stacking. With a shallow interaction depth, the steric hindrance from the large pyrene tail no longer affects the intercalation configuration, enabling a molecular orientation driven by the surface energy and p-p stacking. We used attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy to investigate the chemical binding between the organic cations and the Pb-I framework. Difference ATR-FTIR spectra of perovskite films with PRA, PRMA, and PREA with respect to the reference film are shown in Fig.  2B . Distinctive vibration features from the reference and PRA samples were observed in PRMA and PREA samples between 900 to 1100 cm -1 . Both PRMA and PREA showed substantially reduced absorption near 930 cm -1 and increased absorption near 1060 cm -1 , which we attributed to the change of the outof-plane N-H wagging and C-N stretching   ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""Tin Oxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""pyrene-based ammonium"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""40"", ""time"": ""2000"", ""control_pce"": ""19.3"", ""treated_pce"": ""22.4"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.066"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.85"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.6""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""Tin Oxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""ethylammonium pyrene"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""40"", ""time"": ""2000"", ""control_pce"": ""19.3"", ""treated_pce"": ""22.4"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.066"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.85"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.6""}}"

2414,14_3,"INTRODUCTION Metal halide perovskites have experienced a rapid progress in highimpact optoelectronics, with particularly notable advances made in the field of perovskite photovoltaics  (1) (2) (3) . In single-junction devices, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 25.5% have been demonstrated to date  (4) . The record efficiency devices follow the standard device architecture, in which the perovskite active layer is deposited on top of an electron transport layer (ETL) such as titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) or tin oxide (SnO 2 ) and is then coated with a hole transport layer (HTL)  (5) (6) (7) . Despite tremendous interest in inverted architecture perovskite solar cells-in which the order of charge extracting layers is inversed-the PCE of these devices lags behind, with maximum values rarely approaching 23%  (8, 9) . For a detailed overview over the recent progress in inverted architecture perovskite solar cells, the readers are referred to several excellent reviews on the topic  (10, 11) . The generally lower performance of inverted architecture perovskite solar cells is mainly associated with a reduced current extraction and nonradiative recombination losses that limit the device photovoltage and fill factor (FF)  (12, 13) . The development of strategies to overcome these limitations has been subject to intense research, including interface and bulk passivation of traps, such as crystallographic defects, point defects, or higher-dimensional defects (at grain boundaries)  (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) . Predominantly, these approaches led to an improvement in device performance due to increased open-circuit voltage (V OC ), with FFs remaining in the range of 75 to 80%. This highlights the need to develop new methods that would simultaneously improve the V OC and the FF of inverted architecture devices. Here, we demonstrate an innovative strategy for the dual modification of both the HTL/perovskite and perovskite/ ETL interfaces by introducing a series of large organic cations (Fig.  1A ): 2-phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI), 4-chlorophenylethylammonium iodide (Cl-PEAI), and 4-fluorophenylethylammonium iodide (F-PEAI) in both these interfaces. Despite this class of cations being commonly used for the formation of low-dimensional perovskites  (23) (24) (25) (26) , in our work, we adopt a different strategy and use a very low concentration to modify both interfaces of inverted perovskite solar cells. We find that this approach does not change the bulk perovskite crystal structure or its dimensionality but rather improves the interfaces by facilitating high-quality film formation on top of the HTL and inducing efficient defect passivation at the perovskite/ETL interface. We show that the modification of the buried bottom interface leads to a more homogeneous film formation and the elimination of nanovoids at the perovskite/HTL interface. These improvements result in a significant increase in the FF accompanied by a small increase in the shortcircuit current (J SC ). The modification of the top perovskite surface, on the other hand, leads to its efficient passivation, resulting in a substantial increase in the V OC . The implementation of both modifications at the same time results in a simultaneous increase in all of the photovoltaic parameters leading to a superior device performance. As a result, we achieve a high PCE of 23.7%, with a net improvement of device V OC up to 1.184 V and very high FF of 85%. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""fluorophenylethylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""23.7"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.184"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
2416,14_5," Dual interfacial modification approach In developing the approach for the dual optimization of the perovskite active layer interfaces, we focused on integrating the modification into deposition steps that are already present in the device fabrication of reference devices. In the case of the HTL/perovskite interface, the highly hydrophobic nature of poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) amine] (PTAA)  (27, 28)  HTL makes it necessary to perform a prewashing step before the deposition of the perovskite precursor solution in which the solvent N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) is spin-coated atop the PTAA layer  (29) . This has been shown to improve the wettability of the perovskite precursor solution on PTAA, allowing for the formation of the perovskite active layer. To modify this interface, we introduce the various PEAI cations (Fig.  1A ) into the DMF solution used for the prewash step at a 20 mM concentration. Following the prewash step that either contains (HTL-modified) or does not contain (reference) the PEAI cation, the perovskite solution is deposited as previously reported using the solvent engineering approach  (30) . To trigger the crystallization of the perovskite layer, an antisolvent is dispensed onto the 2 of 9 perovskite solution shortly before the end of the spin-coating step. For the modification of the top surface (ETL-modified), we introduce the PEAI cations into the antisolvent at a low concentration of 0.5 mM and complete the layer fabrication by thermal annealing. These steps are schematically summarized in Fig.  1B . Considering that each of the modifications can be introduced on its own, we used this approach to fabricate four types of devices (Fig.  1C ): reference, HTL-modified, ETL-modified, and dual HTL + ETLmodified, which enable us to study the effect of each interface separately. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""fluorophenylethylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""23.7"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.184"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""PTAA"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""fluorophenylethylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""23.7"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.184"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
2417,14_8," Combined interfacial modification of both interfaces Having examined the effects on each interface separately, it is important to explore whether both modifications can be combined in a single device. To test this, dual modified perovskite solar cells were fabricated and characterized (fig.  S11 ). We observe that dual modified devices combine the improvements observed at each interface, resulting in a number of devices with PCE above 22% and a maximum value of 23%. Moreover, for such a dual interfacial modification to find broad use in inverted architecture solar cells, its efficacy needs to be examined in combination with a modification of the bulk of the perovskite layer  (38, 39) . For example, recent reports suggest that the introduction of ionic liquids into the perovskite active layer can significantly increase their stability  (40) (41) (42) . To explore this, we fabricated photovoltaic devices that combine both interfacial optimizations shown above along with the introduction of an ionic liquid (piperidinium salt [BMP] + [BF 4 ] -) into the perovskite active layer. Figure  4  (A to D) displays the photovoltaic parameters of the devices. In addition, in this case, we observe that both interfacial modifications can be successfully combined to increase simultaneously the V OC , J SC , and FF of the devices. The V OC of the F-PEAI and Cl-PEAI devices was particularly high, reaching a maximum of 1.184 V. Similarly, the FF of these devices was also higher, reaching a maximum of 85%. Together, these improvements have led to high PCE reaching a maximum of 23.7% for the F-PEAImodified device (Fig.  4E ). The photovoltaic performance of the champion devices of each type is summarized in Table  1 . Devices fabricated using F-PEAI cations consistently outperformed those made using the other derivatives. We believe that this is associated with the fact that a larger quantity of F-PEAI remains at both the HTL and ETL interface as evidenced, for example, by the higher atomic % of F at both these interfaces as compared to Cl. We propose that this is associated with differences in the solubility of the PEAI cations. We observe that F-PEAI cations are less soluble in the antisolvent (fig.  S12 ), thus they will precipitate of solution earlier during the drying process of the antisolvent, thus resulting in a larger overall amount remaining on the surface. We note that the biggest contribution to the increased performance comes from the increase in V OC . This is also evident from PLQE and electroluminescence QE (ELQE) measurements performed on  S C I E N C E A D V A N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E 6 of 9 representative solar cells (Fig.  4, F  and G ). The PLQE of reference devices is very low at 0.14%. On the other hand, F-PEAI-modified devices reach a value of ~1%. Similarly, the ELQE of the devices is increased by a factor of ~4 at current injection equivalent to J SC , confirming a significant decrease in nonradiative losses in the dual modified devices (see fig.  S13  for J-V-L measurements). The minor increase in J SC is consistent with an improved charge extraction due to the more homogeneous, void-free perovskite/PTAA interface. This is also supported by our observation that the dependence of V OC and J SC on light intensity is not affected by the dual interfacial modification, as both the reference and the modified device (fig.  S14,  A  and B ) display the same slope, thus suggesting that the bulk recombination in both cases is very similar. However, examining the photocurrent decay (fig.  S14C ) shows that it is faster in the case of the modified device, suggesting an improved charge extraction. The integration of ionic liquids into the active layer leads to an excellent stability of the dual passivated devices. For example, Fig.  4H  displays the evolution of the PCE of both the reference and PEAI cation dual modified devices under continuous illumination in N 2 . It can be seen that the reference device is very stable, maintaining 90% of its initial performance after 2000 min of continuous illumination. The dual passivated devices, however, are even more stable, maintaining their original performance for the entire duration of the experiment. Examining the evolution of all the photovoltaic parameters (fig.  S15 ) reveals that the loss in the performance of the reference device originates from a loss in J SC , possibly as a result of degradation at the perovskite/HTL interface mediated by the presence of nanovoids at that interface  (30) . No deterioration in any of the photovoltaic parameters is observed for any of the dual modified devices. The observation that the dual interfacial modification approach developed here is fully compatible with the integration of ionic liquids into the perovskite active layer is highly promising for the application of this methodology for further development of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells in an inverted architecture. It is important to explore the applicability of the dual modification approach for the fabrication of other types of inverted architecture solar cells. The increasing recent interest in methylammonium (MA)-free perovskite compositions  (9, 43, 44)  motivated us to examine whether the performance of Cs 0.1 FA 0.9 PbI 2.9 Br 0.1 inverted architecture solar cells can also be enhanced by dual modification with PEAI cations. Figure  S16  displays the photovoltaic performance of the devices, which, similar to the results on triple cation perovskite solar cells, exhibit a significant improvement in all of their photovoltaic parameters. These results confirm that the approach can be easily translated to the fabrication of inverted architecture solar cells based on other perovskite compositions. It is of potential interest to investigate whether the dual modification approach can be applied also to standard architecture photovoltaic devices. To preliminarily examine this, we fabricated devices with the architecture glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/SnO 2 /perovskite/ SpiroOMeTAD/Au and performed the same interfacial modification procedure as described above with the PEAI cation. The photovoltaic results show that, while not fully optimized, the dual modified device performs significantly better than the reference ones (fig.  S17 ), particularly due to an enhancement in their V OC and FF. This suggests that our approach can be applicable also to standard architecture solar cells. The observation that the dual modification approach can significantly increase the FF of the devices can be particularly useful in the case of large-area solar cells, which are known to suffer from low FFs  (45) . To investigate this, we fabricated devices with an area of  S C I E N C E A D V A N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E 7 of 9 70 mm 2 , significantly larger than the small-area devices shown above (4.5 mm 2 ). We find that the dual modification approach is entirely applicable to large-area devices, with significant enhancements observed in all the photovoltaic parameters as compared to the reference device (fig.  S18  and table  S3 ). We observe a major increase in the FF of the devices, suggesting that our approach can be used also for the fabrication of large-area solar cells. In summary, we present a dual interfacial modification approach by integrating large organic cations at both the electron and HTL interfaces. We find that modification of the bottom interface leads to an improved wettability, which eliminates the formation of nanovoids at the interface with the HTL. The modification of the top perovskite surface leads to its efficient passivation and a reduction in nonradiative recombination losses. These two different mechanisms for improved photovoltaic performance can be combined to achieve a simultaneous improvement in all the photovoltaic parameters. Moreover, the dual modification approach can be easily combined with the incorporation of ionic liquids into the perovskite active layer, thus leading to both efficient and stable devices, reaching a maximum power conversion efficiency of 23.7%. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""PCBM"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""PTAA"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""fluorophenylethylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""23.7"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.184"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Cs 0.1 FA 0.9 PbI 2.9 Br 0.1"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""PCBM"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""PTAA"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""chlorophenylethylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""33"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""23.7"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.184"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""1"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.9""}}"
2418,14_10," Perovskite film preparation and device fabrication Prepatterned ITO/glass substrates were sequentially cleaned with acetone and 2-propanol (IPA) by ultrasonication for 15 min in each solvent. The ITO/glass substrates were then dried with N 2 and treated with oxygen plasma at 100 mW for 10 min. The HTL and the perovskite films were fabricated in a drybox (relative humidity (RH) <1%), while the ETL and the contacts were deposited inside a glovebox filled with inert atmosphere N 2 . For reference devices, an HTL of ∼10nm thickness made of PTAA with a concentration of 1.5 mg ml -1 dissolved in toluene was spin-coated at a speed of 2000 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 100°C for 10 min. After the annealing step, the samples were washed by DMF by spin-coating it on the prepared PTAA films at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The perovskite precursor solution (1.2 M) contained mixed cations (Pb, Cs, FA, and MA) and halides (I and Br) dissolved in a solvent mixture (DMF/DMSO = 4/1) according to a formula of Cs 0.05 (FA 5/6 MA 1/6 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 with an excess of PbI 2 of 1%. For devices containing an ionic liquid, a piperidinium salt [BMP] + [BF 4 ] -was dissolved in the perovskite solution at a molar ratio of 0.25 mole percent. The perovskite layer was deposited via a two-step spin-coating procedure with 1000 rpm for 12 s and 5000 rpm for 27 s. A mixture of antisolvents [chlorobenzene (CB)/IPA = 9/1, 150 l] was dripped on the spinning substrate during the 21 s of the second spin-coating step. Subsequently, the samples were annealed at 100°C for 30 min. The ETLs were dynamically deposited from a PC 61 BM solution (20 mg/ml in CB) and spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at the speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s (with a ramping speed of 1000 rpm/s) and annealed for 10 min at 100°C. Next, thin layers of BCP (0.5 mg/ml in IPA) were spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s (with a ramping rate of 1000 rpm/s) as hole blocking layers. The small-area devices with an area of 4.5 mm 2 were completed by thermally evaporating of Ag (80 nm). For large-area devices, Ag electrodes with an area of 70 mm 2 were thermally evaporated. The devices with modified interfaces were prepared by dissolving a small amount of the PEAI-cations in DMF (20 mM) used for washing the PTAA and in the mixture CB/ IPA (0.5 mM) used in the antisolvent step. For the fabrication of MAfree perovskite solar cells, a 1.1 M Cs 0.1 FA 0.9 PbI 2.9 Br 0.1 perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving powders of CsI, FAI, PbI 2 , and PbBr 2 in the molar ratio of 2:18:19:1 in 4:1 (v/v) DMF/DMSO. All other device fabrication steps were unchanged. Standard architecture devices were fabricated using the glass/ ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au architecture. SnO 2 nanoparticles (15% in a H 2 O colloidal dispersion, Alfa Aesar) were diluted in deionized water with the volume ratio of 1:2. The prepared SnO 2 solution was spin-coated on clean ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s. After annealing the samples at 180°C for 30 min in ambient air, the substrates were treated by UV ozone for 15 min and transferred into a drybox [<1% relative humidity (RH)] for further use. The perovskite layer was deposited as described above. Spiro-OMeTAD (99.8%; Borun New Material Technology Co. Ltd.) was dissolved in CB (80 mg/ml) with 28.8 l of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 l of Li-TFSI solution (520 mg/ml in acetonitrile) and spin-coated on top of the perovskite layer.

2429,96_4,"Introduction Hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells are swiftly emerging as standalone photovoltaic technology. Since the first study by Kojima et al., the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has undergone rapid improvement from 3.8% to over 23% in under a decade of development.  [1] [2] [3]  The high efficiency attained from perovskite materials is due to their excellent optoelectronic properties, which were optimized by adjusting the composition and ratio of cations and anions within the perovskite lattice.  4, 5  These compositionally engineered, photoactive perovskite layers can be deposited using either one or two step solution processable methods.  [6] [7] [8] 15, 22  In addition to the perovskite composition, the horizon of research has expanded to enhancing the electron transporting layer (ETL),  [9] [10] [11]  perovskite absorber and hole transporting layers (HTL)  12, 13  and implementing scalable fabrication techniques.  14  For TiO 2 based ETLs, relatively high resistivity is known to cause insufficient charge separation at the compact TiO 2 (c-TiO 2 )/perovskite interface.  [16] [17] [18]  Therefore, an additional layer of mesoporous TiO 2 (mp-TiO 2 ) is usually adopted to complement the deficient charge collection.  [16] [17] [18]  Recently, SnO 2 based electron transporting layers have been extensively used due to SnO 2 's high conductivity and superior charge collection ability compared to TiO 2 ETLs.  [19] [20] [21]  SnO 2 has a wide bandgap ranging between 3.6 and 4.1 eV, and its favourable conduction band edge in relation to perovskites makes SnO 2 a good candidate to overcome challenges which occur particularly with c-TiO 2 ETLs.  23  Previously, low-temperature processes were mostly used to form SnO 2 layers to avoid pin-holes on an FTO or ITO substrate with a rough film surface. However, the metal-like nature shown in degenerate semiconductors, i.e., the carrier density of non-doped SnO 2 is ca. 10 20 cm À3 (in the range of semimetals), seems to generate another serious shunting pathway, decreasing the fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (V oc ).  25, 26  We have demonstrated previously that the low PCE is due to the deteriorated hole-blocking ability of the SnO 2 ETL caused by loss of self-passivating materials such as SnOCl 2 and residual precursor of tetrakis-dimethyl-amine-tin (TDMASn).  21, 24  By using different precursors and depositing them with various techniques such as spin-coating and atomic layer deposition methods, we proved the advantages of the low-temperature process are not limited to preventing pin-holes but also include electrically passivating the SnO 2 ETL.  21, 24  In this work, we investigated the film and device performance for planar-type perovskite solar cells using tin acetylacetonate based precursors for SnO 2 . To better understand the role of halides, one of the chosen precursors is halide-free and two are based on chloride and bromide respectively. The optimized devices achieved a high efficiency of 22.19% in a small-size cell and 16.73% in a large area 15 cm 2 module. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""NOTE:Assume tinacetylacetonate is additive"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
2431,96_7," Paper Energy & Environmental Science To evaluate the compatibility for the ETL, we measured the photoluminescence (PL) of the bi-layered electron transporting layer (BETL)/perovskite films as seen in Fig.  3a . Despite differences in the PL intensity, all BETLs show a faster electron quenching efficiency than the c-TiO 2 film. According to the result, Acac shows the fastest quenching rate, and Cl 2 and Br 2 show slightly slower electron transfer as indicated by the PL peaks. Therefore, a higher PCE was expected with the Acac devices, but the device performance demonstrated in Fig.  3b  shows that the trend of the PL measurement does not match well with the device efficiency. The highest PCE is gained from the Cl 2 precursor due to the contribution of enhanced FF and V oc . For Br 2 , the high V oc is promising. However, the Br 2 devices show a relatively low FF and a slightly lower short-circuit current density ( J sc ) than c-TiO 2 . Unlike the PL result, we found that the Acac precursor may not contribute to distinct efficiency enhancement. To explain this observation, we utilized scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to examine the surface morphology of SnO 2 fabricated with Acac. The full-size image of the complete cells is shown in Fig.  S3 (ESI † ). Moreover, we performed absorbance and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) on SnO 2 samples spin-coated with perovskite as seen in Fig.  S4 (ESI † ) and examined the perovskite surface morphologies with SEM as seen in Fig.  S5 (ESI † ). The absorbance, XRD pattern and SEM imaging confirm that the perovskite films deposited on SnO 2 have roughly similar thickness and morphology regardless of the SnO 2 precursor. However, in the cross-sectional SEM images in Fig.  S5 (ESI † ), the Cl 2 and Br 2 films clearly show an increase in the SnO 2 film thickness. However, for the Acac devices, there is no observable increase of the ETL thickness when compared with the c-TiO 2 SEM cross-sectional image. Fig.  S6 (ESI † ) shows SEM top-view images of c-TiO 2 and c-TiO 2 /PTO films formed on the FTO substrate. The magnified images show all SnO 2 precursors form a thin and similarly uniform top layer over the c-TiO 2 underlayer. However, different film morphology can be observed for the SnO 2 prepared with Acac when the magnification is increased. Randomly distributed big particles potentially caused by the aggregation of the precursor are detected on the film surface. The particle sizes range from 1 to 2 mm in diameter and induce huge bumps on the perovskite film as seen in Fig.  S7  (ESI †). The poor morphology in Acac films could be due to the meta-stability of the tin oxidation state. For Acac, the Sn 2+ metal center is four coordinate with two bidentate acetylacetonate ligands. While for Cl 2 and Br 2 , the Sn 4+ metal atom is six coordinate with two bidentate acetylacetonate ligands and two monodentate halogen ligands. In this configuration, Sn 4+ is more likely to be stable in a DMF solution, unlike the case with Sn 2+ , which could be oxidized more readily in DMF. In a preliminary test, we found that Acac dissolves easily in DMF and forms a transparent solution, but starts to precipitate in a couple of hours as seen in Fig.  S7 (ESI † ). Whereas for Cl 2 and Br 2 dissolved in DMF, the solutions do not lose transparency over a month. For Acac, the bumps observed in Fig.  S7 (ESI † ) could potentially provide a shunting route particularly for planar-type cells by forming a thin PTO layer which increases the possibility of pinhole formation. These findings indicate that there are complex challenges associated with Acac in terms of film reproducibility and performance. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was further performed to characterize the Cl 2 and Br 2 films. Strong peaks at 486 and 494 eV attributed to Sn 4+ ions indicate the formation of SnO 2 as seen in Fig.  3d . A weak asymmetry shown in all spectra can be explained by Sn 2+ ions originating from oxygen vacancies (V oc ) on the SnO 2 surface, which are assumed to be the origin of the high conductivity of the SnO 2 film.  24  Strong asymmetry of the spectra indicating the presence of sub-bonds is also observed in the O 1s region (Fig.  3e ), which is associated with the binding energy for the O-S bond (Sn 4+ ) with higher intensity at 529.2 eV. The smaller peak at 530.5 eV can be associated with oxygen impurities such as OH ligands and water adsorption on the film.  27  In addition, we found a small peak assigned to Cl 2p at 197 eV from the Cl 2 film, and a strong peak of Br 3d at 68 eV from the Br 2 film. This is in good agreement with the result of EDX analysis in Fig.  S1  (ESI †). For the Cl 2 film, when varying the annealing temperature, the highest intensity peak of the film slightly decreases from 100 1C to 180 1C annealing. Moreover, the Cl bond peak is still present at 220 1C but is significantly minimized. A similar trend is observed from the Br 2 film, however, it is noteworthy that the intensity of the Br 3d peak remains strong even when annealing at 220 1C. To find the optimal annealing temperature, we carefully prepared SnO 2 films between 160 1C and 350 1C for Cl 2 and Br 2 . Fig.  4a  shows a statistical summary of the device efficiency with respect to temperature. The best PCE is found at 200 1C for Cl 2 , while the highest PCE is obtained at 220 1C for the Br 2 device. It should be noted that the Br 2 devices show a relatively gentle drop of PCEs at high temperatures while the Cl 2 devices demonstrate a steep decrease after the maximum value. Both devices show a rapid increase of J sc according to the ramping of the temperatures until the maximum J sc is reached (close to 24 mA cm À2 at 200 1C). An analogous trend is observed in the FF. Although a high FF is shown with the 160 1C devices, we found a severe drop of electron transfer as seen in Fig.  S8 (ESI † ). Here, it is noteworthy to remember the film formation of the tin oxide layer from SnCl 4 and other chloride-based precursors.  18, 19  Unlike Cl 2 /Br 2 precursors in DMF, SnCl 4 immediately reacts with H 2 O to form SnO 2 nanoparticles and amorphous SnOCl 2 which are not reversibly dissolved in water, indicating the solution is in fact colloidal.  18  As with water-based colloidal SnO 2 precursors i.e., AlfaAesar 15% SnO 2 , an impressively low temperature processing is required, 150 1C.  20  However, surface passivation can potentially occur by SnOCl 2 and base sources potentially added for stable dispersion of the colloid, i.e. NaOH, KOH,  28  if SnO 2 nanoparticles are synthesized using chlorine based tin precursors (Fig.  S9, ESI † ). Therefore, despite a lower device performance, the film contains more crystalline SnO 2 , therefore no current loss (decrease of J sc ) is found despite film drying at 100 1C. However, the Cl 2 /Br 2 precursors do not visibly react with DMF and sustain their solution form, which means smaller or fewer SnO 2 crystallites can be formed at low temperatures, and more residual precursor exists on the film, which can cause higher series resistance at low-temperature annealing. This explains the reason for the different behaviour shown in Fig.  4a  and b . With the same reason, a high V oc is measured for the 160 1C film probably caused by electron accumulation. An unexpected result is found from the V oc trend of the Br 2 devices. A gradual drop of V oc is seen when increasing the annealing temperature beyond 250 1C. Nevertheless, the Br 2 devices maintain a V oc over 1.1 V even at 350 1C. This result implies that the bromide residue is more strongly bound to the film than the chloride counterpart, even at exceptionally high annealing temperature. Further statistical comparison with mp-TiO 2 based cells is summarized in Fig.  S10 (ESI † ). To supplement this analogy thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted and is displayed in Fig.  4b . For both Cl 2 and Br 2 the precursors start to lose weight at ca. 150 1C, mainly attributed to thermal decomposition. For Cl 2 , roughly 90% of weight is lost by crystallization at 250 1C, followed by a gradual weight drop implying complete removal of Cl on the film. Br 2 shows rather slower weight loss, and the conversion to SnO 2 appears to finish roughly at 300 1C. The subsequent drop that goes up to 500 1C can be attributed to removal of residual Br. Considering Cl sublimes more easily than Br, this finding is reasonable. The TGA curves further support the result and agree well with the EDX and XPS results. J-V curves at the optimal conditions are depicted in Fig.  4c . PTO layers clearly show better PCEs. The highest PCE of 21.12% is obtained from Cl 2 . A bit lower PCE is measured with Br 2 , but it also shows a high PCE over 20%, which is still higher than that with a single c-TiO 2 ETL. We confirmed the optimized bi-layered c-TiO 2 /PTO layers show lower PL emission than the 180 1C films (Fig.  4d ). We measured the reflectance of the films, and the optical bandgap (E g ) was calculated by applying the Kubelka-Munk (F(R)) method  27  by plotting (F(R) Â hn) 2 as a function of energy. Subsequently, an E g of 3.92 and 3.93 eV for Cl 2 and Br 2 respectively was estimated (Fig.  4e ). Fermi-levels (E f ) were measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), confirming that both Cl 2 and Br 2 films have the same E f of 4.21 eV. The E g and E f estimations imply that the Cl 2 and Br 2 films possess similar optical and electronic properties. Additionally, the c-TiO 2 /Cl 2 ETL was tested for a monolithic series module, and a 16.73% PCE was obtained with a 15 cm 2 aperture area (Fig.  S11, ESI † ). The champion small cell was fabricated using a two-step deposition method for the perovskite.  15  The best device seen in Fig.  5a  shows promising photovoltaic values in a planar structure with a J sc of 24.78 mA cm À2 , a V oc of 1.13 V, a FF of 0.79, and a PCE of 22.19% under 1 sunlight illumination conditions when scanned backward. With forward scanning, the values are slightly lower, and very small J-V curve hysteresis is measured in a planartype device. We assume the better PCE is from extended light absorption and enhanced perovskite film quality as seen in the EQE and SEM top-view images (Fig.  S12  and S13, ESI †). We confirmed the J sc value from the solar simulator agrees with the calculated J sc . The device shows excellent performance in the stabilized condition measurement (Fig.  5b ).

Film and device fabrication FTO glass substrates (Nippon sheet glass) were sequentially cleaned with detergent and ethanol. A compact TiO 2 layer was coated by spray pyrolysis deposition on the cleaned FTO substrates heated at 450 1C. SnO 2 layers are prepared by spin- coating a precursor solution of tin acetylacetonate based pre- cursors dissolved in dimethylformamide. 0.1 M SnCl 4 aqueous solution was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 10 s on the substrates to get a B20 nm thickness. Then the substrates were transferred onto a hotplate and heated between 160 1C and 350 1C for 1 h and cooled down.

Then the solution was spin coated on the SnO 2 substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and a mixture solution of FAI : MABr : MACl (80 : 10 : 10 mg in 1 mL IPA) was spin coated on the PbI 2 substrate at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Films were annealed at 150 1C for 25 min and 100 1C for 30 min. Finally, spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 25 s.

2441,94_2,"Small molecules, such as Spiro-OMeTAD, are widely used in photovoltaic devices including perovskite and dye-sensitized solar cells due to their excellent hole transport properties. However, this kind of small molecule is often used with hygroscopic additives and dopants suffering from aggregation and demixing under environmental stress and thus leading to pinholes/voids in the resultant films. By using typical molecular Spiro-OMeTAD as an example, we herein introduced a hydrophobic polymeric poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) component to substantially reduce the undesired pinholes during device fabrication and operation. It leads to a significant improvement of the long-term stability of devices, which kept 80% of their original PCE for over 6000 h in ambient air and the promotion of light stability. In addition, P4VP can saturate uncoordinated Pb sites in perovskite crystals, resulting in improved device performance (certified PCE of 20.6%) with negligible hysteresis.

2442,94_3,"Introduction Organic-inorganic halide perovskites have attracted tremendous attention in the photovoltaic eld due to their excellent optoelectronic properties including a high absorption coefficient, 1,2 long charge carrier lifetime,  3, 4  low trap density, 5 lowcost fabrication  6  and so on. With the continuous efforts from all over the world, the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have increased dramatically from 3.8% to a certied 23.7%.  2, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]  Among all architectures, particularly regular (n-i-p) structured PSCs were extensively developed due to their simple fabrication and high efficiency.  [13] [14] [15]  A great deal of effort has been devoted into the exploration of ideal hole transport layer (HTL) materials, including polymers, small molecules, and inorganic species. Inorganic HTLs, mainly represented by CuI,  16  CuSCN 17 and NiO,  18  possess the advantages of both high mobility and low cost. However, it is difficult to deposit these inorganic HTLs on the top of perovskite materials without their damage and interaction, as the corresponding fabrication processes are mostly incompatible with the absorber underneath.  19  Polymeric materials such as commercial PTAA  [20] [21] [22]  and P3HT  [23] [24] [25]  can be well deposited on the perovskite layer. Due to their relatively low conductivity and consequently ultra-small thickness, they require perovskite lms with great wettability, which makes the resulting solar cells rarely achieve a similar reproducibility level to that of the state-of-the-art device.  26  Small molecules are another class of HTLs that have been successfully used in perovskite solar cells due to their excellent photoelectric properties and the ease of processing. However, as an interlayer between the perovskite and electrode, these small molecules are not only required to transport holes but also are desired to be dense enough to retard the invasion of ambient small molecules (especially H 2 O and O 2 ), as well as ion diffusion between the perovskite components and electrode, which are crucial to efficient and stable PSCs. Among small-molecule organic HTLs, Spiro-OMeTAD (Spiro) represents the most superb HTL because of its suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and excellent hole-extraction and transportation abilities.  27  Most of the stateof-art PSC devices are designed by using Spiro as the HTL.  11  However, as a small molecule, it is hard for Spiro to form pinhole free and uniform thin lms during spin coating due to its amorphous nature and the immiscibility of the Li-TFSI. The presence of pinholes largely deteriorates the optoelectronic properties and long-term stability of the resulting device. In addition, the conductivity of Spiro fails to meet the requirement for high performance devices. Therefore, most of the studies adopted a certain amount of Li-TFSI and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) as effective additives/dopants 28 into Spiro to improve its conductivity. Unfortunately, these additives are highly hygroscopic, and can adsorb ambient moisture to segregate in the Spiro lm, which results in extra pinholes in the doped lm. These pinholes may allow small molecular species (such as H 2 O and O 2 ) in ambient air to invade the entire device, which leads to further degradation of PSCs. Meanwhile, the volatile species in the perovskite lm such as CH 3 NH 2 and HI could easily diffuse out via the pinholes to interact with electrodes,  29  leading to the formation of metal halides that corrode the electrodes.  30  In view of the disadvantages of Spiro, some reports have accordingly prepared pinhole-free Spiro by changing the solvent from the commonly used chlorobenzene to chloroform,  29, 31  or deposited Spiro lms via vacuum evaporation, to improve the long-term stability of related devices.  32  These methods only work with Spiro lms without additives, while for lms with additives, a large number of pinholes are generated due to water adsorption and accumulation during device operation, inducing further degradation. Therefore, preventing pinhole formation in Spiro layers under outdoor operating conditions is a key challenge to achieve long-term stable PSCs based on small-molecule HTLs. Here, by using Spiro as an example, we rst proposed a simple approach to greatly improve the lm quality of small molecule HTLs and the resulting long-term stability of the device. By introducing a long chain hydrophobic polymer poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) into the Spiro precursor solution, we successfully smoothed, strengthened and reduced the pinholes in the as-deposited HTL during the lm deposition. Meanwhile, the pinhole formation caused by the water absorption of additives during device storage in high humidity was effectively suppressed, as is clearly revealed by in situ optical microscopy measurement. Non-encapsulated P4VP modied PSCs exhibit better long-term stability in ambient air (about 25-50% relative humidity) and retain 80% of their original PCE for over 6000 h storage. In addition, the efficiency of the PSC based on P4VP was elevated to be 20.6% (certied) with negligible hysteresis, since P4VP can effectively passivate the under-coordinated Pb in the perovskite lms. These ndings highlight the effective HTL modication by suitable molecules for both better long-term stability and improved photovoltaic performance of PSCs. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""polymeric poly(4-vinylpyridine)"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""6000"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""20.6"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.8""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""polymeric poly(4-vinylpyridine)"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""25-50"", ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""6000"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""20.6"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.8""}}"
2452,113_2,"Supplementary Fig.  3 . 2D GI-WAXD images at the full depth of the X-ray incident angle for a perovskite layer with an approximately 500 nm thickness. Supplementary Table  1  Decay Fitting Parameters determined from the TR-PL curves of Extended Data Fig. τavg was calculated using eq (1) 𝜏 𝑎𝑣𝑔 = In perovskite solar cells, the interfaces between the perovskite and charge-transporting layers contain high concentrations of defects (about 100 times that within the perovskite layer), specifically, deep-level defects, which substantially reduce the power conversion efficiency of the devices  [1] [2] [3]  . Recent efforts to reduce these interfacial defects have focused mainly on surface passivation  [4] [5] [6]  . However, passivating the perovskite surface that interfaces with the electron-transporting layer is difficult, because the surface-treatment agents on the electron-transporting layer may dissolve while coating the perovskite thin film. Alternatively, interfacial defects may not be a concern if a coherent interface could be formed between the electron-transporting and perovskite layers. Here we report the formation of an interlayer between a SnO 2 electron-transporting layer and a halide perovskite light-absorbing layer, achieved by coupling Cl-bonded SnO 2 with a Cl-containing perovskite precursor. This interlayer has atomically coherent features, which enhance charge extraction and transport from the perovskite layer, and fewer interfacial defects. The existence of such a coherent interlayer allowed us to fabricate perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 25.8 per cent (certified 25.5 per cent)under standard illumination. Furthermore, unencapsulated devices maintained about 90 per cent of their initial efficiency even after continuous light exposure for 500 hours. Our findings provide guidelines for designing defect-minimizing interfaces between metal halide perovskites and electron-transporting layers. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) consist of α-formamidinium lead tri-iodide (FAPbI 3 ) perovskite sandwiched between charge-separation and charge-transporting layers. The high efficiency of PSCs is achieved by efficient charge extraction and transport without non-radiative recombination at the charge-selective interface with the uniform perovskite layer  [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]  . Recombination at interfaces may be reduced by minimizing the interfacial area between the perovskite and charge-transport layers. For smaller interfacial areas, planar electron-transporting layers (ETLs) and coated, very flat perovskite thin films are essential. A planar configuration is also required to achieve excellent charge extraction and transfer at the interface with low interfacial recombination loss  12  . PSCs with planar electrodes have primarily been studied using a SnO 2 ETL, because of the many advantages of SnO 2 , such as a high electron mobility and good energy-level alignment with perovskite and electrodes  13  . SnO 2 for planar PSCs has been deposited using various methods, including thermal oxidation of Sn(iv) isopropoxide  14  , deposition of SnO 2 nanoparticles  13  , atomic layer deposition  15  and chemical bath deposition  10, 16  . In addition to these methods of depositing SnO 2 electrodes, numerous studies have been conducted to reduce the interfacial recombination losses through surface passivation and to control the energy level and increase charge transport by doping  12  . Interfacial passivation may further reduce non-radiative recombination between the perovskite and charge-transporting layers  17  . Passivation of the perovskite surface with long organic salts has been shown to substantially reduce interfacial defects between the hole-transporting layer (HTL) and FAPbI 3 perovskite  4, 18  . SnO x -Cl colloids derived from Sn(iv)Cl 4 solution have been reported  19  to form methylammonium tin iodide (MA 2 SnI 6 ) and SnO 2 , with spontaneous exchange reactions between Cl -and I -ions when methylammonium iodide (MAI) co-existed. It has also been reported that a perovskite precursor containing Cl -ions resulted in a large number of Cl -ions being retained at the interface between the perovskite and ETL electrode  20, 21  . We thus note that when the halogen-bonded SnO 2 and the perovskite precursor come into contact they form a chemically interconnected interface. Here we report the formation of a coherent interlayer between a perovskite thin film and a Cl-bonded SnO 2 (Cl-bSO) electrode coated with a Cl-containing FAPbI 3 perovskite precursor (Cl-cPP) solution. We explore the presence of this interlayer by using the surface-sensitive grazing-incident X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), synchrotron-based grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GI-WAXD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). From these analytical characterizations, we infer the formation of a crystalline FASnCl x phase as an atomically coherent interlayer between the perovskite and SnO 2 . This interlayer between the perovskite and ETL reduces the interfacial charge recombination loss and contact resistance, enabling the fabrication of a PSC with a power conversion efficiency of 25.8%. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Cl-contained formamidinium lead iodide"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""Cl-bonded SnO 2"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""500"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.8"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.9""}}"
2453,113_3," Interlayer formation Figure  1a  depicts multilayered thin films of ETL (n), perovskite (i) and HTL (p), along with an interlayer formed by the reaction between the Cl-cPP solution and a Cl-bSO ETL. Energy levels based on experimental  22, 23  and theoretical (Supplementary Fig.  1 ) values for each component in the n-i-p architecture are also shown. We expected the interlayer to play a part in substantially reducing the back-recombination of extracted carriers that remain in the interfacial region, without greatly disturbing the carrier transport of photogenerated electrons. One of the main roles of the ETL on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) is to effectively block the holes generated by light absorption of the perovskite while transferring electrons quickly across the interface between the ETL and perovskite. This means that the ETL must be densely coated to prevent direct contact between the FTO substrate and the perovskite, while maintaining a sufficiently small thickness to prevent direct contact between the ETL and perovskite. Therefore, we deposited a Cl-bSO ETL on FTO, using either spin-coating  24, 25  or chemical bath deposition  10, 16  after dissolving either SnCl 2 ⋅2H 2 O in ethanol or SnCl 4 in deionized water. In Supplementary Fig.  2 , we provide a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a representative device using SnO 2 as the ETL, and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra and X-ray diffraction patterns of perovskites coated on various ETLs. We investigated the inclusion of Cl -ions in the SnO 2 layer using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). As shown in Fig.  1b , the SnO 2 layer coated on the FTO substrate using SnCl 2 ⋅2H 2 O contained a considerable number of residual Cl -ions, consistent with previously reported results  23  . In comparison, the TiO 2 thin film, obtained via a similar process using a TiCl 4 aqueous solution, contained a relatively small number of Cl -ions. In the case of SnO 2 , all layers contained a large number of Cl -ions when coated with chlorides as the starting materials (Extended Data Fig.  1 ). The large number of Cl -ions found in SnO 2 may be associated with two common oxidation states of Sn (Sn 2+ and Sn 4+ ). Because the Sn 2+ oxidation state is common in SnO 2 , Z is the stacking direction of the multilayer thin film, E is the energy level, E VAC is the electron energy outside the solid surface, E LUMO is the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and E HOMO is the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital. b, Analysis of the Cl -ions in the Cl-bSO (red dash-dotted line) and TiO 2 (blue solid line) electrodes using ToF-SIMS. c, ToF-SIMS depth profiles for the perovskite and Cl-bSO on FTO. d, Simulation of the formation of the interlayer between perovskite and SnO 2 . ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Cl-contained formamidinium lead iodide"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""Cl-bonded SnO 2"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""500"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.8"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.9""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Cl-contained formamidinium lead iodide"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""Cl-bonded SnO 2"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""500"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.8"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.9""}}"
2491,35_4," Top selective contacts: (HTLs or ETLs): SpiroOMeDAT was spincoated from a spiro-OMeTAD (Merck) solution in chlorobenzene (70 mM) at 4000 rpm for 20 s (acceleration 4000 rpm/s). Spiro-OMeTAD was doped with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, Sigma-Aldrich), tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tertbutylpyridine)-cobalt(III) tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209, Dynamo) and 4-tert-Butylpyridine (tBP, Sigma-Aldrich). The molar ratio of additives for spiro-OMeTAD was: 0.5, 0.03 and 3.3 for Li-TFSI, FK209 and tBP respectively. PC61BM (Solenne BV) was spincoated from a 30 mg/mL DCB solution at 6000 rpm (acceleration 2000 r.p.m/s) for 30 s and the resulting Perovksite/PCBM film further annealed at 100 °C for 30 minutes. For C60 (Creaphys) and LiF ETLs, the perovskite films were transferred to an evaporation chamber where 30 nm of C60 (1 nm of LiF) were deposited at 0.1 Å/s (0.03 Å/s) under vacuum (p = 10 -7 mbar). Metal contacts: pin-type devices were completed by transferring the samples to an evaporation chamber where 8 nm BCP (Sigma-Aldrich) at 0.2 A/s and 100 nm copper (Sigma-Aldrich) at 0.6 Å/s were deposited under vacuum (p = 10 -7 mbar). nip-type devices were completed by transferring the samples to an evaporation chamber where 100 nm gold (0.7 Å/s) were deposited under vacuum (p = 10 -7 mbar). nip-cells were oxgygen doped overnight at 20% relative humidity prior to device and PL measurements. Current density-voltage characteristics: 𝐽𝑉-curves were obtained in a 2-wire source-sense configuration with a Keithley 2400. An Oriel class AAA Xenon lamp-based sun simulator was used for illumination providing approximately 100 mW cm -2 of AM1.5G irradiation and the intensity was monitored simultaneously with a Si photodiode. The exact illumination intensity was used for efficiency calculations, and the simulator was calibrated with a KG5 filtered silicon solar cell (certified by Fraunhofer ISE). The temperature of the cell was fixed to 25 °C and a voltage ramp of 67 mV/s was used. A spectral mismatch calculation was performed based on the spectral irradiance of the solar simulator, the EQE of the reference silicon solar cell and 3 typical EQEs of our cells. This resulted in 3 mismatch factors of 𝑀 = 0.9949, 0.9996 and 0.9976. Given the very small deviation from unity the measured 𝐽 SC was not corrected by the factor 1/𝑀. All EQEs presented in this work were measured by ISE-Fraunhofer. Scanning Electron Spectroscopy: SEM images were acquired with a Zeiss Ultra Plus SEM. Photoemission Spectroscopy Measurements: Photoemission experiments were performed at an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) system consisting of sample preparation and analysis chambers (both at base pressure: 1 × 10 -10 mbar) as well as a load lock (base pressure: 1 × 10 -6 mbar). All of the samples were transferred to the UHV chamber using a transfer rod under rough vacuum (1 × 10 -3 mbar). Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) was performed using a helium discharge lamp (21.22 eV) with a filter to reduce the photoflux and to block visible light from the source hitting the sample. All spectra were recorded at room temperature and normal emission using a hemispherical Specs Phoibos 100 analyzer, and the overall energy resolution was 140 meV. Transient Photocurrent (TPC)/Photovoltage (TPV) and differential charging: Photovoltage transients were recorded with an oscilloscope (Agilent 81150A) at different external load resistance (RLoad) of 1 MΩ (TPV) and 50 Ω (transient photocurrent). A constant background illumination was provided by a white LED which was continuously increased ranging from 10 -3 equivalent suns to approximately 3 suns. Each measured data point corresponds to a different illumination intensity. A Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser (NT242, EKSPLA)) with a pulse length of 5 ns, a repetition rate of 10 Hz and excitation wavelength of 532 nm was used to generate the charge carriers, while neutral optical density (OD) filters were used to attenuate the power output. The laser fluence was kept low to ensure a small perturbation on top of the constant background current (generating a maximum voltage deflection of 20 mV at 1 MΩ without background illumination). In order to obtain the carrier lifetime (𝜏) from TPV, the photovoltage was fitted with a monoexponential decay at each laser fluence. 𝜏 plotted versus the obtained VOC at the given intensity. At low intensities, the effects of external circuit are visible with an 𝑅𝐶-time of ~1ms. The differential capacitance was obtained by integrating the TPV signals to obtain Δ𝑄, while the Δ𝑉 was obtained from the maximum photovoltage of the TPV transients at each intensity. The differential capacitance is obtained from CDC = Δ𝑄/Δ𝑉 and plotted versus the VOC. The geometrical capacitance (𝐶 geo ) is visible at low intensities or VOCs and accumulated charge in the active layer at higher VOCs. The accumulated charge carrier density in the bulk is obtained by integrating 𝑛 bulk = 1 𝑒𝐴𝑑 ∫ (𝐶 DC -𝐶 geo ) 𝑑𝑉 𝑉 0 and also plotted versus the VOC at each intensity.  S2 . Quasi-Fermi level splitting of various perovskite films illuminated through the perovskite (blue circles) or the charge transport layer (red symbols) using a 445 nm CW laser. In case of the neat perovskite film, the red symbol corresponds to a measurement through the bottom glass substrate. We note that the 445 nm laser is absorbed within a narrow window in the perovskite layer (<150 nm penetration depth) according to optical transfer matrix simulations which are also shown in Supplementary Figure  S12 . The graph shows that illuminating through the electron transport layers (ETLs) C60, PCBM causes a significantly lower QFLS (up to 30 meV) compared to illumination through the perovskite, which is attributed to substantial parasitic absorption in the ETL at this wavelength. A smaller difference in the QFLS depending on the illumination side was observed for the other transport layers. Remarks: We note that we do not claim that every individual parameter is perfectly consistent with existing literature, however, we consider them as plausible. Importantly, all parameters marked with a star were varied as part of a much larger set of device simulations in order to understand the interplay between these parameters as good as possible. In particular, the impact of the majority (∆E maj ) and minority carrier (∆E min ) band offsets are discussed in the main text. The impact of strongly doped (1x10 18 /cm 3 ) and essentially undoped (1x10 5 /cm 3 ) charge transport layers was tested with an insignificant influence on the here presented results. The role of the carrier mobilities of the charge transport layers was tested with an insignificant influence on the here presented results. The interface recombination velocities and bulk lifetimes were varied as discussed here and in a previous work.  4  The impact of the transport layer thickness was tested. The built-in voltage is given by the workfunction difference of the electrodes, and its influence was tested. The interface recombination velocities in the metal contacts were set to 1x10 7 cm/s for both majority and minority carriers, while PEDOT was treated similar to a contact metal, however, with asymmetric minority and majority recombination velocities.

2497,24_2,"To understand degradation routes and improve the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), accelerated aging tests are needed. Here, we use elevated temperatures (up to 110°C) to quantify the accelerated degradation of encapsulated CsPbI 3 PSCs under constant illumination. Incorporating a two-dimensional (2D) Cs 2 PbI 2 Cl 2 capping layer between the perovskite active layer and hole-transport layer stabilizes the interface while increasing power conversion efficiency of the all-inorganic PSCs from 14.9 to 17.4%. Devices with this 2D capping layer did not degrade at 35°C and required >2100 hours at 110°C under constant illumination to degrade by 20% of their initial efficiency. Degradation acceleration factors based on the observed Arrhenius temperature dependence predict intrinsic lifetimes of 51,000 ± 7000 hours (>5 years) operating continuously at 35°C. A lthough the power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can now exceed 25%, long-term operational instability issues must be addressed before they can be commercialized  (1) (2) (3) . The most stable and efficient PSCs have reported T 80 lifetimes (the time at which the PCE drops to 80% of its initial value) of just a few hundred or thousand hours (4-7) under continuous illumination, versus the >20-year lifetimes required for most commercial applications. Despite an encouraging report of PSCs with a T 80 of more than 1 year, the PCE of the solar cells is relatively low (<13%)  (8) . Accelerated aging tests can facilitate rapid PSC stability screening  (9) (10) (11) . An effective accelerated stress test can quantify the lifetime acceleration factor (AF) that relates the lifetime under a defined standard operating condition to the lifetime under elevated stress conditions. Thermal and highintensity illumination stress tests with AFs have been developed for organic-and siliconbased PVs  (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) , but developing robust AFs for PSCs is challenging given their complex sensitivities to temperature, light, and electrical bias  (10, 16, 17) . Here, we thermally accelerated the degradation of encapsulated CsPbI 3 PSCs operating under constant illumination at their maximum power point (MPP) with temperatures from 35°to 110°C. The PCE degradation rate followed an Arrhenius temperature dependence that was slowed substantially by incorporating a two-dimensional (2D) Cs 2 PbI 2 Cl 2 capping layer between the perovskite active layer and the hole transport layer (HTL). This 2D layer stabilized the perovskite/HTL interface and suppressed ion migration into the HTL, resulting in a T 80 lifetime of >2100 hours at 110°C. With an experimentally determined AF of 24.2 ± 3.5, this lifetime corresponds to an extrapolated T 80 of 5.1 ± 0.7 × 10 4 hours-or more than 5 years of continuous operation at 35°C. The most efficient PSCs have been based on hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, which contain volatile organic cations, such as methylammonium (MA + ) and formamidinium (FA + ). To maximize the thermal stability and photostability of our solar cells, we chose inorganic CsPbI 3 as the photoabsorber  (18) (19) (20) , despite its solar cells exhibiting slightly lower efficiencies. Inorganic CsPbI 3 PSCs with the structure shown in Fig.  1A  were fabricated both with (capped) and without (uncapped) a 2D Cs 2 PbI 2 Cl 2 layer between the CsPbI 3 absorber and the CuSCN HTL. The all-inorganic stack that includes TiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , and CuSCN transport layers, as well as fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) and Cr/Au electrodes, was designed to maximize the thermal stability and photostability of these devices, as discussed in supplementary text  1   the highest among fully inorganic PSCs in which all the functional materials in the stack are inorganic. Depositing a thin 2D perovskite capping layer can stabilize the surfaces of organicinorganic hybrid perovskites, such as FAPbI 3 and MAPbI 3  (21) , but this approach has not yet been successfully implemented with inorganic perovskites. This challenge stems from the stronger binding strength of Cs + compared to MA + or FA + , which prevents cation exchange between the Cs + of CsPbI 3 and the organic ligands in the applied hybrid organic-inorganic 2D perovskite precursor solution  (22) (23) (24) (25) . To avoid this problem, we deposited a fully inorganic Cs 2 PbI 2 Cl 2 2D layer by treating the CsPbI 3 surface with a CsCl solution followed by thermal annealing. Grazing-incidence wideangle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns (Fig.  2A  and fig.  S4 ) showed two new reflections emerging on CsPbI 3 films after CsCl treatment corresponding to the (002) and (004) reflections of 2D Cs 2 PbI 2 Cl 2 . Increasing the incident angle of the x-ray beam resulted in a decrease in the relative intensity of these reflections (Fig.  2B ), suggesting that the 2D layer formed preferentially on the CsPbI 3 surface. The interfacial nature of this 2D layer was also confirmed by cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging of the device (fig.  S5 ). We esti-mated the thickness of the capping layer to be 20 nm by tracking chlorine content on the film surface with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) while depth etching (Fig.  2C ). To study the surface passivation effect of this capping layer, we measured time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) transients (Fig.  2D ). The lifetime of the device increased from 14 to >62 ns in the presence of the capping layer, suggesting that it effectively suppressed nonradiative recombination at the CsPbI 3 surface and extended the lifetime and diffusion length of charge carriers  (26) . This observation is consistent with the observed V OC increase in capped PSCs (Fig.  1B ), whose PV characteristics are tabulated in table  S1 . This trend was also comparable to previous reports of 2D and 3D PSCs based on organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites that benefited from surface passivation  (26) (27) (28) . To evaluate the stability of capped and uncapped PSCs, N 2 -encapsulated solar cells (fig.  S6 ) with both structures were aged at their MPP under illumination from a metal halide solar simulator (spectrum shown in fig.  S7 ) at 35°, 59°, 85°, and 110°C. Our stability studies used solar cells having the same device configuration as those for PV characterization, including encapsulation and the light aperture. The evolution of the normalized PCE (averaged from three subcells) for both device types at these operating temperatures, and the evolution for the unnormalized data, normalized short-circuit current (J SC ), V OC , FF, and external quantum efficiency (EQE), are shown in figs. S8 to S10. Figure  S11  shows the operational stability of 2D and 3D PSCs without encapsulation operating at 110°C, confirming the robustness of our solar cell packaging. Heating the solar cells reversibly reduced their PCEs  (29) , which accounts for the differences in the initial PCE of the unnormalized data set in fig.  S8 . We observe a clear temperature dependence of the PCE degradation rate that can be fitted to a biexponential function of the form PCE t ð Þ ¼ A1Ãexp Àk fast Â t ð Þ þ A2Ãexp Àk slow Â t ð ÞþB ð1Þ with a fast and slow degradation rate, k fast and k slow . Here, A1, A2, and B are constants and t is time. We fit the data collected across the temperature range using this function with an R 2 > 0.95, except for the data acquired on the capped solar cells operating at 35°C because no PCE degradation was observed, even after 3531 hours of continuous operation (Fig.  3B ). To estimate an activation energy for the degradation processes corresponding to k fast and k slow , we assume an Arrhenius temperature dependence to the degradation rates k T ð Þ ¼ Aexp ÀE a k B T ð2Þ where k(T) is a degradation rate at temperature T, A is constant, E a is the activation energy of degradation, and k B is Boltzmann's constant  (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Rearranging Eq. 2, the activation energy is equivalent to the slope: E a ¼ À @ln k T ð Þ ð Þ @ 1 kBT ð3Þ The temperature-dependent degradation rates were plotted as a function of inverse temperature in Fig.  3C  and fitted to Eq. 3. Degradation rates could be adequately described by a single Arrhenius function across the entire temperature range. This finding suggested that the same degradation mechanism dominated the entire temperature range, which is an important criterion for a reliable accelerated aging test  (9) . We observed that the activation energies associated with the fast and slow degradation of each type of PSC were comparable, suggesting that the two degradation rates probed a single physical process. As we will discuss in detail below, we speculate that ion migration is the dominant degradation mechanism. The E a 's that describe the degradation for capped PSCs are nearly twice those for uncapped PSCs, suggesting that the 2D Cs 2 PbI 2 Cl 2 layer stabilizes the devices against thermal degradation stemming from ion migration.  To extract a meaningful degradation rate at standard operating conditions, k ref , from the accelerated degradation rate at high temperatures, k acc , we define an AF  (11) : AF ¼ k acc k ref ¼ exp E a k B 1 T ref À 1 T acc ð4Þ where T acc and T ref are the operating temperatures during aging at accelerated and standard operating conditions (defined as 1 sun intensity, 35°C). Because k slow is primarily responsible for long-term degradation and the E a 's of the two rates are nearly identical, we used the E a extracted from k slow and Eq. 4 to obtain AFs for each T acc (specifically 59°, 85°, and 110°C) (Fig.  3D ). On the basis of these AFs, we can define an equivalent operating time at T ref = 35°C for devices aged at elevated temperatures by multiplying their aging time by the acceleration factor (Fig.  3, E  and F ). When processed in this manner, all of the data collapsed onto a universal curve for both capped and uncapped solar cells, which further confirmed that the same mechanism, albeit hastened at elevated temperatures, was responsible for degradation across the entire temperature range. With this dataset, we can make T 80 lifetime predictions for capped devices operating at 35°C. This estimate is critical because devices aged at these conditions do not show any PCE degradation, even after continuous operation for 3531 hours. Given that the average experimentally measured T 80 for capped solar cells operating continuously at 110°C is 2100 hours (Fig.  3B ), and the AF for the capped solar cells at 110°C is 24.2 ± 3.5, we estimated a T 80 of 5.1 ± 0.7 × 10 4 hours at 35°C. To investigate the origins of PSC degradation, we aged full-stack devices at 110°C under continuous illumination before peeling off their top electrodes and characterizing the structure of the active layers with x-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig.  4, A  and B , the reflection at 2q = 16.15°corresponding to the (003) reflection of CuSCN in the XRD trace of the uncapped PSCs became broader and less intense after 2000 hours of aging, which suggested a decrease in the CuSCN crystallite size. Clear degradation of the CuSCN surface in aged, uncapped PSCs was also visible in the SEM images in fig.  S12 , which show the formation of pinholes and decreased film uniformity. Correspondingly, the I 3d signal increased substantially in the XPS spectrum of the aged HTL surface (Fig.  4C ). These results suggest that iodine migration from the CsPbI 3 active layer was responsible for the structural changes in CuSCN in uncapped solar cells, as discussed in supplementary text 2 and figs. S13 and S14. By contrast, the film structure and morphology of CuSCN in capped PSCs did not show appreciable changes after the same duration, as shown in their XRD patterns and SEM images (Fig.  4 , A and B, and fig.  S12 ), and we did not observe any appreciable I 3d signal in the XPS spectrum of the HTL surface of capped PSCs (Fig.  4C ). To quantify the ease of ion migration in capped and uncapped films, we measured the temperature-dependent conductivity in two-terminal lateral devices, a widely used method for characterizing ion migration in perovskite films  (4, 30, 31) . The activation   s T ð Þ ¼ s 0 T exp ÀE a;ion k B T ð5Þ where s 0 is a temperature-independent prefactor  (30, 31) . Plotting 1/T versus ln(sT), two distinct regions were present in both capped and uncapped films corresponding to two dis-tinct transport regimes. The high-temperature linear regime, corresponding to ion-dominated transport, was used to extract an approximate E a,ion (Fig.  4D ). Similar to the activation of degradation, the E a,ion of the capped film is nearly twice that of the uncapped film, indicating that the 2D cap frustrated ion migration. Suppressed ion migration likely stems from passivation of iodine vacancies at the surface of the perovskite active layer in the presence of a 2D capping layer (  Although the power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can now exceed 25%, longterm operational instability issues must be addressed before they can be commercialized (1-3). The most stable and efficient PSCs have reported T 80 lifetimes (the time at which the PCE drops to 80% of its initial value) of just a few hundred or thousand hours (4-7) under continuous illumination, versus the >20 year lifetimes required for most commercial applications. While there is an encouraging report of PSCs with a T 80 of more than one year, the PCE of the solar cells is relatively low (<13%)  (8) . Accelerated aging tests can facilitate rapid PSC stability screening  (9) (10) (11) . An effective accelerated stress test can quantify the lifetime acceleration factor (AF) that relates the lifetime under a defined standard operating condition to the lifetime under elevated stress conditions. Thermal and high-intensity illumination stress tests with AFs have been developed for organic-and silicon-based PVs  (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) , but developing robust AFs for PSCs is challenging given their complex sensitivities to temperature, light, and electrical bias  (10, 16, 17) . Here, we thermally accelerated the degradation of encapsulated CsPbI3 PSCs operating under constant illumination at their maximum power point (MPP) with temperatures from 35° to 110°C. The PCE degradation rate followed an Arrhenius temperature dependence that was slowed substantially by incorporating a 2D Cs 2 PbI 2 Cl 2 capping layer between the perovskite active layer and the hole transport layer (HTL). This 2D layer stabilized the perovskite/HTL interface and suppressed ion migration into the HTL, resulting in a T 80 lifetime of > 2100 hours at 110°C. With an experimentally determined AF of 24.2 ± 3.5, this lifetime corresponds to an extrapolated T 80 of 5.1 ± 0.7 × 10 4 hours-or more than 5 yr of continuous operation at 35°C. The most efficient PSCs have been based on hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, which contain volatile organic cations, such as methylammonium (MA + ) and formamidinium (FA + ). To maximize the thermal and photostability of our solar cells, we chose inorganic CsPbI 3 as the photo-absorber  (18) (19) (20) , despite its solar cells exhibiting slightly lower efficiencies. Inorganic CsPbI 3 PSCs with the structure shown in Fig.  1A  were fabricated both with (capped) and without (uncapped) a 2D Cs 2 PbI 2 Cl 2 layer between the CsPbI 3 absorber and the CuSCN HTL. The all-inorganic stack that includes TiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , and CuSCN transport layers as well as fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) and Cr/Au electrodes was designed to maximize the thermal and photostability of these devices, as discussed in supplementary text 1 and fig.  S1 . Photovoltaic characterization of representative as-fabricated devices are shown in Fig.  1, B  and C , fig.  S2 , and listed in table  S1 ; with population statistics as shown in fig.  S3 . Capped PSCs have improved fill factors (FF's) and open-circuit voltages (VOC's), leading to a champion PCE of 17.4% compared with 14.9% for uncapped devices. This PCE is the highest among fully-inorganic PSCs in which all the functional materials in the stack are inorganic. Depositing a thin 2D perovskite capping layer can stabilize the surfaces of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites, such as FAPbI3 and MAPbI 3  (21) , but this approach has not yet Accelerated aging of all-inorganic, interface-stabilized perovskite solar cells Xiaoming Zhao 1 , Tianran Liu 1,2 , Quinn C.

2549,87_7," Supplementary Text The proposed ""redox shuttle"" In a complete device, it is difficult/impractical to solve the inner degradation via additional aftertreatments, which may need reconstruction of devices. Sustainable ""redox shuttle"" in the active layer might potentially address the intrinsic degradation. An ideal ""redox shuttle"" for both perovskite and other similar soft semiconductor materials requires: 1) to selectively oxidize or reduce the generated elementary defects, 2) not to introduce additional deep level defects. Many factors are expected to be taken into consideration for these requirements: such as suitable redox potential, valence state, ionic radius, electronic structure, coordination environment etc. Defect concentration of Pb 0 and I 0 in generation and elimination process In a typical closed redox reaction, the ""redox shuttle"" can transfer electrons from Pb 0 to I 0 defects in a cyclical manner, wherein the Eu 3+ oxidizes Pb 0 to Pb 2+ to form Eu 2+ that simultaneously reduces I 0 to I -(Fig.  1F ). As a result, Pb 0 and I 0 defects in PSCs are eliminated simultaneously in a sustainable manner. Some detailed discussions are as follows: In previous report  (33) , the typical proposed degradation process of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite under light can be expressed as follows: CH3NH3PbI3 → CH3NH2 + HI + PbI2 eqn S1 PbI2 → Pb 0 + 2I 0 eqn S2 It shows that the generated amount of I 0 is twice as high as Pb 0 . In lead iodine perovskite materials, the I and Pb elements are much more variable in chemical valence than other elements or group such as Cs + , MA + or FA + , which are redox-inert. The charge transfer in the redox reaction should obey charge conservation rule. We could reasonably deduce that the amount of I 0 should be twice as that of Pb 0 involved. Similarly, the elimination process of Pb 0 and I 0 could also obey the charge conservation rule. Regardless of the involvement of Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ ion pair, the Pb 0 and twice amount of I 0 would be eliminated at same time. The results of XPS measurement provide further evidence. As shown in the above proposed perovskite decomposition mechanism (eqn S1 and S2), the iodine species (HI and I 0 ) are all volatile, which follows the 1:2 molar ratio. We checked the total change of iodine (ΔI) and lead (ΔPb 0 ) in the film when Eu was added. It follows the equation as follows: ΔI = I/Pb (in Eu 3+ based film) -I/Pb (in reference film) ΔPb 0 = Pb 0 /(Pb 0 + Pb 2+ ) (in reference film) -Pb 0 /(Pb 0 + Pb 2+ ) (in Eu 3+ based film) In reference perovskite film, it is very likely that I 0 will be evaporated during the annealing process, further reducing the I 0 concentration in the resultant film, and the defect concentration of metallic Pb is much higher than I 0 in the typical CH3NH3PbI3 film, due to the fact that the nonvolatile Pb 0 would accumulate in the perovskite film, and the volatile I 0 would evaporate into the surrounding environment. The situation may be different in the Eu 3+ introduced film. The corresponding XPS results (Fig.  2  and table S1 ) show the Pb 0 /(Pb 0 + Pb 2+ ) is 1.4% and I/Pb ratio is 2.93 upon Eu addition, as compared to the reference film of the value of 5.4% and 2.79, respectively. We could calculate the ΔI/ΔPb 0 = 3.5. It shows the change of iodine (ΔI) is three times the change of lead (ΔPb 0 ) during degradation process, clearly indicating the I 0 species preserved is twice of Pb 0 species that is consumed upon redox shuttle addition. After both light and thermal aging test for more than 1000 hours, the Pb 0 /(Pb 0 + Pb 2+ ) ratio is still much lower and the I/Pb ratio is much higher compared with reference film, as shown in Table  S3 . The preserved iodine component in the Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ based film suggests a close redox shuttle formed cyclically. We still noticed that after intensive aging test, I/Pb ratio in the Eu 3+ based film decreased to some extent, and one possible escaping species could be the ""HI"" that is not involved in the redox reaction. -Furthermore, it may be more reasonable to use ""→"" instead of ""="" in the proposed redox equation. This is mainly because the species of I 0 could be in the form of I2, single atom I 0 or I3 , and a chemical balance exists between these different species according to our knowledge and previous reports  (31) . The state of Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ redox shuttle in the film With respect to the possibility for a replacement between Eu 2+ and Pb 2+ , as claimed in the main text ""Given their similar radius of Eu 2+ (117 pm) and Pb 2+ (119 pm) however, we cannot confidently rule out the possibility that Eu 2+ replaces Pb 2+ at B site, wherein direct evidence is expecting."" Due to the small content of Eu 2+ in the film, and detection limitation of the XRD and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), it is still difficult for us to provide clear experimental evidence. Here, we discussed this issue in detail as follows. Firstly, we consider that the possibility for Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ substitution at Pb 2+ site in the bulk perovskite crystal can be ruled out. This was because that when the Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ was introduced in the CH3NH3PbI3 materials system, neither extra diffraction peaks of other species or phases, nor obvious shift of diffraction peak from CH3NH3PbI3 materials could be observed from the XRD results (figs.  S2-4 ). This phenomenon is consistent when Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ content increased from 0.15% to 4.8% (figs. S4). This result represents that the introduction of Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ would not bring new phases/species, as well as detectable ion substitution, e.g. Eu 3+ /Pb 2+ or Eu 2+ /Pb 2+ in the bulk perovskite. The XRD result is also consistent with the XPS result (table  S1 , Fig.  2A-E ), wherein the Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ ions were found to be concentrated near the film surface, as the detected Eu/Pb ratio was much higher than the precursor ratio. It should be noted that the percentage of reduced species Eu 2+ over the total europium content is 36%, which means Eu 2+ was also accumulated on the film surface. This result suggests that the possibility for Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ substitution in the bulk perovskite crystal is very low. Secondly, we cannot theoretically rule out the possibility that Eu 2+ replaces Pb 2+ at B site from the viewpoint of microscopic structure. This was supported by some visible variation of the XRD peak of perovskite film induced by Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ introduction. Especially, as shown in fig.  S2 , the relative intensity of diffraction peak located at 28.11° which are attributed to (004) of tetragonal phase decreased obviously when the 1% Eu 3+ was introduced into perovskite film. This is consistent with 1% Fe 3+ based perovskite film, as the intensity of (004) crystallographic plane was decreased similarly. However, this phenomenon was not observed in Y 3+ and acetylacetone species introduced perovskite film. This difference might be attributed to the reducing species, divalent Eu 2+ , Fe 2+ , with the same valence as Pb 2+ , which could probably affect the microstructure of perovskite materials. Yet we don't know whether the divalent ions could partially substitute Pb 2+ or not on the grain surface. Given the different coordination environment on the grain surface compared to the crystal bulk, and the similar radius of Eu 2+ (117 pm) and Pb 2+ (119 pm), we could not exclude the possibility that Eu 2+ partially substitute Pb 2+ on the grain surface. In addition, europium iodine based organic-inorganic perovskite such as (C4H9NH3)2EuI4  (47)  and lanthanide ions doped CsPbX3 perovskite nanocrystals (48) could be found in previous reports. This also suggests there is a possibility for a replacement for Pb 2+ by Eu 2+ , wherein the direct evidence is expecting.              Total IV measurement time under these conditions was approximately 60 min  (49) .    The components with soft nature in the metal halide perovskite absorber usually generate lead (Pb) 0 and iodine (I) 0 defects during device fabrication and operation. These defects serve as not only recombination centers to deteriorate device efficiency but also degradation initiators to hamper device lifetimes. We show that the europium ion pair Eu 3+ -Eu 2+ acts as the ""redox shuttle"" that selectively oxidized Pb 0 and reduced I 0 defects simultaneously in a cyclical transition. The resultant device achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.52% (certified 20.52%) with substantially improved long-term durability. The devices retained 92% and 89% of the peak PCE under 1-sun continuous illumination or heating at 85°C for 1500 hours and 91% of the original stable PCE after maximum power point tracking for 500 hours, respectively. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP""}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""europium ion pair"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""21.52"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.92""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOST"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
2566,45_3,"Introduction Carrier selective junctions based on silicon rich, mostly polycrystalline (poly-) layers deposited on an interfacial oxide grown on a crystalline (c-) silicon absorber are currently attracting significant research interest. Excellent junction quality with recombination current densities J 0 down to 0.7 fA/cm 2  [1] , as well as efficiencies up to 25.1%  [2]  have been demonstrated with this approach. Regarding the physical working principle of poly-Si/c-Si junctions, different pictures exist  [3, 4] . For interfacial oxide thicknesses of $2 nm or less, it is safe to assume that tunnelling through the oxide takes place. Nevertheless, we present in this work strong support that, at least for our samples with initial interfacial oxide thicknesses 42 nm, additional effects are relevant, which could in particular explain the excellent performance of our p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""heavily doped polycrystalline silicon"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}"
2568,45_5," Alternative picture The alternative picture presented in the following is a generalized version of our previous model according to Ref.  [4] . A comparison of both approaches, as well as a summary of differences and similarities is given in the appendix. As known from secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and electrochemical capacitance voltage (ECV) measurements  [7, 16] , dopants diffuse from the poly-Si into the c-Si during the junction formation process, especially for boron doped poly-Si layers (Fig.  4  (a)). Fig.  4 (b) shows a schematic sketch of our corresponding model for a localized current flow through an interfacial oxide into a doped poly-Si layer. In contrast to previous work  [4] , we do not exclude that charge carriers surpass the oxide by tunnelling, although pinhole formation might make the necessity for tunnelling superfluous. The major aspect of the model is that the oxide is surpassed locally, e.g. due to significant local reduction of the interfacial oxide thickness or due to pinhole formation. This local current flow implies transport limitations for majority and minority charge carriers due to current crowding in the highly doped region of the c-Si absorber. We assume that these crowding effects in the c-Si are limiting both the majority and minority carrier flow, rather than the final local transport through the oxide or through the pinhole. The latter is therefore disregarded. The current flow in the c-Si, i.e., the recombination current densities (minority carriers) and junction resistance (majority carriers), can be calculated analytically  [4] . An equivalent description is provided by the Fischer model  [26] , which can be applied to the highly doped region the c-Si underneath the interfacial oxide. The Fischer model also takes into account recombination in regions where the interfacial oxide is still intact. For the recombination current density, we use Eq.  (20)  in Ref.  [27]  (the assumption of a minority carrier diffusion length much larger than the thickness of the doped region in the c-Si is valid for our samples), while for the resistance implied by the crowding of majority carriers, Eqs.  (22, 23)  in Ref.  [27]  are used. We assume the recombination velocity S 0,pinhole in the interface regions where pinholes have formed or where the interfacial oxide thickness is strongly reduced to be thermally limited (S 0, pinhole ¼10 7 cm/s). According to the TEM results, we assume a radius r pinhole of these regions of 2 nm and vary their areal density from 10 5 cm À 2 to 10 10 cm À 2 . The role of the base in the original formulation of the Fischer model for the description of local rear contacts  [26, 27]  is represented in our picture of poly-Si/c-Si junctions by the highly doped region in the c-Si, which has formed underneath the interfacial oxide due to in-diffusion of dopants from the poly-Si. For the doping concentration N A (for p þ poly-Si/ c-Si junctions) or N D (for n þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions) as well as for the width W of this region, we use the box profile approximation of our measured profiles as shown in Fig.  4(a) . The resulting values are N A ¼ 10 18 cm À 3 , W ¼350 nm for p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions and N D ¼5 Á 10 17 cm À 3 , W¼50 nm for n þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions. The recombination velocity S 0, pass in regions where the interfacial oxide is still intact (or unaltered in thickness) is used as the only fitting parameter. As shown in Fig.  5 (a), we achieve agreement between modelled and measured J 0 (ρ c ) data for our p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions and for the data of Gan et al.  [8]  when assuming a S 0,pass value of 400 cm/s. Remarkably, this value agrees well to literature data for surface recombination velocities at the SiO 2 /p þ c-Si surface for a boron surface doping concentration of N A ¼10 18 cm À 3  [28] . Obviously, recombination in the passivated regions dominates for our p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions, while the data of Gan et al.  [8]  indicates a strong contribution of recombination at the pinholes (which are, according to the very low junction resistances, present with a much higher areal density in these samples). Auger recombination in the highly doped p þ region in the c-Si plays a minor role: its contribution to the total J 0 value of 4.4 fA/cm 2 is calculated to 0.6 fA/cm 2 by the program EDNA 2 for our ECV doping profile. As already pointed out in Ref.  [4] , the most sensitive input parameter of our model in the regime of low junction resistance and ""pinhole-dominated"" recombination is the doping level in the c-Si. Thus, a large uncertainty is implied in the simulation of experimental data from other groups when using the doping profile measured on our samples. However, for the data of Gan et al.  [8] , we achieve nice agreement when using the box approximation of our ECV profile. For the description of the J 0 (ρ c ) data for p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions reported by Feldmann et al.  [16]  and Yan et al.  [17]  with our model, the doping profile in the c-Si is less important since the total recombination seems to be dominated by the recombination in regions where the interfacial oxide is still intact (or unaltered in thickness). However, a higher S 0,pass value of 2000 cm/s has to be assumed. Our hypothesis for this difference in the S 0,pass values for samples from different groups is a difference in the interfacial oxide: While Gan et al.  [8]  and ourselves use thicker, mainly thermally grown interfacial oxides, Feldmann et al.  [16]  and Yan et al.  [17]  use wet chemically grown oxides with a thickness of only 1.5 nm. The smaller interfacial oxide thickness might compromise the passivation quality threefold: First, too thin interfacial oxides might not efficiently prevent the tunnelling of minority carriers (electrons in the case of p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions) from the c-Si into the poly-Si, implying a larger recombination current density. Second, boron can diffuse more efficiently through thinner interfacial oxides, implying a higher boron doping concentration at the SiO x /c-Si interface and thus a higher S 0,pass value  [28] . Third, thinner oxides break up more easily, which implies high recombination current densities for too large pinhole area fractions. Thus, the annealing temperature has to be restricted to lower values than possible for samples with thicker interfacial oxides. However, a high annealing temperature might be beneficial for a re-organisation of the SiO x /c-Si interface, which possibly exhibits a high density of interface defects directly after the wet chemical oxide growth (or the thermal oxide growth at low temperatures $600 °C). Nevertheless, it is possible to achieve excellent junction quality for p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions with wet chemically grown interfacial oxides. Our lowest J 0 value achieved on such a junction with 1.7 nm thick wet chemically grown interfacial oxide thickness is 8 fA/cm 2  [18] . As shown in Fig.  5 (b), our model can also describe experimental J 0 (ρ c ) data for our n þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions and for the data of Gan et al.  [8]  when assuming a S 0,pass value of 40 cm/s. Again, this value in in good agreement with literature data for the SiO 2 /n þ c-Si interface for a Phosphorus doping concentration of 5 Á 10 17 cm À 3  [29] . Auger recombination in the highly doped n þ region in the c-Si is calculated to 0.2 fA/cm 2 by the program EDNA 2 for our doping profiles. Again, the experimental J 0 (ρ c ) data of Feldmann et al.  [12]  and Yan et al.  [13]  can be described by a higher S 0,pass value (300 cm/s in this case), perhaps due to the same reasons as discussed above for p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions. Also for n þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions, it is possible to achieve excellent passivation quality with wet chemically grown interfacial   [7, 14, 18]  as well as for the data of Gan et al.  [8] , a nice agreement is obtained for S 0,pass values of 400 cm/s, while for the data of Feldmann et al.  [16]  and Yan et al.  [17] , best agreement is obtained for S 0,pass ¼ 2000 cm/s. (b) Comparison of experimental and modelled ρ c , J 0 values for n þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions. Here, the best agreement between model and our data  [1, 7, 14, 15]  and the of Gan et al.

Perovskite Cs0.03(FA0.90MA0.10)0.97PbI3 layers A mixture of perovskite solution (1.5 M) composed of mixed cations (PbI2: 691.5 mg, CsI: 11.7 mg, FAI: 225.1 mg, and MAI: 15.4 mg with 30 mol% of MACl) was dissolved in a mixed solvent (DMF/DMSO with 4/1 vol. ratio) according to a formula of Cs0.03(FA0.90MA0.10)0.97PbI3. A twostep spin-coating procedure with 2,000 r.p.m. for 40 s and 6,000 r.p.m. for 10 s was adopted to prepare perovskite films. Anisole (300 µl) was dropped on the spinning substrate during the last 10 s of the second spin-coating step. Subsequently, the sample was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. After cooling down, the 2D passivation by solution post-treatment was carried. Typically, OLAI molecules were dissolved in chloroform with concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 mg/mL. Then, 2D ligand solution (100 µL) was spin-coated onto the as-prepared perovskite films at 5,000 r.p.m. for 25 s. It should be noted, the temperature of N2 glove box was recorded around 25 °C during 2D passivation (the digital thermometer was placed near by spin-coater). Then the treated perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min for 2D-TA-based samples; and stored overnight at room-temperature (under dark and inside N2 glovebox with O2 level was <10 ppm and H2O level was <0.1 ppm) for 2D-RT-based samples. After Annealed or stored overnight, the treated films with 2D perovskite passivation were then washed one time with chloroform at 5,000 r.p.m. for 20 s to remove unbounded 2D ligands. All procedures were done in an N2 glove box. Perovskite Cs0.05FA0.80MA0.15PbI2.25Br0.75 layers For wide-bandgap perovskite, a mixture of perovskite solution (1.4 M) composed of mixed cations (PbI2: 568.2 mg, PbBr2: 61.3, CsI: 18.2 mg, FAI: 192.6 mg, and MABr: 23.5 mg with 15 mol% of MACl) was dissolved in a mixed solvent (DMF/DMSO with 4/1 ratio) according to a formula of Cs0.05FA0.80MA0.15PbI2.25Br0.75.(30) A two-step spin-coating procedure with 2,000 r.p.m. for 40 s and 6,000 r.p.m. for 10 s was adopted to prepare perovskite film. Anisole (300 µL) was dropped on the spinning substrate during the last 10 s of the second spin-coating step. Subsequently, the sample was annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. For fabricating blade-coated devices, PTAA (2 mg/mL in chlorobenzene) solution is spin-coated (5,000 r.p.m. for 30s) and annealed at 100 o C for 10 mins. The perovskite absorber layer is deposited on top of the HTL, by employing a 1.5 M solution of Cs0.15(FA0.85MA0.15)0.85PbI0.7Br0.3 in DMF solution. 25 µL of DMPU and 18 mg of MACl were introduced as additives for 1 ml of precursor solution. The substrates were blade-coated using 10 µL of the precursor solution at room-temperature at a speed of 15 mm/s. The blade-substrate gap was kept at 100 µm and a laminar flow air gun was used to induce crystallization of the precursor thin film. The films were then annealed at 70 o C for 10 min and 100 o C for 30 min, subsequently. The 2D passivation was done as described above. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSD"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""oleylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": ""85"", ""temperature"": ""85"", ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""24.3"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.95""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""PTAA"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSD"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""oleylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": ""85"", ""temperature"": ""85"", ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""24.3"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.95""}}"
2610,51_6," Pioneering work has elucidated the importance of energy Published: March 26, 2021 Letter pubs.acs.org/JPCL cascades, energy transfer, and charge mobility in the 3D/RDP system,  [36] [37] [38] [39]  but a consistent model for hole injection at the 3D/RDP|HTL interface is still lacking. The Grancini group has made significant steps forward in this regard, showing that effective RDP-on-3D passivation is predicated by a flat conformation of the RDP layer.  40  In another study, they showed that the 3D/RDP interface is dynamic, in that the RDP layerinitially consisting largely of (R-NH 3 ) 2 PbI 4 (n = 1)can scavenge intrinsic MA cations from the 3D perovskite t o f o r m d e v i c e -l i m i t i n g , h i g h e r -o r d e r ( R -NH 3 ) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 (n = 1, 2, ...) heterostructures, which can be proscribed by careful design of the RDP-inducing passivant.  41  Elsewhere, Teale et al. developed a technique for dimensional mixing of the passivating RDP layer. They used grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to suggest that device PCE was enhanced for mixed-n RDPs but suggested that further study should be carried out with more precise optical techniques.  42  Interestingly, the common denominator in the latter two studies is the significance of the n value in the passivating (R-NH 3 ) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 layer. However, the link between the value of n and charge extraction remains unseen. Additionally, it is unclear whether the RDP layer actively mediates hole injection in 3D/RDP|HTL systems  26, 43, 44  or forms an electronically benign passivating layer.  23, 40  Herein, we use a combination of surface-sensitive structural and time-resolved optical spectroscopy to elucidate the full scale of passivation in n-i-p MAPbI 3 perovskite films treated with R-NH 3 I salts. We show that cation bulkiness is a prerequisite to enhancements in the injection efficiency, with smaller cations actually working to reduce charge extraction by forming trapping centers. We reveal that the improvements with bulky cations are due to the treatment of excess PbI 2 with R-NH 3 I to form (R-NH 3 ) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 at the MAPbI 3 | HTL interface. Moreover, we gain new insights into the charge s e p a r a t i o n m e c h a n i s m a t t h e M A P b I 3 | ( R -NH 3 ) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 |HTL (3D/RDP|HTL) interface: (i) the RDP layer does not mediate hole injection between the 3D perovskite and the HTL; (ii) efficient hole injection is possible only for n = 1 and is significantly inhibited in systems where n > 1. These results yield an important design rule for the development of high-performance 3D/2D perovskite optoelectronics. In order to investigate the role of chemical structure in determining the efficacy of passivation, we screened methylammonium and phenethylammonium (MAI and PEAI) and The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters pubs.acs.org/JPCL Letter several other R-NH 3 I (R-NH 3 + = ammonium, phenylammonium, phenylmethylammonium, and butylammonium) salts. We note that samples were prepared via a one-step deposition of MAPbI 3 with a 1:1 PbI 2 :MAI ratio as reported elsewhere,  45  followed by iodide salt treatment and annealing as outlined in the Supporting Information. Device efficiency is ultimately based on the yield of sustained charge injection at the interfaces between MAPbI 3 and its CTLs. Therefore, we first investigated the role of R-NH 3 I in determining the hole-transfer yield at the MAPbI 3 :R-NH 3 I|HTL interface with microsecond transient absorption spectroscopy (μs-TAS). Details of the μs-TAS technique and setup can be found in the Supporting Information. Figure  S1  shows that MAPbI 3 exhibits no transient absorption features on the microsecond time scale, which is in line with the typical 10-100 ns recombination time scale for this material in the fluence range used. On the other hand, when interfaced with the HTL poly(triarylamine) (PTAA), a broad TA feature is observed with a maximum signal strength, ΔOD max at 1500 nm, which can be attributed to hole polarons in PTAA formed after injection from the MAPbI 3 valence band.  46, 47  Given the proportionality between ΔOD max and the concentration of injected holes in PTAA, we could then track the impact of each R-NH 3 I treatment on hole transfer to the HTL. Figure  1  shows the relative hole injection yield (i.e., ΔOD max ) in MAPbI 3 |HTL films in the case of passivation with 20 mM of the different iodide salts. Strikingly, only the iodide salts with bulky cations, i.e., those to the right of the control (black) film in Figure  1 , can improve the hole injection yield to the HTL. In contrast, application of MAI and AI to MAPbI 3 results in a reduction in hole injection yield at the MAPbI 3 |HTL interface. This supports work elsewhere in the literature, where MAI applied in great excess, or as a post-treatment, works to lower the PCE of PSCs.  [20] [21] [22]  In order to understand this surprising result, we turned to steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy using MAI as an example salt treatment with a small cation. In Figure  1b, c  we see that the lifetime and intensity of the MAPbI 3 film after MAI treatment are much reduced. This suggests that the addition of MAI adds additional trap-states through which the photoexcited charges in the MAPbI 3 layer can recombine. Consideration of the reaction between MAI and the perovskite film leads to a potential explanation for the increase in trap density after MAI passivation and annealing. Ascrystallized MAPbI 3 contains an excess of PbI 2 at the grain boundaries because of the ready escape of MAI during annealing.  48  This excess PbI 2 is known to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells through a passivation effect  [48] [49] [50]  and may also lower the hole injection barrier at the MAPbI 3 |HTL interface, improving hole extraction.  49, 50  We display evidence for the formation of excess PbI 2 with grazingincidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements in Figure  S2 , where our control MAPbI 3 film shows a peak at 2θ = 12.6°a ssociated with the (001) orientation of unreacted PbI 2 .  51  We also observe a contribution at 2θ = 14.2°, associated with the (110) orientation of the 3D perovskite. The removal of the 2θ = 12.6°peak in the MAI-treated sample (Figure  S2 , second panel) suggests that the MAI reacts with PbI 2 , removing its beneficial passivation effects. We note that the peak position of the (110) contribution associated with 3D perovskite remains unchanged and the intensity is not reduced, allowing us to discard the idea that MAI treatment deteriorates performance by exerting strain on, or damaging, the pre-existing 3D perovskite structure.  52  On the other hand, MAPbI 3 films treated with R-NH 3 I salts containing bulky R-NH 3 + cations consistently exhibit hole injection yields greater than that of the unpassivated control. We used PEAI as an example bulky R-NH3I salt. The enhanced PL lifetime and intensity in MAPbI 3 :PEAI films exhibited in Figure  1b ,c provide strong evidence that recombination of photoexcited charge carriers in MAPbI 3 is much suppressed after PEAI treatment. Furthermore, the entirely opposite effect of PEAI compared to MAI treatment on charge separation in the MAPbI 3 film suggests that the cation plays a decidedly different role in the former case. Further insight into the mechanism of passivation in the case of MAPbI 3 :PEAI films is given in Figure  1c , where an additional PL contribution can be observed at 525 nm. As has been established elsewhere,  26, 35  passivation with bulky organic cations leads to the formation of a reduced dimensional perovskite (RDP) layer with formula (PEA) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 at the top surface of the 3D perovskite film due to the inability of the cation to intercalate into a traditional 3D perovskite lattice. We therefore attribute the 525 nm feature to (PEA) 2 PbI 4 atop the 3D perovskite film. We provide further evidence for this in Figure  S3 , where we excited 3D/RDP at 450 nm (penetration depth, ∼100 nm) from the film and substrate faces, respectively, and measured the PL. The much enhanced intensity of the 525 nm contribution after excitation from the film face confirms that the RDP layer is concentrated at the top surface of the MAPbI 3 film. Moreover, in Figure  S4  we present the PL spectra of 3D perovskite treated with the other bulky R-NH 3 I salts (i.e., PAI, PMAI, and BAI). The features observed in the 500-550 nm region of the spectrum indicate the formation of (R-NH 3 ) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 heterostructures in all cases. This is in good agreement with the literature, where bulky R-NH 3 I salts such as these are routinely used to induce RDP layers.  25, 28, 53  We can therefore conclude that bulky R-NH 3 + cations are prerequisite to the enhancements in interfacial charge injection observed after iodide salt passivation. We also carried out GIXRD to obtain interface-specific insight into the formation of the RDP (Figure  S2 ). Notably, in the case of passivation with the R-NH 3 I salts, the (001) peak associated with PbI 2 is entirely removed after all but PAI treatment, which still shows a substantial reduction in intensity. This suggests that the RDP layers are seeded by reaction between R-NH 3 I and excess PbI 2 at the 3D perovskite surface. We next looked to quantify exactly how interfacial hole injection correlates with the growth of the RDP passivating layer on the 3D perovskite by increasing the concentration of PEAI from 4 to 40 mM. Given the potential for PEA + to combine with intrinsic MA + from the 3D perovskite film to form (PEA) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 , we paid particular attention to the formation of n > 1 RDP layers. We first investigated the growth of the RDP on 3D perovskite as a function of [PEAI] with XRD. Raw XRD patterns (Figure  S5 ) exhibit strong diffraction peaks for 3D perovskite films at 14.2°, 28.5°, and 32.5°, which are associated with the (110), (220), and (310) lattice orientations of 3D tetragonal halide perovskite.  48  Furthermore, the (002) orientation of (PEA) 2 PbI 4 , present within the RDP, becomes increasingly prevalent as a function of [PEAI].  26  In Figure  2a  we track the evolution of the (  110 ) and (002) characteristic peaks of the 3D perovskite and RDP, respectively, as a function of [PEAI]. This data suggests that the RDP is present even at a relatively low concentration of 10 mM. Moreover, for [PEAI] > 10 mM, the 3D perovskite contribution reduces in intensity, suggesting significant damage to the underlying 3D perovskite layer at high PEAI concentrations. We next turned to PL spectroscopy hoping that the orders of magnitude greater sensitivity of this technique could reveal more about the 2D character of the passivated films. In Figure  2b  we summarize the evolution of the RDP with [PEAI] by tracking the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 (n = 1), (PEA) 2 (MA)Pb 2 I 7 (n = 2), and (PEA) 2 (MA) 2 Pb 3 I 10 (n = 3) contributions in the PL spectra at 525, 560, and 610 nm, respectively (raw spectra in Figure  S6 ).  41, 54, 55  Interestingly, we find that the n > 1 features for the [PEAI] ≤ 10 mM samples are minimal when compared to the n = 1 contribution. Notably, the contribution from the n = 2 structure increases with [PEAI] thereafter to 4% and 25% for 20 and 40 mM, respectively. Additionally, a third contribution associated with the n = 3 structure is present at 5% in the PL spectrum of the 40 mM film. It can therefore be concluded that an almost phase-pure (PEA) 2 PbI 4 layer is formed after PEAI treatment at concentrations equal to or below 10 mM because of the consumption of the excess PbI 2 in the film. At higher concentrations, we suggest that the additional PEAI begins to attack the perovskite itself presumably at unsaturated PbI 6 octahedra via V MA sitesand combines with intrinsic MA + to form higher-order RDP (n > 1) heterostructures. We next assessed the impact of RDP growth on the relative hole injection yield, i.e., ΔOD max from μs-TAS. The results in Figure  2c  show that the relationship between hole injection and [PEAI] is nontrivial, reaching a maximum at 10 mM. Importantly, this is the concentration at which the largest amount of phase-pure (PEA) 2 PbI 4 (i.e., n = 1) RDP is formed, with minimal formation of higher-order n > 1 structures. Indeed, the formation of these higher-order structures in the passivating layer is concomitant with a decrease in the hole injection yield. To probe the origin of this maximum in hole injection yield at 10 mM, we captured PL decay dynamics for 3D|HTL and 3D/RDP|HTL with the results displayed in Figure  2d . The PL decay of 3D perovskite can be fitted to a biexponential with a fast (τ 1 ) and slow (τ 2 ) component indicative of charge trapping at grain boundaries and in the bulk, respectively.  56  Upon addition of an HTL, the fast decay (τ 1 = τ inj ) becomes indicative of hole injection, and the slow component (τ 2 ) is due to either unquenched charges that remain in the bulk  57  or surface recombination.  5  The rapid (τ inj = 503 ps) hole injection kinetics observed after interfacing 3D perovskite with PTAA are in line with previous literature reports,  46  attributed to the significant energetic offset (ΔE ≈ 0.2 eV) at the 3D|PTAA interface. We note that τ inj here is much larger than the instrumental response of our TCSPC setup (τ IRF ≈ 100 ps) allowing for accurate assignation of the kinetics. Importantly, τ inj (=513 ps) for 3D/RDP|PTAA is similar to that for 3D|PTAA (Table  1 , bold), suggesting that the RDP layer has little impact on the kinetics of hole injection at the 3D/RDP|HTL interface. In light of this, we rationalize the increased hole injection yield (n + in Figure  2d , inset) at [PEAI] = 10 mM as a decrease of the recombination rate constant in the 3D layer (k rec,M ), rather than an increase in the hole injection rate constant (k inj ). The findings presented so far prove that upon passivation of 3D perovskite with 10 mM PEAI (i) an almost phase-pure Table  1 . Biexponential Fitting (y(t) = A 1 e -t/τ 1 + A 2 e -t/τ 2 ) Parameters for the Time-Resolved Single-Photon Counting Decays Given in Figure  2a  sample a We note that τ 1 = τ inj for PTAA-coated samples. A 1 τ 1 (=τ inj ) (ps) A 2 τ 2 ( The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters pubs.acs.org/JPCL Letter (PEA) 2 PbI 4 layer is formed; (ii) this layer is positioned at the 3D|HTL interface; and (iii) hole injection is not impeded by the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 passivating layer. We therefore next looked to build a picture of the interfacial energetics to explain these observations. While it is established that the conduction band minimum (CBM) of RDP lies well ab ov e the CBM of MAPbI 3 ,  23, 40, 43, [58] [59] [60]  reporting on the position of the valence band maximum (VBM) has not been consistent. This is most likely due to variations in band gap (n value) and ligand coverage, both of which have a significant impact on the VBM.  42  Cho et al. reported that the valence band (VB) energy of (PEA) 2 PbI 4 is similar to that in MAPbI 3 .  26  In contrast, several other literature reports place the VBM of RDPs as shallower than the 3D VBM.  43, 44  Elsewhere, another group of reports place the VBM of RDPs as deeper than the 3D VBM.  23, 40, 58  As such, depending on the literature report, the 3D/RDP interface alternates between type I (3D band gap lies within the RDP band gap) and type II (only the 3D conduction band lies within the RDP band gap), which has important implications for the mechanism of hole injection at the 3D/RDP|HTL interface. In the type I case, the RDP VB lies below that of MAPbI 3 and hole injection to the HTL occurs via tunnelling (Figure  3a ). Otherwise, in the type II case, the RDP VB lies between that of MAPbI 3 and the HTL HOMO and thus mediates hole injection (Figure  3b ). In order to establish which of the two proposed mechanisms is at work, we conducted femtosecond-TAS (fs-TAS) studies on 3D and 3D/RDP films formed after treatment of 3D perovskite with the optimized concentration of 10 mM PEAI. We probed the absorption in the visible/near-infrared (400-800 nm) region after exciting the samples at 635 nm and found two distinct bleaching peaks at ∼476 nm (PB1) and ∼760 nm (PB2). PB2 is assigned to the band edge transition of 3D perovskite, which is in line with the absorption onset of the 3D perovskite film in Figure  S7  at 760 nm. The origin of PB1 is debated but may be due either to excitation from a deeper valence band  61, 62  or a charge-transfer state involving PbI x complexes.  63  The broad positive band between 500 and 700 nm is assigned to photoinduced absorption (PIA), potentially from I 2 -like reversable photodissociation products of PbI x -.  63  As indicated in Figure  S7 , 2D (PEA) 2 PbI 4 has a strong ground-state absorption beginning at 525 nm. In TA spectra, this absorption can lead to a photobleaching feature (PB3) between 500 and 525 nm.  36, 40  We hypothesized that if the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 layer plays an active role in mediating hole injection, PB3 would be present in the TA spectrum at time τ inj after initial excitation of the 3D perovskite. However, the shape of the 3D (Figure  3c ) and 3D/RDP (Figure  3d ) spectra are The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters pubs.acs.org/JPCL Letter strikingly similar across the 6 ns time window for the measurement. This result suggests that no hole injection occurs between the 3D perovskite and RDP layer. We note that the RDP layer in the optimized system, after treatment with 10 mM PEAI, is very thin, and so PB3 (maximum ∼500 nm) could be obscured by PB1 (maximum ∼476 nm), which is assigned to the much thicker 3D perovskite film. However, we show in Figure  S8  that even for a much thicker RDP layer, after 40 mM PEAI treatment, still no features are observed that can be attributed to PB3. This adds weight to our argument that no injection occurs between the 3D and RDP layers. In agreement with our time-resolved PL studies we find an increased lifetime of photoexcited charges in the 3D/RDP samples (Figure  3e ,f, magenta lines) compared to pure 3D (Figure  3e ,f, black lines). Additionally, we checked the decay of PB1 and PB2 for signs of 3D-to-RDP injection. This would be evidenced by a rising component in PB1, due to proximity to the RDP GSB, and a ""quenching"" component in PB2, due to depopulation of the 3D perovskite after injection to the RDP. However, no such abnormalities in the recombination kinetics were observed. Combining this with the lack of new features associated with PB3 in the 3D/RDP TA spectra, we suggest that the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 layer formed after PEAI passivation does not accept holes from the 3D perovskite on the time scales studied (<6 ns). Given that hole injection to the HTL in the bestperforming PSC devices occurs on faster time scales, often subnanosecond as observed in Figure  2d  and elsewhere,  46, 64  we can say with some certainty that the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 layer in our 3D/RDP system does not actively mediate hole injection. This suggests that the 3D/RDP interface is type I, as put forward elsewhere.  23, 40, 58  Given RDP coverage on the 3D perovskite surface is likely incomplete in the optimized system, hole injection can occur via two potential mechanisms: (i) tunnelling at the 3D/RDP|HTL interface and (ii) direct injection in regions of immediate contact between the 3D perovskite and HTL. In Figure  4 , we summarize the mechanism of R-NH 3 I passivation in our system. First, the bulky R-NH 3 I reacts with PbI 2 at the 3D perovskite surface (Figure  4a  and b ). If [R-NH 3 I] < 10 mM, the formation of pure (R-NH 3 ) 2 PbI 4 at the 3D perovskite surface is favored, with minimal disruption of the MA + content in the MAPbI 3 bulk (Figure  4c ). Here, the hole injection barrier is sufficiently thin, and/or there is enough direct contact between the 3D perovskite and HTL, that charge injection can proceed efficiently. However, if [R-NH 3 I] > 10 mM, a thicker (R-NH 3 ) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3...) layer is formed (Figure  4d ) because of the combination of R-NH 3 + with intrinsic MA + . There is some evidence that such layers stack with a tendency to lower n at the interface with the 3D perovskite,  36  but it is likely that the phase distribution of the RDP is highly disordered.  65  This situation then harms interfacial hole injection in three potential ways: (i) removal of intrinsic MA + from the 3D perovskite layer could generate trap states at the 3D/RDP interface; (ii) the disordered RDP layer containing (R-NH 3 ) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3...) could form trap states via hole funnelling; and (iii) the tunnelling yield through the RDP layer decreases exponentially with layer thickness. The 10 mM optimum concentration for PEAI found herein is in excellent agreement with the optimum PCE found elsewhere,  29, 66  on MAPbI 3 -based PSCs with a 1:1 stoichiometry. We note that the optimum concentration of PEAI would likely increase in the case of PbI 2 -rich stoichiometry.  25  Ultimately, during R-NH 3 I passivation with bulky ammonium iodide salts, the passivation layer at the 3D perovskite surface undergoes a transformation from PbI 2 to (R-NH 3 ) 2 PbI 4 . While the presence of PbI 2 at the grain boundaries has been known to exert a limited improvement on PSC efficiency,  [48] [49] [50]  PbI 2 is a known proponent of degradation in devices.  67  Exchanging PbI 2 for (R-NH 3 ) 2 PbI 4 therefore offers a superior passivation method given that (i) the (R-NH 3 ) 2 PbI 4 layer is relatively stable and water resistant and (ii) the charge extraction efficiency, and by extension the PCE, is much enhanced. In conclusion, we presented a comprehensive investigation of the passivation and charge-transfer mechanism at 3D/RDP| HTL heterojunctions. We showed that passivation ensues via a mechanism by which R-NH 3 I reacts with excess PbI 2 in the 3D perovskite film to form a layered (R-NH 3 ) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 heterostructure. We revealed that the RDP layer does not actively mediate hole transfer between the 3D perovskite and HTL layers, implying that interfacial hole injection occurs via tunnelling, regions of direct 3D|HTL contact, or a combination of both. As such, precise growth of the RDP layer is critical, with n = 1 yielding a significant improvement in interfacial hole injection across the 3D/2D|HTL interface, but n > 1 being detrimental to charge injection. We expect that proper consideration of the resulting 3D/RDP interface in these systems will aid the design of future passivation strategies capable of further enhancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite optoelectronics. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Methylammonium Lead Iodide"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP""}"

[22]  After calcination at 180 °C for an hour, Small 2018, 14, 1803350 pristine perovskites are deposited by the antisolvent method and then heated for 1 h at 100 °C. FAL treatment is performed at 100 °C with a drop of solution on the hot plate. We found the post-treatment had wide time window up to several minutes and 40 s were enough for the post-treatment, which increased the technical viability and facilitated the fabrication. The crosssection view of the post-treated device is shown in Figure  5a  and the perovskite layer thickness is around 520 nm. The perovskite crystal grain boundaries are closely packed without crack. The grain size is around 1 µm. The FAL passivation can allow perovskite thin films have excellent PV properties both in bulk interior and at grain boundaries. We further examined the photovoltaic performance and found that the post-treatment significantly improved PSCs' performance. Figure  5b  shows the current density-voltage (J-V) curves of mixed-cation/halide Cs 0.05 (MA 0.17 FA 0.83 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 perovskite-based devices without/with post-treatment. The pristine PSC exhibited only a moderate efficiency of 17.08%, with J sc of 22.56 mA cm -2 , V oc of 1.02 V, and FF of 0.743, in reversed scan mode. After post-treatment, the largely improved device performance was obtained, achieving J sc of 23.33 mA cm -2 , V oc of 1.13 V, FF of 0.777, and PCE of 20.48%, which is 20% higher than the reference cell. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve (Figure  S8 , Supporting Information) has integrated value of 22.48 mA cm -2 , supporting the measured J sc value and J-V hysteresis is not obvious in the solar cell (Figure  5b ). Basically, the interface and the trap account for the hysteresis.  [23]  In our regular p-i-n-FTO planar PSC, FAL modification passivates the perovskite and bridges the p-side interface and thus the hysteresis is much reduced to great extent. The interface at n-side may still cause some hysteresis, which will be improved in the future work. In order to give more convincing comparison, we give the statistical data for pristine and FAL passivated cells, and we can see that the average V oc , J sc , FF, and PCE of reversed scanning mode are all improved, as shown in Figure  5c-f . In order to demonstrate the molecular dipole alignment, the surface potentials are tested by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) (Figure  6 ). The surface of FAL-passivated perovskite has ≈120 mV higher tip potential than that of pristine perovskite (Figure  6a, b ). This is due to the alignment of molecular dipoles through HVACP. We also measured the KPFM of solution-process-passivated perovskite in Figure  6c . Its surface potential is small (≈40 mV). Namely, in HVACP, the vapor molecules are chemically anchored and well aligned into dipole field (Figure  6d ). However, in the solution process, both physical and chemical adsorption occur during the dip-coating. The molecules through physical adsorption seem to be randomly distributed, reducing the net dipole field. The offset effect of random distribution was schematically illustrated in Figure  6e  and the antialigned configuration could counterbalance the dipoles. In the PSC device, the dipole alignment by HVACP can help to promote the charge separation. To evidence the improved charge separation via dipole field in PV devices, we resort to impedance spectroscopy to obtain the series resistance (R s ) and recombination resistance (R rec ). FALpassivated PSC has 15 times R rec lager than that of pristine PSC, while it has 0.5 times R s smaller than that of pristine PCS. This result is consistent with the previous PV performance and KPFM. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""4-fluoroaniline"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""20.48"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""4-fluoroaniline"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": ""17.8"", ""treated_pce"": ""20.48"", ""control_voc"": ""1.02"", ""treated_voc"": ""1.13"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
2640,58_3,"P hotovoltaic (PV) deployment at the multi-terawatt scale is of crucial importance in the quest to transition to a zero-carbon economy.  1  Since the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is one of the biggest determinants for the price of electricity per kilowatt-hour and therefore real-world adoption, developing highly efficient module-scale photovoltaics is a crucial avenue of research. While it took 60 years to engineer c-Si PV with a PCE of 26.7%, 2 it took hybrid perovskite PV only a decade to surpass 25.5%.  2  Apart from the inherent high-quality optoelectronic properties of hybrid perovskites, a key factor behind this rapid efficiency increase has been the broad suite of characterization methodologies developed by the semiconductor community, which reduce reliance upon trial and error experimentation. As instrumentation and our understanding of semiconductor processes advance, new characterization methods may emerge, offering powerful new ways to accelerate material discovery and optimization. A fundamental principle, which has only become commonly exploited over the last 10 years, is that a good solar cell is also a good light-emitting diode.  3, 4  This is because the trap states that capture excited charge carriers and reduce the amount of extractable work in a solar cell also facilitate recombination that does not emit photons. Thus, the photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) serves as an excellent proxy for the quality of photovoltaic materials or devices. Indeed, luminescence measurements have emerged as a powerful ""contactless probe"" of loss mechanisms.  5  Since spontaneous emission is linked to physical quantities such as the carrier densities, the density of states, traps, and the quasi Fermi level splitting (QFLS), many internal properties and processes can be deduced from the luminescence.  6  This approach will only become more powerful as luminescence efficiencies improve and cells approach their thermodynamically limiting efficiencies. While incredible advances have been made in PCEs, highly efficient perovskite solar cells are still restricted to small active areas (≤1 cm  2  ). The simple nature of the processing techniques used for some emerging technologies such as metal halide perovskites introduces large local fluctuations at both short (<100 nm) and long length scales (>10 μm).  7, 8  Even well-performing perovskite solar cells are seen to exhibit regions of both high and poor luminescence efficiencies. Understanding the origins of, and overcoming, these heterogeneities is key to translating high-efficiency laboratory technology to wafer and full module scale manufacturing (∼250 to 20000 cm 2 ). A significant barrier to such upscaling is the lack of advanced characterization methods that can perform high-throughput measurements on an appropriate length scale. Maps of spatially resolved voltage loss have been constructed using hyperspectral luminescence imaging,  9  and light-beam-induced current (LBIC) has been used in Si  10  and perovskites  11  to spatially map the short-circuit current. These techniques, however, can be time consuming (on the order of hours) and require access to specialized equipment. Spatially resolved luminescence measurements provide a fast (approximately minutes) and relatively simple method for characterizing performance parameters and have been used in Si cells for a long time to identify series resistance hot spots in wafers.  [12] [13] [14] [15]  In emerging PV materials such as perovskites, imaging of the PL over very small (nanometer to micrometer) length scales has produced maps of parameters such as QFLS.  8, 16  Heterogeneities in luminescence on a device scale (>1 mm) have also been measured, but many images of luminescence are presented in entirely arbitrary units, and comparisons with established mapping techniques or integrated measurements are necessary for a more robust analysis beyond simply identifying regions of low luminescence.  [16] [17] [18] [19]  Indeed, a review of mapping techniques in perovskites  20  found that while luminescence measurements have been used effectively to map voltage losses on microscopic length scales, such maps are not well-established at macroscopic length scales. Spatially resolved maps of parameters such as the ideality factor have been produced,  21  which can be used to understand the recombination mechanisms in a device. In terms of current loss, the optically measured parameter ""current transport efficiency"" (f T ) introduced by Wong and Green  22, 23  is a figure of merit. f T was conceptualized for Si p-n junction cells, defined as the differential ratio of the extracted (δJ) current to the light-induced current (δJ L ), over an infinitesimally small voltage step, capturing losses in transporting the current from the p-n junction to the load at some voltage bias. Spatially resolved maps of f T have been applied in Si  24  and later in perovskites. El-Hajje et al. measured spatially resolved maps of f T in perovskite solar cells, across both a micrometer and millimeter length scale, evaluated near the open circuit.  25  Ren et al. measured similar maps near the maximum power point, for a range of intensities, and suggest that the differences in f T observed in the samples of the study result from a difference in series resistance.  26  These maps of f T provide a good way to probe the effects of factors such as series resistance at different voltage points. However, at short circuit, current loss is unlikely to be dominated by the effect of series resistance (see note 1 in the Supporting Information). Additionally, δJ L as defined in the formulization of f T refers to the current which flows through the p-n junction. In the case of perovskite solar cells, this is likely to correspond to current which is extracted at the transport layers, and therefore losses in current due to charge carriers not reaching these layers, and remaining in the bulk, are not captured by this factor. The anomalous PL observed in many perovskite solar cells,  [27] [28] [29]  which has been linked to a loss in short-circuit current, is likely to have In this work, we introduce a relatively simple methodology by which we use a sensitive optical camera to image the luminescence of operational perovskite solar cells under varying optical irradiances and electrical biases. By applying the principle of detailed balance, we are able to derive spatial maps of many important optoelectronic and device parameters. We experimentally demonstrate that the ratio of short-circuit PLQE to open-circuit PLQE is an excellent measure of the effectiveness with which generated charge is collected in the case of perovskite solar cells and use this parameter to generate spatially resolved maps of current loss across centimeter-scale images. Furthermore, we show how spatially resolved maps of parameters, such as the QFLS and ideality factor, can be effectively used to reveal correlations between parameters by using a large amount of data extracted from measurements on a single sample. We also visualize the inhomogeneities introduced when seven widely employed charge transport layers (tin oxide nanoparticles (SnO 2 NP), C 60 , 2,2′,7,7′tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), nickel oxide (NiO x ), poly[bis(4-phenyl)-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA), poly(N,N′-bis-4-butylphenyl-N,N′-bisphenyl)benzidine (poly-TPD), and [6,6]  phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)) are processed into a partial device stack, and we use quantitative metrics to describe this inhomogeneity. This can serve as a useful metric to rank materials and processing routes by suitability for upscaling. This is an important complement to the macroscopic quantification of the nonradiative recombination introduced by each layera technique already widely used by the community. We combine luminescence measurements with detailed balance calculations to create maps of the following parameters which link directly to PV performance losses: QFLS at open circuit, which is closely linked to V OC loss; charge collection quality, a metric linked to J SC loss; and the ideality factor n, which encodes information about the dominant recombination mechanism in the material. The QFLS and ideality factor maps are produced in this work using adaptations of methods previously reported.  [30] [31] [32] [33]  The luminescence-derived charge collection quality as a metric for short circuit current loss will be justified and experimentally validated in a later section. When charge carriers are optically excited in a solar cell, the chemical potentials of electrons and holes become nonidentical (""quasi Fermi levels""). The difference between these two quasi Fermi levels (""quasi Fermi level splitting"") is equal to eV OC in an ideal device, where e is the elementary charge (Figure  1a ). However, a misalignment of energy levels at the interfaces or lack of selectivity of the charge extraction heterojunctions often causes eV OC to be lower than the internal QFLS.  30, 34  The principle of optoelectronic reciprocity  4, 32, 35  allows us to link the internal QFLS to the photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE): = +kT QFLS QFLS ln PLQE rad (1) where QFLS rad is the QFLS in the radiative limit, which can be calculated from the active material's absorption spectrum,  32, 36  and k is the Boltzmann constant. A more thorough derivation of eq 1 is given in note 2 in the Supporting Information. A schematic of this process is shown in Figure  1a . A spatially resolved map of the PLQE therefore allows us to reconstruct a map of the QFLS. This is a contactless measurement and so can be done for ""half-stacks"" (partially constructed solar cells) as well as full devices. The nature of the dominant charge recombination mechanism in the device can be inferred from the ideality factor (n). The ideality factor is featured in the classical diode equation = - J J e ( 1 ) eV nkT D 0 / D (2) where J D and V D are the diode current density and voltage, respectively, J 0 is the diode saturation current density, and T is the temperature of the cell. The ideality factor, which is unity in an ideal cell, was traditionally understood to tend toward 2 with increasing first-order nonradiative recombination, understood through the Shockley-Read-Hall model.  37, 38  However, recent reports  31, 39  have provided greater clarity by distinguishing between the influence of bulk and interfacial recombination (occurring at the perovskite/transport layer interfaces) on the ideality factor. The ideality factor may be found optically using a method applied by Sarritzu,  32  with the relation + = I C nkT ln ( ) QFLS suns (3) Here, I suns is the illumination irradiance expressed as number of suns (1 sun is AM1.5 100 mW cm -2 equivalent irradiance for that band gap) and C is a constant term. A more thorough derivation of eq 3 is also given in note 2 in the Supporting Information. Thus, the ideality factor for each point on the active area can be calculated using intensity-dependent QFLS maps. The distribution of n vs QFLS therefore gives us information about the dominant type of recombination. For our imaging setup (Figure  1b ) we used a sensitive Si CMOS camera (Andor Zyla 4.2, Oxford Instruments),  40  which is suitable for low-intensity acquisitions. Samples can be imaged under both controlled optical excitation (440 nm LED; 0-1 sun equivalent photon flux) and electrical bias. In the case of full devices, we used the test device itself to calibrate the optical intensity in terms of number of suns by comparing the short-circuit current to the short-circuit current measured on a well-calibrated solar simulator. A long-pass filter is used in the imaging set up to block the 440 nm excitation light from reaching the camera. The number of counts recorded by each camera pixel scales linearly with the number of photons emitted by the associated point on the sample, assuming that the signal is significantly larger than the noise floor. The sample is aligned to be in the focal plane of the lens and coincides with the center of the illumination, where the illumination profile has the flattest intensity profile (see Figure  S3 ). When the PLQE is desired, a high-reflectance BaSO 4 plate is imaged, without filtering, as a reference. A more detailed description, including correction factors used, can be found in note 3 in the Supporting Information. Before undertaking this work, we were not certain what features and inhomogeneities would exist at the 0.01-1 mm length scale that our imaging setup resolves. In order to verify the general validity of our approach, we recorded luminescence images on a selection of different perovskite solar cells. We imaged a well-performing FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 device (18.5% PCE, 1.6 eV band gap; see Figure  S5  and Table  S3  in the Supporting Information) and characterized the currentvoltage response in four different ways (Figure  2a ): two ACS Energy Letters  http://pubs.acs.org/journal/aelccp  Letter electrical measurements under illumination and two optical measurements analogous to the electrical measurements. The two electrical measurements include (1) measuring the current while sweeping the voltage (labeled ""JV"") and (  2 ) measuring the V OC value while sweeping the intensity, which is used to infer the current density (also known as the suns-V OC method  41  ). The corresponding optical measurements include (1) inferring the current density from the PL intensity averaged across the device as the voltage was swept (drawing upon the approach of Stolterfoht et al.,  27  labeled ""PL implied JV"") and (2) inferring voltage from the average PLQE at open circuit while the illumination intensity is changed (using eq 1 and taking the QFLS to be the voltage; labeled ""PL reconstructed""). The curves measured by all four methods vary, as would be expected from macroscopic measurements of the same properties. Furthermore, the electrically measured curves show excellent agreement with the curves derived from averaging the PL images (Figure  2a ). The fill factor appears to be enhanced in the suns-V OC and PL-reconstructed curves, as these measurements were performed at open circuit, where the series resistance has no influence. This validates our setup's ability to measure absolute PL intensities and reconstruct the QFLS across a range of bias conditions. To further validate the setup and assess the types of inhomogeneities present in full devices, we reconstructed QFLS maps at 1 sun illumination for 1.6 eV band gap cells of two different architectures (Figure  2b ): cell 1, NiO x / perovskite/PCBM; cells 2 and 3, poly-TPD/perovskite/ PCBM. In all of the captured PL images, we observe a number of spatial inhomogeneities at the millimeter length scale, with the better-performing poly-TPD cells exhibiting a more homogeneous QFLS distribution in comparison to the NiO x cell. In a later section, we present a fuller analysis of the heterogeneity introduced by all of the widely used transport layers. On comparing the two poly-TPD cells, we can see that, despite identical processing conditions, the variability is still quite different. This is a common feature of devices processed by simple methods such as spin-coating and is likely to be a significant barrier to scale-up. The poorly performing NiO x -based cell also has a larger difference between the mean QFLS and that measured, indicating an energy level misalignment at a heterojunction or a lack of charge selectivity.  30, 34  Notwithstanding this small difference, the average values of the QFLS are still close to the measured V OC value, and they agree very well for both of the poly-TPD-based cells, once again validating our ability to correctly reproduce QFLS maps. Furthermore, though the luminescence is rather inhomogeneous in the NiO x -based cell, there are localized regions on the map that approach the luminescence efficiencies of the wellperforming poly-TPD-based cells. Their existence indicates that an intrinsic limitation of the material is not at work here: with an optimization of the processing conditions, we can expect to fabricate a device with uniformly bright luminescence. We suggest that such luminescence imaging could be combined with deposition equipment so that the performance can continuously be monitored in situ, accelerating device optimization. With an increase of laboratory automation, we can also envision that such luminescence images will be fed to active learning models that can vary processing parameters until the luminescence is maximized. While the protocol for making spatial maps of quasi Fermi level splitting (and hence voltage losses) from luminescence measurements is well-established, a method for estimating the total current loss at short circuit in a spatially resolved fashion has not been successfully applied to perovskites. Here we utilize and experimentally verify an expression that links the current loss to luminescence at short circuit, enabling us to visualize regions of current loss over a cell's active area. An ideal solar cell at short-circuit (SC) collects all the generated carriers and therefore will not emit any photons. In practice, however, perovskite solar cells have been observed to emit significant PL even at short circuit.  27  Furthermore, a transient increase in PL at short circuit has been observed for some cell types, in conjunction with a transient increase in current loss,  28  and it has been suggested that the ratio of PL at SC to open-circuit (OC) may be linked to the charge extraction efficiency.  29  Similar observations in silicon PV cells have been attributed to diffusion-limited carriers generated in the bulk that were unable to reach the p-n junction,  9, 10  and in some instances the ratio of PL at OC and SC has been used to estimate diffusion lengths in silicon samples.  42  In perovskite devices, one possible explanation for the residual PL at SC could be the screening of the internal field due to ion redistribution, leaving the absorber with a zero net field, where the charge can undergo internal recombination before being transported out of the device.  28  Alternatively, perovskite films, due to processing inhomogeneities, may contain regions of isolated material not properly contacted with the electrodes. Rau links this same anomalous ""residual luminescence"" observed at short circuit in Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 solar cells directly to the ratio of the short-circuit current to the current generated in the material.  43  In the case of perovskite solar cells, we verify that a similar expression does in fact correlate with losses in short-circuit current and use it to generate spatially resolved maps of ""current collection"" at short circuit. We can understand the estimation of current loss intuitively from a comparison between the luminescence intensities from the PV cell at short circuit and open circuit. At open circuit, every generated e-h pair has three possible fates: recombine radiatively, recombine nonradiatively, or flow through the shunt resistance from the equivalent circuit model (Figure  1c ). Luminescence can originate only from charge carriers that flow through the diode in the equivalent circuit model. The extracted current density from the cell (J) is linked to the luminescence through the ideality factor, a ""fudge-factor"" introduced into the diode equation to account for the mixture of recombination mechanisms that operate in a cell. On comparison of the radiative recombination current density (J rad ) to the total current density J, the PL intensity at open circuit can be shown to be proportional to the generation current density (J G ) to the power of n, where n is the ideality factor = - = • • J J J e J J V e EQE ( ) nkT kT G 0 QFLS/ rad 0 EL QFLS/ (4) = ⇒ = J J Je at OC: 0 nkT G 0 QFLS / OC (5) ⇒ = • • - J J V J EQE ( ) ( ) n n rad,OC 0 1 EL G (6) since at open circuit, all generated carriers must recombine. At short circuit, the majority of photogenerated chargecarriers are extracted as load current, quenching the PL. Some carriers are not extracted as load current and instead flow through a shunt pathway or recombine in the perovskite bulk. The current density that is not extracted at short circuit, J G -J SC is responsible for the anomalous PL at SC: = ⇒ - = J J J J J e at SC: nkT SC G SC 0 QFLS / SC (7) ⇒ = • • - - J J V J J EQE ( ) ( ) n n rad,SC 0 1 EL G S C (8) Rearranging eqs 6 and 8, we get:  - = • • - J J J V J ( EQE ( ) ) n n G S C 0 1 EL rad,SC 1/ (9) = • • - J J V J ( EQE ( ) ) n n G 0 1 EL rad,OC 1/ (10) Q col value (Q col -J SC /J G ) as a percentage of Q col from simulation. White and yellow lines show boundaries of 10% and 15% error, respectively. The blue line is the point where, for lower shunt resistances, the ratio of current through the shunt V s through the diode exceeded 1000; for R sh under the blue line, the PL is under the sensor detector limit. Assuming that the ideality factor and EQE EL (V) does not change between OC and SC, we can write = = - = - i k j j j j j j y { z z z z z z i k j j j j y { z z z z Q J J J J 1 1 PLQE(SC) PLQE(OC) n n col SC G rad,SC rad,OC 1/ 1/ (11) where Q col is a parameter we dub the ""charge collection quality"". In a device with zero series and infinite shunt resistance, Q col would be identical to the internal quantum efficiency. While Q col is a function of the ideality factor, it remains much faster to measure PLQE(SC) and PLQE(OC) in comparison to the ideality factor, which requires a full intensity-dependent measurement and fitting of the slope of the QFLS as a function of intensity for every pixel in the map. If a fast measurement is required, one can measure only the PLQE(SC) and PLQE(OC) values and assume an ideality factor of unity, or any other value that corresponds to the macroscopically averaged ideality factor of the cell, to get an approximate value of Q col , which still correlates with the current loss (See note 5 in the Supporting Information for a full justification). When the effects of shunt and series resistances are included, Q col can underestimate or overestimate the internal quantum efficiency. Nevertheless, as we shall experimentally demonstrate, it remains a useful metric, as it is found to correlate with current loss. To experimentally verify the validity of the expression for Q col (eq 11), we measured Q col (n=1) for a large number of cells, in both positive-intrinsic-negative (p-i-n) and n-i-p architectures, with band gaps varying from 1.6 to 1.8 eV, with a variety of different hole-transporting layers (HTLs) and electron-transporting layers (ETLs) (see the Supporting Information for details). For these measurements the ideality factor was considered to be unity, as described. By measuring the average PL intensity over the active area at open circuit and short circuit, we can calculate an average Q col (n=1) for the device (eq 11). The relationship between J SC /J G and Q col (n=1) can be calculated for different ""true"" values of ideality factor and accounting for a reasonable loss in current due to reflection losses and parasitic absorption. If the electrically measured J SC is shown to follow this relation with Q col (n=1), the validity of the expression (eq 11) is confirmed. To minimize the impact of shunt and series resistance on Q col , only ""good"" devices were chosen, meaning that the average shunt resistance may be considered to be much greater than the solar cell's output resistance V I OC SC . Measurements were made under an equivalent irradiance of 1 sun for each cell, with a preillumination of 30 s under opencircuit conditions to ensure the device was at a steady state. In Figure  3a , we show a plot of the band-gap-normalized J SC (taken to be the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) current density) versus the spatially averaged charge collection quality Q col | n=1 . The values of Q col | n=1 vs J J SC SQ fall within a range of values predicted by eq 11, for ideality factors ranging from 1 to 2 and assumption of an average 20% loss in the generation current density from the SQ limit (typical for cells produced in our laboratories). This confirms the qualitative validity of our expression for Q col . Apart from the variation in ideality factor, we may attribute some of the spread in data to some additional factors: namely, the variation of series and shunt resistances and limitation of setting the intensity to exactly 1 sun. We now briefly comment on the impact of series and shunt resistances on Q col . Luminescence originates from radiative recombination in the semiconductor bulk, which in the equivalent circuit model is a certain fraction of the current flowing through the diode. If a fraction of the current is able to flow through a different pathway, namely the series or shunt resistor, then the luminescence will be altered. At open circuit, shunt pathways divert charge away from the perovskite bulk (equivalently more current flows through the shunt resistor as opposed to the diode), diminishing luminescence. The series resistance has no influence at open circuit. At short circuit, the presence of a series resistance results in a nonzero potential difference across the parallel shunt and diode components, hence causing some current to flow through the diode, resulting in luminescence at short circuit, with increasing series resistance. However, even at short circuit some current will flow through the shunt pathways, causing the luminescence to diminish, which does not correspond to the collected current. Using the equivalent circuit model, we can calculate how the internal quantum efficiency J J SC G varies with values of R S and R SH , and compare this to the estimated Q col value (assuming the absolute PL is proportional to current flowing through the diode). Through this, we can estimate the error in Q col introduced by R S and R SH . We show that the values for the internal quantum efficiency and Q col agree with each other very closely (<10% error), apart from the conditions when the shunt resistance is very low and where the series resistance is very high (Figure  3d ; see note 4 in the Supporting Information for full details). In this case, we found that Q col tends to overestimate J J SC G , but this only occurs in extreme cases. We now comment on the spatial inhomogeneity in Q col observed in the three cells we present in Figure  3a . Since the presence of traps influence the device performance on many fronts, it is important to answer the following question: does a poor Q col imply a poor QFLS, both being mediated by traps? If so, Q Col maps would be unnecessary, since QFLS maps essentially provide the same information. Looking at the QFLS and Q col maps of cell 2 (Figures  2b  and 3b ), we can see very clearly that this is not the caseregions of poor Q col are not always detectable on QFLS maps. The red circles in Figure  3b  highlight areas where the values of Q col (and hence the current) are particularly low. These features are completely unobservable with the QFLS map (Figure  2b ). Could these low-luminescence regions instead be explained by shunts? The absence of these features in the map taken at OC (Figure  2b ) shows that they are not shunts, for shunting effects are active at both OC and SC. The maps presented (Figures  2b  and 3b ) indicate that the average value and the inhomogeneity in QFLS (a proxy for V OC ) and Q col (a proxy for J SC ) can vary independently in devices, making the characterization of both essential for a full understanding of spatially resolved losses. To illustratewhile cell 2 (poly-TPD-based) has superior QFLS in comparison to cell 1 (NiO x -based), it has a lower average Q col value (Figure  3b ).

2687,147_12," Device stability The operational stability of the control and target devices was evaluated using full sunlight soaking under the continuous MPP tracking, and the stability results are shown in Fig.  5a . After 1,100 h, the device with CBz-PAI overlayer is capable of maintaining 94.6% PCE of its initial value, while the one for the control device is only 66.6%. Then the measurement of contact angle of the corresponding films was performed to figure out the reason for the improved stability of PSC after CBz-PAI treatment (Supplementary Fig.  30 ). As compared with the perovskite, the contact angle of the hydrophobic chlorobenzene (CB)-based HTL solution droplets on the perovskite/CBz-PAI film decreases from 18.3° to 9.7°, indicating the improved compatibility between the perovskite and the HTL. Additionally, the contact angles of water droplets on the surface of the control sample and the sample with CBz-PAI overlayer are 50.6° and 77.8°, respectively. This obvious difference in water contact angle demonstrates that the surface of the perovskite/CBz-PAI films is more hydrophobic, which is favourable for repelling moisture and slowing down the water penetration into the perovskite film in a moist environment. Moreover, the cross-section of the control and CBz-PAI-based devices was measured by SEM before and after 1,100 h  ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSD"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""carbazole-triphenylamine and phenylammonium iodide units"", ""humidity"": ""85"", ""temperature"": ""85"", ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": ""22.3"", ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.112"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.923""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1100"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""24.7"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.946""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSD"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""carbazole-triphenylamine and phenylammonium iodide units"", ""humidity"": ""85"", ""temperature"": ""85"", ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": ""22.3"", ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.112"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.923""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1100"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""24.7"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.946"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.666""}}"

The void-like features between the perovskite layer and HTL are observed in the aged control device, which could behave as the non-radiative recombination sites to inhibit charge transport. In contrast, thanks to the high compatibility of the conjugated structure in CBz-PAI with HTL layer, no such features appeared in the device with CBz-PAI interlayer after ageing, evidencing that CBz-PAI can enhance the stability of the interface between perovskite layer and HTL layer. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) was applied to analyse the spatial distribution of the key perovskite components within Spiro-MeOTAD layer for the aged control and target PSC devices (Fig.  5d, e ). The mapping signal of I -in Spiro-MeOTAD is counted and represented by pixel ratio. It is clearly observed that the aged control device showed extremely strong signal of I -, while the signal is significantly reduced in the aged device with CBz-PAI compared with the control PEAI device. This result shows that the incorporated CBz-PAI layer strongly suppresses the undesired migration of I -ions from perovskite to HTL, thus preventing the device from fast degradation. We also analysed the depth profile of I -and Li + within the cells by TOF-SIMS (Supplementary Fig.  32 ). The I -signal in the PEAI control device is much higher in the HTL than that of the device with CBz-PAI interlayer. Meanwhile, the diffusion of Li + from HTL layer to the perovskite layer is also effectively reduced in the device with CBz-PAI interlayer, which is considered to be one of the reasons for the small hysteresis of the target device. These results show that the CBz-PAI interlayer can not only improve the stability of the interface between perovskite and HTL layers, it can also suppress the migration of I -from perovskite to HTL, as well as the diffusion of Li + from HTL to perovskite, thus resulting in outstanding stability of the target PSC device. Remarkably, the damp heat (85 °C and 85% relative humidity) test showed that the device with CBz-PAI retained 92.3% of its maximum PCE after 1,000 h (Supplementary Fig.  33 ). Furthermore, we carried out more detailed experiments on higher thermal/light stability by using the more stable PTAA and P3HT as HTL. The target device retained 78.5% and 91.1% of the initial PCEs after 500 h under continuous full light illumination at 80 ± 5 °C with PTAA and P3HT as HTL (Supplementary Fig.  34 ), respectively. Our results demonstrate that CBz-PAI as interface engineering material can effectively enhance the device performance and operational reliability of n-i-p PSCs. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSD"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""carbazole-triphenylamine and phenylammonium iodide units"", ""humidity"": ""85"", ""temperature"": ""85"", ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": ""22.3"", ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.112"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.923""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1100"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""24.7"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.946"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.666""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSD"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""carbazole-triphenylamine and phenylammonium iodide units"", ""humidity"": ""85"", ""temperature"": ""85"", ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": ""22.3"", ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.112"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.923""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""1100"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""24.7"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.946"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.666""}}"

2737,53_4,"P erovskite solar cells (PSCs) are a promising photovoltaic (PV) technology, and certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as high as 25.5% have been reported  (1) . Despite this high performance, device stability hinders their commercialization. Efforts to improve device stability include defect passivation, contact layer modification, and encapsulation  (2) (3) (4) (5) . The use of two-dimensional (2D) perovskite as the interfacial modification layer has great potential for addressing surface defects, in particular to improve the stability and efficiency of PSCs  (6) (7) (8) . The Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) 2D layered perovskites that are based on bulky cations, such as phenethylammonium (PEA + ) or butylammonium (BA + ), have been widely applied to the surface of 3D perovskite thin films to decrease defect densities and enhance device stability  (8) (9) (10) (11) . Such bulky organic cations often self-assemble into a barrier layer that protects against surface water adsorption or ingress. However, bulky-cation-based 2D structures often exhibit anisotropic and poor charge transport across the organic layer and are susceptible to charge-extraction barrier formation that inhibits efficient device operation  (12) (13) (14) . We show a rational design strategy to maximize the out-of-plane hole transport based on a metastable Dion-Jacobson (DJ) 2D perovskite surface layer with a reduced transport energy barrier by using asymmetric bulky organic molecules, leading to highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. Our general design strategy to maximize the out-of-plane charge transport in 2D perovskites is illustrated in Fig.  1 . Because the free electrons and holes are localized in the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) of the [PbI 6 ] planes, respectively, and because of the long distance between two adjacent [PbI 6 ] planes, the out-of-plane charge transport must traverse the bulky cationic organic layers. Thus, it is mainly limited by two factors: (i) the low carrier mobility within the organic layer and (ii) the energy barrier between the [PbI 6 ] planes and the bulky organic cations. To mitigate the first limit, DJ 2D structures based on a short and single layer of divalent organoammonium cations  (15) (16) (17) (18)  are generally more preferable than the RP 2D structures based on double layers of monovalent organoammonium cations  (19) . To mitigate the second limiting factor, the band offsets between the [PbI 6 ] planes and the bulky cationic organic layers need to be optimized. The coupling (interaction) between [PbI 6 ] planes and the organic cations is through hydrogen bonding, and the change in the bonding strength can affect the band offsets  (20) . For a weaker hydrogen bonding configuration, the bonding states of the bulky organic layers are normally at a higher energy position, which brings them nearer the VBM of the [PbI 6 ] planes (Fig.  1A ). This effect leads to a smaller band offset or barrier for hole transport between the [PbI 6 ] inorganic planes and organic cations. Because of the spinorbital coupling of Pb 6p orbitals, the antibonding states of the organic layers are much higher than the CBM of the [PbI 6 ] planes. Thus, a DJ structure with weaker hydrogen bonding should improve hole transport. Yet, a weaker hydrogen bonding (or H-bonding) configuration generally means a less stable structure. Thus, a metastable DJ 2D structure with short cationic organic layers could in principle facilitate out-of-plane hole transport. A rational strategy to induce the desired metastable H-bonding motifs in DJ 2D structures is to use asymmetric diammonium cations in lieu of symmetric straight chain divalent  cations. For example, both N,N-dimethyl-1,3propane diammonium (DMePDA 2+ ) and 1,4butane diammonium (BDA 2+ ) form DJ 2D structures with short interlayer distances  (19) . Whereas BDA 2+ is symmetric and features two terminal primary ammonium ions on the butyl (C4) chain, DMePDA 2+ is asymmetric, with a primary ammonium on one end and a dimethyl-substituted tertiary ammonium on the other end of the propyl (C3) chain. The ""head or tail"" H-bonding options for the DMePDA 2+ molecules are asymmetric, giving rise to different possible relative orientations of the adjacent molecules, and the different H-bonding interactions possible within the [PbI 6 ] planes could lead to both stable and metastable energy polymorphs of the 2D structure (Fig.  1B ). The alternating relative head-to-tail alignment of adjacent DMePDA 2+ cations (most stable orientation configuration) provides a larger compensation for overall structural relaxation than those of other orientation arrangements. By contrast, the symmetric BDA 2+ molecule has only one possible orientation configuration (Fig.  1B ) and cannot form metastable polymorphs. We further examined single-crystal 2D DJ structures from BDAI 2 and DMePDAI 2 and conducted first-principle calculations to verify our design strategy. We found that 1,3-propane diammonium diiodine (PDAI 2 )-which is often assumed the shortest diamine  (15, 21)  to form DJ 2D perovskites-templated Pb-I to a non-perovskite structure (empirical formula:  S1  and table  S1 ). Thus, BDA 2+ represents the shortest linearalkyl-chain diamine that forms an iodide-based 2D DJ structure (BDAPbI 4 ) (fig.  S2A  and table  S2 ). C3-based DMePDAI 2 with two methyl groups attached to one side of PDA can form 2D DJ structures with two polymorphs, which we refer to as DMePDAPbI 4 -1 (fig.  S2B  and table  S3 ) and DMePDAPbI 4 -2, respectively (fig.  S2C )  (22) . [PDAPbI 4 ] 15 •[PDAI 2 ]) (fig. We grew the DMePDAPbI 4 -1 single crystal, which was based on the most stable DMePDA 2+ orientation alignment, from a concentrated hydroiodic acid solution using a slow-crystallization process, as adapted from our previous report  (23)  and consistent with a previous theoretical predication  (24) . By contrast, the DMePDAPbI 4 -2 single crystal, which was based on a metastable orientational alignment, was formed from either a fast cooling  (22)  or antisolvent quenching during singlecrystal growth  (25) , both of which represent a fast-crystallization process. In comparison with DMePDAPbI 4 -1, DMePDAPbI 4 -2 had an emission wavelength that was red-shifted ~25 nm, which is consistent with the corresponding absorption data (fig.  S3 ). The average interlayer distances were comparable among these 2D structures (~10.10 to 10.39 Å), with that of BDAPbI 4 being the shortest. The corresponding hydrogen-bonding configurations for these three single-crystal structures (figs. S4, S5, and S6) were consistent with the analysis in Fig.  1B . We confirmed our design strategy by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculation.   We calculated the effect of organic molecules using the screened hybrid functional and van der Waals (vdW) interaction (HSE+vdW)  (26, 27) . The DMePDAPbI 4 -2 structure was indeed less stable than the DMePDAPbI 4 -1 structure. The energy level differences of the organic cations in BDAPbI 4 , DMePDAPbI 4 -1, and DMePDAPbI 4 -2 could be seen in the total density of states (DOSs) of the organic cations (the sum of states of C, N, and H atoms) (Fig.  1C ). The total DOS of BDA 2+ cations in BDAPbI 4 was lower in energy (farther from VBM) than that of DMePDA 2+ cations in DMePDAPbI 4 -1, which in turn was lower in energy compared with the total DOS of DMePDA 2+ cations in DMePDAPbI 4 -2. Thus, we expected the outof-plane hole transport to improve from BDAPbI 4 to DMePDAPbI 4 -2. Rapid perovskite film growth conditions from standard solution deposition also led to the formation of the metastable DMeP-DAPbI 4 -2 structure. The XRD patterns of the DMePDAPbI 4 thin film prepared by means of spin coating are shown in Fig.  2A . The powder XRD pattern measured from DMePDAPbI 4 -1 and DMePDAPbI 4 -2 single-crystal samples, along with the calculated powder XRD patterns shown in Fig.  2A  for comparison, revealed the differences of XRD patterns between these two single crystals. The XRD pattern of the thin-film sample matched that of the DMePDAPbI 4 -2 structure. A metastable polymorph does not mean it is unstable under synthetic or ambient conditions. The phase transformation between polymorphs requires 180°rotation of the alkyl chain, which is highly energetically unfavorable (Fig.  2B ) (figs. S7 and S8). A wide range of thin-film growth conditions from solution all formed DMePDAPbI 4 -2 thin films (fig.  S9 ). To test our hypothesis that the reduced energy barrier from the asymmetric bulky organic cation layer could facilitate charge transport between inorganic [PbI 6 ] sheets, we conducted time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements along the out-of-plane direction  (28) . In Fig.  2C , we compare the normalized TRMC results between several n = 1 2D perovskite thin films calibrated by their corresponding internal quantum yield of charges measured in devices. The out-of-plane transport for DMePDAPbI 4 (or more specifically, DMePDAPbI 4 -2) is about a factor of 4 to 5 faster than that of BDAPbI 4 , despite the slightly longer interlayer distance. Space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements further verified that the DMeP-DAPbI 4 -2 structure had faster out-of-plane hole transport than that of the DMePDAPbI 4 -1 structure (fig.  S10 ). These results confirmed the role of reducing the energy barrier for improving out-of-plane charge transport. The out-of-plane transport for the two 2D DJ structures (DMePDAPbI 4 and BDAPbI 4 ) was faster than those of the two 2D RP structures (BA 2 PbI 4 and PEA 2 PbI 4 ). These TRMC results were consistent with the current density-voltage (J-V) results of PSCs on the basis of the corresponding n = 1 2D structures (Fig.  2D  and table  S4 ). The DMePDAPbI 4 -based PSC reached a PCE of 4.90% (forward scan) and 4.33% (reverse scan), which is among the highest obtained thus far for any n = 1 2D lead iodide-based PSCs (6); the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum is shown in fig.  S11 . The use of 2D systems to passivate defects and enhance performance has recently been used in many polycrystalline PV technologies  (29) . We validated the impact of this metastable design motif with the use of DMePDAPbI 4 as a surface layer to improve the quality of 3D perovskite absorbers. We spin-coated the corresponding bulky organic halide salt in isopropanol (IPA) solution on top of a 3D perovskite absorber layer  (6) . Specifically, the DMePDAI 2 /IPA solution was coated atop (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbI 2 Br) 0.1 (CsPbI 3 ) 0.05 (or FA 0.85 MA 0.1 Cs 0.05 PbI 2.9 Br 0.1 ) followed by annealing, where FA is formamidinium and MA is methylammonium. The thin-film XRD  results suggested that the DMePDAPbI 4 -2 structure formed, as evidenced by the characteristic low-angle diffraction peak, at ~8.5°f or DMePDAPbI 4 -2, rather than ~8.7°for DMePDAPbI 4 -1 (Fig.  3A ). We also checked the 2D structures on top of three other common perovskite compositions of Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 PbI 3 , (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 , and FAPbI 3 (fig.  S12 ). For these compositions, the characteristics peaks at (002), (004), and (006) matched well to DMePDAPbI 4 -2, which were absent in the DMePDAPbI 4 -1 spectrum. Last, the low-angle diffraction peak associated with the 2D structure from the thin-film XRD results were further confirmed with grazingincidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements (fig.  S13 ). In terms of 2D surfacelayer topology and coverage, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements indicated that the treatment induced formation of a thin surface layer with small apparent grain sizes (figs. S14 and S15). The conductive-atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) measurements show that the current of the treated film is much more uniform and lower than that of the control film, which is consistent with the formation of a capping layer over the 3D perovskite layer (fig.  S16 ). To gain more insight into how the DMeP-DAI 2 modification affects the optoelectronic properties in perovskite films, we conducted steady-state photoluminescence (PL), timeresolved photoluminescence (TRPL), and TRMC studies on these samples. The DMePDAI 2 treatment led to enhanced PL intensity (fig.  S17 ), longer TRPL lifetime (fig.  S18  and table  S5 ), and improved TRMC mobility and lifetime (fig.  S19 ) that were consistent with the improved surface properties  (8, 30) . In addition, the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements showed that the 2D surface treatment improved the energetics for hole transport from the 3D perovskite to the 2D surface layer (fig.  S20 ). The impact of the DMePDAI 2 treatment on the perovskite surface chemistry was investigated with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Normalized core levels from key elements identified on the sample surface are included in figs. S21 and S22. The spectral shapes of most core levels showed minimal change between the two samples, indicating similar bonding environments, but surface treatment caused change in the C 1s and N 1s core levels. We fit the core levels (Fig.  3 , B to E) using constrained fitting procedures (summarized in tables S6 and S7). The control sample had a N 1s region whose relative peak areas were dominated by a C=NH 2 + (FA) peak (~401 eV) with a small shoulder to higher binding energy (~403 eV) that corresponded to C-NH 3 (MA). The DMePDAI 2 treatment increased the area of the C-NH 3 peak and also led to two additional peaks at a lower binding energy consistent with that of C-NH 2 (~400 eV) and the tertiary amine in DMePDAI 2 (~398 eV). Concomitant with these changes, redistribution occurred in the features in the C 1s spectra comprising four main peaks that are consistent with primarily C-C or C-H (~285 eV), N-CH 3 (~287 eV), HC(NH 2 ) 2 (~289 eV), and C-O or C=O bonds (~290 eV). The surface treatment decreased the concentration of HC(NH 2 ) 2 bonds from FA on the surface while simultaneously increasing the amount of N-CH 3 and C-C or C-H bonds. In addition, XPS revealed that surface treatment increased the amount of halide on the surface, from about 2.6 halide-to-lead ratio for the control to 3.1 for the DMePDAI 2 -treated film. Collectively, these results suggest that both organic and halide components of the additive incorporated into the top surface of the treated films. Undercoordinated lead can cause donor defects on the surface, resulting in downward band bending and increased recombination centers  (31) , so the increase in the halideto-lead ratio associated with the formation of 2D interfacial component upon surface treatment was consistent with a less defective surface. We investigated the impact of DMePDAI 2 surface treatment on the PV performance by fabricating PSCs using the standard n-i-p device architecture, glass/FTO/electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL)/ Au, where ETL is TiO 2 or SnO 2 and HTL is spiro-OMeTAD, with more details in the supplementary materials  (23) . Typical cross-section SEM images of devices are shown in fig.  S23 . In Fig.  4A , we compare the J-V curves of the PSCs on the basis of triple-cation-mixedhalide FA 0.85 MA 0.1 Cs 0.05 PbI 2.9 Br 0.1 without and with DMePDAI 2 treatment under simulated 100-mW/cm 2 air mass coefficient (AM) 1.5 G 4 of 6 illumination (Table  1 ). With the surface treatment, the device PCE increased from about 20.9 to 24.0% from forward scan and from 20.4 to 23.7% from reverse scan. The PCE improvement is also consistent with a better perovskite-HTL junction on the basis of the cross-sectional Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements (fig.  S24 )  (32) . The optimum concentration for DMePDAI 2 -surface treatment was found at 0.5 mg/mL (fig.  S25 ). In addition to the FA 0.85 MA 0.1 Cs 0.05 PbI 2.9 Br 0.1 perovskite composition, we also examined the impact of DMePDAI 2 surface treatment on PSCs on the basis of double-cation-mixedhalide (FA 0.97 MA 0.03 PbI 2.91 Br 0.09 ) and singlecation-single-halide (MAPbI 3 ) using ETL of SnO 2 and TiO 2 , respectively, and found PCE improvements for both compositions (Fig.  4,  B  and C ). Noteworthy for PSCs based on FA 0.97 MA 0.03 PbI 2.91 Br 0.09 , the PCE was improved from 22.0 to 24.7% from forward scan and from 21.8 to 24.5% from reverse scan, with shortcircuit current density (J sc ) > 25 mA/cm 2 , which is in agreement with the EQE spectrum (fig.  S26 ). For all three perovskite compositions, the stabilized power outputs (SPOs) for PSCs based on the control and DMePDAI 2 -modified perovskite thin films matched well with the J-V mea-surements (Fig.  4 , A to C, insets, and Table  1 ). The PCE improvement for all three perovskite compositions was reproducible on the basis of the statistical comparison (fig.  S27 ). The devices with this treatment also exhibited higher PCE than that of devices based on other surface treatments with similar length of bulky organic salts for either RP or DJ 2D perovskites (fig.  S28 ). Last, we checked the operation stability of unencapsulated FA 0.85 MA 0.1 Cs 0.05 PbI 2.9 Br 0.1 -based PSCs using maximum power point (MPP) tracking at ~40°C in N 2 , following the ISOS-L-1 stability protocol  (33) . The DMePDAI 2 -modified PSC (Fig.  4D ) showed only 10% relative efficiency drop after 1000 hours of continuous operation, whereas the PCE of the control device decreased by ~43%. The stability improvement with DMePDAI 2 surface treatment was also observed when the devices were tested at high-moisture (>85% relative humidity) or high-temperature (85°C) conditions (figs. S29 and S30). These results suggest that the DMePDAI 2 -modification to form a 2D DJ phase surface layer is a general way to improve PSC performance. Our use of the metastable 2D DJ structure through hydrogen bonding tuning based on asymmetric bulky organic molecules represents a promising chemical design element for perovskite interfacial engineering to enhance PSC efficiency and stability.    ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""FA0.97MA0.03PbI2.91Br0.09"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TinOxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""DMePDAI 2"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": ""20.9"", ""treated_pce"": ""24.0"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}, ""test_1_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL1"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""40"", ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": ""22.0"", ""treated_pce"": ""24.7"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.9"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.57""}}"
2781,48_3," Photocurrent TPV measurement. TPV measurement has been a well-established method to measure the device carrier recombination lifetime.  [4]  In the measurement, the devices were stimulated by laser pulses (337 nm) to generate a small transient photovoltaic signal. A large resistance of 1 M Ohm was connected in serial with the devices so that the photo generated carriers could be effectively c-AFM and TEM measurements. The c-AFM studies were carried using a commercial AFM system (MFP-3D, Asylum Research, USA) equipped with conductive probes (PPP-EFM, Nanosensors). The photocurrent mapping was measured under 0 V bias and the dark current mapping was measured with a bias of 0.5 V. High resolution TEM analyses were carried out on a FEI OSIRIS microscope. The cross-sectional samples were prepared by using focused-ion-beam equipment (FEI Helios 660). Water stability analysis. The water stability test was performed in air under room temperature. Purified water was used to prevent current leakage. The samples without further encapsulation was immersed in water and the photovoltaic output was recorded by a multimeter.    of the perovskite fi lms by superhydrophobic insulating layers, which dramatically enhances resistance of perovskite solar cells to water-caused damage without further encapsulation. The tunneling junctions applied in silicon solar cells, which resulted in the most effi cient silicon solar panels in the world, are comprised of an insulating oxide or a thin-layer of amorphous silicon (HIT structure) inserted between the intrinsic silicon and the heavily-doped silicon layer or indium-tin-oxide (ITO) layer. The tunneling junctions have been shown to suppress the charge recombination at contacts and passivate the surface to increase device effi ciency.  [ 8 ]  The inserted insulating layer can selectively conduct one type of charges while block the other type, which spatially separates photogenerated electrons and holes to reduce their recombination, because the charge selection electrodes or charge transport layers have energymatching electronic states for one type of charges to tunnel into but not for the other type.  [ 9 ]  The oxide or amorphous silicon layers are generally deposited by relatively high temperature vacuum process, which is however not compatible for perovskite solar cells. Encouragingly, we found that the low temperature solution-coated polymeric insulating layers could play the same function, which potentially makes it low-cost and simple to be applied. Figure  1  a shows the structure of the devices in this study where the tunneling junction locates at the cathode side. An insulating polymer is inserted between the perovskite and the electron collecting fullerene (C 60 ) layers, and the proposed energy diagram in Figure  1  b is also shown to illustrate the function of insulating layer in transporting electrons and blocking holes in the perovskite layer. Photogenerated electrons at conduction band minimal (CBM) of the perovskite layer can tunnel to the excited electronic states in C 60 , followed by their relaxation to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of C 60 , because there are energy-matching unoccupied states in C 60 for electrons to tunneling into. On the contrary, these are no energy-matching states in C 60 which could allow the holes to tunnel into. Therefore, the tunneling rate of holes from perovskite to C 60 will be very low. The thin insulating layer thus allows the transport of photogenerated electrons in perovskite to C 60 layer by tunneling, and also blocks the photogenerated holes back into the perovskite layer. Therefore, the insulating tunneling layer causes a spatial separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes, which reduces their recombination at the contact of the perovskite and electron transport layers. The perovskite fi lms in this study were made by the interdiffusion method.  [ 10 ]  Poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) was chosen as the hole transporting layer because of the much larger perovskite grain size formed on the non-wetting surface of PTAA.  [ 5 ]  The PTAA fi lm was doped by 1.0 wt% 2,3,5,6-Tetrafl uoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) to increase its conductivity, Organolead trihalide perovskite (OTP) materials have drawn tremendous attention in the past years because of their great promise to fabricate next generation of low-cost and highly efficient solar cells.  [ 1, 2 ]  The power conversion effi ciency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has rocketed in the last few years, which has been ascribed to the excellent optoelectronic properties and unique defects physics that originates the low carrier recombination in perovskite polycrystalline thin fi lms.  [ 3 ]  Charge recombination in the grain interior can be negligible due to the absence of deep traps in OTP grains which also enables a carrier diffusion length signifi cantly longer than the optical attenuation length in their single crystals.  [ 2, 4 ]  Even in polycrystalline perovskite thin fi lms, the carrier diffusion lengths can still be much longer than the light penetration length, thanks to the enlarging grains and improving crystallinity of the perovskite fi lms with recent rapid improvement in material morphology controlling.  [ 5, 6 ]  The enlargement of grains also signifi cantly reduces carrier recombination at perovskite grain boundaries (GBs), which is facilitated by the advance of passivation techniques to further reduce recombination at GBs and fi lm surface.  [ 7 ]  Now that the photogenerated carriers can fl ow through perovskite fi lms with negligible charge recombination, minimizing the charge recombination at the contacts becomes increasingly important to achieve highly effi cient perovskite solar cells. Inspired by the success of applying tunneling contacts in silicon solar cells, in this paper, we report an insulating tunneling layer inserted between the perovskite and the electron collection layer in perovskite solar cells can reduce charge recombination. Many insulating polymers, including commercial plastic foam which is broadly used for packaging, can form a tunneling contact at the cathode side. The tunneling contact allows the transport of electrons from perovskite to cathode, while block holes into the perovskite layer. Devices with these insulating materials exhibited an increased PCE of 20.3% under 1 sun illumination. This simple nonlattice-matching structure enables the capping COMMUNICATION which was found important in increasing perovskite device fi ll factor.  [ 11 ]  Three insulating polymers, polystyrene (PS), Tefl on, and polyvinylidene-trifl uoroethylene copolymer (PVDF-TrFE), were randomly chosen for the tunneling materials in this study. The molecular structures are shown in Figure  S1  of the Supporting Information. The details of device fabrication can be found in the Experimental Section. The insulating polymers spun on the perovskite fi lms could form a conformal tunneling layer, as verifi ed by the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) cross-section image of the devices. As shown in Figure  1 c , the spun PS layer with a thickness of 1-2 nm conformably covers the perovskite layer. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of a perovskite fi lm before and after depositing PS insulating layer were shown in Figure  S2  of the Supporting Information, which reveals a good coverage of the perovskite fi lm by PS at micrometer scale. Figure  2  a shows the photocurrent curves of perovskite devices with different insulating polymers inserted and that of the control device with 20 nm [ 6 ] -phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) to replace the insulating polymer layer. The control device has a short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 21.1 mA cm  -2  , an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.07 V, a fi ll factor (FF) of 74.9%, and a PCE of 16.9%, which represent a typical performance of PCBM passivated perovskite devices.  [ 11 ]  In a striking contrast, the devices with polymer tunneling contacts exhibited an increased J SC and FF. The devices with PS, PVDF-TrFE, and Tefl on tunneling layer showed higher J SC of 22.9, 22.9, and 22.8 mA cm -2 , respectively. Meanwhile, the FFs for devices with inserted PS, PVDF-TrFE, and Tefl on tunneling contacts were also increased to 79.6%, 77.6%, and 75.6%, respectively. The performances of perovskite devices with different tunneling layers were also summarized in Table  1  . It should be mentioned that the V OC of the perovskite devices with tunneling contacts fabricated from different batches slightly varied between 1.05 and 1.11 V. Statistic V OC distributions of 50 samples in Figure  S3  of the Supporting Information show that the devices with tunneling contacts have a higher average V OC of 1.07 V, compared with 1.05 V of the control devices. The statistics of PCE in Figure  2  b , J SC , FF distributions in Figure  S3  of the Supporting Information demonstrate the reliability and the repeatability of the performance enhancement by the tunneling contacts. The universal performance enhancement by different insulating polymers and no change of trap density measured by thermal admittance spectroscopy belittle the possibility of chemical bonding formation between perovskite and the insulating polymers, because chemical reaction should be sensitive to the chemical structure of the polymers. It indicates the polymer only physically contact to the perovskite and act as tunneling layer. It was interesting that the PS plastic foam, which is broadly used for packaging, worked as well to get a PCE more than 19.0%. A picture of the PS plastic foam used in this study is shown in Figure  1 c . The perovskite device with PS from dissolved foam as the tunneling layer exhibited a J SC of 22.9 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.07 V, a FF of 80.3%, and a PCE of 19.6%. The device performance is even slightly higher than those of the devices with other three polymers with higher purity. The release of constraint of high material purity for highly effi cient perovskite devices might make perovskite solar cells even more competitive in the future market. Since the tunneling probability strongly depends on tunneling-layer thickness, the thickness of the tunneling layer should signifi cantly infl uence the electron extraction effi ciency and thus device effi ciency.  [ 12 ]  Figure  2 c  shows the photocurrent curves of perovskite devices with PS layers of different thicknesses which were tuned by varying the concentration of PS solution in the spin-coating process. As shown in Figure  2 c , for PS solution with a concentration of 0.02%, the device showed a J SC of 20.8 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.05 V, a FF of 75.1% and a PCE of 16.4%, which is comparable to that of the PCBM-passivated devices. This can be explained by the fact that the PS layer formed from the solution with such low PS concentration is barely continuous, and thus the device resembles the control device without PS layer. When the PS concentration was increased to 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1.0%, the photocurrents were signifi cantly increased to 22.0, 22.8, and 22.9 mA cm -2 , respectively. The best devices were made by 1.0% PS solution, exhibiting a V OC of 1.10 V, a J SC of 22.9 mA cm -2 , a FF of 80.6%, and a PCE of 20.3% from the photocurrent scanning. For these devices, the PS layer thickness was estimated to be 1-2 nm from the high resolution TEM shown in Figure  1 c . Further increasing PS layer thickness severely reduced the J SC , V OC , and FF to 20.0 mA cm -2 , 1.03 V, and 49.0%, respectively, because the increased tunneling layer thickness reduced electron tunneling rate. Figure  2 d  show the average external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of devices with PS and PCBM as the contact layer.   b ) the energy diagram that illustrates the principle of suppressing surface charge recombination by the insulating layer. The insulating layer suppresses charge recombination by separating the excess electrons and holes in the electron transport layer and perovskite layer, respectively; c) A transmission electron microscopy cross-section image of a 19.6% effi ciency device revealing the presence of 1-2 nm PS layer between perovskite and electron transport layer.

2782,48_5," COMMUNICATION When fl uoro-silane was deposited on top of the perovskite fi lms, tiny amount of H 2 O that exists in the perovskite fi lms will trigger the hydroxylation of silanes to form silanols. Then the silanols will automatically undergoes a cross-linking process by forming Si-O-Si (siloxane) bonds, which makes this insulating layer robust to protect the underneath perovskite fi lms from water attacking. The devices with the fl uoro-silane layer also showed a good effi ciency of 18.9% (Figure  2  a), which is comparable to the performance of devices with other types of tunneling contacts. Encouragingly, the hydrophobic polymer protected devices showed much better resistance to water damage. As shown by the photos in Figure  3  b,c, the perovskite device with fl uoro-silane layer without further encapsulation showed negligible color change after it was soaked in water for 3 min, while the control device with 20 nm PCBM changed to yellow color after it was immersed in water for less than 5 s. The operation of the unencapsulated device in water was also demonstrated in Figure  3 d , showing a V OC of 1.09 V which is slightly higher than that of the device measured under one sun condition (Figure  2 a ). The slight variation in V OC might be caused by the optical effect of the water or glass beaker which slightly change the light illumination intensity to increase device V OC . The stable operation of the perovskite devices in water indicates the very good conformal coating of the nanometer thick insulting layer onto perovskite layers. Improving the moisture stability of perovskite solar cells has drawn great research attention recently.  [ 17 ]  The demonstration of stable device operation in water represents a major progress in stabilizing the perovskite solar cells in addition to the improved stability in air or moisture, though atomic conformal coverage of the perovskite by the polymer without any pin-holes is still challenging to achieve over very large device area with spin-coating. The performance enhancement in our devices is primarily ascribed to the function of tunneling layer in extracting electrons and blocking holes. To demonstrate that, conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) measurement was conducted to characterize the local dark-current and photocurrent of perovskite samples with or without PS tunneling layer at nanoscopic level. The samples for dark-current measurements have the structure of ITO/PTAA: F4-TCNQ/perovskite/with or without PS. Since both PTAA and the Pt-coated AFM conductive tip have a high work function as well, the measured current is essentially a hole current. As shown in Figure  4  a,b, the local dark current reduced after coating the PS layer, proving the function of PS in blocking holes. The uniform reduction of hole current across the whole mapping area indicates a conformal coating of PS on the perovskite fi lm. The samples for photocurrent measurement had the structure of ITO/ PTAA:F4-TCNQ/perovskite/with or without PS/C 60 . In the  measurement, the c-AFM tips contacted C 60 surface to map the photocurrent of samples illuminated by a white light source with an intensity of 20 mW cm -2 . Since there is an electronaccepting layer, electrons can be collected by C 60 and conduct to the tip. Figure  4 c, d  shows the photocurrent mapping results of the perovskite samples without or with the PS tunneling layer, respectively. The samples without PS tunneling layer showed a photocurrent ranging from 0 to 0.8 pA with a very good reproducibility. After inserting a PS contact, the local photocurrent through most grains increased to >4 pA, directly proving the function of PS tunneling layer in enhancing the photocurrent output. The function of the tunneling layer is also confi rmed at macroscopic level using the single-carrier devices with or without PS tunneling layer. The electron only devices have the structure of ITO/C 60 /perovskite/with or without PS/C 60 /Al, and the hole only devices have the structure of ITO/with or without PS/perovskite/Au, which are shown in the insets of Figure  4  e,f. The tunneling layer spatially separates photogenerated electrons and holes at the perovskite/polymer interface by transporting electrons and blocking holes, which should lead to the reduction of the carrier surface recombination. To verify it, we compared the carrier recombination lifetimes of devices with or without PS contact by transient photovoltage spectroscopy (TPV). As shown in the Figure  4  g, carrier recombination lifetime is longer in the device with PS tunneling contact, compared with the control device (PCBM passivated) at all the light intensity range. The carrier lifetime of the control device under one sun illumination is 0.5 μs which corresponds to the typical TPV lifetime of the PCBM passivated devices.  [ 18 ]  The device with PS contact have a much longer carrier lifetime of 1.6 μs under one sun illumination, demon- strating the suppressed carrier recombination in devices with the tunneling contacts. The increased carrier lifetime extends the carrier diffusion length to increase device J SC and FF. Meanwhile, the suppressed carrier recombination is also benefi cial to the increase of V OC as observed in the devices with tunneling contacts. In conclusion, we demonstrated that inserting a tunneling layer between perovskite and electron transport layer could signifi cantly increase device performance by suppressing carrier recombination at the cathode contact. The tunneling layer can also serve as an encapsulation layer to prevent perovskite fi lm from damage caused by water or moisture. This method is simple because it does not need lattice matching between the buffer layer and perovskite. The low temperature solution process makes it compatible with many types of perovskite materials, and may be applied for anode contact as well. The freedom to choose any insulating layer for contact enables more device designs and manufacturing.  Photocurrent-voltage curve and EQE measurements.

2796,32_3,"Figure S5: The equivalent ionic size of CH 3 NH 3 + can be estimated by the trend of lattice constants of CH 3 NH 3 MI 3 , where M=Si, Ge, Sn, Pb. At the ideal condition of perovskite AMX 3 , the ionic size meet the condition of (r A +r X )/ 2 (r M +r X ) = 1. In this case, the ideal lattice constant is 2×(r M +r X ). The undersized A atom will shrink the ideal lattice constant and oversized A atom will expand ideal lattice constant. To evaluate the extremely high optical absorption of halide perovskites, the optical absorption coeffi cients of two representative halide perovskites, CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 and CsSnI 3 ,  [ 2, 18 ]  are calculated and compared with the optical absorption of GaAs: the absorber of the thin-fi lm solar cell with the highest conversion effi ciency. The optical absorption of a semiconductor at photonic energy ω, according to the Fermi Golden rule, is directly correlated with 2 ˆ2 2 8 3 3 v H c 2 8 3 d k π π δ ( ) c v ω Ec Ev k k k ∫ Ev k ,  [ 19 ]  where v H c is the transition matrix from states in the valence band (VB) to states in the conduction band (CB) and the integration is over the whole reciprocal space. For simplicity, the transition matrix v H c can be considered independent of k and the absorption formula is approximately 2 ˆ2 8 2 3 3 v H c 2 3 d k π π δ ( ) c v ω Ec Ev k k k Ev k ∫ , where the second term is the joint density of states (JDOS) at energy ω. Our calculations show that the transition matrices of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 and GaAs near the optical absorption edges do not have signifi cant differences. Therefore, the JDOSs determines the optical absorption difference between these two materials. Our calculations show a large difference in JDOS, and therefore in optical absorptions, in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 and GaAs. The lower part of the GaAs CB is derived from the dispersive s band (dilute s electron); whereas, the lower part of the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 CB is mainly composed of Pb p bands (Figure  S1 , Supporting Information). The atomic p states have two more orbitals than the s states and exhibit less dispersion. As a result, the density of states (DOS) in the lower CB of the halide perovskites is signifi cantly higher than that of GaAs as shown in Figure  1  a, leading to higher JDOS (Figure  1 b ), and therefore, stronger optical absorption for halide perovskites. The calculated optical absorption coeffi cients of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 , CsSnI 3 and GaAs are shown in Figure  1 c . It is seen that the optical absorption coeffi cient of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 is up to 1 order of magnitude higher than that of GaAs within the visible light range. As the visible light range accounts for the major usable portion of the full solar spectrum, high visible light absorption is critical for achieving high effi ciency cells. Current high efficiency thin-fi lm solar cell absorbers such as CdTe, CIGS and Cu 2 ZnSnSe 4 (CZTSe) have similar chemical characters in their CBs  [20] [21] [22] [23]  as GaAs and thus they have weaker optical absorption above the absorption edge than CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . The strong optical transitions of halide perovskite originate from two key features in halide perovskites: (i) The realization of p-p transition. Sn and Pb are elements that may have n s 2 electron confi gurations, the so called lone-pair s electrons.  [ 24 ]  In halides, these s states will not lose their s electrons and thus the lower parts of the CBs of Sn or Pb halide perovskites are mainly derived from the unoccupied Sn/Pb p orbitals [Figure  S1 ]. The Organic-inorganic hybrid halide perovskites such as CH 3 NH 3 PbX 3 (X = Cl, Br, I), have attracted great attention as absorbers for solar cells.  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16]  Recent reports have shown that these perovskites have very long electron-hole diffusion lengths  [ 15, 16 ]  and a simple planar heterojunction solar cell based on CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3-x Cl x , with the same structure as conventional thin-fi lm solar cells, can have solar-to-electricity conversion efficiencies of over 15 percent.  [ 11 ]  Remarkably, however, the cell has an absorbing perovskite layer as thin as only 330 nm; yet it achieves an open circuit voltage as high as 1.07 V.  [ 11 ]  This performance is comparable to the best single-crystal GaAs and polycrystalline Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 thin-fi lm solar cell and outperforms current polycrystalline thin-fi lm solar cells based on CdTe and Cu 2 ZnSn(Se,S) 4 .  [ 17 ]  In contrast to the rapid increase in effi ciency, the fundamental mechanisms concerning how halide perovskite solar cells can work so well are still unknown. Furthermore, the present effi ciency is still much below the theoretical limit for single-junction solar cell and the guidance to improve solar cell performance is urgently required. Here we show by a systematic theoretical study that halide perovskites exhibit a number of unique properties: (i) Much higher optical absorptions than conventional thin-fi lm solar cell absorber. Ultrahigh optical absorption enables the use of ultrathin absorbers in which photogenerated carriers do not have to travel far before they are collected, and consequently lead to a low non-radiative recombination rate. (ii) Strong s-p anti-bonding coupling, which leads to small effective masses for both electrons and holes. This ensures effi cient solar cells with a p-i-n confi guration. (iii) Dominant shallow point defects. All point defects with low formation energies are found to generate only shallow defect states. (iv) Intrinsically benign grain boundaries (GBs). GBs do not generate any gap states, making polycrystalline halide perovskite thin fi lms single-crystal-like. These superior photovoltaic properties explain the long carrier diffusion length and high effi ciency reported with lead halide perovskites. We further reveal that these unique properties are attributed to the combination of perovskite symmetry and the existence of the lone-pair s orbitals, which enable halide perovskite semiconductors to have direct bandgap p-p transition. The direct bandgap p-p optical transition is generally much stronger than the p-s transition seen in common thin-fi lm solar cell upper VBs are mainly halogen p orbitals mixed with a small component of Pb/Sn s . Therefore, the full occupation of lonepair s orbitals below the valence band maximum (VBM) makes the pp transitions possible. (ii) The direct bandgap. In halide perovskites, the CBM is at the R point due to the p-p coupling in O h symmetry.  [ 25 ]  Meanwhile, the VBM is formed by the antibonding coupling between the lone-pair ns 2 orbitals and the halogen element p orbitals. With a local O h symmetry, such antibonding s-p coupling is particularly strong at the R point and thus results in a direct bandgap at the R point. These two features make halide perovskites direct-gap p-p transition semiconductors. Furthermore, the strong s-p coupling enhances the dispersion of the upper VB [Figure  S1 ] and results in a small effective mass for holes. Our calculated electronic structures are consistent with previous report on halide perovskites.  [ 26, 27 ]  The calculated hole effective masses of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 and CsSnI 3 [Table  S1 ] are much smaller than that of GaAs, CIS, CZTSe, and CdTe whose VBMs have no s-p coupling. The unique small effective masses for both electrons and holes and high absorption coeffi cients make these halide perovskites ideal candidates for solar cells having a p-i-n confi guration. In GaAs, CIS, CZTSe, and CdTe, the effective masses are much larger for holes than for electrons, therefore, solar cells based on these materials rely on the formation of p-n junctions. Our calculated effective mass for CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 is comparable to the previous theoretical results.  [ 28 ]  The optical absorption coeffi cient strongly affects the quantum effi ciency of a solar cell, which is not considered in the well-known Shockley-Queisser limit.  [ 29 ]  For a real solar cell, the theoretical maximum effi ciency depends on the thickness of the absorber layer. After taking the absorption coeffi cient and absorber layer thickness into consideration, we have calculated the maximum effi ciencies of some common light absorbers as a function of the thickness of the absorber layers (shown in Figure  1 d ). The three halide perovskites (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 , CsSnI 3 , and CsPbI 3 ) exhibit much higher conversion effi ciencies than GaAs, CIS and CZTSe for any given thickness. More importantly, the halide perovskites are capable of achieving high effi ciencies with very thin absorber layers. For example, with a 0.3 µm absorber (similar to the thickness of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3-x Cl x in the 15.4% perovskite based cell  [ 11 ]  ), CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 based cells can have a maximum effi ciency up to 21%, while it is only 13% for a GaAs-based solar cell. The results are consistent with many of today's most common thin-fi lm solar cells (GaAs, CdTe, CIGS and CZTSS) -the absorbers must be about 2 µm thick to achieve high effi ciencies.  [ 30 ]  It should be noted that not all p-p optical transitions can result in high optical absorption. For examples, Si has p-p optical transitions, but has an indirect bandgap, and therefore does not have high optical absorption. We fi nd that the perovskite symmetry plays a critical role in establishing strong direct bandgap p-p optical transitions and appropriate bandgaps for solar cell applications. An ideal perovskite structure possesses a local O h symmetry.  [ 31 ]  However, most perovskites exhibit distortions and reduced local symmetries. In order to form a perfect perovskite phase AMX 3 , the bond lengths among the three constituent elements should satisfy a stringent requirement,  [ 32 ]  i.e., the bond length ratio, t = (r A +r X )/ 2(r M +r X ), should be equal to 1. This stringent requirement is often not satisfi edmost cations at A sites are not large enough, leading to buckling and distortion in many perovskite structures. Likewise, the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite exhibits many distorted phases such as the phases with 3 Pm m, Pbnm , I4/mcm and Pmnb symmetries  [ 31, [33] [34] [35]     S2 ]. The small distortions do not change signifi cantly the electronic properties: such as optical absorption, bandgap, and electron and hole effective masses [Figure  S3 ]. Therefore, these phases still show higher conversion effi ciencies than GaAs. The Pmnb phase, however, has a signifi cant distortion that causes some Pb-I bond breakings. The Pb-I bond breaking weakens the s-p coupling and leads to an increased bandgap (2.31 eV) and heavier hole effective masses. Therefore, our results suggest that to achieve the best effi ciencies, the three-dimensional Pb-I bond framework in AMX 3 perovskites should not been broken. Since it directly affects the performance of solar cells, the structural distortion of halide perovskites deserves further investigation. The distortion in a perovskite can be quantitatively determined by the bond length ratio t . The ratio t for halide perovskites can be tuned in different halide perovskites by choosing the appropriate combination of Sn, Pb, and halogen elements. Figure  2 b  shows clear correlations between perovskite stability and t . Larger t value deviations from 1 have a larger structure distortion. The results suggest that mixing Br and/or Cl with I in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 would help stabilize the perovskite phase, which could partially explain the improvement of cell performance when mixing Cl.  [ 5, 11 ]  Furthermore, proper alloying of Sn and Pb, or/and halogen elements (I, Br, Cl, F) could optimize the bandgaps for solar cell applications. Figure  2  b gives a guideline for engineering the bandgap and phase stability of perovskites to achieve solar cells with improved performance. It is worthy to note that high-concentration alloying may result in the problem of miscibility gap and band gap increase. The actual Cl concentration in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3-x Cl x were reported to be below 4%,  [ 36, 37 ]  even though the ratio in precursor could be 33.3%.  [ 38 ]  The small amount of Cl was believed to dramatically improve the charge transport.  [ 37 ]  The exact effects of small-amount Cl/Br alloying in halide perovskites deserve further investigations. In thin-fi lm solar cells, shallow acceptors (donors) are responsible for p -type ( n -type) doping. However, defects with energy levels deep in the band gaps act as Shockley-Read-Hall non-radiative recombination centers, which are mainly responsible for short minority carrier lifetime, and therefore, low V oc . For The results suggest that the dominant defects in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 are shallow defects. Furthermore, CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 could be grown either n -type or p -type by manipulating the chemical potentials (growth conditions). The detailed point defect properties have been studied in Ref. [ 39 ] . The superior defect properties of halide perovskite are possibly due to the strong sp coupling at VBM. This is similar to the case in CIGS  [ 24 ]  where shallow V Cu dominates the defects and is partially responsible for the higheffi ciency of CIGS-based solar cells. In polycrystalline semiconductor absorbers, GBs also play important roles. In most solar cell absorbers such as GaAs, CIGS, CZTS, and CdTe, intrinsic GBs create deep levels in band gaps and are considered detrimental for solar cell performance.  [ 35, [40] [41] [42]  Surprisingly, however, we fi nd that grain boundaries in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 are intrinsically benign. Figure  4  a shows the atomic structure of a supercell containing two Σ5(310) grain boundaries with the exact same structure in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . We choose Σ5(310) GB because it consists of typical features of GBs in semiconductor, such as wrong bonds, dangling bonds and extra bonds and, therefore, the results are representative. Other GB confi gurations have been explored (e.g., Σ3(111) GB) and have consistently yielded band gaps that are essentially free from defect states.  [ 43 ]  The atomic structure is adopted from the same GB in perovskite SrTiO 3 , whose atomic structure has been determined by atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy  [ 44 ]  [Figure  S4 ]. The DOS analysis [Figure  4  b] shows that the GBs do not generate any states in the bandgap of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . The benign GB properties could be explained In summary, we have shown that CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 based perovskites exhibit intrinsic properties that are superior for solar cell applications: extremely high optical absorption; small effective masses for electrons and holes; dominant point defects that only generate shallow levels; grain boundaries that are completely benign. These unique properties can be understood from the perovskite symmetry and Pb lonepair 6s orbitals. Our results explain why CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 related materials have long electron-hole diffusion length and their thinfi lm solar cells can achieve high effi ciencies and high open-circuit voltage. These results further point the way towards achieving even higher effi ciencies through metal or/and halogen element alloying. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Methylammonium Lead Iodide"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}"
2814,104_13," Time Resolved Photoluminescence Time resolved photoluminescence lifetimes were collected using a 532 nm picosecond pulsed diode laser (Picoquant; LDH-P-FA-530-B) adjusted the repetition rate using a pulse generator (Stanford Research; DG535). The excitation power was adjusted using neutral density filters and focused to a spot size of ~100 μm in diameter. The emission from the film was collected and collimated using an off-axis parabolic mirror (Thorlabs; MPD269V) and measured with a silicon single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detector (Micro Photon Devices; $PD-100-C0C). Scattered laser excitation was suppressed using a 532 nm notch filter (Chroma; ZET532NF) and a 550 nm longpass filter (Thorlabs; FELH0550). The 532 nm laser harmonic was suppressed using a 900 nm shortpass filter (Thorlabs; FESH0900). Photon arrival times were recorded using a time-correlated single photon counting card (Picoquant; PicoHarp 300) and all analysis was performed in Matlab. The carrier density was 1.125×10 15 cm -3 . Optical Pump -THz Probe (OPTP) Spectroscopy. The perovskite thin films for OPTP was prepared by using 0.5 M concentration with same spin coating parameters. The time-resolved optical pump and THz probe spectroscopy was performed by utilizing 100-fs laser pulses generated from a 1-kHz Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (Spitfire Ace Pro, Spectra Physics) operating at 800 nm. Optical pump pulses at 400 nm were achieved by second harmonic generation in a beta barium borate (BBO) crystal, whereas THz pulses serving as the probe beam were generated by optical rectification in a 2-mm-thick ZnTe crystal and detected by electro-optic sampling method. The pump-induced THz transmission changes were then measured by using a lock-in-Amplifier (SR830, Stanford Research Systems) depending on the time delay between the pump and probe beams controlled by a motorized stage, while the 400-nm pump pulses were modulated at 190 Hz by the optical chopper. All the measurements were performed under 2% humidity by purging the entire THz beam path with dry air. Supplementary Figure  15 .   Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are an emerging photovoltaic technology with the potential to disrupt the mature silicon solar cell market. Great improvements in device performance over the past few years, thanks to the development of fabrication protocols  [1] [2] [3]  , chemical compositions  4, 5  and phase stabilization methods  [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]  , have made PSCs one of the most efficient and low-cost solutionprocessable photovoltaic technologies. However, the light-harvesting performance of these devices is still limited by excessive charge carrier recombination. Despite much effort, the performance of the best-performing PSCs is capped by relatively low fill factors and high open-circuit voltage deficits (the radiative open-circuit voltage limit minus the high open-circuit voltage)  11  . Improvements in charge carrier management, which is closely tied to the fill factor and the open-circuit voltage, thus provide a path towards increasing the device performance of PSCs, and reaching their theoretical efficiency limit  12  . Here we report a holistic approach to improving the performance of PSCs through enhanced charge carrier management. First, we develop an electron transport layer with an ideal film coverage, thickness and composition by tuning the chemical bath deposition of tin dioxide (SnO 2 ). Second, we decouple the passivation strategy between the bulk and the interface, leading to improved properties, while minimizing the bandgap penalty. In forward bias, our devices exhibit an electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of up to 17.2 per cent and an electroluminescence energy conversion efficiency of up to 21.6 per cent. As solar cells, they achieve a certified power conversion efficiency of 25.2 per cent, corresponding to 80.5 per cent of the thermodynamic limit of its bandgap. SnO 2 -based electron transport layers (ETLs) offer favourable band alignment, while being processable at low temperature  [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]  . Of the various deposition methods, SnO 2 nanoparticle-based ETLs have demonstrated the best performances thus far. However, SnO 2 nanoparticle-based PSCs exhibit relatively low electroluminescence external quantum efficiency (EQE) values, and hence higher open-circuit voltage (V OC ) deficits (defined as the radiative V OC limit minus the high V OC ), compared to TiO 2 -based PSCs 8 , in spite of efforts to eliminate non-radiative recombination pathways  19  . The electroluminescence EQE of a photovoltaic device, determined by measuring the luminescence efficiency under forward bias, is a direct measure of the radiative efficiency of carrier recombination. The electroluminescence EQE can be used to quantify the non-radiative contribution to the V OC deficit via the reciprocity theorem, and is a useful metric for solar cell characterization  11, 20  . Thus, it is crucial to develop strategies that minimize photovoltage losses at the ETL/perovskite interface so as to minimize the V OC deficit, encouraging the search for a different deposition method that can develop the full potential of SnO 2 ETLs. The ideal SnO 2 ETL will generate a high photovoltage and fill factor by having complete and conformal coverage without pinholes, an ideal band alignment to efficiently extract electrons while blocking hole back-transfer, a low defect density to prevent detrimental interface recombinations, and will also be thin enough to promote efficient charge extraction  21  .

2820,104_20," Effect of the MAPbBr 3 additive In addition to engineering the physical and electrical properties of the ETL, further improvements in PSC performance can be achieved by improving the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite active layer. An ideal active layer should present a high absorption profile to maximize carrier generation with long carrier lifetimes and mobilities for efficient carrier collection. This requires developing strategies to improve crystal grain size and carrier lifetime, while preventing the formation of detrimental traps at the bulk and interfaces. Notably, improving the efficiency of PSCs requires the decoupling of the passivation strategies for the bulk and the interface because the type and concentration of defects affect them differently. In the second part of our holistic approach, we show that only a trace amount of methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr 3 ) (<1 mol%) is needed to stabilize the perovskite active layer, with the benefit of improved optoelectronic properties. Figure  3  shows the characterization of perovskite thin films passivated with a two-dimensional perovskite, with the bulk perovskite fabricated with the addition of various amounts of MAPbBr 3 . An increase in grain size with decreasing amounts of MAPbBr 3 is clear in the SEM images of Fig.  3a . The correlation suggests that MAPbBr 3 arrests perovskite grain growth, probably owing to the slow diffusion of the large bromide anion  38  in a perovskite thin film fabricated with methylammonium chloride (MACl) additives, where MACl has been reported to promote perovskite crystal grain growth. In addition to changes in grain size and morphology, the absorption onset and the photoluminescence peak redshifts are consistent with decreased incorporation of MAPbBr 3 into the perovskite crystal as lower amounts of MAPbBr 3 are added (Fig.  3b ). Notably, X-ray diffraction  ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""tin dioxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.2"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Methylammonium Lead Bromide"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""tin dioxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.2"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
2821,104_22," Solar cell and electroluminescence performance PSCs were fabricated by combining our newly developed SnO 2 ETL and the improved perovskite layer described above. These PSCs show an average PCE of 24.7%, with some devices exceeding a PCE of 25%, when measured in-house (blue data points, Fig.  4a ). The best performing devices were sent to the solar cell device testing facility in Newport, USA, for certification with the test results shown as the red data points in Fig.  4a . The best-performing device achieved a certified PCE of 25.2% from a quasi-steady-state measurement, with PCEs determined from the current-voltage (J-V) sweep to be 25.3% and 25.4% for the reverse and forward sweep, respectively (Fig.  4b  and Supplementary Figs. 18-21)   45  . In addition, the certified device showed almost no change in PCE during up to 3,600 h of storage (Supplementary Fig.  22 ). Additionally, the encapsulated device retained about 80% of its initial PCE after 500 h under continuous light illumination at maximum power point (100 mW cm -2 , AM1.5G, 45 °C), without an ultraviolet cut filter (Supplementary Fig.  23 ). We also fabricated PSCs with larger areas; our best-performing large-area cell (0.984 cm 2 ) exhibits PCEs up to 23.0% with a high V OC value of 1,196 mV (Fig.  4c ). The bandgap of this record cell, E g = 1.56 eV, was determined from the inflection point of the EQE curve (Supplementary Fig.  24 )  11  . This bandgap corresponds to a thermodynamic PCE upper limit of 31.3%. At 25.2% PCE, our best-performing certified cell is thus at 80.5% of the theoretical efficiency limit, which is comparable to the best Si solar cells, which are at 80.9% of the theoretical limit  46  . We attribute the high PCEs of our cells to major improvements in the V OC and the fill factor. The radiative V OC limit V OC rad is calculated to be 1.270 V and the V OC measured without an aperture mask reaches 1.225 V (Supplementary Fig.  25 )  6, 11, 47  , resulting in a ratio of V OC to the radiative V OC limit of up to 96.5%, which is the highest reported thus far for a PSC, and is within striking distance of that for GaAs (97.7%). Such a low V OC deficit suggests that almost all non-radiative recombination pathways have been efficiently eliminated and that these PSCs should be highly luminescent when operated as a light-emitting diode, as we find below. Figure  4d  shows a plot of the electroluminescence EQE and energy conversion efficiency (ECE) values versus voltage of a PSC measured under forward bias (the current-luminance-voltage curve is provided in Supplementary Fig.  26 ). We observe an electroluminescence EQE of up to 17.2%, which approaches the efficiency of the best-performing perovskite light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which are engineered specifically for efficient light emission  [48] [49] [50]  . In addition, due to early sub-bandgap turn-on, probably from thermal carriers, our PSCs exhibit a peak electroluminescence ECE of up to 21.6%. In addition to extremely low V OC loss and high luminescence efficiency, our devices exhibit a high fill factor of up to 84.8%. Such a high fill factor is a result of improved carrier mobility in the perovskite active layer and better charge collection with the SnO 2 ETL developed here with minimum parasitic losses from shunt and series resistances. For a further improvement in fill factor, future research should be focused on minimizing trap-assisted recombination, aiming to approach the theoretical fill factor limit of about 90%. ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Methylammonium Lead Bromide"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""tin dioxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.2"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Methylammonium Lead Bromide"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""tin dioxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""3600"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.2"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""1""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""500"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.8""}}"

Using density functional theory (DFT), we show that a low energy of formation, exacerbated in the presence of humidity, explains the propensity of perovskites to decompose back into their precursors. We find, also using DFT, that intercalation of phenylethylammonium between perovskite layers introduces quantitatively appreciable van der Waals interactions. These drive an increased formation energy and should therefore improve material stability. Here we report reduced-dimensionality (quasi-2D) perovskite films that exhibit improved stability while retaining the high performance of conventional three-dimensional perovskites. Continuous tuning of the dimensionality, as assessed using photophysical studies, is achieved by the choice of stoichiometry in materials synthesis.

2834,6_8," ■ INTRODUCTION The rapid advance of organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites represents a breakthrough for next-generation thin-film optoelectronics.  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]  In particular, methylammonium (MA, CH 3 NH 3 ) lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ) perovskites possess an appropriate bandgap energy, 7,8 large absorption coefficient, and long-range ambipolar photocarrier diffusion.  9  Tremendous efforts from multiple research groups have propelled the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells to 20.1%.  10  Unfortunately, perovskite materials lack long-term stability under ambient operation conditions. This has been ascribed, with the aid of theoretical studies, to the low formation energy of MAPbI 3 .  11  This challenge has motivated efforts to improve device stability, and progress in this direction has been made by developing novel device architectures.  12  Here we focus instead on the stability of the active material itself. We investigate, using theory and experiment, the origins of instability in conventional MAPbI 3 , and we propose and fabricate enhanced perovskitestaking advantage of the versatile physical chemistry of this materials systemthat constitute low-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic crystalline thin films. There exist prior reports of two-dimensional (2D) layered perovskites, crafted using bulkier organic molecules in place of MA, that exhibit enhanced stability; however, these suffer from poor photovoltaic performance.  13  These prior reports have shown PCEs lower than 5% due to their low absorption coefficient and poor carrier transport,  14  and this has hindered their further application. Here, we develop and investigate a platform of mixed-organic, dimensionally tuned quasi-2D perovskite thin films that continuously bridge the gap between 2D and 3D materials.  15, 16  We find that members of the quasi-2D family combine the enhanced stability of 2D perovskites with the excellent optoelectronic parameters, including long-range photocarrier diffusion, of 3D perovskites. Our approach relies on computational methods to unravel the origins of instability in conventional MAPbI 3 , while complementary studies of the physical and optoelectronic properties of quasi-2D perovskites allow us to identify optimized conditions to design and fabricate chemically stable, high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""phenylethylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""15.3"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Methylammonium Lead Iodide"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""phenylethylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""15.3"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
2836,6_11," ■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Phenylethylammonium Iodide Synthesis. Phenylethylamine (10 mL, 80 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol in an ice bath, and HI aqueous solution (55%, 20 mL, 170 mmol) was added dropwise to the flask with vigorous stirring. After the addition of HI, the mixture was allowed to stand in ice bath for another 20 min until a colorless precipitate appeared. The precipitate was filtered under vacuum and washed thoroughly using cold diethyl ether. The crude precipitate was collected and recrystallized in ethanol twice to obtain thin, plate-like white crystals (16.5 g, yield 83%). EI-MS: m/z 249.2, calcd 249.0. Film Fabrication. The series of different-dimensional perovskite PEA 2 (CH 3 NH 3 ) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 solutions were prepared by dissolving specific stoichiometric quantities of PbI 2 , MAI, and PEAI in DMF (n < 10) or γ-butyrolactone/DMSO (5:5, volume ratio) mixture (n ≥ 10) at 60 °C for 12 h with vigorous stirring. The resulting solution was filtered by PTFE syringe filter (0.2 μm) before deposition. The DMF solution (n < 10) was then deposited onto the substrate by a singlestep spin-coating process at 5000 rpm for 30 s. The mixed γbutyrolactone/DMSO solution (n ≥ 10) was coated onto the substrate via a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1000 and 5000 rpm for 10 and 60 s, respectively. During the second spin step, 100 μL of chlorobenzene was deposited onto the substrate. The resulting films were then annealed at 100 °C for 1 h for better crystallization. Photovoltaic Device Fabrication. A dense compact TiO 2 electron transport layer (50 nm) was deposited onto a F-doped SnO 2 (FTO, Pilkington, TEC 15) substrate, followed by drying at 130 °C for 10 min and calcining at 500 °C for 1 h. The TiO 2 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 890 mg of titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) and 30 mg of HCl (37%) solution in 8 mL of ethanol. The mixture was then stirred at room temperature overnight before use. The resulting TiO 2 film was immersed in 120 mM TiCl 4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 1 h and then calcined at 500 °C for another 30 min. The perovskite absorber was then deposited onto the TiO 2 using the method described before. The hole-transport layer was spin-coated onto the perovskite film at 4000 rpm for 30 s using a chlorobenzene solution that contained of 63 mg/mL of spiro-OMeTAD and 20 μL of tert-butylpyridine, as well as 70 μL of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (170 mg/mL in acetonitrile). Top electrodes were deposited using an Angstrom Engineering deposition system in an Innovative Technology glovebox. The contacts consisted of 100 nm electron-beam-deposited gold, deposited at 0.4 Å/s. Relative Humidity Control. For all characterizations, the perovskite films were stored at room temperature (measured as 25 ± 1 °C) in a controlled-humidity desiccator. The relative humidity (RH = 90%) was achieved with an accuracy of ±3% by a water/ glycerol solution with careful adjustment of the weight ratio of glycerol. The precise RH was measured periodically using a calibrated hygrometer. Photovoltaic Performance Characterization. The steady-state open-circuit voltage, V OC , was first measured using a Keithley 2400 instrument by fixing the current to zero and sampling the voltage at multiple time points. The steady-state short-circuit current, J SC , was measured by setting the bias voltage to zero and sampling the current at multiple time points. Instantaneous J-V curves were then measured with a scanning rate of 0.02 V s -1 . The maximum power point (V MPP ) was determined from the instantaneous J-V curve. The steady-state PCE was measured by setting the bias voltage to the estimated V MPP . Under the bias of V MPP , the current density value was sampled during 15 s to obtain J MPP . The PCE was finally obtained as the product of V MPP and J MPP . The active area was determined by the aperture before the solar cell to avoid overestimating the photocurrent. Through this aperture (area 0.049 cm 2 ), illumination intensity was calibrated using a Melles-Griot broadband power meter and set to be 1 sun (100 mW cm -2 ). The AM 1.5 solar power is supplied by a class A (<25% spectral mismatch) solar simulator (Science Tech). The spectral mismatch of the system was characterized using a calibrated reference solar cell (Newport). The accuracy of the power measurement was estimated to be ±5%. UPS Measurements. UPS measurements were carried out in an ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure below 5 × 10 -9 mbar. The photon line width was ∼250 meV and the minimum spot size ∼1 mm. He I photons (21.2 eV) were used to acquire the spectra at normal emission. The photoelectrons were collected by using a SPHERA U7 hemispherical energy analyzer with a 7-channel MCD detector, in constant analyzer energy mode. The binding energy values shown with 10 meV precision should be rounded to the nearest 100 meV value in accordance with the overall energy resolution. XPS Measurements. XPS measurements were carried out in a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha system, with a 300 μm spot size, 75 eV pass energy, and energy steps of 0.05 eV. All signals are normalized to Pb for direct comparison between different samples. XRD Measurements. XRD measurements on oriented films were conducted on a Panalytical X'Pert Pro diffractometer with a Bragg-Brentano geometry and PIXCEL 1D detector equipped with a nickel filter. Unoriented scans were collected on powders loaded into a 0.1 mm diameter silicon capillary on a Bruker D 8 Venture diffractometer using monochromated Mo Kα 1 (0.71073 Å) radiation. Other Characterizations. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum for photovoltaic device was obtained using a previously published process.  32  Samples were tested in N 2 ambient. Photoluminescence (PL) was measured using a Horiba Fluorolog timecorrelated single-photon-counting system with photomultiplier tube detectors. For steady-state measurements, the excitation source was a monochromatized Xe lamp. For time-resolved PL, the excitation source was a laser diode with a wavelength λ = 375 nm; the combined (source + instrumental response function) time resolution was Δt ≈ 0.13 ns. ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5b11740.

2856,7_11," ⟨111⟩-Oriented 2D Perovskites ⟨111⟩-oriented 2D perovskites usually incorporate +3 metals since cleaving the parent 3D structure selectively eliminates some metal sites, changing the charge of the inorganic lattice. These perovskites can be regarded as a class of defect perovskites A 3 M 2 □X 9 (M = Bi 3+ , Sb 3+ and As 3+ ; □ is vacancy), where the metal takes 2/3 occupancy of the M site in the A 3 M 3 X 9 perovskite formula. The structure can be seen as removing one layer of octahedra in the ⟨111⟩ direction for every three layers (Figure  11 ). For the iodide perovskites, when the A cation is small, such as ammonium,  189, 190  potassium,  191  or rubidium,  192, 193  ⟨111⟩-oriented 2D perovskite structures can form. While for large A cations like methyl-ammonium  194, 195  and guanidinium,  196  a 0D structure with a dimer of face-sharing octahedra forms. For Cs + , it forms 0D structure with Bi 3+191 and ⟨111⟩-oriented 2D structure with Sb 3+ .  197  Interestingly, when mixed with chloride, the 0D structure of Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 can expand to 2D Cs 3 Bi 2 I 6 Cl 3 ,  198  with the small chloride taking the bridging site and large iodide occupying the terminal site. More interestingly, even when a small fraction of I (9%) is replaced by Cl, the structure can change from 1D (Cs 3 Bi 2 Cl 9 ) to 2D Cs 3 Bi 2 Cl 8.16 I 0.84 ,  199  showing the powerful range that this strategy works. Thanks to the relatively low bandgap and large density, some of the compounds are explored for optoelectronic applications such as solar cells and 200 α-particle 201 and X-ray detection.  202  Generally, we expect the 2D structures to show better performance than the 0D ones. Solis-Ibarra and co-workers expand the single layer ⟨111⟩oriented 2D perovskites to multilayered perovskites by incorporating +2 metal to form A 4 M II M III 2 X 12 .  203  These compounds can also be seen as expansion of 2D layered double perovskites. The octahedra with the M II are in the middle layer and those with the M III are on the edge (Figure  11 ). So far, there are seven synthesized and structurally characterized compounds (Cs   [203] [204] [205]  and more are predicted by DFT calculations.  205, 206  4. OVERVIEW OF THIN FILM AND DEVICE FABRICATION The ascendance of 2D perovskites in the field of photovoltaics in the past five years was surprisingly rapid, and the main reasons for this have been their significantly greater chemical stability, facile tendency to form films from solutions, strong tendency for perpendicular orientation of the 2D perovskite layers relative to the substrate and comparable ability to perform as great solar cell materials compared to the 3D MAPbI 3 . However, even as the success in solar cell devices and light emitting diodes has been undisputed, there has been confusion and controversy in understanding the true nature of the films and the difference between nominal composition and the actual phase distribution in the films. In this section, we review the various methods, characterizations and current understanding of films made from 2D as well as 2D/3D perovskite mixtures. There are different methods used to make thin films of these materials which will influence the properties and the ultimate performance of the device. To understand the relationship between the perovskite layer and device performance, it is important to look at the perovskite layer in the context of the overall device architecture, which varies depending on the device. In solar cells, the overall device architecture consists of an electrode, a hole-transport layer (HTL) which allows holes through but not electrons, the absorbing perovskite layer, an electron-transport layer (ETL) which allows electrons through but not holes, and another electrode.  207  These layers can either be stacked with in the order substrate/electrode/HTL/perovskite/ETL/electrode (pi-n architecture, Figure  12a ) or substrate/electrode/ETL/ perovskite/HTL/electrode (n-i-p architecture, Figure  12b ). The HTL and ETL are chosen based on the energy levels of the perovskite layer. The conduction band minimum (CBM) of the ETL is ideally just below the CBM of the perovskite layer to allow electrons in the CBM of the perovskite to easily transfer to the CBM of the ETL. Likewise, the valence band In solar cells, the power conversion efficiency (PCE)  208  is the factor of merit, defined as the power produced by the solar cell divided by the power put into the cell via sunlight. The PCE can be determined through the simple formula PCE = V OC × J SC × FF where V OC is the open-circuit voltage, J SC is the short-circuit current density, and FF is the fill factor. Each of these parameters is affected differently by the properties of the materials used in the device. The potential maximum V OC is determined by the difference in the electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels.  209  However, other factors like carrier recombination from defects in the perovskite layer or at the interface reduce the V OC from the ideal. The J SC is dependent on the ability of the perovskite absorbing layer to absorb light and transfer the carriers to the HTL and ETL. Finally, the FF is primarily dependent on the interfaces between the perovskite layer and the ETL and HTL layers. If the physical contact of the layers or the electronic alignment between the layers is poor, the FF will suffer. With these parameters in mind, we begin by discussing the desired properties that films need to maximize each of these values. These can be thought of as the ""rules"" to making lowdimensional perovskite films which can succeed in devices. Proper measurements of these properties will be discussed along with the rules, as has been outline elsewhere.  210  After this, we outline the methods used to make the perovskite films and how each method can be used to access the desired properties. Then, we discuss the different cations used in devices with different dimensionalities to relate the effects of the spacer on the different properties of these films and devices, outlining what has been learned so far about the correlation between spacer and device performance from a film and device perspective. One of the well-known advantages of employing low-dimensional structures in perovskite films is the remarkable increase in chemical stability. 3D MAPbI 3 devices suffer significantly from their proclivity to react with moisture to form PbI 2 , MA, and HI as byproducts. This process is enhanced by the high polarity of the organic cation MA which can easily be separated from the inorganic framework.  211, 212  Along with this, degradation from light and heat as well as considerable ion migration in the 3D structures degrade the devices in real conditions.  213  While these processes can be mitigated by encapsulation and barriers,  214  producing intrinsically stable materials in films is preferred to reduce processing and production costs. All these factors should be considered when discussing the stability of perovskite films and devices. The presence of bulky more hydrophobic cations increases the overall hydrophobicity of the film. Additionally, the confinement of ion migration in two dimensions for the 2D structures give rise to an overall higher stability. Measuring film stability under light, humidity, or heat stress can be accomplished easily via X-ray diffraction (XRD) by observing the growth of the PbI 2 phase as the film decomposes.  99  Devices can be measured over time by simply taking the currentvoltage scan after different periods of time under different conditions. However, there is still a need for a consistent manner to test device stability. For instance, humidity varies greatly from location to location, which leads to drastically different responses to humidity depending on the weather. Humidity testing must be done in a controlled environment to make sure that fluctuations in humidity outside are not a factor. Furthermore, testing for light and heat should be regularly performed as well. Only by considering all these factors in a systematic manner can different methods and materials be compared. In fact, recently a consensus statement was issued, suggesting a systematic means to report device efficiency based on the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols.  215  4.1.2. Crystallinity. It is important to consider crystallinity when evaluating a film's ability to transport carriers. Crystallinity is based on the crystallites in the film, where a crystallite is a repeating unit of a chemical structure. Crystallinity is commonly measured using XRD by finding the full-width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the peaks in the pattern. With decreasing crystallite size, the fwhm will increase; however, other factors such as strain, stacking faults, and instrumental broadening can also influence the fwhm, so this is not a perfect method to approximate crystallite size but can be used as a general guide to the relative size of the crystallites when comparing films. 4.1.3. Morphology. Like the crystallinity, morphology is important when considering charge carrier transport. The morphology of a film is its internal and external structure based on the grain size and shape. In the perovskite literature, the term ""grain"" is loosely defined as a region on a film separated by a change in the topography of the film such as a crack. This is commonly quantified by scanning-electron microscopy (SEM)  216  or atomic-force microscopy (AFM). However, smaller cracks often exist within these grains, making the exact definition of ""grain"" difficult. Here, we define grain as the smallest unit able to be seen by SEM or AFM. It should be acknowledged that the techniques used to define grains often only use images from the surface of the film, giving an incomplete picture of the film morphology. Cross-sectional SEM can elucidate the full morphology of the film, showing how deep the grains grow, which is important when considering electron transport for devices. Related to the grains, the roughness of the films should be considered when discussing morphology. When the roughness is large, the presence of pin holes, defined as areas where there is no film coverage, become a possibility, leading to poor device performance. 4.1.4. Orientation. Achieving the correct orientation of a 2D perovskite film on the substrate is crucial for the success of device performance. This is the main difference concerning film deposition between 2D and 3D perovskites where in the latter crystalline grain orientation is much less of a critical issue. For 2D materials, the layers all orient in the same direction within each grain making the grains anisotropic. The orientation of the grains themselves thus leads to a distinct orientation of the layers with regard to the substrate, commonly defined as the ""texture"" of the film. A highly textured film could have grains with layers all parallel to the substrate or all perpendicular to the substrate while an untextured film has grains with layers oriented at all angles regarding the substrate. This is important because of the highly anisotropic nature of the 2D perovskites, which experience both quantum and dielectric confinement perpendicular to the layers. Because of these confinement effects, the charges cannot go from one layer to another, resulting in several orders of magnitude difference in conductivity measured perpendicular and parallel to the layers.  35  For devices such as solar cells, carriers must be able to separate and reach the top and bottom of the film to create current, shown in Figure  13a . If the layers are parallel to the substrate, the charges can only recombine, and no current is produced (Figure  13b ). On the other hand, devices like transistors require charge to run parallel to the substrate and may benefit from the perovskite layers being parallel to substrate. XRD can be used to roughly define the orientation of the films. Characteristic peaks below 2θ = 14°( for diffractometers with a Cu source) are indicative of grains with the 2D layers parallel to the substrate. On the other hand, characteristic peaks at ∼14°and ∼28°(for lead-iodide based structures) are from the repeating unit of one octahedra in line with the layers and seen when the layers are perpendicular to the substrate. A better technique to measure orientation is grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering (GIWAXS). Here, the X-rays irradiate the sample at a very low angle, resulting in complete reflection from the film. The scattering is measured with a 2D detector.  217, 218  The same peaks that would appear in a 1D XRD pattern and peaks that would not normally be seen due to the orientation of the 2D layers are seen in the 2D GIWAXS pattern.  23  The d-spacing of the various crystallographic planes will determine the position of the peaks along the radial axis q. Then, depending on the orientation of the crystallographic hkl planes in the chemical structure with relation to the substrate, the spot wills appear at a certain points along the azimuthal angle χ. The orientation of the perovskite layers will affect the orientation of all crystallographic planes, leading to distinct patterns depending on the orientation of the layers. If the orientation is random, the spots will be spread out along all χ, leading to rings. Comparing simulated GIWAXS patterns to experimental data allows the orientations in the film to be determined. 4.1.5. Composition. The chemical makeup of the film has become more and more relevant to low-dimensional perovskite films because of the phase inhomogeneity of the films. Generally, mixtures of different n values are seen within the films, with high-n phases first crystallizing at the surface followed by low-n phases on the bottom of the film, leading to the multiple quantum well film structure in Figure  13c .  220  Along with 2D lead halide perovskite films, this mechanism has also been seen in 2D tin halide perovskite films with a large variety of n values,  221  meaning that this mechanism is generalizable to a variety of systems. Thus, one should always systematically study the composition of a novel film. Several techniques have been used to identify the composition. XRD can give evidence of the film composition by the characteristic low-angle peaks below 2θ = 14°. As discussed above, the layers are generally oriented perpendicular to the substrate, so the X-ray can only detect the two characteristic peaks at ∼14°and 28°, which is unhelpful to elucidate the composition. In fact, the diffraction patterns for oriented MAPbI 3 and perpendicularly oriented 2D perovskites with most spacers and n values are nearly identical. Sometimes, low-angle peaks can be seen in films which can allow for phase identification by matching the experimental data to a pattern simulated from a structure solved via single-crystal XRD. If the single-crystal has not been solved for, having a harmonic pattern of low-angle peaks does imply the presence of a 2D phase, though not conclusively. Alternatively, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) can sometimes be used to detect different phases in the film visually, though this technique cannot measure the bulk film. A simple way to show the different phases that exist is static absorption spectroscopy measurements, which show the positions of the excitonic peaks, which can be correlated to the expected positions for different phases based on the bandgap of single crystals though it cannot always be assumed that these peaks must be correlated to n = 1, 2, 3, etc. To make such a conclusion, phase-pure materials must be made and measured to determine the location of the peaks in the spectrum, usually in the form of crystals, as phase purity when n > 2 is difficult to achieve in films.  222  Then, the peaks of the phase-pure materials and the peaks in the film can be correlated, though, even then, the presence of other phases with similar band gaps cannot be totally ruled out. Photoluminescence (PL) can also be used to identify different phases, as different quantum well thicknesses for different n values give discrete PL emission energies. The surface of the films (at the film/air interface) often gives a low-energy emission indicative of n > 7 while the bottom (at the film/ substrate interface) gives higher-energy emissions of n = 1-4, depending on the film composition and processing. This is illustrated by the depth-dependent PL of the film seen in Figure  13d .  219  However, the excitons are quickly transferred to higher n phases, reducing PL from the low-n values. Transientabsorption (TA) spectroscopy can be used to better track these different phases, as it tracks the excitons as they transfer from phase to phase, making it one of the most effective ways to observe film composition.  223  No matter which method is used, to conclusively identify the composition in the film, the properties of the phase-pure materials must be known. While certain properties such as bandgap are fairly consistent for the same layer thickness using different spacers, notable exceptions do exist.  89  This also applies to diffraction-and scattering-based analysis, which require simulations based on single-crystal XRD to match data in the films to the proper phase. Thus, we emphasize the need for crystallographic understanding before positing chemistry-based explanations for device performance. 4.1.6. Interactions between Phases. Films with multiple phases have been shown to be particularly advantageous for LEDs, as the carriers are able to transfer quickly from low-n to high-n phases in a sort of ""energy funnel,"" allowing for the carriers to travel easily through the film.  224  This is shown schematically in Figure  17a  and has also been described as a multiple quantum well structure (MQW). Understanding how these phases interact in the films has become increasingly important in optimizing both LEDs and solar cells. TA spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) also give indications as to how quickly carriers will transfer from phase-to-phase. These processes have not been fully elucidated yet, as the composition in films with n > 3 is highly complex, making systematic studies of the interactions between different phases difficult to achieve. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP""}"
2859,7_14," 2D Films We begin with a discussion of what we call ""2D films,"" designated as films in which the targeted stoichiometry (based on the precursor solution) gives an n value less than 8. We have chosen this value because the highest n value studied with single crystal X-ray crystallography has been n = 7.  34, 151  Because the crystalline phases in the film deposit quickly depending on the deposition method, the final material in the film is highly unlikely to be phase pure especially when the targeted n is greater than 2, as multiple phases with different n values will crystallize under kinetic control during film formation. Because of the multitude of conditions used in a wide variety of laboratories, the phase composition of the films can vary from indeed being a single phase containing only one homologous member to containing several homologous members. This is why it is critical for researchers to report as broad a characterization of these films as possible. For simplicity, we will define the composition of the films by the nominal stoichiometry that is used in the precursor solution to make the film. Here, we outline some examples of spacers used in 2D films and devices along with the methods used to make the films and highlight the spacers' unique influence on film properties and device efficiency. Tables  9  and 10  summarize a selected list of monoammonium and diammonium spacers, respectively, that have been used in solar cells with relevant device parameters. 5.1.1. 2D Phases with Monoammonium Cations. 5.1.1.1. Alkylammonium Cations. The BA spacer was the first alkylammonium spacer used in a 2D perovskite solar cell  100  and has also been utilized in LEDs.  [260] [261] [262]  Table  9a  shows a couple examples of early 2D devices using BA as the spacer in solar cells, including with tin as the metal.  64  Mixtures of tin and lead have also been used in solar cells. One report shows a PCE of 5.96% (with large hysteresis) using (BA) 2 (MA) 3 Pb 3 SnI 13 . Interestingly, GIWAXS analysis shows a narrower texture with increasing tin concentration, implying that films using 2D tin perovskites have a greater degree of preferred orientation compared to their lead equivalents.  263  While BA remains one of the most commonly used spacers in film and device studies, other alkylammonium spacers derived from BA have been used to improve upon the original BA spacer. When choosing a new alkylammonium spacer for highefficiency devices, three of the more common derivations of the BA spacer have been considered, outlined in Figure  16 . (1)  A smaller carbon-chain length can be utilized to potentially give a narrower interlayer spacing, leading to a larger inorganic volume ratio in the film, which increases light absorption in solar cells.  35  (2) Conversely, increasing spacer length has shown some improvements in solar cell stability.  36  (3) Conjugated spacers or spacers with heteroatom substitutions can have a higher dielectric constant which is thought to facilitate charge transport across layers.  264  One short spacer is isobutylammonium (IBA), which is isomeric to BA, but with a more compact branched structure. We have recently characterized crystals using the IBA spacer along with the longer isoamylammonium spacer up to n = 4.  265  Solar cell efficiencies for each are in Table  9b  and c . Because of its more compact shape, IBA allows for a smaller interlayer spacing and increased inorganic volume ratio, and its bulky shape leads to larger Pb-I-Pb angles, lowering the bandgap, making it a good possibility for solar cells. In fact, solar cells made from hotcasting (IBA) 2 (MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 films gave a champion efficiency of 10.63% using a C 60 electron transport layer (ETL). In this study, the IBA-based device was compared to a device using the same architecture and method with the BA spacer which led to a lower efficiency of 5.38%.  266  However, because of the hysteresis from using the C 60 layer at the bottom of the device, these values are inflated. Despite this, the results imply that the use of a small spacer leads to increased device efficiency. Further analysis of n = 4 films shows that the phase distribution and charge transfer process is also affected when using IBA instead of BA as the spacer.  223  As mentioned above, multiple phases with different n values exist in these films to form energy funnels. This allows for charge transfer from the wide-bandgap low-n phases to the narrowbandgap high-n phases, as shown in Figure  17a . The TA data in Figure  17b  show that the high-n phases, indicated by the peak at ∼760 nm, are much more apparent in the IBA-based film than the BA-based film. Because the quantum confinement in high-n phases decreases, this would lead to lower exciton binding energy and higher carrier mobility with greater charge extraction in devices, possibly explaining the higher efficiencies for IBA-based devices. Furthermore, the authors showed that the rate of charge transfer was faster for the IBA-based films which had shorter interlayer spacings, implying that the shorter spacers allowed for more efficient charge transfer. One carbon shorter than BA, propylammonium (PA) has been used as a short spacer in solar cells (Table  9d ). We have published the structures for three 2D ""step-like"" structures with the general formula (PA) 2m+4 (MA) m-2 Pb 2m+1 I 7m+4 (m = 2, 3, 4) Table  9 . continued and two 2D RP structures with the general formula (PA) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 (n = 3, 4).  35  Notably, RP ""n = 1,"" ""2,"" and ""5"" were unable to form with a traditional synthesis, though it has been suggested that certain conditions allow ""n = 1"" to form in films.  267  Hotcasting with solvent engineering has been primarily used when studying films with PA. Solvent engineering involves simply tuning the solvent mixture with two or more solvents, in this case DMF and DMSO. Using either DMF or DMF:DMSO mixed solvents has given highly oriented films for n = 3,  35  4,  268  and ""5"" 269 films, particularly with the solvent mixture. TA spectroscopy has also detected a high degree of 3D character in the PA films when compared to the BA equivalents, implying that shorter spacers favor phase distributions with high-n phases, as was the case with the IBA spacer above.  268  Despite this advantage, it is unclear if the parasitic ""step-like"" structures are present in these films or if  such structures are common among short spacers, which would be problematic for device performance. Devices have been fabricated using the same methods with the stoichiometry for n = 3,  35  4,  271  and ""5.""  269  The latter ""n = 5"" case gave a PCE of about 10%, nearly equivalent to the PCE achieved under the same conditions but with (BA) 2 (MA) 4 Pb 5 I 16 .  33, 272  Compared to (BA) 2 (MA) 4 Pb 5 I 16 made with the same method, the efficiencies are nearly equivalent, though the J SC is much higher for ""(PA) 2 (MA) 4 Pb 5 I 16 "" and the FF is higher for (BA) 2 (MA) 4 Pb 5 I 16 , suggesting that, while PA allows for more  current, possibly due to more light absorption, the interface is not as ideal as when using BA. While shorter spacers have potential for greater light absorption since inorganic component of the 2D perovskite is mainly responsible for light absorption, longer spacers may still be beneficial in terms of stability. Films made from the longer pentylammonium and hexylammonium cations have shown improved stability under heat, light, and ambient conditions compared to MAPbI 3 films.  36  Contact angle measurements with water droplets in Figure  17c  clearly show increased hydrophobicity of the films with increasing spacer length. The stability was tested on films with the stoichiometry for n = 4, and both films made from the hotcasting and onestep methods were analyzed. Several conditions were tested as well: 100 °C with 50% relative humidity, ambient light with 50% relative humidity, 1 sun illumination with 50% relative humidity, no light with 50% relative humidity, encapsulated at 100 °C, and encapsulated with 1 sun illumination. In general, the pentylammonium spacer provided the greatest stability for each deposition method and each condition tested. Except for films kept at 100 °C with 50% relative humidity, the stability trend for all conditions is pentylammonium > butylammonium > hexylammonium. For the films under heat and humidity, the trend is pentylammonium > hexylammonium > butylammonium. In either case, the stability is not directly correlated to the spacer length, meaning that the spacer length does not directly affect the stability. Other factors such as final film composition, orientation, and thickness must also be considered, highlighting the complexity of correlating spacer to stability. Films using tin as the metal have also been fabricated with the longer spacers octylammonium and dodecyl-ammonium, showing that shorter chains lead to perpendicular layer orientation for the tin system.  273  The other strategy used to increase efficiency involves alkylammonium spacers with higher dielectric constants (Table  9e -g). For example, conjugated spacers may lead to better charge transport from layer to layer. BA is a completely saturated carbon chain with only single C-C bonds, but replacing the C-C tail with a double or triple bond results in 3-buten-1-ammonium (BEA) or 3-butyn-1-ammonium (BYA), respectively. This gives a series of three cations with similar lengths and different degrees of conjugation, which were incorporated into films and devices via hotcasting using the stoichiometry for n = 4.  270  Shown in Figure  17d , BEA gave the highest efficiency of 16.1% primarily from increased J SC attributed both to the reduced tunneling barrier for conjugated spacers and the more crystalline films leading to lower leakage and fewer defects. Using the 2-(methylthio)ethylammonium spacer has also led to potential for cross-layer interactions via sulfur atoms in the interlayer spacer, as suggested by DFT calculations, yielding a remarkable efficiency of over 18% for a stoichiometrically ""n = 5"" film.  274  Further studies on single crystals of all these materials will help to understand these processes by isolating a single phase and ruling out other variables present only in films. 5.1.1.2. Aromatic Cations. Like the conjugated BEA and BYA spacers discussed above, aromatic spacers are commonly used to attempt to reduce dielectric confinement to improve efficiencies. Phenylethylammonium (PEA) was the first spacer used in a 2D halide perovskite solar cell  99  and LED.  275  Solar cells using this cation have benefitted from the addition of salts with the ammonium cation NH 4 + (Table  9h ). Using ammonium thiocyanate (NH 4 SCN) gives devices using the stoichiometry for ""(PEA) 2 (MA) 4 Pb 5 I 16 "" with efficiencies over 11%, though 2 mol equiv of NH 4 SCN are needed to achieve this efficiency.  246  By using a combination of NH 4 SCN and ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl), an even higher efficiency of 14.1% is achieved with only 0.2 equiv of total ammonium additives using the same composition and device architecture.  276  LEDs have benefitted from the naturally formed multiple quantum well structure in both lead  224  and tin-based perovskites.  277  The thickest layer for any aromatic spacer characterized by SCXRD is n = 3.  99, 128  Thus, the chemical understanding of these spacers is lagging behind that of the alkylamines. Bulky spacers such as the recently reported 1-naphthalenem e t h y l a m m o n i u m ( N p M A ) a n d 9 -a n t h r a c e n emethylammonium (AnMA)  278  show potential for improved solar cell performance (Table  9 (j,k)).  279  The presence of low-n phases is strongly suggested in ""n = 4"" films using the NpMA spacer. HRTEM shows lines of atoms indicative of plates oriented perpendicularly to the substrate, and TA spectroscopy shows bleaches with the energy characteristic of low-n phases. Furthermore, XRD of n = 1 and n = 2 films shows low angle peaks with harmonicity. However, separate DFT studies have shown that, compared to those using phenylmethylammonium, n = 1 RP phases using 1-naphthalenemethylammonium have a higher formation energy, implying that the bulkier the spacer, the less stable the RP phases.  280  While the naphthalene spacer still appears to form well-defined quantum wells, the bulkier AnMA spacer shows greater 3D character via TA spectroscopy, and the n = 1 film does not clearly show harmonic peaks. Because the naphthalene spacer can more readily stabilize multiple quantum wells, it delivers a higher performance. Furthermore, bleach formation time of the 3D phase is more rapid when using the NpMA than it is for the AnMA spacer (6.56 ps vs 10.17 ps), further showing the advantage of the distinctly defined multiple quantum well structure when using NpMA. Additionally, the NpMA spacer has shown great use in LEDs with ""n < 3"" films, which shown a quantum well structure despite the low n value.  281, 282  Characterization of larger n values for such bulky spacers will help to determine which spacers have the potential to stabilize 2D phases in the films and which do not. Dielectric confinement can be potentially further modulated by using spacers substituted with heteroatoms (Table  9 (l-n)); Figure  16 ). Devices made with the precursor stoichiometry for ""n = 5"" using 4-fluorophenylethylammonium (4FPEA) have shown improved efficiencies compared to using the unsubstituted PEA.  122, 283  In particular, a one-step method with an ammonium thiocyanate (NH 4 SCN) additive gave an impressive efficiency of 17.34%.  264  These devices seemed to benefit from a change in phase distribution. Looking at the TA data in Figure  18a , compared to PEA-based films, the 4FPEA-based films have stronger MAPbI 3 and n = 2 bleaches. The enhanced MAPbI 3 bleach is reminiscent of the films made with short spacers and could help charge transfer. Additionally, as shown in Figure  18b , DFT calculations suggest that the fluorinated spacers have substantially higher dipole moments which is backed up by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) which shows an increase of surface potential from 91.28 mV for PEAbased films to 224.36 mV for 4FPEA-based films. This could allow for greater carrier mobility. In fact, the electron mobility remained unchanged, the hole mobility increased by an order of magnitude, giving credence to this hypothesis. Solid state mixtures using the spacers PEA and perfluorophenethylammonium (F5-PEA) have been incorporated into films using a one-step method with no additives and have shown to give the greatest efficiency and stability when a 1:1 ratio of these phase is used, as shown in Figure  18c .  124  The texture (defined as the degree to which the grains in the film are oriented in the same direction) lessens with increasing 4FPEA (i.e., the orientation of the grains goes from perpendicular to random) while the morphology becomes less favorable for increasing PEA, leading to an optimum film structure when a 1:1 ratio is used. Thus, using fluorine-substituted spacers affects phase distribution, dipole moment (and thus exciton binding energy and carrier mobility), chemical stability, orientation, and morphology, which demonstrates the complexity of the effects of changing the spacer. Other substituted spacers can also be considered such as methoxyphenyletheylammonium  283  (Table  9m ) or other halogenated spacers. Earlier, we discussed how the halogen atoms on the cation and the MX 6 inorganic framework can interact to change the unit cell displacement and cation configuration. However, as mentioned above, the spacers also play a key role in film-specific properties. For example, spacers using the larger bromine (4-bromophenylethylammonium, 4BrPEA) and chlorine (4-chlorophenylethylammonium, 4ClPEA) atoms instead of fluorine leads to differences in the orientation of the films, with the films using 4BrPEA and 4ClPEA giving some grains oriented parallel to the substrate.  284  This films also show lower electron mobility compared to those with 4FPEA, reducing device performance. Heteroatoms can also substitute for one of the carbon atoms in the conjugated ring, such as the case for the sulfurcontaining thiophenes (Table  9o -q). In the previous synthesis section, we discussed the ability of the thiophene spacers to form Type II quantum wells. Here, we discuss their effects on film composition and device performance. Thiophenemethylammonium (2TMA) has been used as a spacer, giving (2TMA) 2 (MA) 2 Pb 3 I 10 , which was solved crystallographically and incorporated into a solar cell.  128  This material was deposited using the antisolvent method, which leads to rapid crystallization. Remarkably, by adding additional MACl, the orientation of the layers is still highly perpendicular to the substrate despite the rapid crystallization during the antisolvent method. Understanding whether this effect is because of the extra Cl -, the crystallization rate, or the spacer itself would be very helpful to develop alternative methods for crystalline and oriented films. Either way, a PCE of 15.42% was achieved and remains one of the highest efficiencies for an RP n = 3 solar cell. Later, a ""(2TMA) 2 (FA) 4 Pb 5 I 16 "" solar cell using a 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzylammonium iodide additive in a isopropanol antisolvent yielded a remarkable efficiency over 1 9%.  2 8 5  Anot her thiophene spacer, thiopheneethylammonium  286  was also used to achieve a similar PCE with n = 3 stoichiometry using the hot-casting method with a carefully chosen solvent mixture of 4:1 DMF:toluene and an 8 vol% HI additive.  287  In this study, the phase compositions using different solvent mixtures were analyzed. While all conditions saw bleaches for the n = 2 and n = 3 phases present, the N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc):toluene solvent mixture (with and without HI) was the only one to show a bleach for MAPbI 3 and had more phases with n > 3 present in the film when compared to films made with a DMAc:DMSO solvent mixture. Furthermore, the bleaching time constants when using DMAc:toluene were shorter than the other mixtures. Once again, the phase distribution plays a pivotal role in the charge carrier dynamics for the films, even when the same spacer is used. In this case, all films had low-n phases, but the film with faster charge transfer (and better solar cell efficiency) had both 2D and 3D character. Meanwhile, the DMAc:DMSO mixture here had mostly 2D character. Along with this, we discussed the 9-anthracenemethylammonium (AnMA) spacer above which gave films with mainly 3D character, resulting in slower charge transfer than films made with the 1-naphthalenemethylammonium (NpMA) spacer, which had both 2D and 3D phases.  279  Thus, this phase distribution appears to be a common denominator for high-performance devices. 5.1.1.3. Alternating Cations in the Interlayer Space Phases. Guanidinium (GA) has been the only cation studied in films composed of the ACI phase (Table  9r ). The first device using (GA)(MA) 3 Pb 3 I 10 gave an efficiency of 7.26% with the antisolvent method and the FTO/PEDOT:PSS/ (GA)(MA) 3 Pb 3 I 10 /PCBM/Al architecture.  90  However, by simply using a new architecture -FTO/c-TiO 2 /(GA)-(MA) 3 Pb 3 I 10 /Spiro-OMeTAD/Au-the efficiency nearly doubled, and the addition of an MACl additive allowed the efficiency to exceed 18% when accounting for hysteresis.  288  Other methods such as hotcasting and the one-step method have only seen efficiencies at about 13-14% for each.  289  Like other small spacers, GA can also stabilize other structures such as the ⟨110⟩-oriented (GA) 2 PbI 4 phase  132  which may affect the film formation mechanism. TA spectroscopy has also shown that multiple phases, likely n = 1, 2, and 3 and 3D phases are present in these films and act as energy funnels as in other 2D perovskite films.  289  5.1.2. 2D Phases with Diammonium Cations. 5.1.2.1. Alkyldiammonium Cations. Diammonium cations are attractive because they can coordinate to both layers, removing the van der Waals gap. By coordinating to both layers, these structures are more robust, potentially improving thermal stability.  39  An early report used several cations in devices using the n = 1 materials,  291  which was followed by incorporation of multilayered structures in films and devices. Multilayered structures are known only for the longer cations with at least four carbons.  39  While short cations such as propyldiammonium (PdA)  271, 292  have been used in films and have shown high efficiencies of over 14% in solar cell devices (Table  10a ), it is not clear if these are truly ""2D films,"" as there is no proof that PdA can stabilize 2D iodide perovskites. If PdA cannot form such a structure, it may play a different role in the final film such as a passivator as interfaces. Only with full characterization can we understand this. Even so, the devices show very high efficiency and stability, with the hotcasted ""(PdA)(MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 "" device showing great stability in ambient conditions, heat, light, and humidity. The crystal structures for several alkyldiammonium structures were discussed in the synthesis part of this report. The n = 3 crystals were also made into films using a one-step method with an HI additive to test their stability in future device applications.  39  A different study also fabricated films using an ""n = 5"" stoichiometry with several of these spacers using a one-step method with an ionic liquid solvent.  293  Interestingly, the two methods and n values result in different textures for the films, which is quantified by the GIWAXS images in Figure  19 . For the n = 3 films, GIWAXS reveals that a greater degree of texture (i.e., more grains aligned in the same direction) is found when using longer cations. In fact, while the films from butyldiammonium (BdA) and hexyldiammonium (HdA) show almost no preferred orientation as indicated by the rings in the GIWAXS patterns, the films from octyldiammonium (OdA) and nonyldiammonium (NdA) are highly oriented with the layers perpendicular to the substrate as indicated by the sharp peaks. It should be mentioned that NdA-based films do have some grains orientated with the layers parallel to the substrate, but no rings are seen in the GIWAXS pattern. This indicates that the 2D layers in the grains are either oriented parallel or perpendicular to the substrate with none oriented at other diagonal angles to the substrate Contrarily, the ""n = 5"" films showed sharp Bragg peaks in the GIWAXS patterns for all alkydiammonium cations from three (PdA) to six (HdA) carbons in length when using a one-step method with an ionic liquid solvent. Additionally, the PdA-based film was thge most textured, while the HdA-based film was the least, indicating that these trends are dependent on the n value and deposition method. Additionally, TA spectroscopy of the ""n = 5"" films was also measured and revealed that the PdA and BdA films showed no presence on low-n phases while the pentyldiammonium (PedA) and HdA films did, indicating that longer chains lead to more low-n character in the films, which matches our earlier discussions comparing short monoammonium cations such as PA to longer cations such as BA. Alkyldiammonium-based films were also shown to have increased stability to light, heat, and humidity compared to MAPbI 3 . For the n = 3 films, the OdA-based film had the highest stability of all the alkyldiammonium-based films, with BdA and HdA having the poorest stability. Furthermore, the OdA-based film was even more stable in light than the BAbased film, both n = 3 stoichiometrically and prepared under the same conditions, showing the great stability of these materials. For the ""n = 5"" films, a similar trend was seen, the longest spacer (HdA) showing the greatest thermal stability. However, when incorporated into solar cells (Table  10b -d), the PedA spacer led to greater thermal stability, showing the complexity of stability in devices. The thermal stability for the BdA-based films has been further enhanced by using Cs + instead of MA as the A-site cations.  294  Of the ""n = 5"" films, the short BdA spacer gave the greatest efficiency of 16.38%, likely because of a complexity of factors such as perpendicular orientation, low trap state density, and less surface defects. We also note that the BdA spacer has been used to form lead-free (BdA)(FA) 2 Sn 3 I 10 which has been characterized crystallographically and been incorporated into devices to enhance both PCE and stability.  295  5.1.2.2. Cyclic Diammonium Cations. These cations are attractive for use in solar cells because some of them can form Dion-Jacobson 2D halide perovskites, and they can lead to very close terminal I-I bonds and relatively low bandgaps. Initial average efficiencies for devices based on (xAMP)(MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 (AMP = (aminomethyl)piperidinium, x = 3 or 4) were only 6.74% and 4.24% for x = 3 and 4, respectively (Table  10f ,g).  89  This was done using the antisolvent method with a small amount of HI added, which is shown to give more perpendicular orientation in films. As mentioned above, using a mixture of FA and MA as the A-site cation leads to lower bandgaps by increasing bond angle. Additionally, the trap density has decreased with the addition of the FA cation.  152  To further tune the properties of these materials, the conjugated spacers 3AMPY and 4AMPY can be studied, which benefit from both small spacer size and larger dielectric constant. Using the same methods and architecture as for 3AMP-and 4AMP-based devices, the efficiencies for (xAMPY)(MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 (AMP = (aminomethyl)pyridinium, x = 3 or 4) are 9.20% and 5.69%, respectively (Table  10h ,i). It is interesting to note that, regarding PCE, 3AMPY > 3AMP > 4AMPY > 4AMP, indicating that substitution position, and thus spacer size, influences the device efficiency more than conjugation in this case. It seems likely that this trend is a result of better crystallinity and orientation for 3AMPY film, as well as different optical properties of the crystals, since the 3AMPY crystals show lower bandgaps and smaller interlayer distances than the 4AMPY ones. The use of 4AMP to form Dion-Jacobson phases, though without SCXRD characterization, has also seen success in improving tin-based device stability.  296, 297  Devices have also been made using other spacers whose final structures have yet to be characterized crystallographically (Table  10 (j,k)). The 4-(aminoethyl)pyridinium (4AEP) spacer is slightly longer than the 4AMPY spacer, but has given an efficiency of 11.68% for a device with ""n = 5"" when using a one-step method with NH 4 SCN as an additive, as has been done for other aromatic spacers.  298  It should be noted that the authors characterized this as though AEP was a monoammonium cation, leading to an excessive of (4AEP)I 2 in the precursor solution. This nice efficiency is attributed to the 4AEP spacer's proclivity to coordination with PbI 2 cations, evidenced by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Another perovskite using the phenylenedimethanammonium (PDMA) spacer and FA as the A-site cation, ""(PDMA)(FA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 ,"" gives an efficiency of 6.52% using a one-step method with no additives. These devices primarily suffer from a low V OC , which may be a result of poor film morphology seen by SEM.  299   ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP""}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""4-chlorophenylethylammonium"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""C 60"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""phenethylammonium"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"

2918,60_3," Solar cell fabrication ITO glass was cleaned by sequentially washing with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol (IPA). ITO was then cleaned with ultraviolet ozone for 15 min. The substrate was then spin-coated with a thin layer of SnO2 nanoparticle solution (1:3:3, SnO2 (15% in water) : IPA : Water) at 3,000 r.p.m. for 20 s, and annealed in ambient air at 150 °C for 1 hour. To fabricate perovskite solar cells based on (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05, the perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving 889 mg ml -1 of FAPbI3, 33 mg ml -1 of MAPbBr3 and 33 mg ml -1 of MACl in DMF/DMSO (8:1 v/v) mixed solvent. Then, the solution was coated onto the ITO/SnO2 substrate by two consecutive spin-coating steps, at 1,000 and 2,500 r.p.m. for 5 s and 20 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating (2,500 r.p.m.) step, 1 ml of diethyl ether was poured onto the substrate after 15 s. The intermediate phase substrate was then put on a hot plate at 150 °C for 10 min.

2920,60_6," Simulation In this report we demonstrate a technique to introduce dimensional mixing into the 2D layer, and we show that this leads to more efficient devices relative to controls. Simulations suggest that the improvements are due to a reduction in trap state density and superior band alignment between the 3D/2D perovskite and the hole-transporting layer. T he topic of improving instability in metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is one of ongoing interest. Reduced-dimensional perovskites (RDPs) have been shown to increase ambient and operating lifetimes of PSCs, and 2D/3D heterostructure PSCs consisting of a thin layer of RDPs atop a 3D active layer improve both stability and efficiency compared to pure 3D counterparts.  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  Studies of 2D/3D interfaces in perovskite solar cells are many and varied, with several reports demonstrating that a 2D interlayer can improve charge extraction.  [6] [7] [8]  Reports have generally focused on creating a thin (5-10 nm) 2D layer to prevent resistive losses. To this end, a dilute solution of ligand is usually employed and is rapidly spin-coated to construct the 2D/3D interface. X-ray diffraction techniques are then used to identify the RDPs formed, with n = 1 being dominant in most reports.  7, 9, 10  Considering the tunability of RDPs, we posited that it is possible to modify the distribution of quantum wells through materials processing parameters. This could then be used to investigate the effect of n > 1 heterostructures on device performance. Initial studies of charge transport through these alternating conductive/insulating layers have shown that high solution concentrations (>5 mM) and thicker 2D layers are detrimental to performance  12, 8  and that it is beneficial to produce disordered interlayers having fewer planes oriented parallel with the substrate.  11  We proposed that by using a very dilute solution (1 mM) and prolonging exposure, we could influence the quantum well distribution without a detrimental thickness increase. We found that prolonging the exposure of 3D perovskite surfaces to a dilute ligand-solution modifies the width distribution of quantum wells in the 2D/3D heterojunction. Tuning this parameter for optimal performance, we were able to improve device power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 19.0(±0.4)% to 21.4(±0.3)%. To probe the effect of ligand exposure on RDP formation, we fabricated 2D/3D perovskite thin films and collected grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns. The 2D layer was formed using a solution of 4vinylbenzylammonium (VBA) ligands, which has been shown to increase the efficiency and ambient stability of PSCs,  6  and the solution was prepared according to ref 7 with a concentration of 1 mM, a protocol that previously has been reported to form a ∼10 nm thick conformal layer between the perovskite and the hole-transporting layer (HTL). Rather than spinning immediately after deposition of the solution, we soaked the films for varying amounts of time (Methods in the Supporting Information). The 2D pattern for the 60 s soaked film is shown in Figure  1a , and patterns for the other films may be found in Figure  S1 . The textured spots along q xy = 0 indicate the RDPs are well-oriented parallel with the substrate. Longer exposure is not correlated with a change in orientation or disorder, but rather with the formation of n = 2 quantum wells. Integrating radially along q z and azimuthally between 0 and we produce a film of predominantly n = 1 structures, and with longer soaking time, we observe increasingly strong diffraction from n = 1. Alongside this we see an increase in n = 2 diffraction with soaking time, growing to exceed the n = 1 peak after 60 s of exposure. These results are summarized in Table  1 . This represented a new parameter space which we could optimize for device performance. To investigate the effect of ligand exposure on devices, we fabricated noninverted (n-i-p) planar PSCs with an ITO/ SnO 2 /perovskite/2D-perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au architecture. The 2D layer was once again formed by soaking the films for different times. Reverse scan J-V curves and corresponding photovoltaic figures of merit are shown in Figure  2 . We found that increased exposure did indeed lead to improved performance, with the greatest improvement for around 30 s of soaking time (21.7% PCE). We also found that overexposure (greater than 30 s) led to a loss in performance, seen as a reduction in V OC .We note that hysteresis was observed for all devices (reverse and forward scans for each device are shown in Figure  S3 ), but the stabilized power output (SPO) for devices held at their MPP for 60 s were only ∼0.7 power points lower than PCEs obtained from the reverse scans. For example, the SPO for control and 30 s soaked devices was 18.5% and 21.2%, respectively. MPP tracking data from these devices can be found in Figure  S4 . Yoo et al. have shown that, when preparing 2D/3D perovskites with ligands dissolved in isopropanol (IPA), exposure of the perovskite to IPA results in the formation of a δ-phase that is detrimental to device performance.  9  However, the ligand solution used in the present study was 97% chloroform (a perovskite antisolvent) and contained only 3% IPA to dissolve the VBA ligand, making solvent-related degradation unlikely. V OC initially increases with prolonged soaking time, which correlates with increasing diffraction from n = 1 planes. V OC is Figure  1 . GIWAXS pattern for the 60 s exposure film (upper panel) and azimuthal integrations along q z for the various conditions (lower panel). Peaks at q ≈ 1.0, ∼0.37, and ∼0.25 Å -1 correspond to the (110) plane of bulk perovskite and (001) planes of n = 1 and n = 2, respectively.  12, 13  Table  1 . Volume Integration of n = 1 and n = 2 Diffraction Spots for Each Soaking Time where the 3D perovskite layer was subjected to no ligand exposure (Control), immediate spin-coating of the ligand-solution (0 s), and various soaking times (10, 30, and 60 s) after depositing the solution onto the surface. Forward scans are omitted for clarity and can be found in Figure  S3 . The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters then reduced by longer soaking, corresponding to stronger diffraction from both structures and the dominance of the n = 2 peak. However, the performance of the 60 s soaked film still exceeds that of the 0 s soak and the control, and the fill factor continues to increase with all soaking times. This contrasts with RDP-only absorber layers, in which dimensional mixing results instead in lower fill factors.  14, 15  It has been proposed that a layer of RDPs above a 3D absorber layer increases efficiency via passivation of traps and thus a reduction in surface recombination.  10  These improvements manifest themselves largely as an improvement in V OC , which is also seen here. It has also been shown that a 2D interlayer results in a higher flat-band potential across the interface between the perovskite and the HTL, which is also related to an increase in V OC .  7  The peaks for both n = 1 and n = 2 become more intense and slightly narrower with longer exposure time, which could indicate a greater number of diffracting planes.  16  Previous reports have found that overly thick 2D layers lead to lower performance, but this is usually due to a reduction in current or fill factor, rather than photovoltage.  6, 8  The fill factor for the 60 s soaking film remains as high as 80%, suggesting excellent carrier extraction and indicating that other factors are responsible for the lower V OC . To understand further how altering the 2D layer affects device performance, we simulated perovskite solar cells using the heterojunction solar cell simulator SCAPS-1D. The simulations (Figure  3 ) show that reducing the surface trap state density between the perovskite layer and HTL increases both V OC (+34 mV) and fill factor (+5.6%) and that the introduction of a thin (5 nm) 2D layer increases V OC (+8 mV) if well-aligned with the 3D perovskite and HTL through a slight increase to the Fermi-level splitting. Misalignment of the 2D layer, however, leads to a significant reduction in V OC (-44 mV), with only a small change in fill factor (-1.5%). These trends suggest the misalignment of the 2D perovskite as a potential explanation for the performance drop of the 60 s soaked films. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) experiments on 2D (n = 1) perovskites have determined the valence band maximum (VBM) to be as low as -5.8 eV,  17  and another study found that the VBM became shallower with increasing n,  18  which would suggest a type I band alignment between 2D and 3D perovskites (both the conduction and valence band of the 3D perovskite sit within the band gap of n = 1). However, another report showed that when a 5 mM VBABr solution was used to form an RDP layer, the VBM was measured to be ∼ -5.4 eV, which is similar to the VBM of low bromine content perovskite,  6  enabling a type II alignment (only one of the conduction or valence band of the 3D perovskite sits within the band gap of n = 1). The position of the VBM for RDPs therefore can vary over hundreds of millielectronvolts. It has been shown that the band alignment of RDPs is dependent on not only their bandgap (∼2.3 eV for n = 1, ∼2 eV for n = 2) but also ligand coverage, where a correlation between increased ligand content and shallower VBMs has been observed.  18, 19  As shown in Figure  3 , an energy level shift of ∼0.4 eV causes the 2D layer to move from the superior type-I alignment with the 3D perovskite (type-II with the HTL), to the inferior type-II alignment with the 3D perovskite (type-I with the HTL). We posit that longer soaking times may lead to increased ligand coverage that upshifts the valence band of RDP layers into a favorable alignment with the 3D layer and the HTL, and increasing the relative amount of n = 2 in the composition would also upshift the valence band with its narrower bandgap and shallower VBM compared to n = 1. Our observations here can be explained if after 30 s of soaking, increased dimensional mixing and ligand coverage lead to a more favorable band alignment, and after 60 s the valence band is further upshifted into inferior alignment. We correlate higher performance in 2D/3D PSCs for films with more n = 1 structures and some dimensional mixing at the perovskite-HTL interface and lower performance for films with majority n = 2 structures. Modulation of 2D/3D interfaces influences the device performance through alterations to the energy landscape via bandgap tuning and shifting of energy levels with varying ligand coverage, improving V OC and fill factor. These results suggest this may be a parameter space warranting further exploration in the field of 2D/3D perovskites. This report is limited to examining the structure and orientation of RDPs using GIWAXS and comparing with device performance. Questions remain, such as the influence of 2D layer thickness; 8 whether prolonged ligand exposure promotes RDP formation only at the film surface or also at grain boundaries; if the band levels of RDPs are altered by ligand exposure time;  18  the true extent of dimensional mixing at the 2D/3D interfaces, and how this affects carrier dynamics and long-term stability.  14  We have shown previously that GIWAXS and XRD are often unable to probe the true n distribution of RDPs because of limited spatial coherence between wells, and optical probes are required instead. Future studies should include a wider suite of characterizations to examine changes in carrier dynamics induced by the modified quantum well structure. 3 Figure S1 . 3S1 Figure S1.

2941,18_13," Device Performance Finally, to close the loop between in situ observations and the proposed interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics, we assembled nip-type PSC with the architecture FTO/SnO 2 /3Dpvsk/RP-phases/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-dip-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD/Au). It is worth pointing out that, for all the samples in this experiment, we performed thermal annealing after the deposition of the bulky cation, following the same procedure as during the in situ PL experiments. Boxplots of all solar cell parameters are shown in Figure  5  and Figure  S12  (Supporting Information). They show that both salts can improve the PCE of the corresponding devices; however, the maximum of the PCE is reached at a much lower concentration in the case of PEAI (4 × 10 -3 m) than in the case of TMAI (40 × 10 -3 m). To understand this trend, we analyze each photovoltaic parameter individually, connecting them to the mechanistic insights discussed above. Up to concentrations of 10 × 10 -3 m, the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) is constant for TMAI and slightly improving for PEAI. For concentrations ≥ 40 × 10 -3 m, there is an (additional) increase of V OC for both bulky molecules, with the highest median for TMAI-80 and PEAI-40. The fill factor (FF) has the most dominant influence on PCE, i.e., FF and PCE show very similar trends: for low concentrations, FF is steadily increasing up to a maximum from which it quickly deteriorates with higher concentrations. This maximum is at 4 × 10 -3 m for PEAI and 40 × 10 -3 m for TMAI. Both the trends of FF and V OC can be explained by the formation mechanics unraveled by in situ and ex situ characterization above. Due to the differences in the energy profile of PEAI and TMAI (Figure  4 ), the final mixture of 2D and quasi-2D layers (i.e., the ratio of n = 1 to n > 1 RP-phases) is different for each molecule. In the case of PEAI, most of the reacted salt is present in form of the n = 1 RP-phase (see Figure  3d ), especially ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""2-thiophenemethylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""2-thiophenemethylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
2944,18_17," Experimental Section Preparation of the 3D-perovskite Thin Films for Materials Characterization: The triple cation [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.87 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.13 ] 0.92 (C sPbI 3 ) 0.08 perovskite thin films were deposited in a N 2 -filled glovebox from a solution containing FAI (GreatCell Solar Materials), MABr (GreatCell Solar Materials), PbI 2 (TCI America), PbBr 2 (TCI America), and CsI (Sigma-Aldrich) with a concentration of 1.3 m. A slightly Pb-rich composition (Pb:(FA,MA,Cs) = 1.05:1.00) was used. The precursor was dissolved in a mixture of anhydrous N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma-Aldrich), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich) with a volume ratio of DMF:DMSO = 4:1 at room temperature. The 3D perovskite films were spin-coated using a one-step process, where 50 µL of the precursor solution was deposited on a 1.7 × 1.7 cm 2 sized glass substrate before starting the spin-coating process. Spin-coating was performed at a speed of 2000 rpm for 12 s followed by 5000 rpm for 30 s. 15 s before the end of the spin-coating, 150 µL of chlorobenzene were dropped on the spinning film. Subsequently, the samples were annealed for 60 min at 100 °C. The glass substrates were cleaned with soapy water, acetone, and isopropanol, and then plasma-treated for 5 min right before perovskite deposition. Preparation of the Polycrystalline RP-Phase for Materials Characterization: For n = 1 RP-Phases: 96 mg of PbI 2 (0.21 mmol) was dispersed in 5 mL of toluene and 1 mL of butyric acid. This dispersion was placed under magnetic stirring, and 0.5 mL of the amine (phenylethylamine or 2-thiophenemethylamine) was added to it. The flask was, then, allowed to stir at room temperature for about 3 min. After this time, the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 was formed (green luminescence under UV light) in the reaction with phenylethylamine, and a clear yellow solution was formed with 2-thiophenemethylamine. The later, upon gentle heat (≈60 °C), a slow precipitation of the (TMA) 2 PbI 4 occurs. The solid material was, then, separated by centrifugation (6000 rpm for 5 min), washed with neat toluene (5 mL), and centrifuged again in the same conditions. The toluene was discarded, and the yellow solid was dried under N 2 flow. This solid was used to perform the SSPL measurements in Figure  S5  (Supporting Information). For n > 1 RP-Phases: A separate formamidinium acetate [FA(OAc)] solution was prepared by dissolving 23 mg (0.22 mmol) of FAOac in 3 mL of toluene and 1 mL of butyric acid. This solution was transferred to a syringe and promptly injected into the reaction mixture obtained before the first centrifuge step of the above procedure (n = 1 RP-phase synthesis). In the case of (PEA) 2 PbI 4 , nothing occurs at first and, upon heating the mixture at 80 °C for a few minutes, the yellow powder slowly turns into a vibrant red color. In the case of (TMA) 2 PbI 4 , a rapid reaction took place upon injection of FAOAc solution, forming a dark-red/brown solid; upon heating at 80 °C for a few minutes, the product turned into a more vivid red color indicating the formation of n > 1 RP-phases (mostly n = 2 in both cases). The solids were separated via centrifugation as well (6000 rpm for 5 min) and washed once with neat toluene. These solids were used for the XRD measurements. Synthesis of the Ammonium Salts: Synthesis of PEAI: To a 50 mL round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, 6 mL of isopropanol and 1.04 mL (1 g, 8.25 mmol, 1 eq.) of phenylethylamine were added. The solution was stirred at 0 °C in an ice bath for 15 min and then 1.42 mL (1.34 g, 10.75 mmol, 1.3 eq.) of HI 57 wt% was added dropwise for 15 min. The reaction proceeded for 3 h, and it was gradually cooled to room temperature. In sequence, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The solid obtained was poured into the toluene (5 mL) and stirred under heating (80 °C) for ≈20 min. After reaching room temperature, diethyl ether was added and the solid was filtered. Following this, the product was recrystallized three times using absolute ethanol and diethyl ether. Finally, the white solid was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 8 h and transferred to an N 2 -filled glove box. Synthesis of TMAI: For the synthesis of TMAI, the same protocol described for PEAI was used, only changing phenylethylamine by 2-thiophenmethylamine. The PEAI and TMAI powders were then dissolved in IPA (varying from 1 to 80 × 10 -3 m concentration) and dynamically deposited onto the 3D perovskite films. Thereby, the spin-coating was performed at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The salt solution was dripped at 7 s after starting the spin-coating. Afterward, the films were annealed at 100 °C for 6 min. Preparation of Solar Cells: The FTO-coated glasses were cleaned by an ultrasonic bath in Hellmanex solution 2% in water (15 min), acetone (15 min), and isopropanol (15 min). The substrates were dried with compressed nitrogen. They were thereafter treated in UV-ozone cleaner for 20 min. A SnO 2 layer was deposited by 3.75% SnO 2 nanoparticle (SnO 2 , 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion, Alfa Aesar) in water at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and annealed in ambient air at 150 °C for 30 min. Before perovskite deposition, the substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 20 min and then transferred to the glovebox filled with nitrogen for perovskite deposition. The perovskite deposition was carried out similar to that described previously. The hole transport layer was prepared by dissolution of Spiro-OMeTAD, lithium bis(tri-fluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI, 1.8 m in acetonitrile), tert-butylpyridine (tBP), and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine) cobalt(III) tri[bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide] (FK209, 0.25 m in acetonitrile) in the proportion 1:3.3:0.5:0.05 in chlorobenzene. The HTM solution was spin-coated dynamically on a rotating substrate at 4000 rpm. A 70 nm-thick gold top electrode was deposited as a top contact electrode by thermal evaporation under high vacuum. Solar Cell Characterization: The J-V characteristic of the solar cells was obtained using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under simulated 1-sun AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm -2 ) with a solar simulator (Asahi, HAL-320). The light intensity was calibrated before each JV scan using a silicon pin photodiode previously calibrated by a KG5 filtered silicon reference cell. The devices were measured both in reverse scan (1.2 to 0 V) and forward scan (0 to 1.2 V) with steps of 0.01 V and a delay time of 100 ms. The cells were masked with a black metal mask limiting the active area to 0.16 cm 2 and reducing the influence of the scattered light. In Situ Photoluminescence Measurements: The in situ PL measurements were carried out using a home-built setup in an N 2filled glove box. Excitation was performed using a laser diode emitting at 405 nm and the PL emission was collected using an optical fiber coupled with an Ocean Optics spectrometer (""Flame"") calibrated by the manufacturer. A Jacobian correction was applied to the data transforming them from wavelength-to energy-space and removed a linear background before fitting them using a combination of one to four Gaussians depending on the presence of RP-phases. Integration times of 250 ms were used during spin-coating and 500 ms during annealing. The spectra shown in Figure  3  were recorded with the same setup using integration times of 2 s. The in situ measurements were performed at least four times with each composition to verify that the described trends are reproducible. Scanning Electron Microscopy: SEM images were collected using a FEI Quanta FEG 250 and an electron beam acceleration of 10 kV. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""2-thiophenemethylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""Tin Oxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""2-thiophenemethylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"

PEA exhibits large amplitudes for all peaks ranging between n1 and n10+; the distribution is similar for BTA besides the lack of n1 QWs.

2963,50_5," ■ INTRODUCTION Organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites are solutionprocessed semiconductors with remarkable photophysical and optoelectronic properties. Their composition is readily tuned via precursor stoichiometry during solution-phase processing, enabling perovskite materials with long carrier diffusion lengths and balanced mobilities, 1,2 low defect densities,  3, 4  and tunable bandgaps,  5, 6  giving rise to efficient light-harvesting and lightemitting devices  7  based on these materials. In light of their potential for scalable and inexpensive processing, these materials hold promise for thin film solar cells in view of their impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) that have now exceeded 22%. The stability of perovskite active layers, especially in the presence of moisture which can travel through low-cost flexible encapsulants, remains a priority area for further research and development.  6, 8  Low-dimensional perovskites consist of perovskite quantum wells (QWs) whose lattice is terminated along one axis using bulky organic ligands such as butylammonium (C 4 H 9 NH 3 + ) or phenethylammonium (C 8 H 9 NH 3 + ) (Figure  1a ). This results in quantum confinement within the resultant perovskite domains: the energy levels, as in conventional QWs, vary with the thickness of the nanoplatelets, and hence with the number of monolayers, n, that reside between the bulk-terminating larger ligands. These outer ligands form bilayer interfaces due to van der Waals interactions, creating a stable barrier that protects the perovskite lattice against degradation (Figure  1b ). Previous works have proven that the mixed perovskite QWs are more resistant to moisture and led to better device stability than their 3D counterparts.  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]  The QW width in solution-cast thin films is determined by the ratio of ligand molecules to perovskite A-site cations (typically methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), or cesium (Cs)) in the precursor solution. Higher ratios of ligandto-A-site cation result in lower n values. Due to thermodynamic mixing and the variable formation energy of the QWs, a mixture of QWs with varying widths is created, centered around an n (henceforth referred to as ⟨n⟩, the average QW width).  14, 15  Lower ⟨n⟩ values confer higher stability but lower efficiencies, resulting in a compromise between enhanced device lifetime and device performance by tuning ⟨n⟩.  8  This has been speculated to be due to the insulating nature of the molecular interfaces between perovskite domains.  8, 10, 14  However, transient absorption spectroscopic studies have shown that both electrons and holes are able to transfer between perovskite QWs on a time scale of several picoseconds.  [15] [16] [17]  This indicates that, while overall carrier mobility is slowed, the molecular barrier separating the perovskite QWs does not fully block charge transfer. The slower charge transfer between perovskite QWs may not be the only, or even the principal, cause of lower device efficiency.  8, 10  We sought to determine properties of the low-⟨n⟩ mixed Q2D perovskite thin films that could lead to reduced overall photovoltaic performance and to utilize the resultant insights to address these limitations. QW polydispersity and the resultant nonflat energy landscape is expected to degrade photovoltaic material performance: carriers will funnel down into QWs with the lowest energy bands where, surrounded by a higherbandgap environment, they may to be extracted to the contacts. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""ISOSL"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""650"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""16.5"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.9""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""phenethylammonium"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""650"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""16.5"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.9""}}"
2964,50_6," ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We began our investigations with a study of how the organic ligand influences QW width distribution. The composition of t h e fi l m s s t u d i e d h e r e f o l l o w s t h e f o r m u l a (L) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n-1 , where L is the ligand molecule allylammonium (ALA), phenethylammonium (PEA), or butylammonium (BTA). We select ⟨n⟩ = 10, since it is known to exhibit PCEs in the range 10-12% and maintain ∼90% of this efficiency after 1000 h of aging,  8  giving an opportunity to address and possibly improve the relatively low efficiency in a reasonably stable material. Figure  1c  shows the absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the ⟨n⟩ = 10 films for the three different ligands. The absorption spectra are dominated by the continuum transitions of the higher-n QWs, but excitonic peaks for lower-n QWs are observable. From the absorption onset and band-edge transitions, it is seen that ALA induces the formation of higher-n QWs, and exhibits smaller peaks for the lower-n QWs. The emission spectra for the three ligands are all qualitatively similar, with only the BTA film having a slightly red-shifted PL peak. This would indicate the formation of more 3D perovskite domains in the material, which would have the smallest bandgap and act as a recombination center.  8, 15, 17  Ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy probes the presence of lower-n QWs, since the excitonic resonances are more easily resolved at early delay times without being  obscured by continuum transitions. Figure  2a-c  shows the TA spectra at various delay times for the ⟨n⟩ = 10 ALA, PEA, and BTA films. Negative features correspond to bleached excitonic transitions in the QWs, whereas positive features are caused by blue-shifting of the exciton peak due to hot carriers and manybody effects present at early delay times (0-5 ps).  18  The ALA film features one main bleach peak at ∼750 nm, and vanishingly small amplitudes for lower-n QWs. This is in sharp contrast to the PEA and BTA films, which show peaks for QWs with n as low 2 and 3 in the case of BTA and PEA, respectively. We fit the main exciton bleach (between ∼710 and 750 nm) for the three ligands (Figure  S1 ), and find the fwhm to be ∼200 meV narrower for ALA compared to the two other ligands, showing that, within this inhomogeneously broadened peak, the distribution of QWs (e.g., n = 6-10) is narrowest for ALA. The same relationship between the ligands and the degree of polydispersity is also found in films of ⟨n⟩ = 3 (Figure  S2 ). To assess whether the choice of ligand and QW polydispersity influences crystallinity and ordering of the QWs, we carried out Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-Ray Scattering (GIWAXS) measurements on films of ⟨n⟩ = 3, 5, and 10 using the three different ligands. We show GIWAXS diffraction patterns for the ⟨n⟩ = 3 films here (Figure  2d-f ), since these contain more low-n QWs and exhibit brighter diffraction peaks compared to ⟨n⟩ = 5 and ⟨n⟩ = 10 films (Figure  S3 ). It is possible to identify the morphological composition and orientation of the low-dimensional perovskite films with various ligands. Highly textured spots below 1 Å -1 along q xy = 0 in ALA and BTA films point to the formation of low-n QWs with a high degree of spatial coherence and equally high degree of orientation with ligand bilayers parallel to the substrate. Furthermore, these films (particularly the ALA film) exhibit highly patterned spots for q > 1 Å -1 , evidencing a high degree of orientation of the perovskite unit cell (see Figure  S4  for slices along q z at q xy = 0 for the three GIWAXS images). This observation points to a high degree of order even among larger-n QWs. This trend is decreased in the BTA film along with a concurrent rise in the intensity of the isotropic ring exhibited by disordered crystallites. The PEA film, on the other hand, exhibits weak low-n QW diffraction peaks and broad isotropic rings for q > 1 Å -1 , suggesting a greater disorder of the crystallites. To understand how the QW polydispersity and presence of lower-n QWs in an otherwise homogeneous QW mix may affect transport, we use ultrafast TA to examine the carrier dynamics in highly polydisperse PEA films. ⟨n⟩ = 3 is again chosen to create a larger distribution of different QWs with more distinguishable excitonic resonances, such that it is easier to observe electron and hole transfer between them, and PEA is selected as the ligand, since the energy transfer rates can be compared with previous reports for this exact system.  15  Figure  3a  shows the evolution of the various exciton bleaching peaks following photoexcitation at the n4 resonance (640 nm), where the hole, electron, and exciton transfer are highlighted by the dashed rectangles. Peaks at n2, n3, n5, and the mixture of n6+ begin to grow in within the first tens of picoseconds before the overall spectrum begins to decay due to recombination. Fits to the carrier dynamics are obtained with global analysis (using Glotaran,  19  see the Supporting Information). The three lifetimes used in the fitting are 9, 138, and 4300 ps. The 9 ps component accounts for ultrafast charge transfer, as can be seen from the curves in Figure  3b  (rise times at 610, 666, and 700 nm, corresponding to excitonic bleach of n3, n5, and n6, respectively), whereas the other fast component is attributed to slower transport throughout the film to eventually reach the highest and lowest n QWs. The long ∼4 ns component is attributed to recombination (see Figure  S5  for decay associated spectra for these lifetimes and fit residuals). Transfer from lowto high-n QWs is due to exciton and electron transfer, whereas high-to low-n transfer results from hole migration. This is consistent with the band structure of mixed Q2D perovskites (Figure  3c ) that has been previously determined using UPS on films  15  and single crystals,  11  as well as inferred from TA experiments.  16  Extrapolating the results from ⟨n⟩ = 3 PEA films, we predict that this picosecond hole transfer from high to low n would cause the lower-n QWs to act as shallow traps for holes in the device relevant ⟨n⟩ = 10 films. We sought to determine if the hole-trapping low-n QWs (n = 3-6) that are more abundant in the ⟨n⟩ = 10 PEA-and BTAbased films would be detrimental to carrier transport. PL quenching methods have been used to study transport properties (lifetimes, diffusion lengths, and mobilities) in quantum dot solids and in bulk perovskite thin films.  2, 20  We follow the formalism of Tisdale et al.,  21  which expands upon the 1D PL quenching method to determine diffusion lengths in thin films, and use the same quencher materials as in previously reported quenching experiments for perovskites.  2, 20  Analytical solutions to the 1D diffusion equation and some approximations lead to the following expression of the carrier diffusion length, L D , π τ τ ≈ - ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ L d 2 2 1 D quench which relies only on the film thickness (d), carrier lifetime, and quenched lifetimes for electrons and holes in order to estimate the diffusion length. Small variations in thickness determine the error in estimates of L D and other transport parameters. Figure  S6  shows the fitted transient PL data for three different films with and without the quencher layers. L D for electrons and holes in each film and the parameters used for its calculation are shown in Table  1 . Mobilities are calculated using the diffusion length equation and Einstein relation: τ = L D D μ = D kT q / The ALA-based films have the highest L D and μ, longest lifetimes, and most balanced transport out of the three different ligands. PEA has comparatively large L D for electrons but is significantly limited by hole diffusion, whereas the BTA films exhibit low lifetimes and relatively poor L D for both carriers. Again in the case of BTA, the hole diffusion length is much lower than that of the electron. These findings corroborate our ultrafast TA results, and support the notion that the presence of lower-n QWs in the ⟨n⟩ = 10 films for PEA and BTA should lead to shallow trapping of holes. The PL quenching studies indicate that ALA-based films benefit greatly from the lack of lower-n QWs in these materials, and also suggest that the flattened energy landscape of the more monodisperse QW width distribution assists transport, since the electron mobility of ALA is greater than both BTA and PEA. This is analogous to the influence of bandgap polydispersity on transport and photovoltaic efficiency in quantum dot solids,  22, 23  where a flatter energy landscape and reduced number of shallow traps increases carrier mobility. To examine whether the superior transport properties of ALA films were due to faster charge transfer (as a result of reduced ligand length), we performed TA experiments on mixed low-n films and monitored the lowest energy bleach peak for funneling of carriers (Figure  S8 ). Most notably, ALA and BTA have similar transfer rates despite their different lengths. We also point out that any significantly enhanced electronic coupling from shorter ligands should result in a red-shift of the exciton peaks (as demonstrated in low-dimensional perovskites by Soe et al. using guanidinium as a ligand),  24  yet we do not observe such a red-shift here. We conclude that the small difference in ligand length between ALA, BTA, and PEA is not responsible for the longer diffusion lengths and higher mobilities in ALA films. Anticipating that longer, balanced L D for electrons and holes should lead to increased photovoltaic efficiency, we fabricated solar cells out of the ⟨n⟩ = 10 films for each ligand. J-V curves measured for devices with the three different ligands are shown in Figure  4 , and their characteristics are listed in Table  2 . Out of the three different ligands, the ALA-based films show the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.4% compared to 12.1% and 11.5% for the PEA and BTA films, respectively. While the PEA and BTA devices both possess V OC similar to ALA, they are limited by the fill factor (FF) in the case of PEA and the photocurrent (J SC ) in the case of BTA. We note that the PCE obtained for PEA, and its stability over time when stored under ambient conditions, is very close to that previously reported for nearly identical devices (see ref 8). Owing to the aforementioned performance-stability compromise that follows from the choice of ⟨n⟩, it is important to ensure that the augmented performance of ALA-based films does not arise simply due to these films having a higher ⟨n⟩ QW distribution after being cast into a film (e.g., if ⟨n⟩ = 10 was designated in solution, but a distribution closer to ⟨n⟩ = 20 or 30 actually formed in film due to incomplete ligand incorporation, or the varying solubility between ligands). We rule this out, since the TA peak maximum for the ⟨n⟩ = 10 films is roughly the same (∼750 nm) for all three ligands, indicating that the mixed QWs exhibit a similar degree of confinement and therefore similar ⟨n⟩. We also determined the ligand-tomethylammonium (L:MA) ratios in the films by redissolving them in d 6 -DMSO and then integrating the relevant peaks in 1 H NMR spectra. The L:MA ratios were found to be 0.32:1 (⟨n⟩ = 7), 0:32:1 (⟨n⟩ = 7), and 0.26:1 (⟨n⟩ = 9) for ALA, PEA,   and BTA, respectively (Figures  S9-S12 ). This indicates that the ⟨n⟩ distribution for ALA is not artificially higher than the other ligands. Additionally, the photovoltaic devices have very similar stabilities when stored under ambient conditions, retaining roughly more than 90% of their initial PCEs after 500 h (Figure  S13 ). If the ⟨n⟩ distribution for the ALA films were higher, the increase in performance would be accompanied by a decrease in stability.  8  We thus conclude that the ALA devices' superior performance is derived from the reduced number of lower-n QWs in these films. We also reaffirm the assessment that the lower-n QWs in PEA and BTA films act shallow traps rather than deep traps, since such an abundance of deep traps would be expected to lead to much worse device performances. We speculate that the higher n distribution in ALA films compared to PEA and BTA results from the differences in intermolecular bonding at the QW interfaces. The formation energies for various n value QWs using PEA have been calculated using density functional theory (DFT), and it was determined that lower-n QWs have higher formation energies due to the van der Waals and π-stacking interactions between the PEA moieties, favoring the initial formation of low-n QWs regardless of precursor stoichiometry in solution.  8  BTA molecules also have similar van der Waals interactions to stabilize the interfaces between QWs. Since ALA has only the single CC bond to promote intermolecular interactions between QWs, we suspect that this lowers the formation energy for lower-n QWs, and thus allows for a distribution of QWs that is closer to the originally designated ratio in solution. This would suggest that the loss in formation energy would make these films more unstable and susceptible to degradation; however, our device aging studies indicate that this is not the case. A full understanding of the mechanism that links the choice of ligand with the QW n distribution is an important future direction for this field. The composition of all of the films studied thus far follows the formula (L) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n-1 , i.e. iodine as the halide and MA as the A-site cations. Numerous reports indicate that perovskites with mixed halide (I/Br) and mixed cation (MA, FA, and Cs) compositions achieve higher PCEs.  6, [25] [26] [27]  We fabricated ⟨n⟩ = 10 perovskite devices using a mixed halide (85:15 I:Br) and mixed cation composition (0.14:0.81:0.05 MA:FA:Cs) reported to give efficiencies over 21% in 3D perovskites,  25  using the formula ALA 2 (MA 0.14 FA 0.81 Cs 0.05 ) 9 -Pb 10 (I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 29 . Device performance and hysteresis depended heavily on the halides and solvents used in the precursor solution. In particular, precursor solutions containing dimethylformamide as the primary solvent resulted in much lower performance than a 1:1 mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide and γbutyrolactone, and using a ratio of 0.15:0.85 Br to I also lowered the overall device performance (Figures  S14  and S15 ). However, when Br is removed from this mixture but the mixed cation composition (0.81:0.14:0.05 for FA:MA:Cs) is retained, device performances up to 16.5% could be obtained via an increase in J SC compared to the pure-MA devices (Figure  4 ), with a similar degree of hysteresis (Figure  S16 ). These results, along with more recent reports of mixed cation perovskite QW photovoltaics,  6, 9  indicate the potential of these lower-dimensional perovskite QW photovoltaics to achieve higher efficiencies while maintaining stability. The hysteresis that is present in both the MA-only and mixed cation films needs to be addressed but can be overcome with strategies such as increasing ⟨n⟩ 8 or preheating substrates prior to film deposition (hot-casting).  10   ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""phenethylammonium"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""650"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""16.5"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.9""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""butylammonium"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""650"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""21"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.9""}}"
2982,39_4," The bigger picture Understanding interface energetics and physics is paramount to obtain exact knowledge about the function and operation of a device. This stands true for solar cells and for devices where interfaces are crucial. In this work, for the first time, we determine the exact knowledge on the interface energetics across 2D/3D perovskite interfaces showing that it forms a p-n junction that is capable of suppressing the interfacial recombination losses. This leads to the photovoltaic devices with high open-circuit voltage, which approach the potential internal quasi-Fermi level splitting of the perovskite absorber, nullifying the losses. This is a breakthrough in this field. Chem 7, 1903-1916, July 8, 2021 ª 2021 Elsevier Inc. 1903 ll band structure and energetics and their effect on the processes and loss mechanisms remain largely unexplored, mainly due to the lack of a direct experimental evidence. In this study, we target the interface energetics of optimized 2D/3D perovskite systems by measuring the vertical energy level landscape by an innovative ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) depth profiling technique. The analysis reveals intriguing variations of the interfacial energetics, which depend on the chemical nature of the 2D overlayer. Specifically, we explore a series of thiophene-based cations that form the 2D perovskite layer, which differ slightly in their chemical structure. When integrated in a 2D/3D-based perovskite solar cell, they deliver approximately 21% power conversion efficiency and open-circuit voltage (V OC ) approaching 1.2 V. The photovoltaic performance is intimately linked to 2D/3D interfacial band bending and to a natural formation of a p-n junction in optimal devices. By calculating the quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) from photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) for the neat material and the complete device, we identify that the optimal energetic alignment and reduced electron density at the interface serve as the reasons for such a significant reduction in the nonradiative interfacial recombination losses. This allows us to reach radiative efficiencies of 2% in completed devices, which is far above average.  2  Importantly, the recombination mechanisms proposed are corroborated by drift-diffusion simulation. The optimized 2D/3D interface shows zero interfacial voltage losses, reaching the QFLS-potential of the neat perovskite absorber, thus nullifying the energy losses at the interfaces. As such, we rationalized the mechanisms and the effect of 2D/ 3D interfaces on the effective reduction of the interfacial energy losses, providing a clear path for pushing perovskite solar cells performances closer to their theoretical limits.  2  In particular, we elucidate the fundamental principles of how the creation of 3D/2D heterojunctions and the energy alignment at the hole-selective interface allow us to overcome the decisive interfacial recombination losses of minority carriers at the interface to spiro-OMeTAD interface. This is achieved with a 2-TMAI (Br)-based 2D perovskite layer, which forms an apparent p-n junction with the 3D perovskite, thereby blocking the minority carriers from reaching the spiro-OMeTAD layer. Notably, in this system, the main voltage loss is only because of nonradiative recombination in the perovskite absorber layer, whereas interface recombination is essentially absent. This finding bears important implications for further perovskite design as several perovskites now achieve radiative efficiencies that are very close to the radiative limits.  2, [22] [23] [24] [25]  Hence, our approach to effectively suppress the interfacial recombination may hold the key to create near-ideal perovskite cells in the near future if applied to perovskite layers with very high PLQYs. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null}"
2983,39_5," RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The 2D/3D interfaces investigated here are based on a novel set of bulky thiopheneterminated cations, namely, 2-thiophenemethylammonium iodide (2-TMAI), 9,26 2-thiophenemethylammonium bromide (2-TMABr), and 2-thiophenemethylammonium chloride (2-TMACl), that serve as a building block for the formation of the 2D perovskite layer on top of the 3D bulk layer (Figure  1A ). The 3D perovskite layer is based on a triple-cation composition [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.87 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.13 ] 0.92 (CsPbI 3 ) 0.08 with a band gap of 1.610 eV. The chemical structures of the thiophenemethylammonium salts are shown in Figure  1B . The three different 2-thiophenemethylammonium halides (2-TMAX, where X: Cl, Br, I) were prepared from the commercially available amines and the corresponding acids (see experimental procedures). The salts were then diluted in isopropanol (IPA) and dynamically spin-coated on top of the triple-cation-based 3D perovskite film. 2D perovskites were selectively grown by controlling the excess PbI 2 composition (PbI 2 :FAI = 1.05:1) in the 3D perovskite, which reacts with the thiophene ammonium halide cations to form the 2D layer.  4, 9, 26  Figure  1B  shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the 2D/3D films collected at a low diffraction angle. When the 2-TMAX is used to coat the 3D layer, intense reflexes at 4.3 and 8.6 appeared at the XRD diffractograms, consistent with the key characteristic peaks of 2D perovskites (n = 2).  9, 26  In the case of 2-TMAI, an additional reflection at 6.1 was observed, which corresponds to the n = 1 phase of 2D perovskite.  9  The XRD pattern of the 3D perovskite layer as the control is depicted in Figure  S1 . Cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images shown in Figure  1C  show that the 500 nm thick 3D perovskite layer was continuously coated with a 2D overlayer, with a thickness of approximately 50-60 nm. The top surface images reveal that the formation of the 2D layers results in smoother surfaces, with lessdefined grain boundaries and crystal borders. This was particularly evident in the cases of 2-TMAI and 2-TMABr, whereas in the case of 2-TMACl, a distribution of distinct phases with larger and more elongated grains was visible. The absorption spectra of the 2D/3D thin films are reported in Figure  S2 , while Figure  S3  shows the PL spectra upon excitation from the front side of the film. Notably, in all cases, a clear peak at the lower wavelength region was observed, confirming the formation of a distinct 2D perovskite overlayer. 2-TMAI-based 2D/3D exhibited PL emission peak at 520 and 570 nm, which correspond to n = 1 and n = 2 phases of 2D perovskite, respectively. On the other hand, 2-TMABr and 2-TMACl-based 2D/ 3D only showed an emission peak at the low wavelength region ($545 nm), which is associated with the n = 2 phase. Furthermore, in agreement with what we recently reported, 9 the 2-TMAI-based 2D/3D showed a slightly reduced band gap with respect to the 2-TMABr and 2-TMACl, as revealed by the photoluminescence peak emission shift (of around 0.1 eV) in Figure  S3 . The photovoltaic (PV) response of the 2-TMAX-based 2D/3D perovskite solar cells are shown in Figure  2 , and the PV parameters for champion devices are summarized in Table 1. The hysteresis measurements are reported in Figure  S4  and Table  S2 . With respect to the control, a clear increase in the V OC was observed with the 2D perovskite layer that was higher for 2-TMABr and 2-TMACl. It is important to note that the device V OC reported here is underestimated due to the use of a small mask (0.16 cm 2 ) on a large pixel (0.54 cm 2 ). The reduction in V OC values due to the masking effect could be calculated by the equation DV OC = kT/q ln(A aperture /A device ), where kT/q is the thermal voltage, A aperture is the mask aperture, and A device is the pixel area.  27  Considering that the dark current of the pixel is not affected by the mask, this implies a $3.4-fold overestimation of the dark saturation current (J 0 ), which is equivalent to a voltage loss of 31 mV. When measuring was done without mask, the real maximum device voltage (represented with stars in Figure  2B ) for the reference cell was 1.141 V, while for 2-TMAI, 2-TMABr, and 2-TMACl, the values were 1.153, 1.193, and 1.175 V, respectively (see also Figure  S5 ), which are among the highest values reported so far for n-i-p devices with a mesoporous structure. Importantly, the 2-TMABr shows a remarkable increase in V OC , without compromising the fill factor (FF), which remains comparable to the control device, resulting in an overall increase in the device efficiency. On the other hand, the 2-TMACl shows a reduction in the FF. The highest PV performance is therefore achieved with 2-TMABr-based 2D devices, delivering a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.82%. We noticed that in this series of 2D perovskites, a slight decrease in the short-circuit current (J SC ) was observed. The J SC values obtained from the J-V measurements were in agreement with the calculated J SC from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Figure  S6 ). This decrease might be related to the limitation in the charge transport induced by the presence of the bulky organic moieties. The long-term stability of the devices was monitored under continuous illumination of 1-sun intensity for 1,000 h in an argon atmosphere and is shown in Figure  2D . While the performance of the standard 3D device is reduced to 65% of its initial PCE, the 2D-functionalized solar cells showed a reduced loss in the PCE, with the 2-TMABr/ 3D devices displaying the best stability retaining 75% of the initial PCE after 1,000 h. This confirms that the 2D surface functionalization has a crucial impact on the device lifetime with the best performances achieved with the 2-TMABr-based 2D perovskite. 2D/3D perovskite devices are demonstrated to be highly sensitive to the nature of the organic cation that impacts the device V OC and FF. To elucidate the link between material properties and device performances, it is necessary to directly probe the energetic alignment of the 2D/3D interfaces. The traditional methodology based on UPS measurements is only capable of probing the top 1-2 nm of the surface and will not provide an insight regarding the buried 2D/3D interface. Recently, we developed a method termed UPS depth profiling technique, which allows probing the energetic landscape at the bulk of materials and across buried interfaces.  28  The principle of this technique is shown in Figure  3A  and is based on the essentially damage-free etching enabled by argon gas-cluster ion beams-(1) in combination with UPS measurements and (2) after each etching step. While this method has been previously applied solely to organic systems and organic/inorganic systems,  [29] [30] [31]  this is the first example of its application for the study of perovskite materials. Using this method, we could accurately measure the progression of the vacuum level and valence band positions as a function of film depth, as depicted in the illustration in Figure  3B , providing an in situ measurement of the interfacial energy levels alignment in a 2D/3D system for the first time (Figure  3C ). The position of the conduction band was then estimated by adding the corresponding optical gap. The UPS measurements reveal that the ionization potential (IP) of the 2D and 3D perovskites are all very similar (in the range 6.2-6.6 eV). This is in agreement with previous studies on BA 2 PbI 4 (IP = 6.5 eV) and BA 2 PbBr 4 (IP = 5.8 eV),  32  the IP values of which were found to be in good agreement with those of the corresponding 3D perovskites.  33, 34  The similarity of the IPs is also in agreement with the results of the study conducted by Zhang et al., who observed a change in IP of only 0.1 eV between the 3D and the 2D perovskites they investigated.  32  The matching IPs explain why 2D perovskites can serve as capping layers for 3D perovskites in the n-i-p architecture in which they can permit the extraction of holes, while blocking electrons owing to their higher-lying conduction bands. While the ionization potentials of the materials are similar, UPS depth profiling of the three sets of 2D/3D samples revealed significant differences in their interfacial energetic alignment. Examining the band structure, it is clear that exchanging the halide on the bulky cations has important consequences for the evolution of the valence band levels: (1) 2-TMABr and 2-TMAI showed a shift in valence band compared with the 3D perovskite, indicating an effective energy level alignment to promote hole extraction, while 2-TMACl exhibited an opposite trend, with a slight uphill energy barrier (over the entire 2D layer). This resulted in the first two cases in the formation of a p-n junction, which promoted charge extraction. Notably, this is consistent with the low FF observed in the 2-TMACl 2D/3D devices. (2) All the 2D/3D interfaces investigated exhibited excellent electron-blocking properties, with the energetic barrier being enhanced from 0.55 eV for 2-TMAI to 0.63 and 0.68 eV for 2-TMABr and 2-TMACl, respectively. The improvement in electron blocking suggested a more efficient reduction of minority carriers at the HTL interface of the device, which is in good agreement with the corresponding enhancement in the opencircuit voltage observed from the photovoltaic results. Notably, in all cases, the 3D perovskite was n-type, which is in agreement with the PbI 2 excess used in this case (see reference measurement on a 3D film in Figure  S7 ).  34  Surprisingly, while the 2D layer formed by the 2-TMACl cation followed a similar character to that of the 3D perovskite, 2-TMABr and 2-TMAI denoted a clear transition toward a p-type material. Such a transition is responsible for the formation of a p-n junction at the interface, offering the possibility to improve the charge extraction and reduce interface recombination. This is particularly evident in the cases of 2-TMABr and 2-TMAI, while it is less manifested at the 2-TMACl-based interface, possibly due to a less homogeneous 2D surface layer (see SEM top view in Figure  1C ). As such, this proves that band bending happens at an optimized 2D/3D perovskite interface, contributing to improving the device performance, as reported for other PV technologies.  35  A similar formation of a p-n junction also occurs in other cations, such as 2-thiopheneethylammonium iodide (2-TEAI) and 3-methylammonium iodide (3-TMAI) (Figure  S8 ), which also show high photovoltaic performance.  9  These results are also supported by numerical drift-diffusion device simulations, based on a well-established model,  [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41]  which compares the effect of the additional 2D layer and the different energetic alignment scenarios based on the experimental results obtained for the reference 3D samples, 2-TMABr and 2-TMACl (Figures  S9A-S9C ). The effect of the enhanced electron blocking at the 2D/3D interface is evident when comparing the carrier densities in the proximity of the HTL interface (Figures S9D-S9F, dashed red circle). In the case of 2D/3D systems, the electron density at that interface is significantly reduced when compared with the reference 3D case. When incorporating the 2-TMABr layer into the device structure, the simulated V OC increases from $1.14 to $1.19 V (Figure  S9G ), which is in excellent agreement with the experimental J-V results. This increase can be attributed to the strong reduction of the electron density in the 2D perovskite closer to the interface with the HTL, which effectively limits the interfacial recombination losses (see Figure  3H ).  42  Overall, in the case of the 2-TMABr cation, the band bending reduces the electron accumulation at the interface with the HTL, thereby reducing charge recombination while effectively driving holes into the HTM without inducing FF losses. Together, these processes provide an effective means to eliminate the severe nonradiative recombination loss at the HTM/perovskite interface. To further corroborate these findings and to understand the physical processes governing these 2D/3D interfaces triggering the improvement in device V OC , we measured the PL spectra, as shown in Figures  S10A  and S10B , and we calculated the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY, Figure  S10C ). The PLQY values were then used to derive the QFLS in neat materials and complete solar cell devices, as shown in Figure  4 . This analysis allowed us to assess the relative contribution of bulk and interfacial recombination losses and also the impact of the interfacial energy alignment.  2, 39, 43  We noticed that the neat materials exhibited PLQYs over 1% (see Figures S10A and S10C), which is quite typical for mixed perovskites. The results also highlight that the addition of a 2D layer improves the QFLS of the neat perovskite absorber (triangle in Figure  4A ), indicating a trap-passivating behavior and/or a reduction of minority charges at the defect-dense perovskite surface in the presence of the 2D layer.  2  More importantly, however, the PLQY of the 2-TMABr device approached 2%, which is above average (see Figures  S10B  and S10C ).  38  The deviation from the Shockley-Queisser radiative V OC limit is due to mainly two factors. The first one is the nonradiative recombination in the perovskite absorber. As observed from the PLQY of the neat materials, the QFLS is already limited to roughly 1.25 eV, indicating a certain degree of recombination limiting the potential V OC . The second limiting factor is interface recombination between the perovskite and the transport layers. Usually, the latter is strongly limiting the V OC of Pb-based perovskite cells. Notably, in our 2D/3D system, since the QFLS of the neat materials matched with a good degree to the V OC of the complete device, the main voltage loss was only due to nonradiative recombination in the perovskite absorber layer, while interface recombination was essentially absent. Furthermore, Figure  4  shows that the trend in the nonradiative recombination losses in the devices as determined from the PLQY (squares in Figure  4 ) follows the trend observed in the J-V measurements. Interestingly, when the QFLS of the device was compared with the QFLS of the neat material, we found that all devices that employ the 2D layer display smaller energy losses due to less interfacial recombination losses compared with the reference cell. This confirms a key conclusion from the UPS measurements and the numerical simulations, which is that the 2D layer effectively reduces the density of minority carriers at the HTL interface. Importantly, the device based on 2-TMABr as the cation exhibits an equal QFLS in the neat material and in the complete device, which is also approximately equal to the device V OC (stars in Figure  4 ). This highlights the presence of a lossless perovskite/HTL interface and that the 2-TMABr/3D layer enables to reach the QFLS-potential of the neat perovskite layer.  2  These results are in accordance with the UPS depth profiling and simulation data. However, in the case of the reference device and to a lesser extent in the devices with the other 2D layers, the internal QFLS is considerably higher than the external V OC . As recently discussed, this effect can be explained by an internal bending of the hole quasi-Fermi level, which impacts primarily the device V OC rather than the QFLS in the perovskite layer and suggesting an energy misalignment between the perovskite and the transport layer. This represents an additional interfacial recombination loss that is not captured by measuring the PL emission from the cell.  38, 39  Considering that the internal QFLS is significantly higher than the external V OC in the reference device, an energy misalignment between the perovskite and the spiro-OMeTAD is suggested. Hence, the application of 2D layers might further reduce the detrimental effect of an energetic misalignment between the perovskite and the spiro-OMeTAD layer, as it effectively blocks the minority carriers from reaching the spiro-OMeTAD layer. In fact, we found that 2-TMABr and the formation of the p-n junction is most effective at suppressing all interfacial recombination losses, where the V OC is only limited by the radiative efficiency of the neat material. In conclusion, by combining a comprehensive analysis on device performances, device and interface QFLS, and interface energetics, we demonstrate that even subtle changes in the composition of the 2D perovskite can lead to differences in the energetic alignment at the 2D/3D interface, with a direct impact on charge density distribution, interfacial recombination, and ultimately on the device performance. Our work provides the first demonstration of an optimized 2-TMABr-based 2D/3D perovskite solar cells with zero interfacial voltage losses, reaching the QFLS-potential of the neat perovskite absorber, thus nullifying the energy losses at the interfaces. UPS depth profiling is demonstrated to be a valuable method allowing the direct probe of the interfacial alignment and band bending. Overall, this knowledge is essential to drive interfacial chemistry and functionalization to guide a smart device optimization. Combining chemical manipulation of the 2D perovskite and a deep understanding of the 2D/3D interface energetics and recombination processes, our results provide clear evidence that 2D/3D interface engineering with optimal energetics allows nullifying the nonradiative interfacial recombination of electron and holes, demonstrating a breakthrough in the path to further enhance perovskite solar cell performance. gradually and then it was poured into an excess of diethyl ether (Et ) in DMF and DMSO mixture with the volume ratio of 0.78:0.22. An excess of PbI 2 by 5% toward FAI was used in the precursor solution to control the growth of the 2D perovskite layer.

Chlorobenzene was poured on top of the spinning substrate 15 s prior to the end of the spin-coating process. The deposited 3D perovskite film was annealed at 100 C for 60 min. Then, the film was allowed to cool down to the room temperature, and the corresponding thiophenemethylammonium halide cations (60 mM in isopropanol) was deposited dynamically under 4,000 rpm for 30 s.

[1]  The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) formulated by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof   (PBE) was chosen as the exchange-correlation functional.  [2]  The plane-wave cut-off energy was set to 500 eV. Considering the molecular-rotation-induced uncertainties of organic MA and FA, we use Rb and Cs to replace them in order to further simplify the model following previous reported method.

The k-point meshes of 5×5×1 and 3×3×1 were used in the calculations of PbI 2termiated surfaces for the CsPbI 3 , RbPbI 3 , and Cs 0.5 Rb 0.5 PbI 3 , respectively (see Figure  S1 ). About 15 Å vacuum was added on the top of the slab surface to minimize the interaction between the adjacent slabs. During the structural relaxation, the innermost three atomic layers were fixed at their bulk values, while the other layers were well optimized under sufficient convergence criteria (0.01 eV/Å). The surface energy (E surf ) was calculated on the basis of the bond cleaving and surface relaxation approach,  [4]  following the Equation S1.

[2]  Among various compositions, hybrid organic-inorganic PSCs based on mixed-cation formamidinium/methylammonium (FA/MA) perovskites have been attractive not only due to higher efficiency, but also better thermal stability, higher phase stability and more robust long-term stability than the FA cation or MA cation only counterparts.  [3]  For instance, MA cation only perovskite, i.e., MAPbI 3 , has a very low tetragonal-to-cubic phase transformation temperature of about 60 °C. FA Crystal orientation has a great impact on the properties of perovskite films and the resultant device performance. Up to now, the exquisite control of crystal orientation (the preferred crystallographic planes and the crystal stacking mode with respect to the particular planes) in mixed-cation perovskites has received limited success, and the underlying mechanism that governs device performance is still not clear. Here, a thermodynamically favored crystal orientation in formamidinium/methylammonium (FA/MA) mixed-cation perovskites is finely tuned by composition engineering. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the FA/MA ratio affects the surface energy of the mixed perovskites, leading to the variation of preferential orientation consequently. The preferable growth along the (001) crystal plane, when lying parallel to the substrates, affects their charge transportation and collection properties. Under the optimized condition, the mixed-cation perovskite (FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl)) solar cells deliver a champion power conversion efficiency over 21%, with a certified efficiency of 20.50 ± 0.50%. The present work not only provides a vital step in understanding the intrinsic properties of mixed-cation perovskites but also lays the foundation for further investigation and application in perovskite optoelectronics. cation only perovskite, i.e., FAPbI 3 , can be easily transformed from a black photo-active perovskite cubic phase to an undesirable yellow photo-inactive nonperovskite hexagonal phase at room temperature.  [4]  As promising candidates to replace MA or FA only perovskites, mixed FA/MA cation perovskites have been widely studied from the perspective of: 1) bandgap tuning;  [4a,5]  2) thermal stability;  [4]  3) phase stability;  [4a,6]  4) morphology,  [7]  leading to the optimized film property and device performance. Apart from the above macroscopic properties, the microstructure of the mixed perovskites especially for the preferred orientation, shows great influence on the properties of charge carrier, such as the recombination, diffusion length, mobilities,  [8]  etc, and the charge transfer at the interfaces.  [9]  Fortunately, the preferred crystal orientation is also expected to be tuned by the MA/FA composition engineering, however, an exquisite control and systematic investigation on the crystal orientation are required to better understand the origin of the crystal orientation and its impacts on optoelectronic properties.  [10]  Efforts were documented to reveal the origin of the crystal orientation, where MAPbI 3 , FAPbI 3 , and MA/FA mixed perovskite were examined intuitively. Take the tetragonal MAPbI 3based perovskite film for example, it was observed that the diffraction intensity along (  110 ) or (  112 ) direction was substantially increased, by employing a facile one-step roll-imprinting method,  [11]  or thermal-gradient-assisted directional crystallization method.  [10]  For the FAPbI 3 perovskite film, the diffraction intensity along (001) direction was substantially increased in most case, as a result of its cubic phase. With respect to MA/FA mixed perovskites, a preferred orientation along (100) and excellent crystallinity were obtained through Sn doping,  [12]  Br doping,  [13]  or the templating effect associated to the specific beneath layer.  [14]  Besides, a preferred orientation along (021) or (012) in mixed FA/MA perovskite film could be achieved by altering organic cation concentration,  [15]  or meniscus-assisted solution printing strategy.  [16]  These suggested that a delicate control of crystal orientation of perovskite was a promising way to modulate the properties of mixed FA/MA cation perovskite films and device performance. However, most of the studies failed to explore the origin of the preferable crystal orientation in FA/MA mixed perovskites. Only recently, a versatile x(FA-PbI 2 )-(1-x)(3MAI-PbCl 2 ) precursor was proven to be able to grow highly oriented perovskite films, which was attributed to the effect from the formation of chlorine-containing intermediates during a topotactic transformation, which was kinetically controlled.  [17]  Still, it is of considerable interest to explore the preferred crystal orientation in the context of thermodynamics, and its effect on film quality and device performance of mixed FA/MA cation perovskites. Different from the impact of kinetics, we systematically investigated the crystal orientation of mixed FA/MA cation perovskites fabricated through a two-step interdiffusion method via composition engineering, and illuminated an unexplored preferred crystal orientation controlled by thermodynamics. The combination of experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicated that the change in the surface energy of FA/MA mixed-cation perovskites was primarily account for the preferable crystal orientation. By systematically investigating the effect of composition engineering on the structure, morphology, crystal orientation and optoelectronic properties of perovskites, we found that the preferable growth along (001) crystallographic plane with 90° azimuth angle, significantly improved their charge transportation and collection properties in the resultant devices. With an optimized composition, the relevant PSCs achieved a PCE over 21%, with a certified efficiency of 20.50%. Here, we fabricated perovskite film by a modified two-step inter-diffusion method.  [18]  First, the lead iodide (PbI 2 ) precursor solution was prepared by dissolving PbI 2 in a mixture of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), where the latter acted as Lewis base to interact with PbI 2 , and thereby control the morphology of the resultant perovskite thin films.  [19]  And then the mixed organic cations precursor solutions were made by dissolving different ratios of formamidine iodide (FAI), methylammonium iodide (MAI), methylammonium bromide (MABr), and methylammonium chloride (MACl) in isopropanol (IPA), where all these components were frequently used to fabricate highly efficient PSCs.  [20]  We intentionally controlled the composition of FA 1-x MA x Pb(I,Br,Cl) 3 perovskites by increasing the concentration of MAI while decreasing the concentration of FAI in the mixed-cation precursor solution without varying precursor concentration and ratio of I, Br, and Cl. The Br and Cl concentration did not increase in the films, as MABr and MACl in the processor solution were fixed. The small amount of MACl was considered to have negligible impact on the perovskite crystal structure, but probably playing a role of optimizing the optoelectronic characteristics for high performance.  [1c]  We accordingly used FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) to denote the chemical formula of perovskite with different MA ratios in this study. The molar ratio of MA and (MA+FA) in the mixed organic cation precursor solution, defined as MA ratio (x), was adjusted from 0.13 to 0.65 for further investigation. The detailed fabrication of perovskite films could be found in the Experimental Section in the Supporting Information. We first investigated the influence of composition engineering on the film quality from the perspective of crystallography. Figure  1  shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the obtained FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskite films with different FA/MA ratios. It was observed that the major peaks of perovskite films were mainly located at 13.98°, 24.36°, 28.20°, and 31.63° that were assigned to (001), (  111 ), (002), and (012) crystal planes of cubic perovskite, respectively. All the perovskite films exhibited black perovskite phase rather than yellow phase, regardless of the varied ratios of FA/MA, which further suggested that the introduction of MA into FAPbI 3 could stabilize its black phase.  [6]  In addition, a slightly shift of the (  001 ), (111), and (002) peaks to higher 2θ value was also observed in the films with higher MA ratios, as shown in Figure  S2  in the Supporting Information, which was likely due to that the substitution of FA + with smaller MA + could shrink the crystal lattice. The difference in full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of all the three crystal planes was negligible with MA ratio increased, as shown in Figure  S3  in the Supporting Information, indicating the comparable crystal size in all samples. To further explore the influence of composition on crystals orientation, we checked the ratios of peak intensity, i.e., (002)/ (001), (  111 )/(001), (  111 )/(002) for FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) films as shown in Figure  1b . It was found that the peak intensity ratio of (002)/(001) almost remained unchanged, and the absolute intensity of both peaks gradually increased upon the MA ratio increasing, indicative of the better crystallinity of the film. In contrast, by increasing the MA ratio from 0.13 to 0.65, the peak intensity ratios of (  111 )/(  001 ) and (  111 )/(002) varied from 1.1 and 1.7, respectively, to almost 0. This observation indicated an apparent preferable growth along (  001 ) and (  002 ) crystallographic planes for mixed FA/MA cation perovskite by increasing the MA ratio. Furthermore, we calculated the microstrain in our perovskite films by analyzing the FWHM in the diffraction patterns according to the modified Williamson-Hall method.  [21]  As shown in Figure  1c , the microstrain in perovskite films decreased with the increase of MA ratio. We confirmed that the introduction of smaller MA + ions into FAPbI 3 could release the lattice strain to enhance phase stability, which was in agreement with previous report.  [22]  To further assess the crystal microstructure of above FA/ MA mixed-cation perovskite samples, especially the crystal orientations in multiple orders,  [23]  we used 2D synchrotron radiation grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement (Figure  2a-h ). As shown in Figure  2a -h, the bright rings at q = 10, 17, and 20 nm -1 (where q was the scattering vector, q = 4π sin θ/λ) were the diffraction patterns for (001), (111), and (002) crystal planes, respectively. The red color regions indicated strong diffraction signals for corresponding crystal planes with a preferred orientation and the light blue colored regions indicated a relative weak diffraction intensity for corresponding crystal planes. It was clearly observed that the diffraction intensities of preferred planes, including both (  001 ) and (  002 ), varied significantly with different MA ratios, according to Figure  2a -h. To better visualize and compare the difference, we calculated the intensity of different crystal planes along different azimuth angles exhibited in GIWAXS, as shown in Figure  3a  and Figure  S4  in the Supporting Information. It was confirmed that the intensity of (001) plane was much higher than those of (  002 ) and (  111 ) plane. Apparently, by increasing MA ratio from 0.13 to 0.57, the intensity of (001) plane was enhanced accordingly, suggesting that crystallization of the crystallographic plane along (001) plane was strengthened. It is noteworthy that a dramatic increase occurred when we enhanced the MA ratio from 0.38 to 0.43. Besides, the intensity of (002) crystal plane also showed an increasing trend promoted by MA ratio enhancement. This GIWAXS result was consistent with XRD result shown in Figure  1b . While further increasing the MA ratio over 0.57, the intensity of (001) plane decreased, which was slightly different from XRD results, as would be discussed later. Nevertheless, the intensity of (111)/(001) remained decreased upon MA ratio increasing in the range of interest, from 0.13 to 0.65 (Figure  3a ). It confirmed the  preferred facet orientation along (001) crystal plane could be achieved by tuning the MA/FA ratio in mixed perovskites. We further attempted to assess the variation of the crystal plane stacking pattern with respect to a certain crystallographic plane in FA/MA perovskite film. Here, the GIWAXS pattern azimuthally along the ring at q = 10 nm -1 in Figure  2 , which was assigned to (001) plane, the dominant diffraction peak of corresponding perovskite structure, was considered as an example. It was observed clearly that when the MA ratio was increasing from 0.13 to 0.65, the stacking patterns changed distinctly. As shown in Figure  3c , with MA ratios from 0.13 to 0.38, the diffraction ring displayed three peaks at around 37°, 90°, and 143°, indicating a relatively disordered stacking as from their identical peak intensities. When the ratio of MA was increased, the peak intensity located at azimuth angle 90° increased significantly, while the intensities of the other two peaks (around 37° and 143°) decreased accordingly. In particular, when MA ratio was increased to 0.43, the diffraction mottling at the azimuth angle of 90° became overwhelming, with other two peaks disappeared. This suggested the occurrence of preferred facet orientation of (001) crystal plane dominantly stack along the face-up direction and also indicated an enhanced long-range crystallinity of perovskite film. The possible crystal stacking pattern of the presented hybrid perovskite materials was illustrated in Figure  3e . This preferred crystal orientation would benefit charge transport process and consequently device performance, as would be discussed later.  [9b,10,17]  We also tried to explore the underlying mechanism for the growth of perovskite films with strengthened preferred crystal orientation induced by MA/FA ratios, which had not been explored. From thermodynamics point of view, we examined the surface energy with respect to the corresponding crystallographic planes to understand whether it impacted the crystal orientation in mixed FA/MA cation perovskites. The surface energies of (  001 ) and (111) planes of perovskites with formula of FAPbI 3 , MAPbI 3 , and FA 0.5 MA 0.5 PbI 3 were evaluated based on DFT calculations (see details in Supporting Information). We simplified the model by using single halide I, as all the mixed perovskite films having the same ratio of Br/I/Cl. The calculation results are shown in Figure  3b  and Table  S1  in the Supporting Information, which are further illustrated in Figure  3d . It was found that when we introduced the MA + cation into FAPbI 3 perovskite, the surface energy of (001) plane was significantly reduced. This decrease indicated the (001) planes were more energetically favorable during crystal growth. It was also in agreement with the above XRD and  GIWAXS results, which indicated that MA incorporation in the FA + -based perovskite could facilitate the crystal growth in (001) plane and thus assisted preferred orientation. However, when the ratio of MA was close to 1, this energy was gradually increased as compared to the lowest surface energy at certain MA ratio. This also supported the mentioned opposite trend of intensity variation with respect to (001) plane by increasing MA ratio over 0.57, as displayed in GIWAXS study (Figure  3a ). In addition, we also derived the surface energy ratio of (  001 )/(111), as shown by the blue line (Figure  3b ). It was observed that this ratio kept deceasing, even the MA ratio was increased to 1. The decreased surface energy ratio of (  001 )/(111) further suggested that the (001) plane became an energetically favorable plane when compared with (111) plane. The results implied that an appropriate ratio of MA incorporation in the FA + based perovskite could promote the crystal growth along (001) plane. This further pointed out that the preferred orientation in the perovskite film was primarily governed by the surface energy, which was controlled by thermodynamics. This was also confirmed that the facilitated grain growth along (001) direction presented in the perovskite films with desired FA/MA ratio during the entire crystallization (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information). The reduction of surface energy by MA incorporation is speculated to be related to the following three aspects: 1) Planar density of atoms: The cation radius of MA + (2.17 Å) is smaller than that of FA + (2.53 Å). According to Bragg's law 2d sin θ = nλ,  [24]  compared to the larger FA + , the smaller MA + ion is more likely to facilitate (001) plane with higher planar density, which leading to a stabilized crystal structure. 2) Crystal symmetry: The tetragonal MAPbI 3 , in contrast to isotropic and symmetrical cubic FAPbI 3 crystal,  [25]  might have a decreased tendency to grow along [111] direction.  [4b]  Thus, the incorporation MA-into FA-based perovskite may effectively facilitate the preferred orientation along (001) plane. 3) Orbital interaction: The partial substitution of FA + with smaller cation MA + would reduce cubo-octahedral volume and thus increase the orbital interaction between Pb and I atoms and modify the local structure of perovskite.  [26]  Specifically, it would adjust the degree of [PbI 6 ] octahedral tilting and induce FA + cation orientation change.  [26b,27]  All these effects may collectively contribute to the increased crystallinity and strengthened preferred orientation in perovskite. Furthermore, the preferred (001) orientation would favor the transport of charge carrier in the bulk perovskite and across the interfaces. The perovskite thin films are anisotropic, and the effective mass of the materials varies obviously with respect to the crystal orientation space axes. Notably, the electron effective mass shows the smallest value along the Z-direction, which is perpendicular to the perovskite (001) plane, suggesting that the most efficient electron transport occurs along the [001] direction in the perovskite film.  [9b]  With respect to charge transport at perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD interface, there is a large electrostatic potential increase and preferential holes distribution at the interface of Spiro-OMeTAD and perovskite along (001) preferred orientation, attracting more holes than electrons and yielding stronger electronic cloud overlapping, which benefits interfacial electron-hole pair dissociation and enhance the efficiency of hole transfer.  [9a]  Furthermore, the re-arrangement of the orientation along the face-up direction (azimuth angle 90°) could also enlarge the effective contact area between (001) plane of perovskite film and carrier transport layers, which could be beneficial for the charge extraction process. Therefore, the combination of preferred growth over (001) planes, and crystal stacking mode with respect to (001) plane were expected to lead to improved device performance, as discussed later. To further investigate whether the introduction of MA + into FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) affected other film qualities, e.g. morphology, coverage and grain size, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed. Figure  4a-h  show the top view SEM images of all the FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskite films with different MA ratios. It was observed that all films were uniform, highly crystalline with almost similar compact texture. Moreover, we compared the grain sizes of all the films, as shown in Figure  S6a  in the Supporting Information. It was found that all the FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskite films showed nearly identical statistic grain size. Besides, we measured the thickness of perovskite films with different MA ratios, as illustrated in Figure  S6b  in the Supporting Information, which did not show any obvious variation. This observation ruled out the apparent film morphological influence on the resulting film quality, and also suggested that the grain size of the FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskite films here was not the key factor that would possibly govern the device performance. Apart from above crystal and morphology properties, we further investigated the influence of introduction of MA + into the FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskites on their optoelectronic properties. As shown in Figure  4i , the ultraviolet-visible (UVvis) spectra showed a 20 nm blueshift upon increasing the ratio of MA in perovskite films from 0.13 to 0.65. This indicated the bandgap increased from 1.51 to 1.54 eV obtained in Figure  4i . The normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskite thin films are also presented in Figure  4j . Accordingly, a blueshift of the emission peak of the FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskites was observed upon increasing the ratio of MA, which derived from the substitution of FA + with MA + in the perovskite lattice.  [6]  In addition, we further checked the Urbach energy (Eu) of the perovskite films with different MA ratios, which would probe the sharp onset of absorption at the direct bandgap, exhibiting significant information about disorders in shallow energy level.  [28]  As shown in Figure  S7  in the Supporting Information, we observed a consistent decrease of Eu values with MA ratio increase to 0.43, which indicated a smaller degree of electronic disorder at the band edge. This variation trend of Eu value obtained was in good agreement with the exhibited preferred orientation by increasing MA ratio, suggesting that the preferred orientation of perovskite film could reduce the disorder and benefit the charge transportation and device performance we exhibited below. Furthermore, we estimated the carrier lifetime of fresh perovskite films with different MA ratios by using time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. All the TRPL spectra of perovskite films could be fitted by biexponential decays (as shown in Figure  S8a , Supporting Information) and the corresponding lifetimes and diffusion lengths were summarized in Table  S2  in the Supporting Information, according to the calculation method.  [29]  The perovskite film with 0.43 MA ratio showed the longest PL lifetime and diffusion length, suggesting that the preferred orientation could effectively suppress the trap-assisted recombination in the bulk and the surface. We further investigated the quenching effect of different perovskite films with electron-transport layer (ETL) SnO 2 , and hole-transport layer (HTL) Spiro-OMeTAD. Similarly, all the TRPL spectra could be fitted by biexponential decays (as shown in Figure  S8b ,c in the Supporting Information) and the corresponding lifetimes and diffusion lengths  [30]  are summarized in Tables  S3  and S4  in the Supporting Information. It was found that the 0.43 MA ratio perovskite film/ SnO 2 sample showed the shortest average PL lifetime (τ avg ), indicating the best carrier extraction capability from perovskite to ETL. For perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD samples case, 0.43 MA ratio perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD sample showed an obvious quenching effect and respectable hole diffusion length. Overall, 0.43 MA ratio perovskite film was considered with excellent carrier extraction capability at both ETL and HTL interfaces, indicating that the preferred orientation could effectively facilitate the carrier extraction. To reveal how crystal orientation of perovskites with different MA ratios in this work interfered the device performance of solar cells, we fabricated devices with configuration of ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au as illustrated in the cross-sectional SEM images in Figure  S9  in the Supporting Information. All fabrication details could be found in Supporting Information. The photovoltaic parameters of PSCs with different MA ratios are shown in Figure  5a  and Figure  S10a-c  in the Supporting Information. Remarkably, the PCEs increased with the MA ratios varied from 0.13 to 0.43, and decreased when further increasing MA ratios from 0.43 to 0.65. Also, the open-circuit voltage (V oc ), short-circuit current density (J sc ) and fill factor (FF) had similar variation trend with PCEs. These changes were consistent with the variation trend of (111)/(001) crystal planes intensity ratio when MA ratio was lower than 0.43. When MA ratio was larger than 0.43, the performance decreased originated from deteriorated optoelectronic properties as discussed later. It had been reported that the spatial heterogeneity of perovskite polycrystalline could significantly affect J sc and V oc of the resulting solar cell devices due to the fact that anisotropic distribution of trap states was orientation dependent.  [8c]  Besides, the mobility of perovskite films is also closely related to the crystal texture, especially the crystal orientation.  [31]  Here, we speculate that the enhanced device performance for MA ratio of 0.43 case mainly originated from the preferable growth along (001) crystalline plane and face-up crystal stacking. This preferred crystal orientation would lead to enhanced long-range crystallinity which was beneficial for the charge transportation across the perovskite bulk layer and also the charge collection at the perovskite/charge selective layer interfaces.  [9b]  Interestingly, the PCEs decreased for the MA ratio larger than 0.43, indicating that the smaller increase of intensity ratio of (001)/(111) crystal planes mentioned above had less impact on device performance of solar cells. This would be explained by the superior intrinsic properties of FAPbI 3 than MAPbI 3 , such as longer carrier lifetime, higher mobility, and larger ion movement barrier for higher performance.  [32]  Therefore, we suggested that preferable growth along (001) crystalline plane with the proper MA ratio around 0.43 would improve the performance of devices. To further confirm the effect of preferred crystal orientation on the charge carrier dynamic within the devices, we carried out transient photovoltage decay (TPV) and transient photocurrent decay (TPC) measurements on the PSCs, and the results are shown in Figure  S11  in the Supporting Information. It was found that the lifetime for device with MA ratio of 0.43 was longer than those for other devices with rest MA ratios. This suggested a substantially suppressed recombination in this perovskite absorber with MA ratio of 0.43, which was consistent with its higher V oc than other cases (Figure  S10a , Supporting Information). It was also observed that the device with MA ratio of 0.43 showed a faster photocurrent decay than devices based on other MA ratios. This observation confirmed that the MA ratio of 0.43 based device possessed a much more efficient charge transportation process, leading to a higher output photocurrent, which was consistent with the higher Jsc than other cases (Figure  S10b , Supporting Information). The better performance on TPV and TPC results with 0.43 MA ratio was probably caused by the preferred orientation that enabled improved carrier flow between perovskite and carrier transport layers, while proper MA ratio (not too high as 0.57) would take advantage of the high carrier mobility of FAPbI 3 . In addition, to further study the charge transportation and charge recombination behavior in the devices, we conducted electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. As shown in Figure  S12  in the Supporting Information, all devices showed a semicircle feature in the Nyquist plots, which were ascribed to the transport resistance of the devices.  [33]  It was observed that the device based on perovskite with the appropriate MA ratio (0.43) showed almost the lowest transport resistance, which further supported that the preferable orientation and proper MA ratio could benefit the charge transport process, leading to the J sc enhancement. Meanwhile, we also calculated the defects density and chargecarrier mobility of perovskite films with different MA ratios from space change limited current (SCLC) measurements as shown in Figure  S13  in the Supporting Information. The perovskite films with MA ratio of 0.43 showed the lowest defects density of 9.2 × 10 14 cm -3 , which was at most 10 times lower than the other perovskites, e.g. with 2.3 × 10 16 cm -3 of 0.2 MA ratio. As discussed above, the reduced defects density was ascribed to that a highly preferred orientation with enhanced long-range crystallinity would reduce the probability of defects formation. Meanwhile, the perovskite with MA ratio of 0.43 also exhibited the highest charge-carrier mobility (0.122 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) than other cases. This improved carrier mobility would also originate from the preferred orientation with enhanced long-range crystallinity enabled a fast charge transport path facilitating the charge transportation, while proper MA ratio (around 0.43) would benefit from the high carrier mobility of FAPbI 3 . Given the above, the improved conductivity combined with suppressed recombination guaranteed an effective carrier transportation and collection in the devices enabled such improved device  performance. These results also further confirmed that a preferential crystal orientation in perovskite films induced by MA incorporation could benefit device performance enhancement. Accordingly, the champion device with MA ratio of 0.43 achieved a best PCE of 21.21% under reverse scan and 20.26% under forward scan, as shown in Figure  5b . One of our devices with MA ratio of 0.43 also achieved a certified efficiency of 20.50 ± 0.50% (Figure  S14 -S18, Supporting Information). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) is shown in Figure  5c , exhibiting an integrated Jsc of 23.7 mA cm -2 , which was in good agreement with the J-V measurements. In addition, the device also showed a stabilized PCE exceeding 20.3% in Figure  5d , which was in good agreement with the J-V scans. In Figure  S10d  in the Supporting Information, we also compared the hysteresis of devices by presenting the Hysteresis-index (H-index) defined as the previous work.  [34]  All the devices with three different MA ratios showed relative low H-index, indicating that hysteresis could be also suppressed by fine tuning the orientation of the perovskites. In summary, we systematically investigated the crystal orientation of mixed FA/MA perovskites fabricated through a two-step interdiffusion method via composition engineering. We also illuminated the origin of preferred crystal orientation from the perspective of thermodynamics by DFT calculation, where the reduction of surface energy for FA/MA mixed-cation perovskites results in the preferable crystal orientation. To our best understanding, this is the first study that reveals the origin for the thermodynamically favored crystal orientation in mixed FA/MA cation perovskites. By systematically investigating the effect of composition engineering on perovskite crystal structure, morphology, bandgap, and crystal orientation, we found that the preferable growth along (001) crystal plane, as well as the face-up crystal stacking of the perovskite crystals significantly affected the charge transportation and collection properties within the devices. With the optimized composition, the mixed-cation PSCs achieved a PCE over 21% and a certificated efficiency of 20.50 ± 0.50% under one sun illumination. It thus sheds light on understanding the intrinsic properties of mixedcation perovskites, which guides further investigation and application in perovskite optoelectronics. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TinOxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""FA0.5MA0.5PbI3"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""21.21"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"

Owing to rapid development in their efficiency 1 and stability 2 , perovskite solar cells are at the forefront of emerging photovoltaic technologies. State-of-the-art cells exhibit voltage losses  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  approaching the theoretical minimum and near-unity internal quantum efficiency  [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]  , but conversion efficiencies are limited by the fill factor (<83%, below the Shockley-Queisser limit of approximately 90%). This limitation results from non-ideal charge transport between the perovskite absorber and the cell's electrodes  5, 8, [13] [14] [15] [16]  . Reducing the electrical series resistance of charge transport layers is therefore crucial for improving efficiency. Here we introduce a reverse-doping process to fabricate nitrogen-doped titanium oxide electron transport layers with outstanding charge transport performance. By incorporating this charge transport material into perovskite solar cells, we demonstrate 1-cm 2 cells with fill factors of >86%, and an average fill factor of 85.3%. We also report a certified steady-state efficiency of 22.6% for a 1-cm 2 cell (23.33% ± 0.58% from a reverse currentvoltage scan). Nitrogen-doped titanium oxide (titanium oxynitride, TiO x N y ) has been widely investigated for photocatalysis  17, 18  , but rarely in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). PSCs incorporating solution-processed TiO x N y have been reported, but device performances have not exceeded that of PSCs with standard TiO x electron transport layers (ETLs)  19, 20  , because the stoichiometric control required to optimize metal oxide transport layer properties is challenging with solution processing. Instead, we report here a reverse-doping method to produce high-quality TiO x N y films by oxidizing sputtered titanium nitride thin films using a controlled annealing temperature in an oxygen atmosphere (details are provided in the Methods). In addition to producing high-quality TiO x N y films, sputtering is already widely used in the photovoltaic and electronics industries and is therefore a promising deposition method for commercial fabrication of PSCs. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TItanium oxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""22.6"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
3040,105_4," TiO x N y film composition and morphology To understand the effect of the annealing process on the physical and electronic properties of TiO x N y , we prepared films (thickness ~50 nm) with seven different annealing conditions: as deposited (room temperature), 300 °C, 350 °C, 400 °C, 450 °C, 500 °C and 550 °C. There is no significant difference in the morphology of the resulting TiO x N y films (Extended Data Fig.  1 ), and they are similar to the bare fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrates. We next investigate the elemental composition of TiO x N y using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig.  1a , the Ti 2+ oxidation state  21  is present in the as-deposited TiN film as evidenced by the presence of O 1s (refs.  15, 22  ; Fig.  1b ) and O-Ti-N (refs.  18, 23, 24  ) XPS peaks (Fig.  1c ). The appearance of Ti 3+ and Ti 4+ states after annealing at 300 °C indicates partial oxidation of the TiN, and oxidation increases at higher temperatures. For samples annealed at 450 °C and above, only the highest Ti 4+ oxidation state is present  15, 21  . Meanwhile, the TiN (refs.  18, 23  ) peak weakens and eventually disappears at higher annealing temperatures, and two new N 1s core-level peaks (NO x (refs.  18, 23, 25  ) and γ-N 2 (refs.  23, 26  ) (chemisorbed N 2 )) are observed (Fig.  1c ). This further demonstrates that the chemical states of Ti and N within TiO x N y lattices continuously change as the oxidation temperature increases. More details of the XPS analysis can be found in the Methods. By combining the elements' relative peak areas and sensitivity factors (Extended Data Fig.  2 ), we calculate that the atomic ratio of O/Ti (N/Ti) is 0.58 (0.62) for the as-deposited film. The O/Ti atomic ratio increases with annealing temperature, reaching a peak of 2.24 at 500 °C before decreasing. In contrast, the N/Ti ratio decreases monotonically with annealing temperature. However, N atoms remain in the TiO x N y film at higher temperatures, with N/Ti ratios of 0.08 and 0.07 for samples annealed at 500 °C and 550 °C, respectively. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging (Extended Data Fig.  3a ) shows that the as-deposited film is not completely crystalline and features an amorphous contrast along with a distribution of crystalline particles with characteristic sizes ranging from 10 nm to 20 nm. A survey of the first two diffraction rings from the polycrystalline pattern in Fig.  2a  reveals diffracting planes corresponding to distances of d 1 = 2.45 ± 0.07 Å and d 2 = 2.12 ± 0.06 Å, which can be respectively assigned to the cubic phases of TiO (ref.  27  ) and TiN (ref.  27  ) (d (111),TiO = 2.411 Å, d (200),TiO = 2.088 Å; d (111),TiN = 2.445 Å, d (200),TiN = 2.117 Å). Detailed parameters for simulation are summarized in Supplementary Table  1 . Given the XPS result, which shows a large concentration of N relative to O, and the difficulty of differentiating the cubic TiO from the cubic TiN (Extended Data Fig.  2 ), we conclude that the observed crystalline phase has a composition of the type TiO x N y . Similar analysis of the films annealed at 300 °C, 350 °C and 400 °C indicates that these are also largely composed of the cubic TiO x N y phase (Fig.  2  and Extended Data Fig.  4 ). Note that there are two rings in the diffraction patterns of the sample annealed at 400 °C (Fig.  2c ), which can be allocated to the tetragonal anatase crystal phases of TiO x N y (ref.  28  ). The combined evidence of the XPS and TEM analysis shows that oxidation at low temperatures (<400 °C) starts a restructuring process in which TiN and TiO crystals transform into amorphous TiO x N y , which then continues to form TiO x N y crystals under oxidation at high temperatures (>450 °C). Compared with the as-deposited sample and those annealed at 300 °C, 350 °C and 400 °C, an increased crystalline fraction is observed for the TiO x N y film annealed at 450 °C and above (Extended Data Figs.  3  and 4 ). The diffraction patterns of the sample annealed at 450 °C are dominated by a combination of tetragonal anatase and rutile phases of TiO x N y (ref.  28  ), accompanied by the complete disappearance of the cubic TiO x N y phase (Extended Data Fig.  4d ). At the highest temperature investigated, the film annealed at 550 °C features large tetragonal crystals with sizes of greater than 20 nm with similar crystal phases to those of the film annealed at 500 °C (Fig.  2d  and Extended Data Fig.  4e, f ). ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TItanium oxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""22.6"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""titanium oxynitride"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""22.6"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
3042,105_6," Solar cell characterization Having investigated the physical, electronic and optical properties of the TiO x N y films, we next investigate their use as ETLs in n-i-p PSCs. The devices studied here feature a structure of glass/FTO/TiO x N y (~40 nm)/meso-TiO 2 (~50 nm)/PMMA:PCBM/Cs 0.05 FA 0.9 MA 0.05 PbI 2.74 Br 0.26 (~500 nm)/PMMA/P3HT:CuPc (~65 nm)/Au (Fig.  4a  and Extended Data Fig.  6 ). Here meso-TiO 2 represents mesoporous TiO 2 , PMMA (ref.  5  ) and PMMA:PCBM (ref.  5  ) are ultrathin interface passivation layers consisting of poly(methyl-methacrylate) and PMMA:([6,6]-phenyl-C 61-butyric-acid-methyl-ester), respectively, and P3HT:CuPc (ref.  8  ) is a blended hole transport layer (HTL) consisting of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and copper phthalocyanine. Solution-processed compact TiO x (ref.  15  ) substitutes TiO x N y as the ETL in the control cells. As shown in Fig.  4a , our champion TiO x N y -based cell with an active area of 1-cm 2 yielded a PCE of 23.36% (23.38%) with V OC ~ 1.193 V (1.200 V), J SC ~ 22.80 mA cm -2 (22.89 mA cm -2 ) and fill factor (FF) ~ 0.859 (0.851) from reverse (forward) scan in-house measurements. The TiO x -based control cell exhibited a maximum PCE of 21.65% (V OC ~ 1.172 V, J SC ~ 22.75 mA cm -2 and FF ~ 0.812) and 21.22% (V OC ~ 1.171 V, J SC ~ 22.70 mA cm -2 and FF ~ 0.798) from reverse and forward scans, respectively. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and perovskite optical bandgap (E g ~ 1.57 eV) plots confirm the accuracy of the measured photocurrent as demonstrated by a discrepancy <2% between the integrated J SC from the EQE spectra and the J SC measured from the J-V curve (Fig.  4b ). Another cell was submitted to an independent testing centre and achieved a certified efficiency of ~23.33% ± 0.58% with a FF of 86.68% ± 1.01% from a reverse J-V scan, and a steady-state efficiency of ~22.6% (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). This is, to our knowledge, the highest certified efficiency for 1-cm 2 PSCs 1 and the highest FF reported for a PSC of any size (Supplementary Tables  4  and 5 ). The J-V parameter distribution plots in Fig.  4c  and Extended Data Fig.  7a  illustrate the reproducibility of our 1-cm 2 PSCs. The average PCE of the TiO x N y -based cells is 23.09% ± 0.11% with an average FF ~ 0.853 ± 0.005, while that of the TiO x -based cells is 21.26% ± 0.33% (average FF ~ 0.793 ± 0.014). There is little difference in both V OC and J SC between the TiO x N y -and TiO x -based cells (Extended Data Fig.  7a ), so d c    2  and 3 , respectively. Nature | Vol 601 | 27 January 2022 | 577 the efficiency gains for TiO x N y -based cells are dominated by the higher FF that results from improved electron transport. A similar trend was also found between the TiO x N y -and TiO x -based PSCs fabricated with indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (see Supplementary Fig.  3  and discussion in the Methods). PSCs fabricated with TiO x N y ETLs annealed at 550 °C exhibited a lower average PCE of 21.42% ± 0.32% with substantial FF losses (Extended Data Fig.  7b, c ) compared to cells processed at 500 °C. This is due to the order-of-magnitude reduction in carrier density in the sample annealed at 550 °C compared to that annealed at 500 °C. We performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements to investigate the effect of ETL composition on subsequently deposited perovskite films. As seen in Supplementary Fig.  4 , we found no evidence of changes in the surface morphology (from SEM images), or in crystal structure, orientation or crystallinity (from X-ray diffraction measurements) of perovskite films deposited on the different substrates. There was also little difference in the time-resolved photoluminescence decay measurements, consistent with the experimental cell V OC values. This suggests that the very high FFs of the TiO x N y -based perovskite cells are derived from the improved electronic property of the TiO x N y film itself. To explain how TiO x N y can significantly increase FF, we employed numerical one-dimensional, multilayer ionic-electronic numerical device simulations. Our focus is on the electrostatics of the perovskite/ ETL/FTO layer structure. The empirical data suggest that increased dopant density is the only electronic factor that conclusively distinguishes TiO x N y from TiO x . Yet a simple analytical treatment based on ex situ conductivity of the ETL layers cannot explain the difference in FF. For 50-nm ETL layers, the optimum TiO x N y (N D = 3 × 10 17 cm -3 ) reduces the voltage losses relative to TiO x (N D = 5 × 10 14 cm -3 ) by only ~3 mV at the maximum power point (MPP) current of 22 mA cm -2 (where the electron mobility μ e = 0.5 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ). This is a small fraction of the experimental mean MPP voltage loss of approximately 80 mV. Instead, our model explains the resistance-related FF loss by showing that heavy doping of the ETL layer protects against electron depletion that can occur in The solid and dashed lines represent reverse and forward J-V scans, respectively; the TiO x N y -based cell device structure is shown in the inset. Note that the TiO x N y ETLs were fabricated at 500 °C and all J-V curves of the cells (effective area, 1.2 cm 2 ) were measured using an aperture mask (certified area, 1.0189 cm 2 ). Given that the meso-TiO 2 must be annealed at 500 °C to completely remove the organic compounds from the TiO 2 paste, the TiO regions of positive space charge at the perovskite/ETL and FTO/ETL heterojunctions. Equilibrium conditions in the perovskite/ETL/FTO structure deplete the ETL of electrons to concentrations that can be orders of magnitude below the fixed dopant density (Fig.  4d ). At the TiO x dopant density of 5 × 10 14 cm -3 , the equilibrium free-electron concentration can be closer to 10 13 cm -3 , introducing many tens of millivolts of voltage loss in the ETL at MPP currents (see Extended Data Fig.  8  for details). Our simulations suggest that although modifications of the WF alignment between these materials, and in particular the ETL and FTO layer, can mitigate the effect to some extent, high doping (⪆10 17 cm -3 ) in the ETL layer will, in general, be necessary (although not sufficient) to achieve PSC FFs above approximately 85%. We conclude this work by investigating the cell stability  31  . As seen in Extended Data Fig.  9a , the unencapsulated TiO x N y -based cell exhibited a steady-state PCE of ~22.82% after 250 h of MPP voltage (V MPP ) tracking under continuous 1 sun illumination in nitrogen, retaining ~98.7% of its initial efficiency (~23.12%). Similarly, the TiO x -based cell (~20.24%) retained ~96.5% of its initial efficiency (~20.97%), demonstrating no significant difference in light-soaking stability between the unencapsulated cells with different ETLs (Extended Data Fig.  9b ). Two cells of each type were also subjected to damp-heat exposure in the dark. For these tests, an additional MoO x (~10 nm)/indium zinc oxide (~40 nm) barrier layer was deposited between the HTL and the gold electrode resulting in a reduced FF relative to the unencapsulated cells reported above. All four individual cells retained >90% of their initial efficiencies after 1,000 h. Time-dependent power output and J-V curves are presented in Supplementary Figs.  5  and 6  showing the cell performance evolution during the degradation tests. Although both the light-soaking and damp-heat stability tests show promising results, these are not sufficient to guarantee the stability of perovskite cells under real operating conditions where thermal, light and humidity stressors act simultaneously  31  . According to the literature  2, 32  , the combination of these conditions can accelerate degradation of the perovskite active layer, even in the presence of stable charge transport layers and encapsulation. As the perovskite used in this work was not optimized to withstand such conditions, a more stable composition such as those reported in refs.  2, 32  would be necessary to realize the full benefits of the TiO x N y ETL. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""titanium oxynitride"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""22.6"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""titanium oxynitride"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""250"", ""control_pce"": ""20.24"", ""treated_pce"": ""22.82"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.987"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.965""}}"

The supernatant liquid was removed, and the precipitate was recrystallized by cooling down. The recrystallized golden crystals were filtered and rinsed with DI water several times. Finally, the product was dried at 85 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h and then stored in Ar filled glove box. Synthesis of FAI and MACl. Formamidinium iodide (FAI, HC(NH2)2I) was synthesized by reacting 15 g of formamidinium acetate with 30 mL of hydroiodic acid in a round-bottomed flask in an ice bath for 2 h. Dark yellow precipitate was recovered by evaporating at 60 ºC for 1 h. Resulting product was dissolved in ethanol and recrystallized in diethyl ether, which was repeated for three times. methylammonium chloride (MACl, CH3NH3Cl) was synthesized using methylamine and hydrochloric acid in a similar way with FAI. The final white precipitates were dried at 50 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h and then stored in Ar filled glove box. Synthesis of FAPbI3 powder. For FAPbI3 powder synthesis, 7.66 g of FAI was added into Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 mL acetonitrile (ACN) under vigorous stirring and then the synthesized PbI2 or low-grade (95% purity) commercial PbI2 (15.67 g) (PbI2:FAI = 1:1.3) was slowly added together with extra 50 mL ACN. The brown precipitate appeared after addition of PbI2. After vigorous stirring for 24 h, the powder turned gradually bright yellow. Then the powder was washed with ACN and diethyl ether for six times. The final product was dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h and then stored in Ar filled glove box. The yield was 93%. (Caution: in case of scale-up, rotary evaporator is recommended to dry the powder instead of using a vacuum oven.). The FAPbI3 powder is also commercially available from ShareChem Co., Ltd. Solar cell fabrication. F-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated conductive glasses (T18VU70, 12-13 Ω/sq, AGC Fabritech Co., Ltd.) were cleaned by detergent, followed by ultrasonic treatment in ethanol for 20 min. UV/ozone (UVO) treatment was conducted for 60 min prior to use. SnO 2 film was deposited on the FTO substrate by spin-coating the commercial SnO2 colloidal solution (diluted with DI water to adjust to 4 wt%) at 4000 rpm for 20 s, which was annealed at 185 °C on a hotplate for 30 min. The FAPbI3 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing 663 mg of the synthesized FAPbI3 powder and 71 μL of DMSO (molar ratio 1:1) in 568 μL of DMF with different molar ratio (0 mol%, 10 mol%, 20 mol%, 30 mol% and 40 mol%) of MACl (optimal was 20 mol%). For the conventional precursor mixture solution, except for using the synthesized powder, PbI2 (Alfa Aesar, 99.9985%) and the synthesized FAI were dissolved. The solution was spin-coated at two consecutive steps of 1000 rpm for 5 and 5000 rpm 20 s. During the second spin-coating step, 1 mL of diethyl ether was quickly dripped on the rotating substrate (5000 rpm) at 17 s to obtain an adduct intermediate film. The adduct films were annealed at 150 °C on a hotplate for 10 min. The spiro-MeOTAD layer was formed on the perovskite layer by spin-coating of 20 μL of the stock solution comprising 50 mg spiro-MeOTAD in 0.55 mL chlorobenzene including 19.5 μL t-BP (tert-butylpyridine) and 11.5 μL Li-TFSI solution (540 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%)) at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, Ag electrode with a thickness of ca. 150 nm was deposited on top of the spiro-MeOTAD layer under 4×10 -7 torr using a thermal evaporator. The as-fabricated PSCs were stored in the desiccator overnight before the current density-voltage (J-V) measurement. Characterizations. J-V curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under the simulated one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW/cm 2 ) using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A class AAA) equipped with 450 W Xenon lamp (Newport 6280NS), in which light intensity was adjusted by NRELcalibrated Si solar cell with KG-2 filter. Solar cells were covered with a metal mask with an aperture area of 0.125 cm 2 during the measurement. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by either an EQE system (PV measurement Inc.) equipped with a 75 W Xenon source lamp (USHIO, Japan) or a QuantX-300 Quantum Efficiency System (Newport) equipped with 100 W Xenon lamp. EQE data were collected at DC mode without bias light. The absorbance of the perovskite film was measured by UV-vis spectrometer (Lambda 45, Perkin-Elmer). Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) was measured using a fluorescence spectrometer (Quantaurus-Tau C11367-12, Hamamatsu). Perovskite films were photo-excited with a 464 nm laser pulsed at the frequency of 10 MHz. The PL was detected by high sensitivity photon counting near-IR detector. Timeresolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured using a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system by FluoTim 200 (PicoQuant) with 500 kHz repetition rate. The perovskite films were excited by 375 nm laser source, and then the emitted PL from the samples was collected by a photon multiplier tube (PMT) detector (PMA 182, PicoQuant-GmbH) at 800 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) data were collected from a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer, where Cu Kα radiation was used (λ = 1.5406 Å) and a scan rate was 4º/min with 0.02º/step. GIXRD were measured with the incident angle of 1º, 2º, 3º and 4º in the range of 5º -40º with 0.01º/step. The GIXRD penetration depth depending on incidence angles was calculated from eq 1, 1 τ1/e = sin θ/μ (1)  where τ1/e is the depth at which the intensity of radiation on a material is attenuated to 1/e (37%) and μ is the linear absorption coefficient, μ = μmρ (μm is the mass absorption coefficient and ρ is the mass density). ρ for cubic unit cell crystal structure could be calculated using eq 2, ρ = M/(a 3  NA) ( 2 ) where M is the molar mass of FAPbI3 (632.98 g/mol), NA is Avogadro's number (6.022  10 23 ), a is the edge length of unit cell (a = 6.35694 Å for cubic FAPbI3 determined from XRD analysis). The mass density ρ was calculated to be 4.092 g/cm  3  . According to the NIST standard reference database,  2  the μm of FAPbI3 is 246.9 cm 2 /g at 8000 eV photo energy. According to the eq 1, the penetration depth τ1/e of FAPbI3 under incidence angle of 1°, 2°, 3°, 4°and 5° are 172.7 nm, 345.4 nm, 518.0 nm, 690.5 nm and 862.7 nm, respectively. Light-intensity-dependent photocurrent mappings (PCM) were obtained using an atomic force microscope (AFM, NX10, Park System) equipped with a white LED light source (maximum power: 3.3 W), where light intensity was modulated from 0% (dark) to 20% (0.66 W), 40% (1.32 W), 60% (1.98 W) and 80% (2.64 W). The sub-mode of the PCM was Variable-Enhanced Conductive AFM (VECA) using the cantilever (SD-CDTP-NCHR) and 1 V DC bias voltage was applied to the substrate. The current images were obtained under the ambient condition. The depth profile of the perovskite film on FTO substrate was recorded using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS, model TOF-SIMS 5 of ION-TOF, Germany) in negative polarity. The pulsed primary Bi + ion source was operated at 25 keV and pA scale on a 40 μm  40 μm area to bombard the sample surface to produce secondary ions. The sputtering was performed with a Cs + ion beam operated at 1 keV and 45 nA on a 150 μm  150 μm area. Defect density was estimated using hole-only devices with the structure of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au. The devices were measured from -0.1 V to 2 V in the dark. The observed response was analyzed according to space-charge-limited current (SCLC) theory. Defect density (Ndefects) was estimated using the relation VTFL = eNdefectsd 2 /2r0,  3  where VTFL is the trap-filled-limit voltage, e is electron charge (1.602  10 -19 C), r is relative dielectric constant, 0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.8542  10 -14 F/cm) and d is the perovskite film thickness. The dielectric constant was calculated using the equation of r = Cd/A0, where C is capacitance at high frequency (~10 4 Hz) and A is area.  4, 5  Raman spectra were collected in back-scattering geometry. The 514.5 nm (2.41 eV) line of an Ar ion laser was used as an excitation source. The laser beam was focused on the surface of the solution in a petri-dish by a 50× microscope objective lens (0.8 NA). The scattered light was collected and collimated by the same objective in the backscattering geometry. The scattered signal was dispersed by a Jobin-Yvon Horiba iHR550 spectrometer (2400 grooves/mm) and detected with a liquid-nitrogencooled back-illuminated charge-coupled-device (CCD) detector. To approach the low-frequency range below 100 cm -1 , volume holographic filters (Optigrate) were used to clean the laser line and reject the Rayleigh-scattered light. The laser power was kept below 100 μW in order to avoid local heating. Surface and cross-sectional morphologies were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JSM-7600F, JEOL). Absorption spectra were measured using an UV/visible spectrometer (Lambda 45, Perkin Elmer). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the cross-sectioned full cells were obtained using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM-2100F) at an acceleration voltage 200 kV. The specimens for TEM were prepared by vertical etching using focused ion beam (FIB) equipm ent (JEOL JIB-4601F) with the cell structure glass/FTO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD. Before preparing the specimens, Pt and carbon layers were deposited on the spiro-MeOTAD layer to protect the samples from milling damage. A thick plate was extracted from the bulk sample at 30 kV and 3,000~30,000 pA, which was welded on Cu grid (omniprobe grid) by using probing system. The thick plate was first thinned at 30 kV and 50~1,000 pA and then lower current of 10~30 pA. Finally, the specimen was completed by thinni ng at lower voltage of 1 kV and 30~50 pA after beam showering at 3 kV and 10~30 pA. MACl were added into the perovskite precursor solution to fabricate the perovskite film. From the XRD pattern in Figure  S2a , the peaks at 11.7 o correspond to δ-phase, where the 20 mol% MACl doped perovskite film shows almost no δ-phase. The appearance of δ-phase is indicative of degradation due to α → δ phase transition under humidity condition (fresh samples did not show δ-phase). Thus the suppression of δ-phase for the 20 mol% MACl doped perovskite film indicates that α-phase is relatively stable for this content. The (100) peak position at 13.92 o for α-phase FAPbI3 is not altered by the MACl content, which indicates that MA ion might not be involved in the crystal lattice. However, in Figure  S2b  and S2c of the UV-vis absorption and PL spectra, the PL peak and UV-vis absorption are shift to lower wavelength, indicative of a partial substitution of FA + with MA + in FAPbI3.  6  The optical bandgap of 0 mol%, 10 mol%, 20 mol%, 30 mol% and 40 mol% are 1.527 eV, 1.539 eV, 1.545 eV, 1.539 eV and 1.539 eV, respectively. PL peak is shift from 818 nm to 802 nm with MACl addition. However, it is noted that the EQE onset edge position is observed at about 840 nm regardless of MACl content (Figure  S2d ).  might be related to difference in composition along the film depth. Figure  S3a  shows the grazing incidence angle (ω)-dependent XRD patterns of the annealed FAPbI3 film formed from the synthesized powder with 20 mol% MACl, where the depth in perovskite film can be increased with ω as illustrated in Figure  S3b .  7  The penetration depth τ1/e of FAPbI3 under incidence angle of 1°, 2°, 3°, 4°and 5° are 172.7 nm, 345.3 nm, 517.9 nm, 690.2 nm and 862.4 nm, respectively. As shown in Figure  S3a  and S3b, the (100) peak is deconvoluted into two peaks at 13.86° (red color) and at ~14.0° (blue color). The detailed parameters are summarized in the Table  S1 . The red peak corresponds to FAPbI3 but the blue peak might be related to incorporation of smaller MA in the larger FA site. The peak position at 13.86° is unchanged with increasing ω, however, another peak (blue color) shifts from 14.10° to 14.02°. In addition, the peak area ratio of red to blue is increased from 0.88 to 1.18 as the incidence angle is increased from 1° to 5°. This indicates that the underlying MA-incorporated phase is probably located on the surface of the film rather than on the bottom of the film. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) is decreased with increasing ω, which underlines that the FAPbI3 perovskite grain size is increased going from top surface to the bulk film. From the PL measurement illuminated on different side in Figure  S3c , no change in PL emission peak position is observed regardless of illumination side for the FAPbI3 film without MACl (Figure  S3d ). On the other hands, a slight change in PL peak position is observed for the 20 mol% MACl case, where the glass side illumination results in PL emission at a slightly longer wavelength, which is indicative of difference in composition between top and bottom of the film. According to GIXRD and illumination-side-dependent PL, MACl assists to increase grain size of FAPbI3 and exists near the surface of FAPbI3 rather than incorporation into bulk FAPbI3, which can explain the reason why the onset wavelength in EQE together with the (100) peak position in XRD were unchanged with MACl. We also measured time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) to investigate the position of residual Cl inside the film. As shown in Figure  S4 , due to MA cation located near perovskite surface, the Cl content decreases going from the to p to the bottom in the perovskite layer. However, the Cl content sharply increases when approaching the SnO2 layer, which indicates that most of Cl is located near SnO2 layer and this location of Cl was reported to improve stability. 8        H ybrid organic-inorganic all-solid-state perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are currently attracting increasing interest because of their low cost and high performance. A surge of recent research activity in PSCs has been triggered by the first report of a solid-state PSC with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7% and a 500 h stability without encapsulation,  1  following two seed reports on perovskite-sensitized solar cells.  2, 3  Rapid progress in PCE has been made, and most of the PCEs over 20% are based on mixed-cation and mixed-anion perovskites comprising formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) as a major component.  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]  By far, the certified record PCE of 25.2% 10 surpasses PCEs of copper-indium-gallium-selenide (CIGS) and CdTe solar cells. Because the Shockley-Queisser (S-Q) limit efficiency is over 30% based on the bandgap energy of 1.6 eV,  11  further improvement in PCE is expected. FAPbI 3 is currently one of the most promising perovskite materials for high-efficiency solar cells owing to its optimal bandgap of 1.47 eV, high absorption coefficient exceeding 10 4 cm -1 , and a carrier diffusion length of a few hundred micrometers.  12, 13  However, the photoactive ""black phase"" (αphase) is less stable under ambient conditions because its photoinactive ""yellow phase"" (δ-phase) is more favorable.  14  A partial substitution of FA + with MA + or Cs + was reported to be an efficient way to stabilize the α-phase of FAPbI 3 at ambient conditions,  8, [15] [16] [17] [18]  which however leads to increasing the bandgap energy and thereby narrowing the absorption spectrum. Nonreproducibility in photovoltaic performance in PSCs has been often reported, which might stem from the precursor preparation and film formation procedure when using PbI 2 (usually high purity ∼99.99%).  5, 7, 17, 19, 20  This conventional ""precursor mixture"" method is likely to cause the fractional deviations in stoichiometry because of impurity and/or nonperovskite phase, leading to low reproducibility.  21  In addition, using the expensive PbI 2 is not a cost-effective way to scale up PSCs. Thus, a cost-effective approach is also required to guarantee the reproducibility of high-efficiency PSCs. The perovskite powder approach is more beneficial for reproducibility of photovoltaic performance of PSCs than the precursor mixture method because the underlying nonstoichiometry of the resulting perovskite film can be avoided. Perovskite powders were reported to be synthesized by either mechanochemistry or wet chemistry methods.  19, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26]  The mechanochemically prepared MAPbI 3 powder was used as a precursor for the coating solution, which resulted in a PCE of 17.5%, which was better than the PCE obtained from the precursor mixture of MAI and PbI 2 .  22  The grinded or ballmilled powder of perovskite with mixed cation and/or mixed anion showed a PCE of about 19%.  23  Perovskite powders were synthesized by wet chemistry based on antisolvents  24  or lowsolubility solvents such as 2-proponal,  25  acetonitrile,  26  or 2methoxyethanol.  19  Among the reported PCEs based on the synthesized FAPbI 3 crystal or powder,  5, 8, 19, 27  powder-based PSCs achieved a certified PCE of around 23%.  5, 19  However, these perovskite powders were synthesized using a costineffective high-purity PbI 2 and production yield was low. In our previous report,  26  we first attempted to synthesize highyield MAPbI 3 and FAPbI 3 powders in acetonitrile using lowgrade PbI 2 at room temperature. We obtained α, δ, and α/δ mixed-phase FAPbI 3 powders by controlling the ratio of PbI 2 to FAI. However, the average PCE of FAPbI 3 PSCs was still as low as 17.21% because of the phase purity issue. Thus, an advanced method is required to synthesize pure δ-phase FAPbI 3 powder for higher PCE reproducibly, which has been successfully performed via a synthetic procedure including a washing process. Here we report the materials and methods for reproducible high-efficiency PSCs based on the room-temperature-synthesized FAPbI 3 powder using homemade or inexpensive lowgrade PbI 2 . The average PCE of 20.71% is achieved from the 130 devices based on the synthetic powder-based FAPbI 3 films fabricated in different batches, and the quasi-steady-state PCE of 21.07% is certified. The photovoltaic performance and reproducibility of the powder-based devices are compared with those of the expensive high-grade PbI 2 (99.9985%) based the precursor mixture-based conventional method, from which the former is confirmed to be much superior to the latter. Synthesis and Properties of FAPbI 3 Powder. Because the quality of PbI 2 varies from different batches and the high-purity (99.9985%) PbI 2 is still cost-ineffective,  26  the cost-effective materials leading to reproducible high efficiency are highly required for commercialization.

3108,102_5," ACS Energy Letters Letter spectra, is compared in Figure  2b . The sharp shoulder without a tail near the optical bandgap (1.55 eV) region is observed for the powder precursor case, while an additional absorption tail (called the Urbach tail) appears after the bandgap for the conventional precursor case. Absence of an Urbach tail for the powder-based FAPbI 3 film is indicative of no deep trap states, whereas a distinct Urbach tail for the conventional precursor mixture-based FAPbI 3 film underlines the presence of deep trap states.  31, 32  Little difference in Raman spectra (Figure  S5 ) is found, which indicates that the main chemical species in the solution are the same. In the Raman spectra for films, the powder-based FAPbI 3 shows the main peak position of 235 cm -1 , while a redshift to 226 cm -1 for the precursor mixturebased perovskite film is attributed to the small amount of δphase FAPbI 3 .  14, 33  Panels c and d of Figure  2  show steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL), where TRPL fitting results are obtained using a biexponential decay equation,  34, 35  and average lifetime (τ ave ) is estimated using a time constant and weight factor (Table  S2 ).  36  The steady-state PL intensity of the powder method is markedly higher than that of the conventional one. τ ave is also significantly enhanced from 142 to 306 ns, which implies that the FAPbI 3 film fabricated from the single powder-based solution has many fewer defects than the one using the conventional precursor mixture. We further measure the photocurrent mapping of the films formed on the FTO substrate using photocurrent atomic force microscopy (AFM),  37  where white light with different intensity (0%-80%) is illuminated on the film under bias voltage of 1 V (Figure  3 ). The two perovskite films show a similar morphology but a large difference in the surface photocurrent (Figure  3a, b ). Contrary to a large inhomogeneity in the surface photocurrent of the precursor mixture-based film, a highly homogeneous photocurrent is detected from the powder-based FAPbI 3 film. In Figure  3c , the average photocurrent of the perovskite film based on the powdered FAPbI 3 is higher than that of the one based on the conventional precursor in the dark conditions (0% light intensity). As LED light intensity increases from 20% to 80% of the maximum power, the powder-based FAPbI 3 film shows uniform current output at the given light intensity, while a large variation in current response is observed for the conventional precursor mixturebased one. Besides, the extent of increase in surface photocurrent with light intensity is lower for the powder case than for the precursor mixture one. Because the inhomogeneity of photocurrent is related to different crystal facets and the density of trap states,  37  uniform and steady increase in photocurrent for the powder case underlines that homogeneous crystal facets with controlled trap states are arranged on the surface of the powder-based perovskite film. The homogeneous surface current is attributed to phase stability and low FA defect of the powder-based FAPbI 3 film as confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis in Figure  S6 . It is noted from the TEM studies that the synthesized powder-based FAPbI 3 film in the device contains cubic perovskite α-phases without any sign of degradation and no trace amount of PbI 2 , while the precursor mixture-based one is already shown to be in the middle of degradation without observing the α-FAPbI 3 phase at all during e-beam irradiation of TEM measurements. Photovoltaic Performance and Reproducibility. Photovoltaic performance is investigated using a device structure of glass/ FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag (Figure  S7 ). No significant difference in the perovskite film morphology is observed by the cross-sectional SEM, while photovoltaic performance of the device based on the powder method is significantly higher than that of the one based on the precursor mixture method.

3109,102_6," ACS Energy Letters Letter and forward-scanned (FS) J-V curves measured under simulated one sun illumination (photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table  S3 ), where the powder-based FAPbI 3 exhibits higher V oc and FF. For the powder method, the RS PCE is 21.72% with J sc of 24.15 mA/cm 2 , V oc of 1.114 V, and FF of 0.808, while the precursor mixture method shows the RS PCE of 17.87% with J sc of 23.48 mA/cm 2 , V oc of 1.052 V, and FF of 0.723. The integrated J sc from EQE shows 24.44 and 23.71 mA/cm 2 for the powder method and the conventional precursor mixture one, respectively, which is well consistent with the measured J sc values (Figure  4b ). Light-dependent J sc and V oc are plotted in Figure  4c ,d to investigate recombination in device.  38  The slope in J sc versus light intensity (Figure  4c ) is calculated to be 1.00 and 1.03 for the powder and the precursor mixture cases, respectively, suggesting good dissociation probabilities at short-circuit conditions, indicative of negligible bimolecular recombination in the devices.  39  Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination is related to the slope of the light-dependent V oc ,  40  where SRH recombination becomes lower as the slope is close to unity. The powder-based device is estimated to be 1.48 kT/q, which is much lower than the 2.25 kT/q for the precursor mixture-based one (k is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, and q the electric charge). The results indicate that the powder-based device exhibits better junction and interfaces because of the highquality FAPbI 3 film with lower trap-assisted nonradiative recombination. The defect density of the powder-based perovskite film is estimated to be 0.84 × 10 16 cm -3 , which is 22% lower than that of the precursor mixture-based film (1.08 × 10 16 cm -3 ) as measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Figure  S8  and Table  S4 ). Little dependency of J-V hysteresis on the scan rate is observed for the powderbased device as compared with the precursor mixture-based one (Figure  4e ,f), which is attributed to fewer defects in the powder-based FAPbI 3 film.  41, 42  Photovoltaic parameters on scan rate-dependent data are summarized in Tables  S5  and S6 .

3128,57_2,"Recent advancements in perovskite solar cell performance were achieved by stabilizing the α-phase of FAPbI 3 in nip-type architectures. However, these advancements could not be directly translated to pin-type devices. Here, we fabricated a high-quality double cation perovskite (MA 0.07 FA 0.93 PbI 3 ) with low bandgap energy (1.54 eV) using a two-step approach on a standard polymer (PTAA). The perovskite films exhibit large grains (∼1 μm), high external photoluminescence quantum yields of 20%, and outstanding Shockley-Read-Hall carrier lifetimes of 18.2 μs without further passivation. The exceptional optoelectronic quality of the neat material was translated into efficient pin-type cells (up to 22.5%) with improved stability under illumination. The low-gap cells stand out by their high fill factor (∼83%) due to reduced charge transport losses and short-circuit currents >24 mA cm -2 .

3129,57_3,"H alide perovskites offer exciting opportunities to efficiently harvest the energy from the sun either in single junction solar cells or in combination with well-established photovoltaic (PV) technologies as tandem devices.  1  The materials family with chemical structure ABX 3 is intrinsically low-cost, can be easily processed from either solution or low-temperature evaporation, and thus shows significant potential for commercial-scale applications.  2  Halideperovskite-based solar cells are fabricated typically by sandwiching a roughly 500 nm thick perovskite absorber layer between two charge transport layers (TLs), either in the nip-or pin-structure, depending on the arrangement of the pand n-type TL. While perovskite solar cells were first demonstrated in a nip-configuration in a dye-sensitized solar cell,  3  solid-state perovskite cells were established soon afterward in both nip-and pin-structures.  4, 5  Both architectures have been intensively investigated over the last 10 years with nip-cells yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 20% in 2015,  6  which was achieved with the pin-type in 2017.  7, 8  This achievement was attributed mainly to the introduction of various cations and halides into the perovskite lattice. For example, formamidinium (FA), Cs, and Rb have been proposed as alternative or additional cations.  9, 10  At the same time, Br was used in addition to I to tune the band gap energy  10, 11  and to increase the tolerance to oxidation,  12  among other reasons. After passing the 20% PCE landmark, efforts to lower the bandgap of the mixed perovskite compositions have been ramped up to optimize the trade-off between photon absorption and thermalization losses.  13  For lead halide perovskites, this was achieved by increasing the molar concentration of formamindium lead iodide (FAPI).  [13] [14] [15] [16]  We note that incorporation of tin, in particular, mixed Pb/Snbased perovskites, enables much lower bandgaps (∼1.2 eV);  17, 18  however, here, we focus on Pb-based perovskites. Notably, pure FAPbI 3 suffers from the presence of a photoinactive, hexagonal ""yellow"" δ-phase, which is more stable at room temperature compared to the trigonal black αphase.  19  However, these problems were mitigated through various approaches. For example, small amounts of Cs, 20 methylammonium (MA),  15, 21  or MAPbBr 3  13, 16, 22  were used to stabilize the α-phase of FAPbI 3 . In other works, Cl was added to improve the nucleation and crystallization processes, which improved the performance and reproducibility.  [22] [23] [24]  Altogether, these efforts allowed impressive PCE improvements (e.g., 23% in 2018,  16  above 24% in 2019,  25  and 25.5%  26  today) and also led to improved device stabilities, likely due to a decrease of the molar concentration of Br and MA. Compared to one of the best cells in 2016 (ref 9) with a short-circuit current-density (J SC ) of 22.8 mA cm -2 , the performance improvement in the above publications was largely due to a significant J SC increase, e.g., 26.7 mA cm -2 was achieved in ref 25. Most of the top-performing nip-type cells employed perovskites with a molar FAPI concentration of 95% or even more,  13, 16, 22, 23, 25  delivering short-circuit currents of ≥25 mA cm -2 , underlining the importance of lowering the bandgap toward the optimum regime in the Shockley-Queisser (S.-Q.) limit (1.1-1.4 eV). Interestingly, however, these improvements were all achieved in nip-type cells. Similar efforts to lower the bandgap in pin-type cells were not quite as successful. This resulted in a slower increase of the PCE (e.g., 20.4% in 2017  8  to 20.9%  27  in 2018), with only two recent examples with a certified PCE above 22%.  28, 29  In the latter publication, Zheng et al.  29  showed that addition of long surface-anchoring alkylamine ligands promotes favorable grain orientation, which improved the p e r f o r m a n c e o f t r i p l e c a t i o n p e r o v s k i t e s Cs 0.05 (FA 0.92 MA 0.08 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.92 Br 0.08 ) 3 with a bandgap of 1.56 eV as obtained from a Tauc plot. Nevertheless, the J SC (24.1 mA cm -2 ) was slightly lower than in the above-mentioned record nip-type cells (≥25 mA cm -2 ). Similarly, in ref 30, the fabricated low-gap (1.55 eV) double cation/double halide MA 5 FA 95 Pb(I 95 Br 5 ) 3 pin-type cell had a comparatively low J SC (23.5 mA cm -2 ). This raises the important question as to why the formation of low-gap (∼1.53 eV) perovskites with a FAPI concentration of roughly 95% did not yield similar performance improvements in pin-type cells. Clearly, the lower J SC could be related to an imperfect film formation on standard ptype transport layers, such as PTAA or polyTPD, resulting in an inferior perovskite morphology. However, it may also be conceivable that the overall lower performance is related to a higher concentration of interfacial defects and/or due to a more unfavorable energetic alignment between the FA-rich perovskites and the transport layers typically employed in pintype cells, causing more open-circuit voltage (V OC ) losses.  31, 32  Being able to exploit the full potential of almost pure FAPI perovskites in a pin-architecture would greatly increase the possibilities to fabricate efficient and stable perovskite cells as recently demonstrated.  29, 33  Moreover, pin-cells typically require only very thin TLs, e.g., 8 nm of PTAA as a hole TL and 20-30 nm of C 60 as an electron TL  8  or ultrathin (∼1 nm) self-assembled monolayers (ref 30), without the need for chemical-doping or high-temperature treatments during fabrication (100-150 °C). In the present work, we fabricated FA-rich (93%) low-gap double cation pin-type perovskite cells with short-circuit currents of up to 25 mA cm -2 , which are significantly larger than in comparable triple cation perovskite cells. The double cation perovskite is thereby fabricated via a two-step process on a conventional PTAA p-type layer, which resulted in large grains with an average diameter of nearly 1 μm. The resulting perovskite cells enabled not only significant short-circuit current-density (J SC ) improvements but also exceptional fill factors (FFs) of up to 83%. To investigate the reason behind these high fill factors, we measured the FF in the absence of transport limitations via light-intensity-dependent open-circuit voltage measurements. The results demonstrated that the better FF in the double cation perovskite cells is a direct consequence of the optimized charge transport compared to the triple cation cell. Despite these promising results, compared with the radiative V OC limit, the open-circuit voltage losses in the double cation cells were quite significant (∼170 mV). To analyze the recombination losses, we quantified the quasi-Fermi level splitting in various stack layers of the cells following a previously reported approach. We find that both transport layers induce large recombination losses at the p-and the n-interfaces, which exceed the bulk recombination by a factor of 150 in the case of the perovskite/electron TLinterface. Nevertheless, the neat material exhibits an outstanding external photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 20% with an unprecedented charge carrier lifetime of 18 μs. Using intensity-dependent quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) measurements, we quantify a large efficiency potential (implied PCE) of 28.4% in the neat material, and we discuss the necessary steps to realize this potential. Following our recent work on triple cation (TC) perovskite solar cells in a pin-structure, with PTAA and C 60 as hole and electron transport layer, respectively, we first aimed to lower the bandgap to optimize the trade-off between photocurrent collection and thermalization losses. Our reference triple cation p e r o v s k i t e h a s a n o m i n a l c o m p o s i t i o n o f Cs 0.05 (FA 0.83 MA 0.17 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 with a bandgap of 1.63 eV, which we call here 83:17 triple cation.  10  We note that in the literature, different approaches exist to estimate the bandgap of a semiconductor.  34  Here, we follow the method proposed by Kirchartz et al.  35  by taking the peak of the derivative of the EQE. However, we note bandgaps obtained from the Tauc plot result in nearly identical values. Using experimentally measured input parameters, such as the recombination rate constants in the perovskite, interface recombination velocities (S = 100 and 2000 cm/s at the PTAA-and C 60 -interfaces, respectively) and bulk lifetime (τ bulk = 500 ns), energy levels, mobilities, and the perovskite density of states, we were recently able to model these solar cells.  36  In particular, we could reproduce the ideality factor  37  and previously determined interfacial and bulk recombination currents in the 83:17 triple cation cell.  31  Based on this set of simulation parameters, we varied the bandgap of the absorber layer by keeping the energy levels of the transport layers aligned with the perovskite. The results are shown in Figure  1a . Interestingly, for all simulations with realistic recombination properties and as well for optimized recombination parameters (S = 10 cm/s at both interfaces, τ bulk = 10 μs), we found that the optimum bandgap (∼1.36-1.53 eV) is considerably different than expected from the S.-Q. model (1.12-1.4 eV), as indicated by the dashed circles in Figure  1a . Therefore, a slight decrease of the bandgap with respect to methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI, 1.6 eV) would put the bandgap of the cell into an optimal regime for perovskites with finite and realistic recombination parameters. In order to lower the bandgap experimentally, we first increased the ratio of FAPbI 3 vs MAPbBr 3 to 95 and even 100% in triple cation cells Cs 0.05 (FA x MA y ) 0.95 Pb(I x Br y ) 3 by keeping the CsPbI 3 molar concentration at 5%. Doing so lowers the bandgap from 1.63 eV for the 83:17 triple cation to 1.57 eV for the 95:5 triple cation and 1.53 eV for the Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 PbI 3 (100:0 CsFA) perovskite as shown by the Tauc plots in the Supporting Information (Supplementary Figure  S1 ). Figure  1b  shows the obtained photovoltaic performance parameters. Unfortunately, we observe that the short-circuit current does not significantly increase with increasing FA content. In combination with the expected drop in open-circuit voltage with decreasing bandgap, the PCE continuously drops with increasing FAPI content. This rather unsuccessful attempt illustrates the above-mentioned challenges to achieve significant performance improvements in triple cation pin-type perovskite cells by lowering the bandgap <1.6 eV, although this does not mean that it is generally not possible.  28, 29  In order to overcome these limitations, we fabricated lowgap, FA-rich perovskite cells using a two-step fabrication process following the description in ref 22. In particular, Brfree MA 0.07 FA 0.93 PbI 3 double cation (DC) perovskites were prepared with a nominal molar FA concentration of 93%, without considering the MACl. Briefly, in this two-step process, the solution consisting of MA and FA cations is spin-coated on top of the PbI 2 layer, which forms the perovskite layer after the cations diffuse through the PbI 2 (all fabrication details are presented in the Supplementary Methods and a Supplementary Video). The sample is then annealed in air at a relative humidity of roughly 25%, which is critical for obtaining the high PLQY of the neat material, which will be discussed further below in detail (Supplementary Figure  S2 ). It is interesting to note that for this particular perovskite composition, cells based on the two-step interdiffusion method outperformed cells fabricated from identical precursors using a one-step solvent assisted process (Supplementary Figure  S3  and Supplementary Table  S1 ). We also found that adding Br to the double cation perovskite by replacing the MAI precursor with MABr, using otherwise the exact same recipe, did not improve the performance. Nevertheless, in this work, we do not aim to make general conclusions as to whether a double cation perovskite composition is better than a triple cation composition nor that a two-step process is generally better than a one-step process. To analyze the optoelectronic properties of the (two-step) DC system, we first characterized the optical properties of the perovskite absorber layer. Supplementary Figure  S1  shows the Tauc plot of the neat perovskite film, which demonstrates a bandgap of 1.54 eV, which is in agreement with the literature.  15  Notably, the bandgap is close to the Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 PI 3 perovskite (1.53 eV). As shown in Supplementary Figure  S4 , this is also consistent with the peak of the first derivative of the EQE (1.54 eV), which reflects the peak of bandgap distribution and confirms the comparatively low bandgap in the final cell. Moreover, the Urbach tail as estimated by an exponential fit to the EQE tails exhibits a value of 15 meV. The sharp absorption onset corresponds to low radiative recombination losses  38, 39  and underlines the high optoelectronic semiconductor quality suitable for solar cell applications. In the following and throughout the rest of the manuscript, we compare the fabricated double cation cells to 95:5 triple cation cells, as similar compositions [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 :(MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 ] (often without the CsI) have been recently employed in highperformance nip-type cells with PCEs above 23%.  13, 16, 22  As shown in Figure  2a ,b, the two-step process results in much larger apparent grains with an average circular grid diameter of 890 nm as compared to the 95:5 triple cation perovskite with an average disk diameter of 140 nm, which has been prepared by a one-step process. The corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters of the cells are shown in Figure  2c . Compared to the 95:5 triple cation cells, the short-circuit current is significantly higher (up to 25 mA/cm 2 ). Figure  2d  depicts the JV-characteristics of the current record device with a reverse-scan PCE of 22.5% and a forward-scan PCE of 21.8%. In reverse, the device demonstrates a comparatively high FF (82.9%), a high J SC (24.7 mA cm -2 ), and a V OC of (1.098 V). This PCE is slightly lower than the highest reported values for a pin-type structure (22.75% certified).  28  The corresponding external quantum efficiency measurement in the inset demonstrates that the integrated EQE-sun spectrum product (24.5 mA/cm 2 ) matches the J SC within a small error. Supplementary Figure  S5  demonstrates that the stabilized PCE of another high-efficiency cell matches closely the initial PCE. Despite these promising features, the V OC of the DC cell is similar to the TC cell, which however also implies that there is significant room for improvements. This point will be explored further below. Moreover, Figure  2e  shows the maximum power point tracking of a high-performance DC device under constant illumination at 27 °C in a nitrogen controlled atmosphere. The MPP exhibits a PCE above 95% of its initial value for ∼350 h. We note that the DC cell was not encapsulated with SnO 2 on top of C 60 , which can further improve the stability of pin-type cells.  29, [40] [41] [42]  In comparison to the triple cation cells, we found a quite similar stability under MPP conditions in the 95:5 triple cation cell; however, the 83:17 triple cation cells degraded significantly faster (Supplementary Figure  S6 ). Therefore, reducing the amount of MA and Brthereby decreasing the bandgap energyimproved the stability under continuous illumination, which is crucial for further perovskite solar cell development. However, this does not mean that Cs is detrimental for the stability. In order to assess the performance difference between the DC and TC systems, we first performed a comparative analysis of the factors determining the FF of the cell. Not counting the shunt resistance, there are three primary considerations affecting the fill factor.  43  These are (1) the series resistance limitation, which is quite small in our configuration (∼0.25 Ω cm -2 ), (2) the transport limitations due to insufficient mobilities, and (3) the nonradiative recombination losses that govern the dark current, hence also causing FF losses, beyond the fill factor in the radiative limit. To assess these parameters in the two systems, we measured the open-circuit voltage as a function of the illumination intensity (Figure  3a ), which resulted in an ideality factor of ∼1.4 for both cells. Note, the intensity-dependent V OC is equivalent to a seriesresistance-free dark JV-curve.  43  Adding the voltage-independent generation current-density to this dark curve creates a pseudo-JV curve that is only impacted by the nonradiative recombination processes in the cell, hence allowing the impact to be assessed independent of transport losses. This result, shown in Figure  3b  by the dashed lines and summarized in Table  1 , demonstrates that the obtained resistance-free pseudo fill factor (pFF) is around ∼86% in both systems. Notably, the device FF of the DC cell was above 83%, meaning the transport losses in the device are quite small. Interestingly, and as a comparison, the pFF of the 95:5 triple cation cell is also 86% with a device FF of 79%. This highlights similar nonradiative (or ideality factor related) FF losses in these two systems but more transport losses in the triple cation cells. Considering that the transport layers are the same in both cells suggests that the enhanced charge extraction in the double cation cells is related to a higher effective mobility in the DC absorber layer and/or to less charge carrier scattering at the grain boundaries. In order to investigate this, we first characterized the intragrain carrier mobilities in the double cation perovskite layer using time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy (TRTS). We note that charges move only very few nm in response to the THz pulse, and therefore, grain boundaries are not expected to affect the obtained TRTS mobility. These measurements reveal an intragrain mobility sum of ∼35 cm 2 / (V s) (Supplementary Figure  S7a ), which is typical for perovskites (e.g., a mobility sum of ∑μ ≈ 30 cm 2 /(V s) was recently obtained on a 77:23 triple cation perovskite with higher Br content 44 ). These observations indicate that it is likely transport barriers (probably grain boundaries) on larger length scales that are decisive for charge collection, FF, and J SC . Consistent with this, cross-section SEM images reveal larger grains along the vertical (z)-direction in the case of the double cation film, while the grains appears to be broken in the zdirection in the case of the 95:5 triple cation film (Supplementary Figure  S8 ). In addition, using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the THz mobility would be sufficient to avoid charge transport losses in the case of the double cation perovskite. In this case, the charge extraction is then limited by the low mobility in the PTAA layer (Supplementary Figure  S7b ).  8  Finally, we also note that the improved J SC in the double cation cell is likely also a result of the improved collection considering that EQE of the double cation cell is significantly higher than in the 95:5 cell across the whole spectrum (Supplementary Figure  S9 ). Moreover, the double cation has a lower bandgap as compared to our 95:5 cell and has a larger active layer thickness, both of which contribute to the enhanced J SC . Knowing that the V OC is lowered by a nonradiative recombination loss of ∼170 mV in the DC perovskite, we further investigated the devices by measuring the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the individual components of the cell following a previous reported approach.  45  To this end, we prepared different stacks composed of the neat material on glass (""neat""), the perovskite with the electron transport layer (ETL) or the hole transport layer (HTL) attached and the perovskite sandwiched between both TLs (optical pin-stack), and finally a complete cell (with contacts). All samples were illuminated with a 520 nm wavelength laser through the glass or glass/PTAA (PTAA is the less absorbing compared to the ETL). As shown in Figure  4a , in both DC and TC systems, the highest PLQY was obtained in the neat material (2.6% in TC and 20.2% in DC). Notably, as shown in Figure  4b , the high PLQY in the double cation perovskite correlates with a Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) decay time of 18.2 μs in the monoexponential regime, which is superimposed by bimolecular (second-order) recombination at higher excitation fluences and carrier densities up to ∼10 16 cm -3 . We note that the monoexponential TRPL decay time is the minority carrier SRH lifetime in the low-level injection regime, while it is the average electron hole ). We note that a higher shunt resistance is observed in the double cation cell at intensities <10 -3 suns. (b) V OC (I) allows a seriesresistance-free pseudo-JV curve (dashed lines) to be created to estimate the contribution of nonradiative and transport losses to the total fill factor (FF) loss. In comparison to the TC cell, the DC cell has a lower transport loss (i.e., better charge extraction) as visible from the difference of the actual JV curve (solid lines) and the pseudo-JV curve from V OC (I); see also Table  1 . We note that the contribution of nonradiative FF losses is similar in both systems, which is given by the difference between the JV curve in the radiative S.-Q. limit (dotted lines) and the pseudo-JV curves. SRH lifetime in the high-injection regime.  46, 47  Supplementary Figure  S10  shows the initial TRPL amplitude versus the generated carrier density and excitation fluence (nJ cm -2 ), which reveals a switch from low-to high-level injection at a carrier density of around 4 × 10 13 cm -3 . Hence, the background (doping) carrier density is expected to be similar to this value.  47  To our knowledge, this is the longest reported lifetime in the literature with an optical transient measurement. We note a decay time of 8.8 μs have been previously demonstrated for trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) passivated MAPI films. 48 However, to our knowledge, such wellpassivated MAPI/TOPO samples with such long lifetimes have not yet been successfully implemented in devices as TOPO likely impedes charge carrier transfer and/or extraction. Therefore, the double cation absorber layers fabricated here stand out, as they do not require further passivation with (d) Current-density vs voltage (JV) and pseudo-JV (pJV) characteristics obtained from intensity-dependent V OC (I) and QFLS measurements of double cation cells (black line) and partial solar cell stacks (neat material, PTAA/perovskite, perovskite/C 60 , pin-stack). The implied PCE of the neat material is marked (28.4%). (e) Loss mechanism in the double and 95:5 triple cation perovskite cells due to short-circuit current losses (difference between the measured J SC and the J SC with an average EQE of 95%), insufficient charge transport and mobility (as discussed in Figure  3b  or Table  1 ), interface recombination (the difference between the implied efficiency of the neat material and the pinstack), and efficiency potential losses in the neat material with respect to the 95% of the S.-Q. limit. The graph demonstrates that the challenge to realize the PCE potential of the neat double cation material relies largely on the ability to suppress the nonradiative recombination at the interfaces. additional chemicals and can be directly employed in highperformance pin-type cells. In comparison, the lifetime in the neat 95:5 triple cation film is ""only"" 1 μs (Supplementary Figure  S11 ). A further comparison to lifetimes obtained in literature can be found in Supplementary Figure  S12  and Supplementary Table  S2 . In order to better under the reason for the improved carrier lifetime in the double cation perovskite, we performed additional cathodoluminescence measurements, which allow the emission to be resolved with high spatial resolution (∼10-50 nm) yet require a high equivalent carrier generation rate (∼10 5 suns). As shown in Supplementary Figure  S13 , these measurements reveal nonradiative recombination primarily at the grain boundaries in the neat double cation perovskite. Therefore, the differences in the apparent grain size between both perovskites (∼890 vs 140 nm, Figure  2a ) might be related to the difference in the lifetimes of the two systems. Calculating the surface recombination velocity at the grain boundaries (S) via the apparent grain size (d grain ) and the obtained lifetime (τ SRH ) in both systems S = d grain /2τ SRH 49 yields a value of S of ∼2.5 cm/s in the case of the DC perovskite and S ∼ 4.5 cm/s in the 95:5 triple cation perovskite. This analysis would suggest that the recombination speed at the grain boundaries is quite similar in both systems and that the different grain size in these two systems contributes to the difference in the lifetime. Nevertheless, this does not exclude the importance of the perovskite surface in determining the lifetime or the PL yield of the neat material. Despite the high quality of both neat films, the PLQY of the perovskite/C 60 junctions was significantly lower. In the case of TC, the PLQY of the neat material dropped from 2.6 to 0.22% upon the addition of C 60 , i.e., ∼12 times. In the case of DC, the PLQY dropped from 20 to 0.13%, i.e., approximately 150 times. This means that the nonradiative recombination at the C 60 -interface is much more pronounced in the large-grain DC system and exceeds the recombination in the neat DC material by more than 2 orders of magnitude. Notably, in the DC system, the losses at the p-interface are also significant (∼22× reduction of the PLQY compared to the neat), but in the case of the TC perovskite, these losses are minimal. Overall, for both the double and triple cation perovskite, the limiting interlayer is the C 60 -interface. To directly compare the opencircuit voltage potential in the individual stack layers to the V OC of the device, we quantified the QFLS of the stacks from the PLQY using = * k T J J QFLS ln(PLQY / ) B G 0,rad (1) where k B T is the thermal energy, J G is the generation currentdensity, and J 0,rad is the radiative recombination current-density in the dark (see Supplementary Note 1 for more details). As shown in Figure  4c , the highest values were obtained for the DC neat material with a theoretical V OC of 1.23 V that could be obtained in the absence of recombination losses at the interfaces or electrodes. However, the QFLS of the perovskite/ C 60 stack is only 1.1 V, meaning that the voltage loss at the ninterface of the DC cell is as high as 130 mV. Nevertheless, the QFLS of the cell is similar to the corresponding V OC , indicating small energetic offsets between the perovskite and the transport layers and little recombination losses at the electrodes.  31  Having analyzed the primary V OC limitations in the neat perovskite film and at the interfaces, we further investigated the efficiency limiting mechanism across the power-generating JV regime. By using the same approach as shown above to create a pseudo-JV curve from the intensity-dependent V OC of the complete cell, we utilized the intensity dependence of the QFLS to measure the implied PCE of perovskite films on glass as shown in ref 43. To quantify the PCE potential of the neat film, we assume a certain short-circuit current-density that could be potentially reached in complete cells. To this end, we consider that an average EQE above the bandgap of 95% to be the short-circuit current limit of current state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells. Notably, this was already achieved in recent record nip-type cells, with certified PCEs and shortcircuit currents.  23  Figure  4d  depicts these different pseudo-JV curves on partial DC solar cell stacks (neat perovskite, perovskite/TL bilayers, the pin-stack), as well as the JV curve in the S.-Q. limit in comparison to the actually measured JV curve under AM1.5G illumination. Table  2  and Figure  4e  show the calculated pseudo-PCE of each stack in comparison to the measured JV in both studied systems and the losses associated with interfacial charge transport and ""avoidable"" current losses below 95% of the J SC in the S.-Q. limit. We note that the internal quantum efficiency of the DC cell is near unity (Supplementary Figure  S14 ), which implies that the remaining J SC losses are of optical nature. For the neat material, we obtained an efficiency potential of 28.4%, which is the highest reported value for a perovskite material, slightly outperforming the previously reported PCE potential of a potassium passivated triple cation perovskite.  43  However, the perovskite in this study is significantly simpler, with a low amount of MA and without Br, which is beneficial in terms of stability (as also demonstrated above). Overall, the studied double cation composition combines multiple advantages in terms of stability and allows the fabrication of near-ideal solar cells close to the thermodynamic limit. Clearly, engineering of the interfaces and TLs is the most promising pathway to improve the opencircuit voltage and to realize the PCE potential of the neat material. In summary, in this work, we fabricated low-gap (1.54 eV), MA 0.07 FA 0.93 PbI 3 double cation perovskite solar cells in a pintype architecture via a two-step process. With an external PLQY of 20% under a 1 sun equivalent illumination condition and a record lifetime of 18.2 μs, the neat material exhibits an exceptional optoelectronic quality without the need for further passivation. The high PLQY and lifetime can be at least partially attributed to the large average grain size of nearly 1 μm. Compared with FA-rich triple cation perovskites (95:5), the fabricated cells stand out by their short-circuit current density of up to 25 mA cm -2 , their high fill factors reaching values above 83%, as well as significantly improved stability under continuous illumination and maximum power point tracking. A maximum PCE of 22.5% was reached, which is among the highest efficiencies for pin-type solar cells. Using intensity-dependent open-circuit measurements, we were able to pinpoint the FF enhancement in the DC system to an improvement of the charge transport efficiency. The rather large open-circuit voltage losses in the system can be traced back to a 150-fold reduction of the PLQY upon addition of the ETL on top of the perovskite, although the losses at the pinterface were also significant. Interestingly, the losses at the ninterface were significantly larger in the large-grain (∼1 μm) DC system as compared to the TC system with smaller grains (∼100 nm). Using intensity-dependent QFLS measurements, we quantified the implied PCE of the neat double cation layer to be 28.4%, therefore enabling the possibility to create nearideal single junction solar cells in terms of performance. This efficiency can be reached under the following conditions: (1) interfacial recombination losses are minimized with respect to bulk recombination losses, (2) an average EQE of 95% above the bandgap can be achieved through a reduction of optical losses, and (3) the hole transport layer mobility can be improved by roughly a factor of 10 to minimize the remaining charge transport losses. Therefore, these results rationalize the huge improvements that were recently achieved in nip-type cells and lay out a clear path for further advancements of pintype cells toward the radiative limit. ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""MA0.07FA0.93PbI3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""poly(triarylamine)"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN""}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Cs 0.05 (FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""buckminsterfullerene"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""poly(triarylamine)"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""27"", ""time"": ""350"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""22.5"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.098"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.95""}}"

Inverted PSCs with SST exhibited a PCE of 24.3% with V oc up to 1.19 V in agreement with the V bi from Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 3B; see certified PCE of 23.5% in fig. S10, PCE dependence on SST thickness in fig. S11, and device hysteresis in fig. S12). The stabilized PCE under MPP reached 24.2% (fig. S13A). Control PSCs had lower PCEs of 21.8% (stabilized PCE of 21.0%; fig. S13A) mainly because of the lower V oc of 1.09 V. In addition, the device fill factor (FF) was also increased from 80.0 to 82.9% in PSCs with SST. Both control and SST-based devices exhibited high external quantum efficiency values (fig. S13B), in agreement with their similar short-circuit current density from current density-voltage (J-V) curves. PSCs with the commonly used phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) passivator were also fabricated, and limited improvement was observed (PCE of 22.4%; fig. S14). Statistical analysis indicated good reproducibility in PSCs with SST, with an average efficiency of 23.3 ± 0.5% among 50 separate devices (figs. S15 and S16).

3166,100_3," An electron-transport layer (ETL) with appropriate energy alignment and enhanced charge transfer is critical for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, interfacial energy level mismatch limits the electrical performance of PSCs, particularly the open-circuit voltage (V OC ). Herein, a simple low Here, we introduce a simple low-temperature solutionprocessed In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 bilayer ETL for efficient planar PSCs. We demonstrate that uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films can be obtained by the introduction of In 2 O 3 . The band energy alignment can be also tailored with increased built-in potential, resulting in an enhanced electric field for the separation of carriers and enhanced charge transfer, as well as reduced carrier recombination. The planar PSC utilizing In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 ETL demonstrated a higher efficiency of 23.24% with negligible hysteresis and 22.74% stable power output compared with a SnO 2based device that has an efficiency of 21.42%. In addition, the In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 -based PSC maintains 97.5% of its initial PCE after being stored under N 2 for 80 days without encapsulation and retain 91% of their initial PCE after 180 h under 1 sun continuous illumination.  contact with ITO, improving the electrical performance of resulting devices.  [29]  To further demonstrate the influence of In 2 O 3 , top-view SEM images of the perovskite films were examined. As shown in Figure  1e ,f, uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films with larger grain sizes can be obtained when deposited on the In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 ETL substrate than on SnO 2 ETL. The grain size of perovskite films is increased by an average of around 200 nm (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information) with the incorporation of In 2 O 3 . Pinholes on the surface of the films will reduce the shunt resistance and lead to recombination,  [30]  which are detrimental to the performance of devices. Moreover, the RMS roughness of corresponding films was significantly reduced from 44 to 33 nm (Figure  S5  Uniform and compact perovskite films lay the foundation for efficient PSCs. To better understand the variations in properties of the deposited perovskite films after introducing of In 2 O 3 , XRD was performed. Figure  2a  shows the XRD patterns of the films based on different ETLs. The strong intensity of the XRD peaks is related to better crystallization. So a better crystal film was obtained which is consistent with SEM results. The optical absorption spectra of these two films were measured by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. Figure  2b  shows that the presence of In 2 O 3 does not affect the absorption edge of perovskite films while slightly increasing the absorption intensity. The bandgap of both films extracted from Tauc plots shows an identical value of 1.53 eV (Figure  S7 , Supporting Information). In order to determine the dynamics of charge transfer and the extraction characteristics of different ETLs, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy were performed. As shown in Figure  2c  The radiative recombination rate from photoinduced carriers competing with nonradiative loss  [31]  plays a key role in the recombination process. In Figure  3b  shows the reverse and forward J-V scans of the devices. The device based on In 2 O 3 shows the lowest performance with a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 24.10 mA cm -2 , V OC of 1.10 V, fill factor (FF) of 72.52%, and PCE of 19.21%. SnO 2 ETL-based devices have a typical J SC of 24.26 mA cm -2 , V OC of 1.13 V, FF of 78.14%, and PCE of 21.42% (reverse scanning). By introducing In 2 O 3 , the performance of devices can be improved significantly. Further characterization shows that the optimum concentration of In 2 O 3 precursor solution is 0.05 m (Figure  S10  and Table  S1 , Supporting Information). Devices based on In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 ETL show a J SC of 24.53 mA cm -2 , V OC of 1.16 V, FF of 81.23%, and PCE of 23.07% with negligible hysteresis (Table  1 ). Therefore, our devices have good reproducibility. As shown in Figure  S11  (Supporting Information), 60 devices with different ETLs were fabricated. The PCEs of devices based on SnO 2 ETL range from 18.60% to 21.17%,    S12  (Supporting Information). The results discussed above reveal that device performance improvement is mainly due to the enhancement of FF and V OC . The hysteresis of the devices was also suppressed by the introduction of In 2 O 3 . Previous studies have demonstrated that hysteresis is mainly caused by ion migration  [32]  and charge transfer at the interface.  [4]  In order to further understand the effect of In 2 O 3 , the band structures of In 2 O 3 and SnO 2 were measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS; Figures  S13  and S14 , Supporting Information). The optical bandgap values of In 2 O 3 and SnO 2 determined by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy are 3.8 and 3.9 eV, respectively (Figure  S6a, d , Supporting Information). The calculated conduction band minimum (E CB ) is -4.55 eV for In 2 O 3 and -4.20 eV for SnO 2 (Figure  S14 , Supporting Information). According to previous studies, the E CB of ITO is about -4.7 eV.  [33]  The presence of In 2 O 3 with a deeper conduction band matches SnO 2 and ITO well, which is beneficial to a higher V OC (Figure  3c ). To further elucidate the possible mechanism responsible for the enhancement of V OC and FF, capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements were also taken. As shown in Figure  3d , the device based on the In 2 O 3 / SnO 2 bilayer has a smaller slope in the linear Mott-Schottky curve and the built-in potentials (V bi ) based on In 2 O 3 , SnO 2 , and In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 are ≈915, 935, and 985 mV, respectively. A higher V bi means stronger electric field in the perovskite which is beneficial for enhancing charge transfer,  [34]  resulting in suppressed hysteresis and more efficient devices.  [35]  The performance of PSCs is highly affected by the quality of perovskite films. Excellent contact between interfaces originating from uniform and compact films may be one of the reasons for the higher FF. In order to determine the origin of V OC and FF improvements, the trap density of prepared films with different ETLs was evaluated. So, electron-only devices with the ITO/ETL/perovskite/PCBM/bathocuproine (BCP)/Au structure were fabricated. As shown in Figure  3e , the current density reveals an Ohmic-type response at low bias. The cross point is defined as the trap-filled limit voltage (V TFL ), when the bias voltage is higher than the V TFL . The trap density can be determined by V TFL using the following equation n trap = 2εε 0 V TFL /eL 2 .  [31]  The trap density is proportional to V TFL . The results show that the trap density of film deposited on In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 is lower than that of the film deposited on SnO 2 . This is due to low nonradiative recombination and results in a higher V OC . In addition, the dark J-V curves (Figure  S15 , Supporting Information) of the devices based on SnO 2 and In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 indicate that the J 0 decreased with the presence of In 2 O 3 , which means low leakage current density. Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) determined the dynamics of charge transfer in PSCs.  [36]  It is well known that the high-frequency component represents the transfer resistance (R tr ) and the low-frequency component indicates the recombination resistance (R re ). Small R tr is beneficial to electron extraction, and large R re means less charge recombination.  [37]  Figure  3f  shows the Nyquist plots of cells with different ETLs under dark conditions, and the equivalent circuit diagram and specific parameters of devices based on SnO 2 and In 2 O 3 / SnO 2 are shown in Figure  S16  and Table  S2  in the Supporting Information, respectively. The R re of devices based on In 2 O 3 / SnO 2 is significantly larger than that of SnO 2 , meaning low recombination rates and resulting in enhanced FF and V OC . An optimized device with a PCE of 23.24% was successfully fabricated (Figure  4a ). Significantly, this device demonstrates a high voltage of 1.17 V with only 0.36 V loss in potential. This is one of the highest voltages demonstrated by an n-i-p planar structure (1.53 eV). Moreover, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 -based device was measured (Figure  4b ). The integrated current density is 24.34 mA cm -2 , matching well with the values from J-V characterization. The steady-state efficiency at maximum power point tracking (MPP) of the optimized PSC was also measured. The maximum voltage for the devices with In 2 O 3 is 0.98 V, and the maximum current density is 23.2 mA cm -2 . The corresponding steady-state output PCE was 22.74% (Figure  4c ). The best-performing device was sent to a PV calibration laboratory (Quality supervisionand Testing Center of Chemical and Physical Power Sources of Information Industry, China) for certification. A certified efficiency of 22.54% was demonstrated with a V OC of 1.16 V, J SC of 24.78 mA cm -2 , and FF of 78.23% (Figure  S17 , Supporting Information), making it one of the best planar PSCs. A performance comparison with previous devices based on bilayer ETLs can be found in Table  S3  (Supporting Information). The stability of PSCs is one of the most important criteria for commercialization.  [38]  The device stability was tested under a nitrogen environment (25 °C) without encapsulation, as shown in Figure  4d . After 80 days, the In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 -based PSC still maintains 97.5% of its initial PCE. Compared with SnO 2 -based PSCs which retain only 92.7% of their initial PCE, our results verify the enhanced stability of the new device. Figure  4e  shows the normalized PCE changes over time. It is obvious that after 180 h of continuous illumination, the device based on the In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 bilayer maintains ≈91% of its initial efficiency. While for the same conditions, the device based on SnO 2 maintains only 83% of its initial efficiency. The stability was also tested under ambient air (relative humidity (RH) 75%). After 120 h, the devices based on In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 maintain ≈80% of their initial efficiency and the devices based on SnO 2 only provide 71% of their initial efficiency under the same conditions (Figure  4f ). The same conclusion was also confirmed by thermal stability measurements (Figure  S18 , Supporting Information). The instability of PSCs is due to the decomposition of perovskite materials and organic hole transport layer (HTL). The grain size of perovskite films based on In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 is larger compared to that of SnO 2 (Figure  1 ). The larger grain size of perovskite films may partly suppress the permeation of water at grain boundaries and increase stability. We believe that the stability of perovksite solar cells can be improved further if new HTL materials  [39]  and/or encapsulation methods  [40]  are used. In summary, a simple and effective In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 bilayer ETL was developed for fabricating efficient low-temperature-processed planar PSCs. The presence of In 2 O 3 leads to low trap densities in perovskite films, better energy alignment, and enhanced charge transfer, which result in higher V OC and FF. Eventually, an optimized PCE of 23.24% (certified 22.54%) was obtained with negligible hysteresis. Moreover, the device based on In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 ETL retains 97.5% of its initial efficiency after 80 days in N 2 without encapsulation and maintain 91% of their initial efficiency after 180 h under 1 sun continuous illumination. This work demonstrates that a bilayer ETL can provide sufficient energy alignment and enhanced charge transfer for efficient and stable photovoltaic devices. The efficiency of PSCs can be further improved by optimizing the energy alignment between the interface layers. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""ISOSL"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""180"", ""control_pce"": ""21.17"", ""treated_pce"": ""23.24"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.91"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.927""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""180"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.91"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.83""}, ""test_3"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""75"", ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""120"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.8"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.71""}}"
3182,100_21," -temperature-processed In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 bilayer ETL is developed and used for fabricating a new PSC device. The presence of In 2 O 3 results in uniform, compact, and low-trap-density perovskite films. Moreover, the conduction band of In 2 O 3 is shallower than that of Sn-doped In 2 O 3 (ITO), enhancing the charge transfer from perovskite to ETL, thus minimizing V OC loss at the perovskite and ETL interface. A planar PSC with a power conversion efficiency of 23.24% (certified efficiency of 22.54%) is obtained. A high V OC of 1.17 V is achieved with the potential loss at only 0.36 V. In contrast, devices based on single SnO 2 layers achieve 21.42% efficiency with a V OC of 1.13 V. In addition, the new device maintains 97.5% initial efficiency after 80 d in N 2 without encapsulation and retains 91% of its initial efficiency after 180 h under 1 sun continuous illumination.

3208,63_10," Photovoltaic Performance Solid-state solar cells were fabricated using the perovskite as sensitizer and spiro-MeOTAD as hole-transport material. The perovskite material was deposited as described from solution containing a 1:3 molar ratio of PbCl 2 and CH 3 NH 3 I in DMF and annealed at different temperatures followed by the subsequent deposition of the hole-transport material (HTM) by spincoating. The current-voltage ( J-V ) characteristics measured under standard AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm -2 ) of these devices are presented in Figure  4  , the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of which are summarized in Table  2  . A clear correlation is observed between the annealing temperature of the perovskite and the photovoltaic performance of the devices. Samples that were annealed at 100 °C gave the highest power conversion effi ciency (PCE), 11.66%, as a result of the highest open-circuit potential ( V OC ) and short-current density ( J SC ), 938 mV and 18.37 mA cm -2 respectively. At low annealing temperatures (60 °C) both of these parameters are decreased as a consequence of incomplete conversion to the Table  2 . Photovoltaic performance parameters extracted from J-V measurements under standard AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm -2 ) of devices using different annealing temperatures. All devices were masked to achieve an illuminated area of 0.285 cm 2 .  This exponential behavior of the chemical capacitance is characteristic for such nanostructured materials and has been extensively reported.  [34] [35] [36] [37]  In the region of low forward bias, where the current fl ows over the blocking underlayer, the behavior of the chemical capacitance is similar for all devices, exhibiting a small increase in capacitance with increasing forward bias. As in the other measurements, the samples prepared at 100 °C and 80 °C behave relatively similar, with the exception that at very high forward bias, the chemical capacitance for the device annealed at 100 °C does not continue to increase, but instead shows a leveling off. Increasing the temperature further shows that the chemical capacitance deviates from its exponential increase at progressively lower forward bias. While for samples heated at 175 °C the chemical capacitance still shows some initial increase before remaining constant, annealing the perovskite at 200 °C resulted in the chemical capacitance displaying no considerable increase at all. In the case of bulk heterojunctions devices, the capacitance has been observed to behave similarly, here the decrease of the capacitance at high forward applied bias was attributed to the formation of an injection limitation.  [ 38, 39 ]  These types of devices show Schottky diode behavior at the metal-semiconductor contact. For Schottky diodes, the barrier height of this junction can limit the injection of the minority carrier under moderate to large forward bias thus determining the minority carrier concentration in the bulk semiconductor material.  [ 40 ]  Due to this injection limitation the charge collection is reduced and leads to the formation of a peak in the capacitance instead of increasing indefi nitely with increasing forward bias. Furthermore this might evolve into a strong negative capacitive component.  [ 40 ]  In the systems under consideration here injection of electrons from and to the mTiO 2 is dependent on the energy level alignment between the conduction bands of the mTiO 2 and the perovskite material. The conduction band (CB) energy for the perovskite material has been reported to be only very slightly higher than that of mTiO 2 (-3.93 eV and -4.00 eV below vacuum level for the perovskite and TiO 2 respectively).  [ 2 ]  Hence any upward shift of the CB of TiO 2 or downward shift of the CB of the perovskite would result in an injection barrier and thus prevent charge build up in the mTiO 2 . When high forward bias is applied in the dark, the CB in the mTiO 2 is unpinned. The upward shift of the CB of the mTiO 2 at high forward bias will lead to a misalignment of the energy levels. The behavior of the chemical capacitance was observed to be similar under illumination, while the recombination resistance showed the expected decrease in magnitude (see Supporting Information Figure  S5 ). A misalignment of the bands could possibly arise due to the increasing proportion of PbI 2 that forms with increasing annealing temperature. It is possible that the PbI 2 acts as a sink for charges injected from the perovskite, preventing the buildup within the mTiO 2 and accounting for the energy level misalignment. This is clearly shown in the case for samples annealed at 200 °C which contain a high proportion of PbI 2 . The capacitance does not show any signifi cant increase indicating that there is no injection from and into the mTiO 2 and thus no buildup of charges in the mTiO 2 . resistance within the HTM (if insuffi ciently doped) was found to remain more or less unchanged regardless of the annealing temperature used. This work focused on the intermediate to low frequency region in which the transport and recombination of charges manifests. Figure  5  shows the recombination resistance, R ct and associated chemical capacitance, C μ determined from the impedance measurements conducted on devices in the dark. As can be seen the behavior of the recombination resistance remains relatively similar for all devices, no matter the annealing temperature used. This however is not the case for the chemical capacitance. In the case where the perovskite was heated at 80 °C the chemical capacitance shows the typical behavior expected of such devices. At low forward bias, where the mesoporous TiO 2 is insulating and the charges fl ow through the compact TiO 2 underlayer, the associated capacitance of this interface is low. As the applied bias increases and the mesoporous TiO 2 becomes conductive (usually at an applied bias >400 mV), the chemical capacitance increases exponentially.  ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""CH3NH3PbI3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""CH3NH3PbI3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""100 \u00b0C"", ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""11.66"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"

3275,4_10," Results and discussion XRD and in situ GIWAXS. We used the ligand cation 4vinylbenzylammonium bromide (VBABr, Fig.  1b ), which we have shown forms 2D/3D interfaces with RDPs that exhibit strong diffraction, and greatly improves the efficiency and stability of photovoltaic devices  10, 12  . To obtain q values for the diffraction peaks of low-n RDPs, we first spin-coated thin films of n h i = 1, 2, and 3 directly from RDP precursor solutions using the composition (VBABr) 2 (FA 0.95 MA 0.05 ) n-1 Pb n (I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3n+1 , which has the same cation and anion composition as the 2D/3D films used throughout this work. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for these films are shown in Fig.  1c . The (001) diffraction peaks of n = 1 and 2 were found to have q = 0.37 Å -1 and 0.29/0.30 Å -1 , respectively, while an (001) n = 3 peak could not be observed for these samples. The n = 2 peak experiences a small shift in the n h i = 3 film, possibly due to strain. These q values are similar for analogous films using the MA-and iodine-only composition (VBABr) 2 MA n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 (Supplementary Fig.  1 ), indicating that the RDPs with multication and multianion composition have minimal shifting of their characteristic (001) diffraction peaks. The diffraction peak positions we observe for n = 1 and 2 are also very similar to those we have previously measured and simulated for RDPs using the ligand phenethylammonium, PEA (owing to the structural similarity of PEA and VBA)  21  , where we found n = 3 PEA RDPs to diffract at q = 0.22 Å. We assume a similar peak for the n = 3 VBA RDPs here. We next used in situ GIWAXS in order to gain insight into the formation of the 2D/3D interface. Measurements were performed at the Brockhouse Beamline  22    zero is taken to be the frame where spinning was engaged and the ligand solution is removed from the surface. In the initial frame (t = -6 s), we observe the expected isotropic diffraction from the (110) plane of 3D MAPbI 3 at q ≈ 1.0 Å -1 , and also a smaller amplitude peak at q z ≈ 0.9 Å -1 , which corresponds to PbI 2 . After soaking the surface with the ligand solution for ~6 s, the spinning is turned on at a speed of 1000 r.p.m. At t = 1.05 s after spinning is initiated, a peak at q z ≈ 0.50 Å -1 is observed, which then (t = 2.10 s) decays simultaneously with growth of a peak at q z ≈ 0.37 Å -1 . This diffraction peak-which corresponds to the (100) plane of n = 1-then remains constant through to the end of the experiment, which can be seen from a contour map of azimuthally integrated GIWAXS patterns (Fig.  2b ). The diffraction peaks for both the transient intermediate peak and the n = 1 peak are strongly centered along q xy = 0, indicating that the species are oriented parallel with the substrate, which is often observed for low-n RDPs  3, 10, 21, 23  . These experiments indicate that n = 1 is not directly formed from the MAPbI 3 but rather transitions through an intermediate state. The peak at q z ≈ 0.50 Å corresponds to a d-spacing of 12.6 Å, which is too large to be attributed to PbI 2 and too small to be attributed to an RDP (n = 1 has the smallest d of ~17 Å, and higher n RDPs have progressively larger d as the thickness increases). Kim et al. observed a highly similar peak with q ≈ 0.55 Å -1 that was also oriented along q z , during thermal degradation of MAPbI 3 into PbI 2 and other decomposition products  24  . This peak is attributed to 2D PbI 2 sheets that are intercalated by MAI or solvent molecules. We therefore posit that either IPA from the ligand solution or MAI that is being displaced from the perovskite lattice are the species that intercalate into PbI 2 sheets. This is supported by additional experiments using ligand solutions containing chlorobenzene (CB) with IPA:CB solvent ratios of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3. When CB is included in the solvent, we do not observe the intermediate species, indicating that IPA intercalates with PbI 2 to form the intermediate species during 2D/3D interface formation. This suggests that these PbI 2 sheets template the subsequent formation of n = 1 RDPs, consistent with the fact the diffraction peaks for the intercalated PbI 2 and n = 1 are identical in shape and therefore orientation. Control experiments using only IPA as the exposure solution confirmed that this peak only appears when ligands are included (Supplementary Fig.  2 ), meaning cation displacement by the ligand molecules is also required to form this intermediate intercalated PbI 2 . We observe a very different 2D/3D transformation from in situ GIWAXS experiments on multication and multianion perovskites of composition (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 . Compared to MAPbI 3 , multication and -anion compositions achieve higher PCEs in photovoltaic devices  3, 13, 25  . Accordingly, in order to best simulate the 2D/3D interfaces used in our devices  10  , we used a solution of 1 mM VBABr (~214.11 µg/mL) in 3:97 IPA:chloroform (CF). A lower proportion of IPA reduces perovskite dissolution and surface trap state density  13  , and a lower concentration of ligands results in thinner RDP layers, which is favorable for carrier extraction and fill factor  11, 12  . To compare fairly with our results from MAPbI 3 , we also performed experiments with (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 using 5 mg/mL VBABr in IPA, and observed no intermediate state before the formation of n = 1 (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). A contour map of azimuthally integrated in situ GIWAXS patterns and four of the full patterns are shown in Fig.  2c  and d . In contrast to MAPbI 3 , rather than observing an intermediate at higher q, we instead observe a small but discernible peak that is overlapped with the specular reflection near q z ≈ 0.22 Å (d ≈ 28.6 Å). This peak is only visible for a single frame before disappearing simultaneously with the appearance of another peak at q z ≈ 0.30 Å (d ≈ 20.9 Å), which remains for ~1 s before transforming into a peak at q z ≈ 0.37 Å (d ≈ 12.6 Å). The three peaks are similar in shape and all oriented along q xy = 0. These d-spacings correspond to (001) diffraction planes of n = 3, 2, and 1 RDPs. In order to more clearly observe these transitions, we took the average of the first three frames of the experiment-which contained diffraction from the 3D perovskite, PbI 2 , and the specular reflection-and subtracted them from all subsequent frames. A contour map of azimuthally integrated GIWAXS patterns and traces near time zero are shown in Fig.  3 . We can see that the subtraction cleanly removes the specular reflection at low q values, evidenced by first pattern in Fig.  3b  which corresponds to the frame before the solvent exposure. Examining the patterns between q z = 0.15-0.45 Å reveals the distinct peak at q z ≈ 0.22 Å in the earliest frames after spinning is initiated, and clearly shows the evolution of n = 3 → 2 → 1 in the first few seconds of spinning. The n = 3 → 2 → 1 transition is most apparent when using the 1 mM VBABr 3:97 IPA:CF solution, but a clear n = 2 → 1 transition is also observed when using 5 mg/mL VBABr in a mixture 1:3 IPA:CB (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). Our experiments thus suggest that for (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 (-FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 films, the transformation from 3D perovskites into RDPs occurs through a progressive reduction of dimensionality, rather than the immediate formation of n = 1. It is possible that even higher n RDPs are formed initially, but the (001) diffraction peaks for these species would be at too low q to be observed in our experiment. Moreover, in such a sequence of reducing dimensionality, we would expect diffraction of larger RDPs to be weaker, since there would initially be few instances of adjacent and periodic high-n RDPs, but once they split into lower-n RDPs, these structures would be immediately adjacent to each other, thus promoting diffraction  21  . Considering the small percentage of bromine in the (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 films, we posit that the difference in the 2D/3D transformation pathways arises due to the greater stability of FAPbI 3 compared to MAPbI 3 , where the latter is known to exhibit poorer thermal stability due to loss of volatile species under thermal stress and is more easily converted to PbI 2  26, 27  . DFT simulations of interface formation and stabilization. In the multication films, we hypothesize that ligand molecules are able to infiltrate into and bisect a part of the 3D surface into highn domains, which undergo further bisection into lower-n RDPs. We illustrate such a process in Fig.  4a . Further studies would be required to probe and confirm more microscopic picture of ligand infiltration and sequential bisection of the 3D lattice, where the terminating cations along the surface are replaced by the ligand molecule. This idea is, however, supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, where we calculated the binding energy of two perovskite fragments at their interfaces while their surfaces are converted from MAI-terminated to VBA-terminated (see Supporting Information for computational methods). These structures are shown in Fig.  4b , and a plot of the binding energy versus number of incorporated VBA molecules is shown in Fig.  4c . The binding energy increases, approximately linearly, with each VBA ligand substituted into the interface, from -0.10 eV for 1 VBA and up to -3.14 eV for 16 VBAs. If we gauge the reaction energies per VBA molecule insertion, the values are in -0.10, -0.11, -0.12, -0.14, and -0.20 eV for the systems with 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 VBA molecules, respectively, showing that the thermodynamics become increasingly favorable due to the π-π stacking of the VBA molecules. We also examined binding energies at the interfaces between a fragment of n = 1 terminated by VBA and a 3D fragment terminated by MA, PbI 2 , and VBA (Fig.  4d ), which we found to be -1.85, -1.84, and -3.06 eV, respectively, again demonstrating the favorable thermodynamics of VBA-VBA compared to other surface terminations of the 3D perovskite. This binding energy likely results from phenyl ring stacking: such interface stabilization via ligand interactions has been noted previously for RDPs using PEA ligands, and was invoked to explain the improved stability of low-n RDPs compared to higher-n and quasi-3D structures  4  . We additionally calculate binding energies considering more commonly used cations butylammonium (BTA) and PEA (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). The binding energies with 16 BTA and PEA molecules are -2.43 and -2.70 eV, respectively. The reaction energies per BTA and PEA insertion are -0.15 and -0.17 eV, respectively, compared to -0.20 eV for VBA. This supports our assertion that extended π-π stacking at the interface makes the interface growth more thermodynamically favorable. Here, we posit that the same ligand interactions are what cause the ligand molecules to bisect the 3D lattice and form an interface between two fragments, and thus drives 2D/3D interface formation. Influence of 2D/3D formation on photovoltaic efficiency. Lastly, we examined the influence of the different ligand solutions on photovoltaic device performance. Devices were fabricated in an n-i-p architecture comprised of ITO/SnO 2 /3D perovskite/ RDPs/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, following refs.  3, 10  . J-V curves for devices with 2D/3D active layers fabricated with different solvent conditions are shown in Fig.  5 . Compared to control (3D-only) devices, the films exposed to 1 mM VBABr that undergo progressive dimensional reduction have higher fill factors (FF), open-circuit voltages (V OC ), and overall higher PCEs. These improvements imparted by the 2D/3D interface, relative to 3D-only films, have been attributed to passivation by the RDPs and more favorable band alignment  3, 9, 10, 12  . The 1 mM VBABr device also outperforms a series of devices exposed to 5 mg/mL VBABr in mixtures of IPA and CB (Fig.  5b ). From this series, we see that decreasing the proportion of IPA leads to increased V OC and J SC , whereas FF remains fairly constant throughout (besides for the pure IPA solution). The increasing J SC with decreasing IPA proportion can partially be attributed to lessened dissolution of the underlying 3D layer when exposed to lower concentrations of IPA, which decreases the amount of 3D perovskite that is lost during the ligand exposure and preserves thicker, more absorptive active layers. This could also contribute to the trend in V OC . However, we posit that the improved photovoltaic metrics are also sensitive to the assembly mechanism of the 2D/3D interface, which we have shown varies with different solvent combinations: when only IPA is used, we observed no intermediate peaks during in situ GIWAXS experiments, and n = 1 RDPs appear to form directly (Supplementary Fig.  3 )-but when CB is included in the ligand solvent, we do observe the n = 2 → 1 transition (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). IPA is the solvent which dissolves both VBABr and the perovskite, whereas the CB or CF antisolvent is included to help prevent dissolution of the perovskite surface. As the transient n = 3 and n = 2 peaks are only observed when CB or CF are included in the ligand solution, this suggests that the CB and CF antisolvent serves the additional function of slowing down the cation substitution reactions-which would require IPA to solvate MA, FA, and VBABr-that are involved with the overall 2D/3D transformation. This would be consistent with the n = 3 → 2 → 1 # of VBA molecules: transition only being observed using a solution containing 1 mM VBABr and 3:97 IPA:CF as the solvent, meaning the 2D/3D transformation proceeds slowest under these conditions, whereas films exposed to 5 mg/mL VBABr in 1:3 IPA:CB undergo faster cation substitution reactions, explaining why only the n = 2 → 1 transition is observed. The combined observations from our in situ GIWAXS experiments and our devices suggest that slower 2D/3D transformations are correlated with improved device performance, since the 1 mM VBABr photovoltaic has the highest V OC , FF, and PCE. This would also be consistent with the trend of increasing V OC and PCE with decreasing amounts of IPA for the solvent series. If we consider the 3D-to-2D transformation as analogous to crystal growth, then slower rates of transformation or crystallization could lead to higher quality RDPs and thinner 2D layers. This may improve the optoelectronic and morphological properties of the RDPs, as has been demonstrated generally for bulk perovskite and RDP thin films used in photovoltaics and LEDs  [28] [29] [30]  . ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""tin dioxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP""}"

Here, we use in situ Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-Ray Scattering to resolve 2D/3D interface formation during spincoating. We observe progressive dimensional reduction from 3D to n = 3 → 2 → 1 when we expose (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 perovskites to vinylbenzylammonium ligand cations. Density functional theory simulations suggest ligands incorporate sequentially into the 3D lattice, driven by phenyl ring stacking, progressively bisecting the 3D perovskite into lowerdimensional fragments to form stable interfaces. Slowing the 2D/3D transformation with higher concentrations of antisolvent yields thinner 2D layers formed conformally onto 3D grains, improving carrier extraction and device efficiency (20% 3D-only, 22% 2D/3D). Controlling this progressive dimensional reduction has potential to further improve the performance of 2D/3D perovskite photovoltaics. 1 Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. 2   The Edward S.

3301,110_11," Shelf-life and operational stability of the PSCs To assess the stability of our PSCs, we measured first their shelf life by storing the unencapsulated devices in the dark at 25 °C and 20% relative humidity. Figure  4a  shows that the PCE of the reference cell decreased by about 35% after 1,000 h aging, whereas the target cell showed a degradation of only 10% over this time. A heat-stability test was also performed by annealing the unencapsulated PSC devices at 60 °C under 20% relative humidity. Figure  4b  shows that the target cell retained around 80% of its initial efficiency after 1,000 h aging, whereas the reference cell retained only about 40%. We further investigated the operational stability of the PSCs by aging the unencapsulated devices under a nitrogen atmosphere, using maximum power point (MPP) tracking under a simulated 1-sun illumination. Figure  4c  shows the PCE of the PSCs under continuous light soaking using a xenon lamp. The PCE of the target cell remained above 24% after 10-h MPP tracking, whereas that of the reference cell decreased to 22.8%. Figure  4d  shows the long-term operational stability of the PSCs. The PCE of the reference cell decreased by about 30%, whereas the target cell only lost around 15% of its initial efficiency. Note that during this experiment the temperature of the PSCs was measured to be around 35 °C, as we did not cool the cells during illumination. Compared to the target PSC, the reference cell showed a considerable decrease in J sc and fill factor over the 450-h MPP tracking test (Extended Data Fig.  7 ), which suggests that reference perovskite layer is less stable. We attribute the decline in fill factor to a de-doping of the hole conductor due to Li + ion migration under illumination  37  . The improvement in thermal and operational stability of the target cell compared with the reference cell is ascribed to the better crystallinity of the perovskite film and a reduced concentration of halide defects, because NMR experiments show that formate is not incorporated into the bulk of the perovskite. It is known that crystallinity is crucial for the stability of the perovskites, because the main degradation process starts from defects near the grain boundaries. The high crystallinity and large grain size of the formate-containing perovskite films-as validated by SEM and XRD measurements-will contribute to their greater stability and performance. Our simulations and calculations suggest that formate anions have the highest binding affinity among all halides and pseudo halides for iodide vacancy sites, and are therefore the best candidates to eliminate the most abundant and deleterious lattice defects present in halide perovskite films. This results in a marked reduction of trap-mediated non-radiative recombination, which we validated by EQE EL , time-resolved photoluminescence, n id , and SCLC measurements. A low level of halide vacancies is beneficial for the stability of solar cells, because halide vacancies can lead to degradation as a result of photoinduced iodine loss, especially under light illumination. Overall, we demonstrate α-FAPbI 3 -based PSCs with a PCE of 25.6% (certified 25.2%) and high stability, achieved through solution processing by introducing 2% formamidinium formate into the FAPbI 3 perovskite precursor solution. Our molecular dynamics simulations, together with solid-state NMR spectroscopy analysis and in-depth optoelectronic device characterization, provide an understanding of the role of HCOO -anions as passivating agents for FAPbI 3 perovskites. Our findings pave the way for facile access to high-performance PSCs approaching their theoretical efficiency limit. ","{""perovskite_composition"": ""formamidine formate"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""formate"", ""humidity"": ""formate"", ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": ""23.92"", ""treated_pce"": ""25.59"", ""control_voc"": ""1.153"", ""treated_voc"": ""1.189"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""formamidine formate"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSD"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""formate"", ""humidity"": ""20"", ""temperature"": ""25"", ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": ""23.92"", ""treated_pce"": ""25.59"", ""control_voc"": ""1.153"", ""treated_voc"": ""1.189"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.9"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.65""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSD"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""20"", ""temperature"": ""60"", ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.8"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.4""}, ""test_3"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""35"", ""time"": ""450"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.85"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.7""}}"
3313,74_5," Charge carrier dynamics and device performance To investigate the carrier dynamics within the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure and with perovskite/HTL stacks, we conducted time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. On glass  substrates, the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure and the 3D/CLP film show longer average carrier lifetimes (τ avg ) (315 ns and 341 ns) than the pristine 3D perovskite (248 ns) (Fig.  3a  and Supplementary Table  4 ). The τ avg of the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure further increases to 423 ns. This is indicative of synergistic passivation from the CLP and 2D perovskite. When a 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) layer was deposited on top of the samples, the 3D perovskite, 3D/2D, 3D/CLP and 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructures show similar τ avg and τ 1 (Fig.  3b ). This indicates efficient charge extraction from the perovskites to the HTL can still be achieved after incorporating the CLP layer in the perovskite heterostructure. Consistent results were also obtained for the steady-state PL spectra (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). Space charge-limited current spectra  [57] [58] [59]  of the perovskite heterostructures show that the 3D/2D and 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructures generate current densityvoltage (J-V) curves with similar shapes and comparable current values (Supplementary Figs.  11  and 12 ) for both electron-only and hole-only devices. By fitting the linear regions, the electron and hole mobilities of the 3D/CLP/2D heterostructure are similar compared with that of the 3D perovskite or 3D/2D heterostructure. Thus, the CLP layer has not hindered the transport of either the electrons or the holes within the heterostructures. We conducted ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis) measurements to estimate the energy levels of the perovskite heterostructures (Supplementary Fig.  13 ).

The 2D perovskite 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4 possesses a much larger bandgap of 2.36 eV and forms type-I band alignment with the 3D perovskite  60  . The close valence band maximum position of the 3D and 2D perovskites do not hinder the transport of holes from the 3D perovskite layer to the HTL  10, 11  , while the higher conduction band minimum of the 2D perovskite than the 3D perovskite acts as an electron-blocking layer, effectively preventing the recombination of electrons in the perovskite and holes in the HTL for the 3D/2D and 3D/CLP/2D heterostructures  10, 13  . This favourable band alignment contributes to the enhanced V OC of as-fabricated cells, and the selection of 4F-PEAI is discussed in Supplementary Note 4. To avoid the instability issues associated with metal electrodes  36, 61, 62  , we prepared carbon electrodes based on the screen-printing technique (Supplementary Fig.  14 ) to fabricate PSCs with a device architecture of ITO/SnO 2 /3D/CLP/2D/spiro-OMeTAD/ carbon. We optimized the concentration of the CLP solution and found that the CLP layer prepared with a concentration of 3 mg ml -1 delivered the optimal cell efficiency (Fig.  3d ). We fabricated cells using 3D perovskite, 3D/2D, 3D/CLP and 3D/CLP/2D heterostructures as the light-absorbing layers, and the distribution of efficiencies is presented in Fig.  3e , Supplementary Table  5  and Supplementary Fig.  15 . The cells based on 3D perovskite achieve an average efficiency of 18.83%. The average efficiencies of devices based on 3D/2D and 3D/CLP heterostructures are improved to 19.81% and 19.91%, respectively. The cells based on the 3D/CLP/2D heterostructure deliver an average efficiency of 20.29%. The efficiency improvement mainly results from the enhanced V OC , which is attributed to the synergistic passivation effect of the CLP and 2D perovskite. Figure  3f  shows the representative J-V curves of the cells. For the champion 3D/CLP/2D cell, we achieve a high efficiency of 21.2% with a V OC of 1.13 V, a current density (J SC ) of 24.00 mA cm -2 and a FF of 0.78 for carbon-electrode-based PSCs (Supplementary Table  6 ). The steady-state power output (SPO) efficiency of the cell reaches ~20.87% (Supplementary Fig.  16 ). The external quantum efficiency spectrum of the 3D/CLP/2D PSC shows an integrated short-circuit current density of 23.34 mA cm -2 (Fig.  3g ), which is in agreement with the J-V scanning result. We further fabricated a PSM with six sub-cells in series, as shown in Fig.  3h  and Supplementary Fig.  17 . The champion PSM based on the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure with a carbon electrode and an aperture area of 17.1 cm 2 achieves a PCE of 19.6% with V OC of 6.73 V, short-circuit current of 66.2 mA and FF of 0.751. Furthermore, it exhibits SPO efficiency of 19.1% under a bias voltage of 5.5 V for 100 s (Fig.  3i ).

3315,74_7," Device stability To study operational stability, we monitored the cell performance under MPP tracking conditions and continuous one-sun illumination at 60 °C (Supplementary Fig.  19 ). The estimated T 90 lifetime of the 3D/2D PSC is 560 h. The PSC based on the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure maintains ~92% of the initial efficiency after 1,000 hours under continuous illumination. According to time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) of these 1,000 h-aged cells, the diffusion of iodide ions from the perovskite layer to the spiro-OMeTAD layer is effectively suppressed in the 3D/CLP/2D PSC (Supplementary Fig.  20 ). Combined with the XPS depth profiling (Supplementary Fig.  21 ), we find that the CLP layer and 2D perovskite synergistically contribute to the suppressed diffusion of iodide. To eliminate the negative effect of spiro-OMeTAD on the cell stability and verify the stability of the perovskite heterostructures, we carry out four repairing cycles of the cell by re-depositing the spiro-OMeTAD layer. The cell maintains ~90% of the initial efficiency after 5,000 h continuous operation (Fig.  4a ). The cell performance recovery indicates that the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure is highly stable against light and heat stress. Furthermore, a more stable poly(3-hexylthiophene)-spiro-OMeTAD (P3HT-spiro-OMeTAD) (3:1 w/w) mixed HTL is adopted to replace the unstable spiro-OMeTAD  12  .

3339,68_31," Reply: We value the efforts of the referee and appreciate his supportive recommendation We added in the manuscript: ""Note, the hysteresis did not increase in the course of aging."" The area of thin-film photovoltaics has been overwhelmed by organometal halide perovskites. Unfortunately, serious stability concerns arise with perovskite solar cells. For example, methyl-ammonium lead iodide is known to decompose in the presence of water and, more severely, even under inert conditions at elevated temperatures. Here, we demonstrate inverted perovskite solar cells, in which the decomposition of the perovskite is significantly mitigated even at elevated temperatures. Specifically, we introduce a bilayered electronextraction interlayer consisting of aluminium-doped zinc oxide and tin oxide. We evidence tin oxide grown by atomic layer deposition does form an outstandingly dense gas permeation barrier that effectively hinders the ingress of moisture towards the perovskite and-more importantly-it prevents the egress of decomposition products of the perovskite. Thereby, the overall decomposition of the perovskite is significantly suppressed, leading to an outstanding device stability.

NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8:13938 | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms13938 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications S olar cells based on organolead halide perovskites have seen tremendous progress over the past 5 years 1 . Although their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has skyrocketed to reach a level of 420% (ref.  2 ), concerns about their stability are still intimately linked to this technology  [3] [4] [5]  . Generally, there is consensus that perovskites like CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 decompose to their constituents, that is, HI, CH 3 NH 2 and PbI 2 , in the presence of water  6  . Moreover, the intrinsic decomposition of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 to CH 3 NH 3 I and PbI 2 , which is thermally activated and which occurs even under inert conditions, states a more fundamental problem  7, 8  . At the same time, there are secondary effects of perovskite decomposition such as the degradation of functional building blocks in the solar cell because of the corrosive effect of the perovskite decomposition products  9  . Specifically, the corrosion of metal electrodes like Ag or Al has been identified to be a critical issue  10  . Overall, without proper concepts to overcome these reliability issues, the prospects of wide-spread application and commercialization of organolead halide perovskite technology may be significantly compromised. Among the various device architectures for perovskite solar cells, the inverted planar geometry has been shown to yield devices essentially free of hysteresis  11, 12  . Here, the photogenerated holes are extracted via the bottom electrode using a hole-extraction interlayer (for example, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)), while the electron extraction proceeds via the top electrode. The energetic alignment of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 and [6,6 0 ]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) has been shown to be especially favourable for the extraction of electrons from the conduction band of the perovskite  13  . To overcome the stability issues discussed above, several groups have introduced inverted planar perovskite cells based on metal oxides as electronand hole-extraction interfacial layers adjacent to the cathode and anode, respectively  14, 15  . Chen et al.  15  employed a sol-gel Ti(Nb)O x electron-extraction layer that was aimed to protect the perovskite against moisture from ambient atmosphere. Because of its poor electrical conductivity of 10 À 5 S cm -1 , the authors had to limit the thickness of the sol-gel Ti(Nb)O x to 10 nm. Moreover, it is known that sol-gel-derived layers state only relatively poor permeation barriers  16  . As a result, the device stability tests that afforded a lifetime of 1,000 h were done with additional encapsulation. Kaltenbrunner et al.  17  have used Cr 2 O 3 /Cr at the cathode side to protect the metal cathode and thereby to improve the stability under ambient conditions, but still the efficiency was found to drop to 80% of its initial value after only 28 h. Very recently, Guerrero et al.  18  confirmed the protective effect of the Cr 2 O 3 /Cr interlayer but still found some severe degradation after only a few hours. You et al.  14  have shown that devices based on indium tin oxide (ITO)/NiO/perovskite/ZnO/Al were stable for tens of days in ambient conditions, whereas a reference device based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/Al showed severe degradation within half a day. Especially, the ZnO layer, which has been spin coated from a nanoparticle dispersion on top of the perovskite, has been claimed to protect the Al electrode against corrosion. Very recently, Bush et al.  19  have found that in their devices a similar nanoparticle-based ZnO layer next to the cathode did not provide any sufficient protection at elevated temperatures. As solar cells in outdoor conditions may reach a temperature significantly above 25 °C, the latter result appears to be extremely relevant. Other reports have evidenced rapid decomposition of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 when in direct contact with ZnO  20  . Here we propose an inverted cell architecture, where a bilayered aluminium-doped ZnO (AZO)/tin oxide (SnO x ) electron-extraction layer (EEL) affords perovskite solar cells with a remarkable resilience against moisture and heat. AZO is excellently suited to extract electrons from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of fullerenes  21  . However, the nanoparticlebased AZO layer does not provide sufficient protection against the ingress of moisture or the egress of perovskite decomposition products. Thus, we add a thin SnO x layer to form a bilayered AZO/SnO x EEL assembly. The SnO x is grown by low-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 80 °C that affords extremely dense, conformal and pinhole-free layers. Please note that there are reports where ALD layers have been directly deposited on top of perovskites to improve their resilience against ambient atmosphere and heat  22  . However, these ALD layers were not a functional part of a device, and therefore most of the experiments were based on electrical insulators like Al 2 O 3 . SnO x layers grown by ALD are optically highly transparent, electrically conductive and provide outstanding gas permeation barrier properties with a water vapour transmission rate as low as 7 Â 10 À 5 g (m À 2 day À 1 ), even when grown at a low temperature  23  . Their water vapour transmission rate is orders of magnitude better than that of sputtered ITO thin films or that of solution processed metal oxide layers. The electrical conductivity of the SnO x layer on the order of 5 Â 10 À 3 S cm À 1 allows us to place it between the sensitive electrode and the photoactive layers without adding any noticeable series resistance. Thereby, the SnO x provides outstanding protection of the perovskite against the ingress of moisture and, more importantly, at the same time it serves as permeation barrier against the out-diffusion of decomposition products of the perovskite. We will show that the sealing property of the SnO x layer contains the decomposition products inside the cell and, thereby, the overall decomposition of the perovskite is significantly suppressed. Although cells based on LiF/Al or AZO degrade within tens of hours in ambient air (23 °C and 50% relative humidity (rH)), devices based on AZO/SnO x show superior stability of their solar cell characteristics even on a timescale of 4350 h. More strikingly, at 60 °C under inert atmosphere, AZO-based devices degrade within 100 h because of thermally induced decomposition of the perovskite. On the contrary, the suppressed out-diffusion of decomposition products because of the diffusion-barrier properties of the AZO/SnO x EEL affords cells that are essentially unchanged even after 41,000 h under the same conditions. Our paper reports a general strategy to achieve a substantially improved device lifetime in the case of photoactive materials that may come with concerns about their intrinsic compositional stability. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TinOxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}"
3340,68_32," Results Planar inverted cells. The devices used in this study are based on a planar inverted cell layout, where the holes are extracted via the bottom electrode (substrate electrode). The layer sequence is shown in Fig.  1 . As hole-extraction layer, PEDOT:PSS is used, whereas for electron extraction a 100 nm thick PCBM layer is deposited on top of the typically 180 nm thick CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite layer. Directly adjacent to the PCBM we have used a 100 nm thick AZO layer prepared from a nanoparticle dispersion in isopropylalcohol. In some cells, a SnO x layer is deposited on top of the AZO layer by ALD at 80 °C to form the bilayered electron-extraction assembly (AZO/SnO x ). The nominal thickness of the SnO x layer is 20 nm. As the AZO layer is derived from a nanoparticle dispersion, it contains pores that are partially coated with SnO x because of the conformal nature of the ALD process. A more detailed discussion of the SnO x growth on top of the AZO layer is provided in the Supplementary Fig.  1 . Please note that we have also prepared devices with SnO x deposited directly on top of PCBM, but the stability of the resulting devices was inferior to that of the AZO/SnO x cells (see discussion below). Reference devices based on ITO/PED-OT:PSS/Perovskite/PCBM/LiF/Al have also been included in our study. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of a typical AZO/SnO x -based perovskite solar cell is shown in Fig.  1b . The J/V characteristics of the device measured in forward and reverse direction (scan speed: 500 mV s À 1 ) are presented in Fig.  1c . No substantial hysteresis is found in the J/V data. The extracted characteristics V oc ¼ 0.95 V, FF ¼ 74% and a J sc ¼ 18 mA cm À 2 result in a PCE of 12.8%. We want to note that the perovskite precursor used in this study was commercially obtained from Ossila Ltd with a typically specified efficiency in the range of 11-13% (see Methods for details). Significantly higher PCEs can be achieved by using, for example, optimized precursor inks or mixed-cation/mixedhalide perovskite absorbers  24  . As the EEL is in the core of this report, further optimization of the perovskite system itself was considered to be beyond the scope here. Stability in ambient air. A very striking advantage of the bilayered AZO/SnO x EEL in direct comparison with AZO is displayed in Fig.  2 . Here, the stability of the cell characteristics is shown for devices that were continuously exposed to ambient air at 23 °C and 50% relative humidity. The devices that were based on a single layer of AZO as EEL degrade swiftly within B50 h. A severe decay of the FF from B70% to o25% and a concomitant drop of the J sc from B17 to 8.2 mA cm À 2 is found. Opposed to that, the characteristics of the corresponding cells with the bilayered EEL of AZO/SnO x do not show any degradation even after 4300 h in air. Note that the thickness of the SnO x layer is only 20 nm in these devices. There is a slight increase of the V oc in the AZO/SnO x samples that happens on a timescale of several tens of hours. This increase is only observed in the AZO/SnO x samples, as the LiF/Al and the AZO cells already undergo strong degradation on the same timescale. A similar increase of V oc on such a long timescale has been seen by other authors and it has been explained by an ageing effect that reduces the density of trap states in the perovskite  25  . As a reference, the cells based on LiF/Al are essentially degraded within B1 day. In order to analyse the reasons underlying the strikingly different degradation phenomena shown in Fig.  2 , we have performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies of the respective device structures. Note that in case of the XPS measurements, a thinner top Ag electrode was chosen (10 nm) compared with the actual solar cells (100 nm) because of the small probing depth of the technique. Looking first at the AZO-based device, the XRD spectrum shows the (110) and (220) reflections of tetragonal MAPbI 3 at angles of 14.11°and 28.14, respectively. As this XRD measurement has been made on a full device stack, further signals related to the Ag and ITO electrodes are visible. A detailed assignment of these peaks is shown in the Supplementary Fig.  3 . Only a very weak signal due to PbI 2 was found that did not significantly increase even after 7 days in air (Fig.  3a ). Thus, no severe decomposition of the perovskite to PbI 2 upon storage in air can be inferred from the XRD data. On the other hand, when XPS was used to look for degradation products on the surface, a notable amount of iodine was evidenced on the AZO sample (Fig.  3b ) after exposure to air for 2 days, whereas on identical samples kept in nitrogen no such iodine signal is found. Please note that the peak of B622 eV in the XPS spectrum of the aged AZO cell does not represent another bonding state of the iodine, but it is rather a so-called shake-up peak. Such shake-up peaks are commonly observed in strong XPS signals. The survey XPS spectra can be found in the Supplementary Fig.  4 . Plan-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the AZO samples aged in air show the formation of spot-like degradation motifs (Fig.  3c, d ). These spots point to the local ingress of moisture and out-diffusion of decomposition products of the perovskite, supported by the appearance of the iodine signal in XPS. In the degraded spots, needle-like features occur. Similar features have been reported for Ag electrodes corroded by the decomposition products of MAPbI 3 (ref. 26). Our findings are also in line with the results of Kato et al.  10  who unveiled a moisture promoted corrosion mechanism of Ag which resulted in the formation of products like AgI. The role of water in the electrode corrosion is further clarified below in cells aged under inert conditions. To explain the spot-like degradation, we can assume that structural defects, such as pinholes, in the AZO NP layer would give rise to locally enhanced water permeation. Opposed to that, the sample with the bilayered EEL of AZO/SnO x does not show any sign of degradation in SEM (Fig.  3e ) under identical conditions. In XPS, only a negligible amount of iodine at the surface of the AZO/SnO x samples can be detected. For comparison, we have also studied layer stacks where only SnO x , that is, without AZO between the PCBM and the SnO x , has been used as EEL. We have recently shown that SnO x with a work function of 4.1 eV forms an excellent EEL layer in inverted organic solar cells  27  . Here, the resulting perovskite solar cells based on SnO x were more stable than the devices based on AZO. However, they showed a statistical failure on a timescale of 100 h (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). This finding could be explained by a nonideal ALD growth of the SnO x directly on top of the organic PCBM layer. ALD as a chemical deposition technique relies on self-limiting chemical reactions on the sample surface  28  . For the ALD deposition of oxide layers, -OH surface groups form the nucleation sites for layer growth. In this sense, on organic surfaces like PCBM the nucleation of an ALD layer may deviate significantly from the growth on a surface rich of -OH groups  29  . Therefore, we can assume that the SnO x layer grown on PCBM is not free of some pin-hole defects that compromise its functionality as diffusion barrier. Consequently, substantially more iodine is detected on the surface after exposure to air compared with the AZO/SnO x device (Fig.  3b ). Thus, we conclude that the AZO serves two purposes in the bilayered AZO/SnO x EEL: (1) its electronic structure has been shown to facilitate electron extraction from the PCBM (ref. 21) and (2)  the AZO layer provides an improved (oxide-) surface for the nucleation of the subsequent SnO x ALD layer that can thus from a dense, pin-hole-free permeation barrier. Figure  3f ,g shows schemes portraying the specific differences between AZO and AZO/SnO x as EEL in devices exposed to air. As indicated before, the AZO layer prepared from the NP dispersion does not provide a significant diffusion barrier against the local ingress of moisture from the ambient air. As a result, decomposition of the MAPbI 3 perovskite occurs and yields iodine-based products that migrate to the surface. In the case of AZO/SnO x , substantially better moisture barrier properties prevent the penetration of water. The claim of superior moisture barrier properties of the bilayered AZO/SnO x EEL compared with that of the AZO NP layer is also supported by Ca-corrosion tests (Supplementary Fig.  6 ). It has to be noted that the detrimental effects of ambient air could in principle be avoided by using a proper encapsulation of the entire solar cell. However, the out-diffusion of decomposition products from the perovskite and the degradation of the metal electrode (Fig.  3c, d ) may impose a more fundamental issue. This is even more important, as earlier reports evidenced the thermally activated decomposition of the MAPbI 3 perovskite even under inert atmosphere  7  . Stability at elevated temperatures. To study the long-term stability of our solar cells under inert conditions, we have stored a set of devices in a glove box under N 2 atmosphere. All the devices were placed on a hot plate at 60 °C and their characteristics were measured repeatedly. Most remarkably, the characteristics of devices based on AZO EELs degraded on a timescale of 100 h (Fig.  4 ). Although the J sc and V oc of these devices remain fairly stable, the decay of the FF results in the severe drop of PCE to B2% after 360 h. The degradation motif in the AZO-based cells is essentially different from that found in ambient air, where all cell characteristics decayed within a day (Fig.  2 ). Again in striking contrast, the characteristics of devices based on the bilayered AZO/SnO x EEL remain almost unchanged even after 1,032 h. Note that the hysteresis did not increase in the course of ageing. To unravel the mechanisms behind these results, we have again performed XRD and XPS studies of the respective device structures. After heating the device stacks for 6 days under inert atmosphere, the XRD spectrum of the AZO samples reveals a significant signal due to PbI 2 that is absent in pristine stacks (Fig.  5a ). The formation of PbI 2 indicates the thermally activated decomposition of the perovskite upon heating, in agreement with earlier reports  7  . Opposed to that, the devices based on the bilayered AZO/SnO x EEL do not show any signature of a PbI 2 phase after identical ageing conditions (Fig.  5b ). The formation of PbI 2 in the AZO samples is in contrast to the degradation experiments in air, where no PbI 2 phase in the AZO samples was found in XRD (Fig.  3a ). At the same time, the I3d 5/2 XPS spectra (Fig.  5c ) do not reveal any significant increase of the amount of iodine at the surface of any of the samples aged in N 2 . Please note that the noise in the XPS spectra indicates that the concentration of I3d 5/2 at the surface of all the samples is close to the detection limit and variations between the samples are within the measurement error. A plan-view SEM image of the aged AZO samples does not reveal any degradation of the Ag electrode, in contrast to the experiment where the ageing took place in air (Fig.  3c, d ). Thus, we conclude that in the case of AZO, volatile decomposition products of the MAPbI 3 perovskite evaporate from the cell stack without degradation of the Ag electrode. In air, other than in N 2 , the presence of water would promote the corrosion of Ag because of CH 3 NH 3 I and other halide compounds  10  . However, the loss of CH 3 NH 3 I etc. drives the further decomposition of the perovskite. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TinOxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""CH3NH3PbI3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TinOxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""PEDOT:PSS"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""methylammonium lead iodide"", ""humidity"": ""50"", ""temperature"": ""23"", ""time"": ""4300"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""12.8"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""1"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSLT"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""60"", ""time"": ""1032"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.99"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0""}}"
3361,1_10," Device fabrication and characterization Keeping in mind that PEAI can efficiently passivate the surface defects in the perovskite layer, we fabricated devices with the structure ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au 8,24 (ITO: indium tin oxide; spiro-OMeTAD: 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-dipmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene). The thicknesses of the electron transport layer SnO 2 , the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer spiro-OMeTAD were about 40 nm, 800 nm and 250 nm, respectively (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). The dependence of the device performance on the PEAI concentration (Fig.  3a , Supplementary Fig.  8  and Supplementary Table  2 ) shows that the PCE jumped significantly when the perovskite films were treated with a low concentration of PEAI solution, and the PCE reached a maximum at 20 mM of PEAI. For this best condition, the mass thickness of the PEAI is about 16 nm when deposited on a smooth silicon substrate (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). It is noted that several tens of nanometres of PEAI films deposited on a very rough perovskite surface (roughness = 32 nm, Supplementary Fig.  2 ) via a solution process cannot be conformal, and the resulting PEAI film should be discontinuous or thin enough for charge transport (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). While the device performance began to drop at high PEAI loading even the recombination rate was low (Supplementary Fig.  6 ), which could be due to the highly insulating properties of PEAI. The typical J-V curve of the device with PEAI (20 mM) and without PEAI treatment is shown in Fig.  3b . It can be seen that the J SC remains almost the same, while V OC substantially increases compared with the control device. We also observed that the hysteresis can be eliminated when the perovskite surface is treated with PEAI. Both the improvement of device performance and elimination of hysteresis could be related to the reduction of the surface defects, which can result in suppression of charge recombination and also charge accumulation  20  . We tested the device performance when the the PEAI layer was processed at different temperatures and found that the device performance degraded while thermal annealing the PEAI layer (Supplementary Fig.  11  and Supplementary Table  3 ). This is consistent with the PL results (Fig.  2a, b ), confirming that the PEAI itself has a better passivation effect for perovskite layer. We also screened several organic iodine salts for perovskite surface treatment and found that the device performance either showed no significant enhancement or inferior performance compared with the control device (Supplementary Fig.  12  and Supplementary Table  4 ). After optimization of the PEAI-treated device, we obtained the best device with an efficiency of 23.56%, a V OC as high as 1.16 V, a J SC of 24.9 mA cm -2 and a fill factor (FF) of 81.4% (Fig.  3c ), and there is almost no hysteresis for the device (Supplementary Fig.  13  and Supplementary Table  5 ). The steady output for the best device shows a quasi-steady output of 23.2%, while for the device without PEAI, the output is 21.3% (Supplementary Fig.  14 ). The integrated current density from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) is 24.5 mA cm -2 (Fig.  3d ), which is almost in agreement with the measurement from the solar simulator in this study. In addition, according to the EQE decrease to half the peak value and the differential of the EQE  40  , it can be estimated that the absorption threshold is 1.53 eV. This value is consistent with the result from the differential of absorption (Supplementary Fig.  15 ). The statistics of the PCE distribution confirm the reproducibility of our results and that the PEAI treatment can undoubtedly improve the performance of PSCs (Supplementary Fig.  16 ). We sent the best device to an accredited laboratory (Newport, USA) for certification. The devices showed 23.32% certificated efficiency with a V OC of 1.18 V, J SC of 25.2 mA cm -2 and FF of 78.4% (Supplementary Figs.  17  and 18 ). Furthermore, it is noted that the certificated efficiency obtained here is the quasi-steady-state efficiency  41  . In this new measurement standard, the J-V parameters were measured under a 13-point IV sweep configuration wherein the bias voltage (current for V OC determination) is held constant until the measured current (voltage for V OC ) is determined to be unchanging at the 0.03% level. This is intended to represent the quasi-steady-state performance of the device. We tested the device response under different light intensities (Supplementary Fig.  19 ). We found that both the control and PEAItreated devices show a linear J SC versus light intensity relationship (Supplementary Fig.  19c ). This indicates that carriers can transport smoothly in the device and that there is no obvious charge barrier induced at the interface even though insulating PEAI was introduced. The relationship between V OC and light intensity is also plotted (Fig.  4a ). It can be seen that the control device shows a slope of 1.88k B T/q, while PEAI-treated devices show a much smaller slope  ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""HC(NH 2 ) 2 -CH 3 NH 3"", ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""phenethylammonium"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""23.32"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""TinOxide"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""phenethylammonium"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""23.32"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.16"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
3374,130_5,"The surfaces were modeled by a periodic slab consisting of perovskite layers, separated by at least 15-20 Å of vacuum in the surface normal direction. To calculate the surface energy of the slabs along 100 and 111 of FAPbI3 with and without the organic amidinium cations (PAd, BAd, and PRd) we considered the following method. We first calculate the cleavage energy of the clean surface generated from the bulk FAPbI3 𝜎 𝑐𝑙𝑣 = 1 2 [𝐺 𝑠𝑙𝑎𝑏 𝑢𝑟𝑙 -𝑁𝐺 𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘 + ∑ 𝑛 𝑖 𝜇 𝑖 ] 𝑖 . Here, 𝐺 𝑠𝑙𝑎𝑏 𝑢𝑟𝑙 is the energy of the unrelaxed slab, 𝐺 𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘 = 𝜇 𝐹𝐴 + 𝜇 𝑃𝑏 + 3𝜇 𝐼 is the energy per unit formula of the bulk FAPbI3. 𝜇 𝐹𝐴 , 𝜇 𝑃𝑏 and 𝜇 𝐼 are the chemical potentials of FA, Pb and I, respectively. 𝑛 𝑖 is the number of FA, Pb and I appropriately removed from or added to the reservoir to create the slab. The relaxation energy of the cleaved surface is then calculated from 𝜎 𝑟𝑙𝑥 = 𝐺 𝑠𝑙𝑎𝑏 𝑟𝑙𝑥 -𝐺 𝑠𝑙𝑎𝑏 𝑢𝑟𝑙 , where 𝐺 𝑠𝑙𝑎𝑏 𝑟𝑙𝑥 is the energy of the relaxed perovskite slab. Surface energy is calculated from 𝛾 = (𝜎 𝑟𝑙𝑥 + 𝜎 𝑐𝑙𝑣 )/𝐴, where 𝐴 is the area of the slab surface. For the case of slabs with molecular cations, we first cleaved the perovskite, to generate the slab, and incorporated the cation over the surface and then relaxed the cation over the surface while fixing the atomic positions of the slab. We later performed a full relaxation over the relaxed-cation and slab system to calculate the relaxation energy and then the surface energy. Supplementary Fig.  10  showed the slabs for perovskite (100) and (111) planes with PAd, and the reduction in their surface energies compared with the control.

Notes: In this case, the width of P2 lines and P3 lines was 200 μm and 100 μm respectively, and the geometric fill factor (GFF) was around 0.90. The black phase of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) perovskite shows huge promise as an efficient photovoltaic, but it is not favoured energetically at room temperature, meaning that the undesirable yellow phases are always present alongside it during crystallization  [1] [2] [3] [4]  . This problem has made it difficult to formulate the fast crystallization process of perovskite and develop guidelines governing the formation of black-phase FAPbI 3 (refs. 5,6). Here we use in situ monitoring of the perovskite crystallization process to report an oriented nucleation mechanism that can help to avoid the presence of undesirable phases and improve the performance of photovoltaic devices in different film-processing scenarios. The resulting device has a demonstrated power-conversion efficiency of 25.4% (certified 25.0%) and the module, which has an area of 27.83 cm 2 , has achieved an impressive certified aperture efficiency of 21.4%. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.4"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
3376,130_7," Oriented nucleation in formamidinium perovskite for photovoltaics Pengju FAPbI 3 has an impressive bandgap and thermal resistance, and has therefore emerged as the most promising candidate perovskite for use as a photovoltaic device  [1] [2] [3] 7, 8  . However, the photoactive black phase of FAPbI 3 is not energetically favoured at room temperature  4, 9, 10  . Polytype formation and the presence of other intermediate non-photoactive phases can readily occur, which undermines its photovoltaic performance. Several approaches have been developed to promote the formation of black-phase FAPbI 3 at room temperature, such as adduct formation with PbI 2 and solvent engineering using ionic liquids  11, 12  . Unfortunately, the fast crystallization kinetics of FAPbI 3 perovskites precludes in-depth investigations of its film-formation processes  5, 6  . The microscale mechanism of its phase evolution during crystallization has yet to be unambiguously defined  13, 14  . This lack of information has hampered the development of more-rational and targeted design of film-processing methods for efficient FAPbI 3 perovskite absorbers, especially for different film-processing scenarios, such as one-step and two-step film-deposition protocols and small-and large-area devices  [15] [16] [17] [18]  . A strategy to promote the formation of black-phase FAPbI 3 in one processing scenario usually fails when applied to other situations. In this study we observed an oriented nucleation mechanism that originated from the reduced surface energy of a specific crystallographic plane, and this enabled us to avoid the yellow phase of FAPbI 3 and governed the formation of black-phase FAPbI 3 . We verified the mechanism for different film-deposition methods and found it could be applied to improve the performance of both small-area devices and solar modules. In a two-step deposition protocol for perovskite films, in which the PbI 2 and organo-halide precursors were deposited sequentially, intermediate non-photoactive phases were always observed at room temperature. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the deposited perovskite film at room temperature showed diffraction peaks corresponding to the (100) planes of the black phase, accompanied by diffraction peaks of the the hexagonal perovskite polytype 2H and 6H intermediate phases (Fig.  1a ). When pentanamidine hydrochloride (PAD) was incorporated in the precursor of the organic cations, the intermediate phases were eliminated. Density-functional theory calculations and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to investigate how PAD interacts with the Pb-I framework. As modelled in Fig.  1b , the positively charged amidinium head of PAD was able to anchor into the octahedral cavity of the black-phase perovskite by means of electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. Peak shifts of the C=N and N-H vibration could be seen in the FTIR spectra of PAD after mixing with PbI 2 , confirming the strong interaction between PAD and the Pb-I framework through the amidinium unit (Extended Data Fig.  1 ). This interaction exposed the hydrophobic alkyl chain of PAD such that it was stacked in an ordered manner on the black-phase perovskite (100) plane. As a result, compared with the other planes, the surface energy of the perovskite (100) plane was decreased the most (it fell by 64% from 3.16 to 1.14 eV) when the plane was terminated by PAD (see Supplementary Note 1 for details of the calculation and the variations in surface energy of different crystallographic planes).

The reduced dimension of the perovskite phase evidenced the extremely low surface energy of the (100) plane. This thermodynamic driving force led to the preferential formation of the (100) orientation of black-phase perovskite, which determined the crystallization texture and promoted the formation of black-phase perovskite crystals. By contrast, the relatively even energy profile of the phase transformation process without PAD resulted in the coexistence of several phases and orientations (Fig.  1c ). We used synchrotron-based multimodal in situ probes to analyse the crystallization of perovskites from the precursors and to verify the oriented nucleation mechanism. The details of the measurements and film-processing procedures are shown in Supplementary Note 2. In situ grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements revealed that the perovskite nucleated when the formamidinium iodide solution was dropped onto pre-deposited PbI 2 ; this could be seen by the emergence of the perovskite (100) diffraction peak (Fig.  2a ). During the spin-coating process, the peak intensity of the (100) plane gradually increased, which we describe as a nucleation stage in which the disappearance, formation and growth of the nuclei take place concurrently. The subsequent annealing step led to a rapid rise in the intensity of the (100) peak, indicating a fast crystal growth process. During the nucleation stage, the control perovskite film showed diffraction peaks corresponding to multiple intermediate phases, whereas the film using PAD featured a clean (100) diffraction pattern of black-phase perovskite. This finding indicates that incorporating PAD suppressed the formation of yellow phases from the start of the nucleation process. Notably, the control film had a faster increase in the (100) peak intensity during the nucleation stage than that with PAD, indicating that PAD led to delayed nucleation kinetics. This slower nucleation may be attributed to the strong interaction of PAD with the Pb-I framework, because the formamidinium had to compete with PAD to interact with the Pb-I, slowing down the reaction. The in situ azimuth angle mapping was extracted from the GIXRD patterns of the perovskite (100) plane during the nucleation stage (Fig.  2b ). The azimuth angle showed a broad distribution ranging approximately from 60° to 120°, indicating that the control sample had a fairly random crystallographic orientation. However, a sharp peak centred at the azimuth angle of 90° was observed when PAD was incorporated, and the half-peak width remained as small as around 8°. These findings verified that there is a nucleation stage with a preferred out-of-plane orientation along the (100) facet, which we described as an oriented nucleation mechanism. We studied the proposed mechanism further by varying the length of the alkyl chain attached to the organic amidinium cation, thereby modulating the effect on the surface energy. Butylamidine hydrochloride (BAD) and propionamidine hydrochloride (PRD), which have shorter alkyl chains than PAD, were investigated. Calculations based on density-functional theory revealed an increase in the surface energy of the perovskite (100) plane as the alkyl chain became shorter (Extended Data Fig.  2 ). The (100) plane that terminated with PRD, BAD or PAD, which featured an increasingly elongated and exposed organic tail and thus increased hydrophobicity, had a calculated surface energy of 1.57, 1.20 and 1.14 eV nm -2 , respectively. In situ GIXRD measurements revealed that both BAD and PRD suppressed the formation of intermediate photo-inactive phases during the nucleation stage (Extended Data Fig.  3 ). However, the in situ azimuth angle mapped during the nucleation stage demonstrated different levels of oriented nucleation as the surface energy varied (Extended Data Fig.  4 ). Because adding PAD provided the lowest surface energy of the perovskite (100) plane, it induced the most-oriented nucleation of the three additives. Despite the ability of BAD and PRD to induce more-oriented nucleation than the control sample, they resulted in broader azimuth-angle distributions than did PAD. These observations demonstrated that the oriented nucleation and the promoted formation of black-phase perovskite were governed by the surface energy of perovskite (100) plane. In situ photoluminescence measurements provided further evidence of the sluggish nucleation kinetics. The evolution of the photoluminescence spectra of the perovskite films during the nucleation stage is shown in Fig.  2c . Without PAD, a photoluminescence peak at 770 nm rose rapidly, which we attribute to the photoactive perovskite phase. With PAD in the precursor solution, the photoluminescence peak appeared at 760 nm with delayed kinetics. The slight blue-shift in the photoluminescence peak could be attributed to the smaller size of the nuclei, which could either lead to compressive lattice strain or induce stronger quantum confinement (Extended Data Fig.  5 ). This in turn provided evidence of the slower nucleation kinetics in perovskite films with PAD. Sluggish nucleation kinetics were also observed for BAD and PRD (Extended Data Fig.  6 ), but to a lesser extent than for PAD, further confirming the important role of surface energy in regulating the crystallization. The strong interaction between the inorganic framework of the perovskite and the PAD cation lowered the surface energy of the (100) plane, leading to slower nucleation kinetics with preferred crystallographic orientation. This oriented nucleation mechanism governed the subsequent crystal growth step, which also followed the preferred orientation along the (100) facet  19  (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). The resulting perovskite film exhibited higher crystallinity and conductivity, as indicated by the increased intensity of the XRD patterns and by conductive atomic-force-microscopy measurements, respectively (Supplementary Figs.  3  and 4 ). The film also had larger grain sizes as a result of the slower nucleation (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). The enhanced photoluminescence intensity and prolonged photoluminescence lifetime of the PAD-based perovskite film indicated that there were fewer non-radiative recombination sites (Extended Data Fig.  7 ). We investigated the incorporation of PAD in a one-step deposition protocol and observed the elimination of the yellow phase. As revealed by the in situ XRD measurements, a mixture of intermediate phases appeared with the black-phase perovskite during crystallization in the absence of PAD (Fig.  3a ). By contrast, incorporating PAD eliminated all the intermediate phases, leading to a single diffraction feature apparent from the (100) plane of black-phase perovskite (Fig.  3b ). In situ photoluminescence measurements of the perovskite films with and without PAD were performed (Supplementary Note 3). The evolution profiles of the photoluminescence peak positions and photoluminescence intensity with time are shown in Fig.  3c, d , respectively. In the control sample, we observed a turning point (highlighted by the red dashed area in Fig.  3c, d ) in the evolution profile of the photoluminescence peak position, which coincides with fluctuations in photoluminescence intensity. In general, changes in the photoluminescence peak position may be related to lattice or structural changes. Therefore this turning point might indicate the emergence of intermediate phases during the crystallization, in addition to the black phase. The perovskite film with PAD instead exhibited a smooth photoluminescence evolution profile for both peak position and peak intensity, further verifying the direct conversion to the black phase. The perovskite film with PAD exhibited considerably enhanced photoluminescence intensity and photoluminescence lifetime (Fig.  3e, f ), indicative of pure black-phase perovskite with reduced non-radiative recombination sites in the film. We subsequently evaluated the photovoltaic performance of the fabricated solar-cell devices. For the two-step deposition protocol (Extended Data Fig.  8 ), the device made with PAD had the best power conversion efficiency (PCE), achieving 24.0%, whereas the best control device had a PCE of only 22.9%, primarily because the PAD version had an increased fill factor and open circuit voltage (Fig.  4a ). This was attributed to the reduced non-radiative recombination in the device with PAD, as demonstrated by the slower transient photovoltage decay (Supplementary Fig.  6 ). The short-circuit currents of the device were marginally enhanced, reflecting the slightly faster transient photocurrent decay of the device with PAD  20, 21  (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). A similar trend in device performance was observed for the one-step method (Fig.  4b  and Extended Data Fig.  9 ). The device with PAD demonstrated an improved PCE of up to 25.4% (certified at 25.0%). The histogram of PCEs for 36 devices is shown in Fig.  4c  (the detailed parameters are shown in Supplementary Table  1 ), which confirms that the performance improvements of devices made with PAD were highly reproducible (a 5.6% improvement in average PCE from 23.7 ± 0.4% to 25.0 ± 0.4% when PAD was incorporated). We further extended the application of PAD to the fabrication of solar modules to verify its compatibility with upscaled devices. A high aperture efficiency of 21.4% (certified) was achieved for the PAD-based perovskite module with an area of 27.83 cm 2 (Fig.  4d ). The module showed an average PCE of 20.4%, whereas the control module had an average PCE of only 18.9%, further demonstrating the universality of the approach (Extended Data Fig.  10 ). Our fabricated devices also demonstrated considerably improved operational stability. When tracked at the maximum power point (MPP) with constant illumination at 30 ± 3 °C, the PCE of the control device fell by 30%, whereas the device fabricated with PAD maintained 95% of its initial PCE after more than 1,000 h (Fig.  4e ). In an accelerated-ageing test at 65 ± 3 °C and 85 ± 5% relative humidity, the device with PAD kept more than 82% of its initial PCE after more than 500 h when held at the MPP under constant illumination, whereas the PCE of the control device decreased by around 37% (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). This increased stability could be attributed to the higher crystallinity, reduced defect density and reduced surface energy caused by PAD  8, 22, 23  (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.4"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""30"", ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": ""22.9"", ""treated_pce"": ""24.0"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.95"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.7""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""85"", ""temperature"": ""65"", ""time"": ""500"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.82"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.63""}}"

3392,86_4," Comments: First some general comments. • The authors consistently use hyperbolic language in this manuscript. They describe -even in the title-the solar cells as ""without hysteresis"" and say that hysteresis is ""completely eliminated"" in their devices. I agree that the devices have very low hysteresis for perovskite solar cells. This is clearly shown in Fig.  S11 . Nevertheless, the hysteresis is not eliminated: eliminated is simply too strong of a word. There are differences in the forward and reverse JV scans. While these differences are slight they are clearly visible. Fig.  6  shows the FF changes from 0.792 to 0.783 with scan direction. This is hysteresis. The authors should modify the language of the paper in this respect. Hysteresis is reduced, it is perhaps even negligible, but it is certainly still present and is not ""eliminated"". Response: Thank you very much for your suggestion. We agree with your comment and have revised all relevant sections accordingly. • The English throughout the paper requires significant improvement to improve the readability of the manuscript. This is particularly true of the methods section. In fact, it is in places difficult to understand the methods being used due to inconsistent grammar. Improving readability would greatly improve the impact of this work. Response: Thanks for the suggestion! Revised version has been reviewed by a native English speaker for grammar. • The authors use a variety of device configurations to measure material properties such as defect density, mobility, and others. While I don't necessarily disagree or refute the results as presented, there are complicating factors associated with these measurements and device architectures. The authors should be clear about the caveats associated with their measurements and why they believe these can be neglected in this case. This will give the reader a fairer picture of the measurements undertaken and the conclusions of the work. Response: Thank you very much for the comments! Per your request, we have revised the sections with proper analyses and discussion, as shown on pages 10 and 22. To gain insights into the charge transport, we have measured electron mobility using different electron transport layers (ETLs) in the same device structure. Specifically, the electrononly device was designed and fabricated using structure ITO/Al/ETL/Al, as shown in the inset in Likewise, the trap state density (N t ) of the perovskite films are estimated using the device structure ITO/ETL/perovskite/PCBM/Ag, similar to previously reported results (Energy Environ. Sci., 2017, 10, 2570-2578; Adv. Mater., 2016, 28, 5206-5213; Energy Environ. Sci., 2017, 10, 2095-2102, etc.), R3-R5 The device architecture is shown in Fig.  3a  with the dark condition I-V curves. The linear correlation in the I-V curve reveals an ohmic-type device response in the low bias voltage range. The current is quickly increased nonlinearly when the bias voltage exceeds the trap-filled limit voltage (V TFL ) located at the kink point, indicating that the traps are completely filled. Hence, the trap density of the perovskite film can be calculated using V TFL through equation (  2 ) presented in the manuscript. More details are provided in the manuscript on page 10. More specific comments. • The authors' description of the crystallization with respect to the Gibbs free energy is unclear. What do the authors mean that the ""hydrophilicity of the E-SnO Response: According to the established model for nucleation and growth of thin films, R6,R7 the perovskite formation process can be divided into four steps: i) formation of crystal nucleus, ii) evolution of nuclei's into island structure, iii) formation of networked microstructure and iv) growth of networks into continuous film. The Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation in the first step can be expressed as: △G heterogeneous = △G homogeneous × f(θ), wherein f(θ) = (2 -3cosθ + cos 3 θ)/4, and θ is contact angle of the precursor solution. Since the magnitude of θ varies in the range of [0, π/2], the larger the is θ the smaller is the magnitude of cosθ, and therefore larger is the parameter f(θ) ϵ [0, 1]. In other words, a smaller contact angle results in reduced Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation, thereby, assisting the nucleation process. Higher nucleation density will promote the film densification process.  R7  Compared to EDTA and SnO 2 , E-SnO 2 shows the smallest contact angle (20.67°, Fig.  S6 ), which is further expected to improve the wettability between the E-SnO 2 and the perovskite layer. R8-R10 Thus, the perovskite coated on the E-SnO 2 exhibits better crystallinity (Fig.  S7 ) and full surface coverage (Fig.  2c ). In addition, the small contact angle of substrate provides the low surface energy,  R11  leading to increased grain size during the growth of the networked structure as observed in the SEM measurements. R7 This explanation has been added in the manuscript (page 9-10). The N t measurements are conducted with FA 0.95 Cs 0.05 PbI 3 , the same active layer used in the rest of this work. We are really sorry for the error label in Fig.  3a . It has been corrected. • The authors state that hysteresis is more severe in planar-type architectures (see pg 3). This is not universally a true statement. Generally p-i-n structures have very low hysteresis. Moreover, Response: Thank you for your question! Fig.  S2  compares the FTIR spectra of the E-SnO 2 solution measured in the freshly prepared condition and again after it was stored in ambient for 2 months.

3410,86_30," Results Fabrication and characterization of E-SnO 2 . It is well known that EDTA can react with transition metal oxide to form a complex, because it can provide its lone-pair electrons to the vacant d-orbital of the transition metal atom  47  . Thus, EDTA was chosen to modify the SnO 2 to improve its performance. Supplementary Fig.  1a  describes the chemical reaction that occurred when the SnO 2 was treated using the EDTA aqueous solution, resulting in the formation of a five-membered ring chelate. The images of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 samples are shown in Supplementary Fig.  1b . It is apparent that the unmodified EDTA and SnO 2 samples are transparent, while EDTA-treated SnO 2 turned into milky white. Supplementary Fig.  2  compares the Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of the E-SnO 2 solution measured in the freshly prepared condition and again after it was stored in an ambient atmosphere for 2 months. It is clear that there is no obvious difference between the two solutions indicating the high stability. Figure  1a  shows the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) for EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 films deposited on quartz substrates. In order to reduce the charging effect, the exposed surface of the quartz substrate was coated with a conductive silver paint and connected to the ground. We calibrated the binding energy scale for all XPS measurements to the carbon 1s line at 284.8 eV. It is clear from these measurements that SnO 2 shows only peaks attributed to Sn and O. After the EDTA treatment, the E-SnO 2 film shows an additional peak located at ca. 400 eV, ascribed to N. Meanwhile, the Sn 3d peaks from E-SnO 2 are shifted by ca. 0.16 eV in contrast to the pristine SnO 2 (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), indicating that EDTA is bound to the SnO 2 . FTIR was used to study the interaction between SnO 2 and EDTA. As shown in Fig.  1b , the peaks around 2895 cm -1 and 1673 cm -1 belong to C-H and C=O stretching vibration in the EDTA, respectively. The characteristic peaks of SnO 2 observed at ca. 701 cm -1 and 549 cm -1 are due to O-Sn-O stretch and the Sn-O vibration, respectively  48  . In addition, the peak at 1040 cm -1 in the SnO 2 film is attributed to O-O stretching vibration due to oxygen adsorption on the SnO 2 surface  49  . For the E-SnO 2 sample, the characteristic peaks of SnO 2 shift to 713 cm -1 and 563 cm -1 , and the C-H and C=O stretching vibration peaks shift to 2913 cm -1 and 1624 cm -1 , further demonstrating that the EDTA is indeed complexed with SnO 2 . Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 films deposited on the ITO substrates are shown in Fig.  1c . The data reveal that the E-SnO 2 film shows the smallest root-mean-square roughness of 2.88 nm, a key figure-of-merit for the PSCs  50  . We also measured their Fermi level by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), with the surface potential images shown in Supplementary Fig.  4 , and the calculated details are described in Supplementary Note 1. Figure  1d  provides energy band alignment between perovskites and different ETLs. The Fermi level of E-SnO 2 is very close to the conduction band of perovskite, which is beneficial for enhancing V oc  51  . )  Figure  1e  shows the optical transmission spectra of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 films coated on ITO. All these samples display high average transmittance in the visible region, demonstrating good optical quality. In addition, the electron mobility of various ETLs was measured using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method  20  , as shown in Fig.  1f . It is found that electron mobility of E-SnO 2 is 2.27 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 , significantly larger than those of the EDTA (3.56 × 10 -5 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) and the SnO 2 (9.92 × 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ). It is known that the electron mobility is a key figure-of-merit for ETLs in PSCs. Supplementary Fig.  5  shows the electron injection models for ITO/SnO 2 or E-SnO 2 /perovskite/PCBM/Al structures, with their corresponding J-V curves, and the details are described in Supplementary Note 2. It is apparent that the high electron mobility effectively promotes electron transfer in the PSCs, reduces charge accumulation at the ETL/perovskite interface, improves efficiency, and suppresses hysteresis for the PSCs  21  .

The quality of the perovskite films, including grain size, crystallinity, surface coverage, etc., is very important for high-performance PSCs. For a consistent microstructure, a solution deposition technique was used to fabricate perovskite films on EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 substrates. Figure  2a-c  shows the morphology of the perovskite films deposited on different ETLs. It is clear from these images that continuous pinhole-free films with full surface coverage were obtained. Figure  2d  shows the distribution diagram with an average grain size of about 309 nm for the perovskite coated on SnO 2 . The grain size increased to about 518 nm for the EDTA sample. Surprisingly, the average perovskite grain size is further enhanced to as much as about 828 nm (Fig.  2c, d ) for the E-SnO 2 substrates. According to the established model for nucleation and growth of thin films  52, 53  , the perovskite formation process can be divided into four steps: (i) formation of a crystal nucleus, (ii) evolution of nuclei into an island structure, (iii) formation of a networked microstructure, and (iv) growth of networks into a continuous film. The Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation in the first step can be expressed as Eq. (  1 ) 4G heterogeneous ¼ 4G homogeneous f θ ð Þ ð1Þ wherein f(θ) = (2-3 cos θ + cos 3 θ)/4  54  , and θ is the contact angle of the precursor solution. Since the magnitude of θ varies in the range of [0, π/2], the larger the θ is, the smaller is the magnitude of cos θ, and therefore larger is the parameter f(θ) ϵ [0, 1]. In other words, a smaller contact angle results in reduced Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation, thereby assisting the nucleation process. Higher nucleation density will promote the film densification process  53  . Compared to EDTA and SnO 2 , E-SnO 2 shows the smallest contact angle (20.67°, Supplementary Fig.  6 ), resulting in the wettability interface for the perovskite  55- 57  . Thus, the perovskite coated on the E-SnO 2 exhibits better crystallinity (Supplementary Fig.  7 ) and full surface coverage (Fig.  2c ). In addition, the small contact angle of the substrate provides the low surface energy  58  , leading to increased grain size during the growth of the networked structure  53  , as observed in the SEM measurements. Charge transfer dynamics. The electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/ETL/perovskite/PCBM/Ag were fabricated to evaluate the trap density of perovskite deposited on different substrates. Figure  3a  shows the dark current-voltage (I-V) curves of the electron-only devices. The linear correlation (dark yellow line) reveals an ohmic-type response at low bias voltage, when the bias voltage is above the kink point, which defines as the trapfilled limit voltage (V TFL ), the current nonlinearly increases (cyan line), indicating that the traps are completely filled. The trap density (N t ) can be obtained using Eq. (  2 ) N t ¼ 2ε 0 εV TFT eL 2 ð2Þ EDTA/perovskite where ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε is the relative dielectric constant of FA 0.95 Cs 0.05 PbI 3 (ε = 62.23)  59  , e is the electron charge, and L is the thickness of the film. The trap densities of the perovskite film coated on SnO 2 and EDTA substrates are 1.93 × 10 16 and 1.27 × 10 16 cm -3 , respectively. Interestingly, the trap density is reduced to as low as 8.97 × 10 15 cm -3 for the film deposited on E-SnO 2 . The significantly lower trap density is related to low grain boundary density in the perovskite film (Fig.  2 ). Figure  3b  shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite deposited on different substrates. Compared with other samples, significant PL quench is observed in the ITO/E-SnO 2 /perovskite, demonstrating that the E-SnO 2 has the most appealing merits as the highest electron mobility (Fig.  1f ). Figure  3c  shows the normalized time-resolved PL (TRPL) for perovskite coated on various ETLs. The lifetime and the corresponding amplitudes are listed in Supplementary Table  1 . Generally, the slow decay component (τ 1 ) is attributed to the radiative recombination of free charge carriers due to traps in the bulk, and the fast decay component (τ 2 ) is originated from the quenching of charge carriers at the interface  60  . The glass/ perovskite sample shows the longest lifetime under excitation intensity of 3 μJ cm -2 . For perovskite coated on the ITO substrate, the lifetime is decreased to more than half due to the charge transfer from perovskite into ITO. For EDTA/perovskite and SnO 2 /perovskite samples, both the fast and slow decay lifetimes are very similar, and τ 1 dominates the PL decay for both samples, indicating severe recombination before they were extracted. When the perovskite is deposited on E-SnO 2 , both τ 1 and τ 2 were shortened to 14.16 ns and 0.97 ns, with a proportion of 45.32% and 54.68%, respectively. Meanwhile, τ 2 appears to dominate the PL decay, indicating that electrons are effectively extracted from the perovskite layer to the E-SnO 2 with minimal recombination loss. Even under smaller excitation intensity (0.5 μJ cm -2 ), the acceleration of the lifetime for E-SnO 2 /perovskite is observed. The lifetime increases with reduced excitation intensity (Supplementary Fig.  8  and Supplementary Table  1 ), in agreement with a previous report  61  . The electron-transport yield (Ф tr ) of different ETLs with different excitation intensities can be estimated using equation, Ф tr = 1 -τ p /τ glass , where τ p is the average lifetime for perovskite deposited on different substrates, and τ glass is the average lifetime for glass/perovskite. With the excitation intensity of 3 μJ cm -2 , the electron-transport yields of ITO, EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 are 49.72%, 67.58%, 68.31%, and 81.50%, respectively. When the excitation intensity reduces to 0.5 μJ cm -2 , the electron-transport yields of ITO, EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 are increased to 60.37%, 74.46%, 80.65%, and 90.82%, respectively. It is clear that the excitation intensity can significantly increase the electron-transport yield. These results further indicate that the E-SnO 2 is a good electron extraction layer for planar-type PSCs. The performance of PSCs. With the superior optoelectronic properties discussed above, it is expected that the E-SnO 2 would make a better ETL in the PSCs than the SnO 2 . Planar-type PSCs are therefore designed and fabricated based on different ETLs with the device structure shown in Fig.  4a  inset. FAPbI 3 was used as the active absorber for its proper band gap, with a small amount of Cs doping to improve its phase stability  62, 63  . Supplementary Fig.  9  presents the cross-sectional SEM images for the complete device structure. The thickness of the perovskite film is controlled at ca. 420 nm for all devices. While the perovskite grains are not large enough to penetrate through the film thickness when the SnO 2 is used as the substrate, the grains are significantly larger when deposited on EDTA and E-SnO 2 with the grains grown across the film thickness, which is consistent with top-view SEM results (Fig.  2 ). Figure  4a  shows the J-V curves of planar-type PSCs using different ETLs, with the key parameters, including short-circuit current density (J sc ), V oc , fill factor (FF), and PCE summarized in Table  1 . The device based on EDTA gives a PCE of 16.42% with J sc = 22.10 mA cm -2 , V oc = 1.08 V, and FF = 0.687. The device based on SnO 2 substrate shows a PCE of 18.93% with J sc = 22.79 mA cm -2 , V oc = 1.10 V, and FF = 0.755. Interestingly, when the E-SnO 2 is employed as ETL, the J sc , FF, and V oc are increased to 24.55 mA cm -2 , 0.792, and 1.11 V, yielding a PCE up to 21.60%, (the certified efficiency is 21.52%, and the certificated document is shown in Supplementary Fig.  10 ), the highest efficiency reported to date for the planar-type PSCs. The low device performance for the EDTA is caused by small J sc and FF, which is related to low electron mobility and high resistance  47  , and the low V oc results from the small offset of Fermi energy between the EDTA and HTL (Fig.  1d )  64  . In comparison, the planar-type PSCs with E-SnO 2 ETLs exhibit the best performance. The higher J sc and FF are Fig.  3  The charge transfer between perovskite and different ETLs. a Dark I-V curves of the electron-only devices with the V TFL kink points. The inset shows the structure of the electron-only device. b Steady-state PL and c TRPL spectra with an excitation intensity of 3 μJ cm -2 of perovskite films deposited on different substrates attributed to the high electron mobility that promotes effective electron extraction, and the larger V oc due to the closer energy level between E-SnO 2 and perovskite  65  . Figure  4b  shows the incidentphoton-to-charge conversion efficiency (IPCE) and the integrated current of the PSCs based on different ETLs. The integrated current values calculated by the IPCE spectra for the devices using EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 are 21.22, 21.58, and 24.15 mA cm -2 , respectively, very close to the J-V results. It is apparent that the device based on the E-SnO 2 shows significantly higher IPCE due to less optical loss when perovskite is deposited on E-SnO 2 ETL (Supplementary Fig.  11 ), consistent with the J-V measurement. To further demonstrate the device characteristics, photocurrent density of the champion devices from each group based on EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 was measured when the devices were biased at 0.85, 0.89, and 0.92 V, respectively. Figure  4c  shows the corresponding curves at the maximum power point (V mp ) in the J-V plots. The PCEs of the champion devices using the EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 stabilize at 16.34%, 18.67%, and 21.67% with photocurrent densities of 19.22, 20.98, and 23.55 mA cm -2 , respectively, very close to the values measured from the J-V curves. Next, we fabricated and measured 30 individual devices for each ETL to study repeatability. Figure  4d  shows the PCE distribution histogram for devices with different ETLs, with the statistics listed in Supplementary Tables  2 3 4 . Amazingly, the devices based on E-SnO 2 exhibit excellent repeatability with a very small standard deviation in contrast to the devices based on EDTA and SnO 2 , indicating that the E-SnO 2 is an excellent ETL in the planar-type PSC.  In order to gain further insight into the charge transport mechanism, the charge transfer processes in the perovskite devices were studied in detail. The carrier recombination rate in the PSCs was evaluated by the V oc decay measurements. Figure  5a  shows the V oc decay curves of the PSCs based on different ETLs. It is apparent that the planar-type PSC based on E-SnO 2 exhibits the slowest V oc decay time compared to the devices based on EDTA and SnO 2 , indicating that the devices with E-SnO 2 have the lowest charge recombination rate and the longest carrier lifetime, consistent with the highest V oc for the device based on E-SnO 2 by J-V measurements. Figure  5b  shows J sc versus light intensity of the PSCs using various ETLs. It appears that all devices show a linear correlation with the slopes very close to 1, indicating that the bimolecular recombination in the devices is negligible  66  . Figure  5c  shows that V oc changes linearly with the light intensity. Prior studies have indicated that the deviation between the slope and the value of (kT/q) reflects the trap-assisted recombination  20  . In the present case, the device using the E-SnO 2 shows the smallest slope, indicating the least trap-assisted recombination, which is in excellent agreement with the result showing the lowest trap density when the perovskite is deposited on E-SnO 2 (Fig.  3a ). In fact, the slope is as small as 1.02 kT/q, implying that the trap-assisted recombination is almost negligible. The electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to extract transfer resistance in the solar cells. Figure  5d  shows the Nyquist plots of the devices using different ETLs measured at V oc under dark conditions, with the equivalent circuit shown in Supplementary Fig.  12 . It is known that in the EIS analysis, the high-frequency component is the signature of the transfer resistance (R tr ) and the low-frequency one for the recombination resistance (R rec )  67  . In the present study, because the perovskite/ HTL interface is identical for all devices, the only variable affecting R tr is the perovskite/ETL interface. The numerical fitting gives the device parameters, as listed in Supplementary Table  5 . Apparently, compared to PSCs based on EDTA and SnO 2 , the device with E-SnO 2 shows the smallest R tr of 14.8 Ω and the largest R rec of 443.3 Ω. The small R tr is beneficial for electron extraction, and the large R rec effectively resists charge recombination, which is in agreement with the observations discussed above. Combined, all the results confirm that E-SnO 2 is the most effective ETL for the planar-type PSC. Stability and hysteresis. Stability and hysteresis are two key characteristics for the PSCs. Figure  6a  shows normalized PCE measured as a function of storage time, with more detailed J-V parameters summarized in Supplementary Table  6 . It is clear that while the device based on E-SnO 2 maintains 92% of its initial efficiency exposed to an ambient atmosphere after 2880 h in the dark, the device using SnO 2 only provides 74% of its initial efficiency under the same storage condition. The PSCs were also tested under continuous irradiation at 100 mW cm -2 . Figure  6b  shows the normalized PCE changes as a function of test time, with more detailed J-V parameters provided in Supplementary Table  7 . It is clear that after 120 h of illumination, the device using the E-SnO 2 maintains 86% of its initial efficiency, while for the same test duration, the device using SnO 2 remains only 38% relative to its initial efficiency. It is apparent that the device fabricated on E-SnO 2 shows excellent stability under both the dark and continuous irradiation. The instability of PSC is mainly caused by degradation of the perovskite film and spiro-OMeTAD HTL. In the present work, all devices used the same spiro-OMeTAD HTL, therefore, the degradation from the HTL should be the same for all the devices. It is found that the grain size of the perovskite film is increased by three times when it is deposited on E-SnO 2 in comparison to that on the pristine SnO 2 (Fig.  2 ). The larger grain size can effectively suppress the moisture permeation at grain boundaries  68  , resulting in improved environmental stability for the PSCs based on the E-SnO 2 ETLs. For the hysteresis test, Fig.  6c  and d  show the J-V curves measured under both reverse-and forward-scan directions. It is found that the device with E-SnO 2 has almost identical J-V curves with negligible hysteresis, even when it is measured using different scan rates from 0.01 to 0.5 V s -1 . Supplementary Fig.  13  presents J-V curves measured for the device based on E-SnO 2 at different scan rates. It is apparent that the J-V curves almost remain the same, regardless of scan rate and direction, demonstrating that the hysteresis is negligible. Generally, the hysteresis of PSCs is ascribed to interfacial capacitance caused by charge accumulation at the interface, which originates from ion migration, high trap density, and unbalanced charge transport within the perovskite device  [69] [70] [71]  . It is found that the trap density of the perovskite film is significantly reduced when it is deposited on the E-SnO 2 , one of the primary reasons for reduced hysteresis. In addition, the electron mobility of the SnO 2 ETL is only 9.92 × 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 s -1 (Fig.  1f ), about an order of magnitude slower than the hole mobility of the doped spiro-OMeTAD (ca. 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) HTL. Thus, the electron flux (F e ) is ca. 10 times smaller than the hole flux (F h ) due to the same interface area of the ETL/perovskite and perovskite/HTL, that leads to charge accumulation at the SnO 2 /perovskite interface, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  14a . The accumulated charge would cause hysteresis in the solar cells (Fig.  6c ). When the high electron mobility E-SnO 2 (2.27 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) is employed as the ETL, the F e is comparable to the F h of the spiro-OMeTAD HTL (Supplementary Fig.  14b ), resulting in equivalent charge transport at both electrodes. Therefore, the high electron mobility of E-SnO 2 would enhance electron transport from perovskite to E-SnO 2 ETL, leading to no significant charge accumulation, and consequently, the devices based on the E-SnO 2 exhibit negligible hysteresis. High-efficiency flexible PSCs. Given the advantage of lowtemperature preparation, we applied the E-SnO 2 ETL in flexible PSCs. Figure  7a  shows J-V curves of flexible PSCs using the poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET)/ITO substrates, with key J-V parameters summarized in Table  1 . The champion flexible device exhibits PCE of 18.28% (J sc = 23.42 mA cm -2 , V oc = 1.09 V, and FF = 0.716). The lower J sc of the flexible device is caused by the lower transparency of the PET/ITO substrate compared to the glass/ITO used for the rigid device (Supplementary Fig.  15 ). The lower V oc and FF are likely due to higher sheet resistance of the PET/ITO substrate  67  . Figure  7c  shows the IPCE and integral current density of the flexible device. It is clear that the integral current is 23.12 mA cm -2 , in perfect agreement with the J-V results. For the reproducibility test, 30 individual cells were fabricated with the PCE distribution histogram shown in Fig.  7d  and detailed parameters are summarized in Supplementary Table  8 , both confirming very good reproducibility. The mechanical stability is an important quality indicator for the flexible solar cells. According to a previous report  72  , it is safe ) Voltage (V) for ITO to be bended to a radius of 14 mm, and when the bending radius is smaller than 14 mm, the ITO layer starts to crack, leading to significant degradation in conductivity. In order to examine the mechanical stability of the flexible PSCs, we therefore adopted the bending radii of 14 mm, 12 mm, and 7 mm to test the flexible device. Figure  7a  shows device performance of the flexible solar cells measured after flexing for 500 times with different curvature radii, and the test procedure is shown in Fig.  7b . It shows that after flexing for 500 times at a bending radius of 14 mm, the J-V curve and the associated parameters remain the same without obvious degradation. However, when the bending radius is decreased to 12 mm and 7 mm, the PCE degraded to 17.82% and 16.84%, respectively, attributing to the conductivity degradation of ITO  72  .

3460,120_2,"Further enhancing the performance and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is crucial for their commercialization. We report that the functionalization of multication and halide perovskite interfaces with an organometallic compound, ferrocenyl-bis-thiophene-2-carboxylate (FcTc 2 ), simultaneously enhanced the efficiency and stability of inverted PSCs. The resultant devices achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.0% and maintained >98% of their initial efficiency after continuously operating at the maximum power point for 1500 hours under simulated AM1.5 illumination.

3462,120_4,"P ower conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as high as 25.7% have been realized for single-junction conventional n-i-p perovskite solar cells (PSCs), approaching the PCEs of state-of-the-art crystalline-silicon solar cells (1-3). Inverted (p-i-n structure) devices, with a deposition sequence of holetransport (p), intrinsic (i), and electron-transport (n) layers, have exhibited greater stabilities and lifetimes because of their undoped holetransporting layers (HTLs) and the formation of highly crystalline perovskite films  (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Recently, strategies for managing defects and ion migration in inverted PSCs have further contributed to device stability. For example, Chen et al. have used solid-state carbohydrazide to modulate the crystallization of perovskites and fabricate a minimodule that maintained 85% of its initial PCE under 1-sun illumination (where 1 sun is defined as the standard illumination at AM1.5, or 1 kW m -2 ) for 1000 hours  (11) , and Bai et al. have applied ionic liquids within perovskite films by suppressing ion migration and have fabricated PSCs that exhibited only ~5% degradation of device performance under continuous simulated AM1.5 irradiation for >1800 hours  (12) . However, the currently reported operational lifetime of inverted PSCs under international standards still lags far behind the 25-year lifetime guarantee for commercialized silicon solar cells  (2, 13) . Moreover, although synergistic tailoring of grains, defects, and interfaces can boost efficiencies to 23.3%, there is still a lack of strategy that could result in efficiencies of up to 25% to rival n-i-p PSCs and silicon solar cells  (14) (15) (16) . Here, we report highly efficient and stable inverted PSCs through interface functionalization with an organometallic compound, ferrocenyl-bis-thiophene-2-carboxylate (FcTc 2 ), that not only provided strong chemical Pb-O binding to reduce surface trap states but also accelerated interfacial electron transfer through the electron-rich and electron-delocalizable ferrocene units. The improved interface binding and carrier transport properties of FcTc 2 contribute to superior device stability. The resulting devices achieved a PCE of 25.0% (with certified 24.3%) and maintained >98% of their initial efficiency in long-term operational stability tests with continuous 1-sun illumination for >1500 hours. Moreover, the FcTc 2 -treated devices exhibited excellent stability under damp heat tests [85°C and 85% relative humidity (RH)], which have passed the international standards for silicon solar cells. Interfaces were functionalized with FcTc 2 by using the inherent carboxylate and thiophene groups around the central ferrocene motif (see Fig.  1A  for chemical structure). The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of FcTc 2 in solution and as a thin film are shown in figs. S1 and S2, respectively. The device configuration is depicted in Fig.  1A , in which poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) was the HTL and C 60 was the electron transfer layer (ETL). Figure  S3  shows the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a typical device with a perovskite composition of Cs 0.05 (FA 0.98 MA 0.02 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.98 Br 0.02 ) 3 (where MA and FA denote methylammonium and formamidinium, respectively) and FcTc 2 surface treatment. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) in Fig.  1B  demonstrates that most of the FcTc 2 was located on the surface of the perovskite film. We used x-ray diffraction (XRD), top-view SEM, and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy measurements to study the crystallinity, morphology, and optical absorption of perovskite films with and without FcTc 2 treatment (figs. S4 to S6). All of the samples showed no obvious changes, which indicates that FcTc 2 does not affect the crystallization and lightharvesting properties of perovskite films. The interaction of FcTc 2 with the perovskite was studied by comparing the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on the pristine and FcTc 2 -treated perovskite films (Fig.  1 , C to E). The binding energies corresponding to the Pb 4f, I 3d, and N 1s core levels of the FcTc 2 -treated perovskite films all shifted marginally to higher values compared with the control sample, suggesting enhanced binding of both anions and cations on the perovskite surface, which could be caused by strong binding between surface ions and FcTc 2  (17) . Density functional theory (DFT) simulation analyses were performed to study the interaction between the perovskite surface and FcTc 2 molecules. We chose the (001) PbI 2 -terminated perovskite surface as a model because it has been proven to be stable and to have the lowest energy configuration. Starting from the ordered interface, we observed enhanced bonding of O from FcTc 2 with Pb from the perovskite surface within a few picoseconds (Fig.  1,  F  and G ). With the interfacial rearrangement, the molecular dynamics reach a stable equilibrium state in which the bond length of Pb-O was simulated to be 2.65 Å (Fig.  1H ). The electrostatic potential (ESP) analysis (fig.  S7 ) indicated a high electronegativity (-29.79 kcal mol -1 ) of O in FcTc 2 , driving the formation of stable Pb-O bonds and substantially enhancing the electrostatic attraction between the perovskite and FcTc 2 interface. XPS analysis combined with DFT simulation proves that there is a strong interaction between perovskite and FcTc 2 , which is beneficial for both passivation of surface defects and stabilization of surface components in perovskite  (7, 18) . To study the effect of FcTc 2 on the electrical properties of perovskite films, we conducted kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements to examine the surface potential of the films (Fig.  2, A  and B ). The perovskite film functionalized by FcTc 2 exhibited a decreased contact potential (~50 mV) relative to that of the control sample, which suggests direct interaction and surface charge transfer between FcTc 2 and perovskite  (18) . Moreover, FcTc 2functionalized perovskite displayed a smaller potential distribution and surface potential difference (~150 mV) compared with that of the control sample (~250 mV). A uniform distribution of surface contact potential was beneficial for effective charge carrier extraction to prevent nonradiative recombination  (19, 20) . The carrier kinetics characterization (figs. S8 and S9) on the perovskite-ETL interface further verifies the accelerated electron extraction with FcTc 2 modification, which can be attributed to the ferrocene and thiophene units  (21, 22) . Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured to evaluate the nonradiative recombination of perovskite films (Fig.  2C ). The carrier lifetime nearly doubled from 1166.74 to 2159.22 ns after incorporating FcTc 2 (the fitted carrier lifetime is summarized in table  S1 ), which is consistent with enhanced steady-state photoluminescence intensity (fig.  S10 ), indicating reduced numbers of nonradiative recombination centers from the surface defects. Additionally, the space charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements (fig.  S12 ) further confirm the decreased defect density through FcTc 2 modification. In triple-cation mixed-halide perovskite, the chemically reactive components, such as MA + and I -at the perovskite surface, can easily volatilize and migrate through photo-and thermal effects. The surface trap states generate decreased photovoltaic performance degradation  (23, 24) . To estimate the effect of FcTc 2 on perovskite stability, the MA + cations of the control and FcTc 2 -functionalized perovskite films were probed by peak force infrared (PFIR) microscopy under illumination and heat conditions  (20) . The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy spectra of the perovskite films confirmed that the signal of the MA ions in perovskite is distinct and readily resolved (fig.  S13 ). PFIR mapping showed that the intensity and distribution of MA + cations in the FcTc 2 -treated sample were well maintained after aging for 1000 hours (Fig.  2 , D and F), whereas the control sample exhibited substantial reduction of intensity and broadening of distribution of the MA signal (Fig.  2, E  and G ). These results indicate that FcTc 2 can prevent surface ions from migration to produce a more uniform and stable surface component distribution (Fig.  2H )  (25) . By contrast, ion migration and volatilization were more prone to occur in the control films, resulting in increased surface defects and affecting the operational stability of perovskite devices (fig.  S14 ). Measuring the perovskite films after >1000 hours separately under con-tinuous 1-sun illumination or heating at 85°C also confirmed the stabilization effects of FcTc 2 on perovskite (figs. S15 and S16). Figure  3A  shows the current density-voltage (J-V) curves for control and FcTc 2 -functionalized devices under AM1.5G simulated solar illumination, in which the concentration of FcTc 2 was optimized to be 1.0 mg ml -1 to obtain the best performance (figs. S17 and S18 and table  S2 ). The control device exhibited a maximum PCE of 23.0%, with an open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.13 V, a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 25.25 mA cm -2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 80.45%. Compared with the control device, the FcTc 2 -functionalized device exhibited an enhanced PCE of 25.0%, with an increased V OC of 1.184 V, a J SC of 25.68 mA cm -2 , and an FF of 82.32% with a low hysteresis (fig.  S19 ). Corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig.  3B ) yielded integrated J SC values with a small variation from the values obtained from J-V measurements.  devices were also measured at the maximum power point (MPP) to obtain a stabilized photocurrent of 23.68 mA cm -2 and a stabilized PCE of 24.2% (Fig.  3C ). One of the best-performing devices was validated by an independent solar cell-accredited laboratory (National Institute of Metrology, China) for certification, where a PCE of 24.3% (with V OC = 1.179 V, J SC = 25.59 mA cm -2 , and FF = 80.60%) was confirmed (fig.  S20 ), which is the highest certified efficiency among all inverted PSCs to date (table  S3 ). The PCEs also exhibited a satisfying reproducibility, with an average PCE of 22.5% for the control device and 24.5% for the FcTc 2based device (Fig.  3D ). The particular effectiveness of FcTc 2 is further verified in figs. S21 to S24 and table  S4 . Additionally, we conducted quantitative analysis of the photovoltage loss (V OC loss) for the control and FcTc 2 -treated devices accord-ing to detailed balance theory  (26) . The EQE EL values of 1.5 and 7.0% for the control device and the device with FcTc 2 , respectively, could be obtained from electroluminescence (EL) spectra (Fig.  3, E  and F ), leading to 108.57 and 68.75 mV of DV 3 (V OC loss from the nonradiative recombination), respectively. The relative lower DV 3 suggests that FcTc 2 suppresses nonradiative recombination as an interfacial modifier. The values of the three components of V OC loss (DV 1 , DV 2 , and DV 3 ) are calculated in the supplementary text and summarized in table  S5 . A V OC loss of 363 mV is one of the lowest values reported among inverted PSCs  (16, 26) . To investigate the effect of FcTc 2 functionalization on device stability, the efficiency evolution under various conditions was monitored. We first examined the long-term operational stability of unencapsulated devices by loading at MPP voltage under continuous 1-sun illumination in an N 2 atmosphere (Fig.  4A ). The FcTc 2 -functionalized device retained its initial PCE in the first 200 hours and only exhibited a decay of <2% after >1500 hours. In comparison, the control device decreased to 72% of its initial PCE. We further measured the stability of unencapsulated devices under heat and ambient conditions. As shown in figs. S27 and S28, the performance of the control devices dropped to <80% of the initial efficiency after >800 hours.

3519,143_5," RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Panels a and b of Figure  1  show the schematic device architecture and the corresponding energy level diagram of PSCs investigated in this study. The devices are based on a mesoporous TiO 2 scaffold and triple cation perovskite with a composition of (FAPbI 3 ) 0.77 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.14 (CsPbI 3 ) 0.09 used as absorber material. The perovskite layer is deposited using a one-step spin coating with antisolvent quenching, as reported previously.  11  In this work, we study the efficiency and stability of PSCs when using a thin buffer layer of 2D perovskite at the perovskite/HTM interface, as well as CuSCN as an inorganic hole transport layer. The 2D perovskites were deposited by spin coating PEAI and FPEAI dissolved in isopropanol (15 mg/mL) on top of the perovskite capping layer as described in the Experimental Section. A thin layer of the 2D perovskites (PEA) 2 PbI 4 and (FPEA) 2 PbI 4 respectively is thereby formed on the triple cation perovskite via ion exchange and/or reaction of excess PbI 2 . Figure  1c  shows the cross-sectional SEM micrograph of a device with a thin interlayer of (PEA) 2 PbI 4 . It is evident from the figure that the 2D layer is creating an additional interface between the HTM and the perovskite layer. Devices passivated with FPEA or using CuSCN as an HTM revealed very similar interlayer structures, and their SEM pictures are shown in the Supporting Information (SI; Figure  S1 ). From the SEM images, the thickness of the 2D perovskite is estimated to be less than 50 nm. The CuSCN HTM layer was applied onto the perovskite by spin coating its solution (30 mg/mL) in diethylsulfide. Top-view SEM images of pristine and 2D treated perovskite layers are shown in Figure  2a ,b, respectively. The pristine perovskite reveals the formation of the uniform crystal grains, while for the 2D perovskite treated layers a clear change of the surface morphology can be observed. The 2D perovskite has a platelike morphology and fully covers the underlying 3D absorber layer. The presence of the 2D perovskite could be additionally confirmed by XRD diffraction of thin films (Figure  2c ). PEAI and FPEAI treated samples clearly show the diffraction peaks at low angles corresponding to the respective 2D perovskites as observed for the pure 2D reference sample. Exclusively reflections corresponding to the (00l) crystallographic plane could be observed, suggesting a strong preferred orientation growth of the 2D perovskite, commonly observed in layered structures. Surprisingly we noticed the appearance of an additional set of diffraction peaks (*) corresponding to an enlarged unit cell. We assign these peaks to unreacted PEAI during the isopropanol treatment along with (PEA) 2 PbI 4  4  . The diffraction peaks of the 3D Cs triple cation perovskite, however, remain unchanged before and after the treatment. This strongly suggests that the bulk of the 3D perovskite has not been affected in the multilayer deposition process. Also, the excess lead present in the pristine sample (PbI 2 peak at 12.8°) is no longer present after the treatment, suggesting that it has been reacted with the PEAI and FPEAI respectively to form the 2D perovskites. To further analyze the 3D/2D perovskite interface, we performed photoluminescence (PL) experiments.

3534,141_2,"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) commonly exhibit significant performance degradation due to ion migration through the top charge transport layer and ultimately metal electrode corrosion. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial management strategy using a boron chloride subphthalocyanine (Cl 6 SubPc)/fullerene electron-transport layer, which not only passivates the interfacial defects in the perovskite, but also suppresses halide diffusion as evidenced by multiple techniques, including visual element mapping by electron energy loss spectroscopy. As a result, we obtain inverted PSCs with an efficiency of 22.0% (21.3% certified), shelf life of 7000 h, T 80 of 816 h under damp heat stress (compared to less than 20 h without Cl 6 SubPc), and initial performance retention of 98% after 2000 h at 80 °C in inert environment, 90% after 2034 h of illumination and maximum power point tracking in ambient for encapsulated devices and 95% after 1272 h outdoor testing ISOS-O-1.

3536,141_6," Device fabrication Perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) with p-i-n structure were fabricated following a configuration of ITO/HTL/perovskite/ETLs/BCP/e lectrodes. ITO glass was cleaned by sequentially washing with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. The substrates were dried with N 2 and cleaned by UV ozone for 15 min. Cu:NiO x HTLs were spin-coated on the clean ITO substrates according to our previous reports  [33] [34] [35] . The CsFAMA-mixed perovskite layers were fabricated according to the one-step antisolvent method we reported previously  [35] . In details, the perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing PbI 2 , PbBr 2 , FAI and MABr in DMF/DMSO (v/v: 4/1) where the mole concentration of PbI 2 was kept at 1.1 mol L À1 , and the mole ratio of I/Br and FA/MA were maintained at 0.85/0.15. After stirring for 1 h at 60 °C, 35 lL CsI (2 mol L À1 in DMSO) was added and then stirred for another 1 h. The perovskite films were deposited on HTLs with 4000 r min À1 for 35 s, during spinning, 300 lL CB was used as antisolvent 25 s prior to the end of the spinning process. Then the perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 60 min.

3632,62_7," Results and discussion The 3D CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite was prepared by a two-step vapor fabrication. A PbI 2 thin film of 150 nm was first evaporated on FTO/ TiO 2 substrate, and then exposed in a MAI vapor environment for 30 min under 180 °C (Fig.  1a ). Reaction according to equation (1) take places, which drive the formation of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . PbI 2 +CH 3 NH 3 I = CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 (1) nCH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 +2BAI = (BA) 2 (CH 3 NH 3 ) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 +CH 3 NH 3 I (2) The SEM image in Fig.  1b  shows that the as-prepared MAPbI 3 thin film is composed of compact crystals with sizes of around 800 nm. Formation of the 2D capping layer was accomplished by exposing the as-prepared MAPbI 3 thin film in the BAI vapor (equation (  2 )). Fig.  1c  shows that surface layered structure developed from the 3D grains in 5 min, indicating the partial transformation of 3D to 2D structure. The conversion of morphology proceeds with time and a surface with smaller layer structure was observed after 60 min reaction (Fig.  1d ). The crystal structure of the thin film was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in Fig.  2a . On the as-prepared MAPbI 3 thin film, typical diffraction peaks at 14.13°, 20.00°, 24.56°, 28.47°, 31.92°, were observed. They correspond to the (110), (  112 ), (  202 ), (  220 ), (310) crystal plane of tetragonal MAPbI 3 . It's found that after BAI vapor treatment, the diffraction peaks did not change until treatment time increase to 20 min. New diffraction peaks of 2D perovskite at 6.38°and 4.73°, corresponding to (002) plane of (BA) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 for n = 1 and n = 2 appeared. The appearance of new excitonic absorption peaks at 517 nm (n = 1), 570 nm (n = 2), 608 nm (n = 3) in the UV-Vis spectra (Fig.  2b ) also confirm the existence of 2D perovskite species in the 3D MAPbI 3 perovskites. This result shows that large alkyl ammonium BA has inserted into the 3D-MAPbI 3 structure and enlarged the distance between inorganic [PbI 6 ] layers by replacing MA to form a 2D perovskite in the thin film. If the 2D and 3D perovskite is in the mixing form, a decrease of n value of the whole perovskite can be expected, and thus broaden the band gap of the thin film. The absorption onset of the thin film in Fig.  2b  keeps constant at 780 nm, corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.59 eV of 3D structure. It suggests that the 2D perovskite does not mixed into the bulk. To locate the existence of 2D perovskite, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite surface and the interface between the perovskite and TiO 2 were measured (Fig.  2c  & Fig.  S2 ). It's found that once the 3D perovskite was exposed to BAI vapor, BA 2 MA 2 Pb 3 I 10 (n = 3) peak at 615 nm and BA 2 MA 1 Pb 2 I 7 (n = 2) peak at 577 nm were observed and increase with prolonging treatment time on the surface side. At the same time, the emission peak at 780 nm shift to 762 nm. It indicates the formation of surface 2D perovskite with higher n values, which has a higher band gap than the original 3D perovskite  [31] . In contrast, PL spectra at the interface detects no signal of 2D perovskite. It confirms that transformation of 3D to 2D structure only appears on the surface, showing the formation of a 3D-2D heterojunction structure. AFM images in Fig.  S3  show that the surface of the 3D perovskite thin film is compact and uniform. After treating with BAI vapor for 5 min, the grains turn to platelet crystals with layered structure, and the root square roughness slightly increase from 24.5 nm to 25.0 nm because of the formation of 2D structure. As the 2D structure shows different energy levels, which will alter the energy level alignment at the interface, we continue to measure the surface potential change on the surface using KPFM. Fig.  2d  & Fig.  S4  shows that as more and more 2D perovskite with smaller n value formed, the surface potential decreases from 530 mV to 96 mV. As the tip is biased in our measurement set-up, the decrease of surface  The inset shows the enlarge section between 550 nm and 650 nm. (d) CPD evolution for different BAI treatment time. The AFM tip is bias so as the decrease of CPD means an increase of vacuum level. (We performs the KPFM in Air, the work function may affected by absorbing H 2 O or O 2 . So the absolute value of work function cannot be taken exactly.) potential means that the upward band bending of vacuum level. This result indicates there is a building potential between 3D and 2D structure, which facilitates the separation of electron-hole. The results indicate that exposing the 3D perovskite thin film using BAI vapor allow slow formation of surface 2D layer and control of the energy structure. We fabricated solar cells with the above 3D-2D hybrid structure using device architecture consists of glass/FTO/TiO 2 /C 60 /3D-2D perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au in Fig.  3a . The effect of treatment time on the performance of the devices was shown in Fig.  3b  and Table  1 . As prepared 3D perovskite device has V oc of 1.01 V, J sc of 23.66 mA cm -2 , and FF of 72.40%, giving a PCE of 17.30% in reverse scan. The device shows a hysteresis index of 7.07%, which is calculate by (J Re- verse (0.8V oc )-J Forward (0.8V oc ))/J Reverse (0.8V oc ) (Fig.  S5a )  [32] . Although the above KPFM results shown that more 2D structure leads to stronger internal field for more efficient electron-hole separation, however, with increased treatment time, the PCE decrease was observed. To investigate the origin, we first investigate the dark current of the devices in Fig.  S5c . Rapid decrease of dark current with increasing treatment time was observed, which leads to a decrease of FF as shown in Table After long time treatment, the S-shape J-V curves was observed (Fig.  S5d ). This shows that transport of carrier is not only affected by the increasing resistance of 2D structures, but also by charging at the interface. To further reveal the mechanism, we analyzed the surface valance band structure evolution during the vapor treatment process in quantify. UPS measurement on samples with increasing treatment time in Fig.  4a  gives the SE cutoff edge at 17.26 eV, 17.19 eV, 17.18 eV, 17.17 eV, 17.16 eV, 17.15 eV, respectively, and the VB onset at 1.59 eV, 1.52 eV, 1.54 eV, 1.55 eV, 1.57 eV, 1.58 eV, respectively using logarithmic extraction method due to its low DOS at valance band  [33] . The   VBM position can be calculated by: E VBM = 21.22-(E SE-cutoff-edge -E VB-onset ) (3) The change of VBM is shown in Fig.  4c . It shows that the VBM becomes deeper as treatment time increases. It means that hole flowing to the Au back contact will encounter an increasing barrier. This VBM offset will induced hole accumulation at the interface, and thus cause reduction of J SC or even the S-shape. It's shown that when the treatment time was restricted at 5 min, the position of VBM lies at -5.55 eV, which is nearly the same as that of 3D counterpart. This energy level  alignment facilitates the extraction of holes and blocking of electrons. Therefore, the J SC and V OC are as high as that of the 3D devices in Fig.  3c . The 3D-2D device after 5 min treatment showed V OC of 1.02 V, J SC of 23.37 mA cm -2 , FF of 68.70% and thus the PCE reaches 16.50%. The hysteresis index of the device is reduced to 4.54%. Moreover, our device structure and fabrication process are proved to be suitable for large area fabrication. Fig.  3d  and e  shows typical devices with active area of 1.00 cm 2 fabricated using the same procedure. The 3D-2D device showed a PCE of 14.10% with J SC of 21.04 mA/ cm 2 , a V OC of 1.07 V, and an FF of 62.55% under reverse scanning measurement. It is similar to the 3D device, which shows PCE of 14.01% with a J SC of 21.91 mA/cm 2 , a V OC of 1.05 V, and an FF of 60.44%. The PCE difference is negligible in large area devices. We suggest that it comes from the reduction of leakage in the film because of more compact surface, where BAI insertion leads to lattice expansion. The stability of the devices is investigated in Fig.  5 . Both the asprepared 3D perovskite and hybrid structure after 5 min treatment shows good illumination stability, giving the stabilized power output (SPO) of 16.75% and 16.12% at maximum power point, as shown in Fig.  5a  and b . Both devices can reach a stable PCE rapidly. The 3D device only shows 95.78% SPO ratio, while the 3D-2D device shows better SPO ratio of 97.69%. The higher SPO ratio means that hysteresis of 3D-2D device is alleviated as compared to the 3D device  [20] . More importantly, the long-term thermal and humidity stability was greatly improved in 3D-2D heterostructure devices as shown in Fig.  5c  and d . Under 55% RH at room temperature without encapsulation, the PCE of as-prepared 3D-MAPbI 3 device decreases to 44% of its original PCE after 30 days, while the 3D-2D hetero-structure keeps 83% after 30 days. Under 80 °C ± 2 thermal aging, the PCE of the 3D device decrease to 27% in 14 days, while the 3D-2D hetero-structure keeps 73% after 30 days. To understand the mechanism of stability improvement, we first trace the change of XRD patterns under difference storage environment. It's found that the under 55% RH environment, strong PbI 2 peaks at 12.67°can be observed in 3D MAPbI 3 after 4 days. For the 3D-2D structure, although significant decrease of the (110) peaks intensity was observed, the PbI 2 peak is not observed at 9 days. At 14 days, a small PbI 2 peak appeared. Moreover, we can observe a strong peak at 10.50°a nd a small peak at 8.52°These peaks coincided with the (-101) and (100) reflections of monoclinic MAPbI 3 •H 2 O  [34] , indicating the formation of monohydrate. Reaction between 2D perovskite and H 2 O has been proposed as  [35] : → + ⋅ - + -- - -+ MA Pb I x H O MA Pb I x MAPbI H O BA ( ) BA ( ) n n n n x n x n x 2 1 3 1 2 2 ( ) 1 ( )3 ( ) 1 3 2 (4) This reaction shows that on the surface, the amount of 2D perovskite with high n value will be reduced, giving a surface layer with MAPbI 3 •H 2 O and 2D inside layer with smaller n value (Fig.  6c ). This process will increase the amount of 2D perovskite with smaller n. It's found from the XRD that a small peak at 9.54°also appears after 14 days storage. This peak consists with the n = 2 peak of BA 2 MAPb 2 I 7  [16] . It supports the above analysis and shows that n = 2 is the most stable form in the system. The generation of 2D perovskite with smaller n value at surface can protect the inner species and is helpful for the stabilization of devices. The thermal degradation of the 3D perovskite shows the similar quick degradation process as compared with humidity degradation of 3D perovskite film. However, the evolution of 3D-2D structure under heat stress shows difference with that of humidity degradation. From XRD monitoring, PbI 2 peak cannot be observed after 4 days storage. After 9 days, only the peak of PbI 2 was observed, no additional peaks appear (Fig.  S6b ). It means that the thermal degradation of 3D-2D system is different from the humidity degradation. To further investigate the change, we map the surface potential evolution using insitu KPFM under 80 °C. The surface of as-prepared 3D-MAPbI 3 perovskite thin film in Fig.  S7  shows uniform and smooth grains. After heating at 80 °C for 20 min, some nanoscale particles first appeared on the grain boundary (marked by the black arrow), and then dispersed to overall surface after 57 min. The surface roughness increases from initially 18.05 nm-20.76 nm after 57 min. KPFM shows that the surface potential decreased from 480 mV to 220 mV, this process can be understood by the formation of lower surface potential PbI 2 owning to release of MA molecules  [36] . The AFM topography evolution of the 3D-2D perovskite films shown in Fig.  7a -d is different. The 2D-(BA) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 platelet structure keeps robust under 80 °C heat stress for 56 min. It reflects that the 2D surface is more resistive to heat stress. Meanwhile, the change of surface potential of the 2D layer shows opposite tendency to that of thermal degradation of 3D-MAPbI 3 , with value increases from 350 mV to 660 mV. It indicates that the perovskite does not experience the thermal decomposition to PbI 2 . If revisit the surface potential change of 2D perovskite in Fig.  2d , where the surface potential decreases as n value decreases, it can be found that the surface potential evolution during decomposition of the 2D layer has inverse tendency to the formation process, and thus an increase of n value can be expected. As a result, we suggest that the thermal decomposition is an inverse process to the 2D perovskite growth (Fig.  7f ). At high temperature, the MA species inside the MAPbI 3 counterpart is released to the top 2D layer, while the BA species slightly diffuses inside. This interdiffusion behavior leads to the formation BA 2 (MA) n Pb n+1 I 3n+4 from a (BA) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 grain. Improvement of the thermal stability comes from generation of 2D perovskite with high n value, which buffers the release of MA species inside the film. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""methylammonium lead iodide"", ""humidity"": ""55"", ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""720"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""16.5"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.81""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOST"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""80"", ""time"": ""720"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.74""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": ""methylammonium lead iodide"", ""humidity"": ""55"", ""temperature"": ""80"", ""time"": ""720"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""17.3"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.83"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.44""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOST"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": ""80"", ""time"": ""720"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.74"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.27""}}"

Despite its pivotal function in the development of a rational device optimization, the actual role played by the incorporation of interfacial modifications and the interface physics therein remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the interface and device physics, quantifying charge recombination and charge losses in state-of-the-art inverted solar cells with power conversion efficiency beyond 23% -among the highest reported so far -by using multidimensional photoluminescence imaging. By doing that we extract physical parameters such as quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) and Urbach energy enabling us to assess that the main passivation mechanism affects the perovskite/PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester) interface rather than surface defects. In this work, by linking optical, electrical measurements and modelling we highlight the benefits of organic passivation, made in this case by phenylethylammonium (PEAI) based cations, in maximising all the photovoltaic figures of merit. I nverted perovskite solar cells following a p-i-n structure have recently attracted enormous interest due to their enhanced stability and reduced hysteresis compared to the traditional n-i-p architecture 1,2 . However, n-i-p devices, where the perovskite absorber is deposited onto an electron transport layer, still result in higher power conversion efficiencies (PCE) reaching values up to 25.6% 3 mainly due to a better carrier extraction. One of the most common strategies employed to limit non-radiative losses and therefore improve perovskite solar cells (PSC)s efficiency relies on the use of interface passivation agents such as low dimensional halide perovskites 2,4,5 , organic cations  6, 7  or selfassembled monolayers (SAM)  8, 9  . In our recent work, we have developed an innovative strategy for the optimisation of p-i-n stateof-the-art inverted solar cells  10  , consisting of a dual passivation method at both the top and bottom interfaces of the perovskite active layer by introducing large organic cations at these interfaces. This resulted in improved performances with PCE beyond 23%, among the highest reported so far  10  . Specifically, two large organic A-site cations, i.e. 4-chloro-phenylethylammonium iodide (Cl-PEAI) and 4-fluoro-phenylethylammonium iodide (F-PEAI), were introduced at the interfaces of the perovskite absorber with both hole transport layer (HTL) and electron transport layer (ETL). Despite the clear improvement, questions regarding the physics behind the modified interfaces are still open  11  . Issues regarding the completeness of the coverage of the passivating layer  12  , whether a 2D perovskite is formed or not  13, 14  , and the possible effects on carrier extraction remain not fully understood. In a more general way, several studies focused on the recombination dynamics at the perovskite/selective interfaces by tracking the photoluminescence signal and its intensity  [15] [16] [17]  . For instance, the contributions of bulk and interfacial recombination currents were decoupled through the measurements of the quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) of the individual layer by all-optical techniques  18  . Stolterfoht and coworkers used transient and absolute photoluminescence (PL) imaging to visualise non-radiative recombination pathways at modified perovskite/C 60  19  electron transport layer. Here, we combine steady-state and time-resolved multidimensional photoluminescence imaging techniques to probe the main optoelectronic and transport properties of the optimised p-i-n devices. First, our results demonstrate that the Cl-PEAI and F-PEAI cations deposition result in a homogenous coverage of the perovskite surface. Second, we verify that no layered perovskite is formed. Moreover, we identify that interfacial passivation is the main mechanism driving the improvement of the device open circuit voltage (V oc ), as the boost of QFLS and the reduction of surface recombination rate are observed only after PCBM (ETL) deposition. Instead, the introduction of the cations at the perovskite bottom interface (HTL/perovskite) helps in the perovskite crystallisation process but does not significantly reduce the losses at that specific device interface, as demonstrated by the quantitative analysis of the QFLS. ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": ""PIN"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""fluorophenylethylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}}"
3648,15_11," Results Dual interfacial modified devices. The devices under investigation follow a p-i-n structure, as shown in Fig.  1a, d . The full stack includes: glass/Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)/Poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA)/A-cation/perovskite/A-cation/ [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/Bathocuproine (BCP)/silver. Ionic salts, namely piperidinium salt [BMP] + [BF 4 ] -20 , were added to the mixed cation double halide composition (Cs 0.05 (FA 5/6 MA 1/6 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.9 Br 0.1 ) 3 ). Three different types of cells were fabricated: a reference cell (Fig.  1a ) and devices with dual interfacial modification by F-PEAI and Cl-PEAI cations (Fig.  1d ). The cations, commonly used as precursor for 2D perovskite formation, were added in very low concentrations (of 0.5 mM) at the top interface, meanwhile 20 mM were added at the bottom interface. The use of such low concentrations did not lead to the formation of a 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase  10  , confirmed by XRD analysis reported in Supplementary Fig.  S1 , showing the characteristic perovskite reference peaks. However, as recently reported by Gharibzadeh et al  21  , 2D organic cations can be also employed to passivate both grain boundaries and interfacial defects in p-i-n configuration devices, allowing to achieve a substantial enhancement of the device performances. In this case the use of the top and bottom modification with the large organic cations is meant to improve the interfaces between the perovskite and the selective charge transport layers by simultaneously reducing the defect density and therefore the nonradiative recombination. The main photovoltaic characteristic parameters for the reference cell and the A-cations devices are reported in Fig.  1b, c , e and f. The addition of the cations induced an increase of all the main photovoltaic characteristics. The PCE of the devices in which both absorber interfaces were modified by A-cations is clearly enhanced, exhibiting values up to 23.34% for the Cl-PEAI and 23.22% for the F-PEAI. In particular, we can note a clear increase of the V oc from 1.10 V for the reference to 1.15 V using Cl-PEAI and exceeding 1.16 V using F-PEAI, which corresponds to a tenfold decrease of the dark current, i.e. of the carrier recombination rate. The current also slightly improved, in contrast with some previous observations in the literature, where the full formation of a 2D perovskite layer was acting as a blocking layer  22  . Remarkably, fill factor reached values up to 85 % on the Cl-PEAI and F-PEAI devices, within the highest ever reported for halide perovskite solar cells. Also, the devices do not show any hysteretic behaviour, as is shown in Supplementary Fig.  5 . Quantification of non-radiative losses at the interfaces. To better understand the origin of this evident improvement in terms of device performances we employed multi-dimensional photoluminescence and analysed the datasets by employing physical models to quantify the key parameters governing the carrier recombination and transport. Specifically, we used two different set-ups to investigate both steady-state and transient regimes, namely a Hyperspectral Imager (HI)  23  and a Time Resolved Fluorescence Imaging (TR-FLIM)  24  set-up. Photoluminescence (PL) spectrum images were acquired by using a blue laser (405 nm) and illuminating the samples from the thin films side to avoid optical artefacts induced by the glass. We acquired a series of PL calibrated maps of neat perovskite thin films deposited on glass, half devices (glass/ITO/PTAA/perovskite) and full devices without the silver top electrode (glass/ITO/PTAA/perovskite/ PCBM/BCP) of reference and Cl-PEAI or F-PEAI samples. Notably, the A-cations samples do not exhibit any 2D perovskite emission peak, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  3 . The lack of a 2D perovskite formation is thus further confirmed, corroborating the XRD measurements. The spatially averaged and absolutely calibrated values of each map were fitted by using a model based on Planck's law  25, 26  (see Fig.  2a  for PL spectra and fits of full devices), allowing to determine the QFLS values for each set of samples, reported in Fig.  2b  and in Table  1 . In Table  1  we also report the radiative level splitting (Δµ rad ) and the radiative open circuit voltage (V oc rad ). The Δµ rad is defined as: 4μ rad ¼ kT Á ln I ph qϕ em ð1Þ where I ph is the photocurrent due to the considered illumination and kT the thermal energy of the charge carriers and q is the elementary charge. The term ϕ em is the PL emission of the absorber in thermal equilibrium with its surrounding at 300 K. It means that only the thermal photons emitted in the dark by the  surrounding excite the device, which in return emits the very minimum PL photons flux possible. This PL flux depends on the bang gap energy, the temperature and the absorption coefficient, which is affected by the defect density. Moreover, we defined the radiative open circuit voltage V oc rad as: V rad oc ¼ kT q Á ln J sc J 0rad ð2Þ Where kT is the thermal energy of the charge carriers, q is the elementary charge, J sc is the short-circuit current density of the solar cell and J 0rad is the radiative current  27, 28  . Specifically: J 0rad ¼ q Z EQEðEÞϕ 300K BB E ð ÞdE ð3Þ with EQE being the external quantum efficiency of the full devices. We considered the radiative QFLS (Δµ rad ) as the radiative limit for the optical measurements and the V oc rad as the upper limit for the open-circuit voltage measured by electrical characterisation. The small difference of the values determined for the two limits arises from the fact that the V oc rad depends not only from optical properties of the absorber and the radiative recombination but also from the collection and the injection of carriers. We obtained values of QFLS for neat perovskite thin films equal to 1.24 eV for the reference sample and 1.25 eV for the two A-cations samples, corresponding to 80-90 meV losses if compared to the radiative QFLS (Δµ rad ) that is equal to 1.33 eV in all cases. Interestingly, the main impact of the organic cation passivation is observed for full devices. In this case, the difference between reference and A-cations containing samples is in the range of 60-70 meV, proving that the cations have drastically reduced the non-radiative recombination at the interface absorber/ETL. Conversely, when considering neat perovskite or half devices the addition of the cations resulted in an improvement of only 10-20 meV. Therefore, the main passivation mechanism acting relates to the interfacial passivation at the interface absorber/ ETL. The introduction of the organic cations at the interface HTL/absorber favoured the perovskite crystallisation on the PTAA surface, but did not drastically reduce the losses at that interface. It is worth noting that the interface perovskite/PCBM appears to be particularly critical for device optimisation. The fast recombination observed at this specific interface represents a major loss mechanism for solar cell operation  29  . Moreover, we linked the QFLS of full devices to the V oc measured on full devices  30  by finding a good agreement between the two values, thus confirming the direct relationship between optical and electrical measurements. A similar approach to evaluate the recombination processes of 3D-2D interfaces in a n-i-p architecture was performed by Sutanto et al.  22  , where the interfacial passivation was considered as the main process affecting the losses. However, cation interfacial passivation, not only reduce the non-radiative recombination, but also favour the carrier extraction that, on the contrary, is limited in the case of full 2D perovskite formation at the interfaces, acting as a barrier for the photo-generated carriers  22  . Finally, we determine the total losses due to non-radiative recombination in full devices by comparing the radiative voltage radiative voltage V oc rad with the measured V oc (ΔV= V oc rad -V oc ). In the reference sample ΔV ref is equal to 0.21 eV, while in the A-cations devices ΔV corresponds to 0.16 eV in the case of Cl-PEAI and to 0.15 eV in the case of F-PEAI, thus confirming the beneficial role played by the addition of the cations on the charge losses. To gain further insights regarding the carrier dynamics, we performed TR-FLIM analysis on two sets of samples: (i) thin films on glass and (ii) full cell devices (without the Ag metallic layer to allow for illumination from both sides). For both sets of samples, we analysed a reference sample with only bulk perovskite as well as Cl-PEAI and F-PEAI samples. The experiments were performed using a wide field illumination via a pulsed 532 nm laser with repetition rate of 40 kHz. For each sample, the fluence of the laser was varied from low (~10 11 ph.cm -2 ) to high level (~1.5 × 10 12 ph.cm -2 ) and all the samples were measured with both top and bottom illumination (and light collection). A complete list of the available data and conditions is reported in the Supplementary Information. Decays averaged over the image for low fluence (~10 11 ph.cm -2 ) by illuminating the samples from the thin films side are presented in Fig.  2c  (neat perovskite) and 2d (full devices). In the case of bare absorbers, the three decays are very similar, whereas for the full devices, the samples with the added A-cation layers show slower decay than the reference. We estimate that the slightly higher PL level obtained for the Cl-PEAI bare absorbers is not discriminating enough to conclude that this cation has a better passivation effect than its F-PEAI counterpart. Slower decays of multilayer samples do not necessarily imply better devices as passivation layers could hinder the amplitude of the current of charges flowing out of the cell. In this case, considering also that the short-circuit currents slightly increased upon modification with the A-cations (see Fig.  1c ), we can conclude that this passivation approach allows to reduce non-radiative recombination at the perovskite-charge transport layer interfaces while allowing for high currents to flow. Transient measurements thus confirmed that the passivation plays a key role only at the perovskite-charge transport layer interface, as also observed in the steady-state study. Importantly, the time-resolved analysis also proves that high non-radiative recombination is responsible for the fast decay of the reference cell of Fig.  2d , that therefore cannot be attributed to carrier extraction as sometimes reported in the literature  31, 32  . Next, we treated the datasets by using drift-diffusion model in order to quantify the induced passivation. However, fitting decays of multilayer samples remains challenging, as an incorrect modelling of the layer stack, of the band alignment or of the boundary conditions can easily lead to data misinterpretation  16, 33  . To overcome this issue, we chose to fit the simplest model possible, that is based on a thin film without the neighbouring extracting layers. Supplementary Figure  10  represents the fitting results of the cells' decays, the green dotted line is the fitted model, while the coloured curves correspond to the experimental data. We fit a unique drift-diffusion model to represent simultaneously four curves, i.e. decays acquired in bottom and top configuration at low and high fluence. The fitted parameters are the top and bottom surface recombination velocitiesall the other parameters are fixed, see Supplementary Materials for more details.

3665,109_3,"Improvements to perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have focused on increasing their power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability and maintaining high performance upon scale-up to module sizes. We report that replacing the commonly used mesoporous-titanium dioxide electron transport layer (ETL) with a thin layer of polyacrylic acid-stabilized tin(IV) oxide quantum dots (paa-QD-SnO 2 ) on the compact-titanium dioxide enhanced light capture and largely suppressed nonradiative recombination at the ETL-perovskite interface. The use of paa-QD-SnO 2 as electron-selective contact enabled PSCs (0.08 square centimeters) with a PCE of 25.7% (certified 25.4%) and high operational stability and facilitated the scale-up of the PSCs to larger areas. PCEs of  23.3, 21.7 , and 20.6% were achieved for PSCs with active areas of 1, 20, and 64 square centimeters, respectively. E fforts to realize metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of >23% have focused on formamidinium-rich lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) formulations (1-7) because their narrower bandgap is closer to the Shockley-Queisser optimum than for methylammoniumbased or mixed-halide perovskites  (8) . By fully using the broad absorption spectrum of FAPbI 3 , a certified PCE of 25.21% with a short-circuit current density (J sc ) of >26 mA/cm 2 was obtained for the mesoporous-structure PSCs  (7) . However, the mesoporous-TiO 2 (m-TiO 2 ) electron transport layer (ETL) may show unwanted photocatalytic effects under ultraviolet (UV) light illumination, and the low electron mobility of m-TiO 2 limits the charge transport  (9) (10) (11) . Among alternative metal oxide ETLs (10-17) for PSCs, SnO 2 -based PSCs could potentially be more efficient and stable given that SnO 2 is UV resistant and has a higher carrier mobility than TiO 2 , which facilitates electron extraction and transport  (10) (11) (12) . Several techniques, such as spin coating  (11, 16) , atomic layer deposition  (1) , and chemical bath deposition (CBD)  (12, 17) , have been used to deposit the SnO 2 ETLs. Spin-coated SnO 2 ETL from a SnO 2 colloidal quantum dot (QD-SnO 2 ) solution onto the indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) substrate enabled a certified PCE of >23% for the corresponding planar-structure PSCs  (2, 16) . Recently, a thin SnO 2 ETL on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) deposited with a well-controlled CBD method enabled PSCs with a certified PCE of 25.19%, because of the improved carrier properties of SnO 2 ETL  (17) . However, compared with the m-TiO 2 -based PSCs, the SnO 2 -based PSCs still suffered from a relatively low J sc of <26 mA/cm 2 , which is attributed to the optical losses arising from reflection and destructive interference of the incident light waves at the interfaces. One approach to reduce these optical losses is to use the textured surface of FTO as the front contact that scatters the incoming radiation, destroying the coherence of the incoming light and affording light trapping by increasing the optical path length  (18) . The enhanced light absorption by the perovskite benefits the photocurrent delivered by the photovoltaic (PV) cell. Similar strategies have been used for textured crystalline silicon-based PSCs  (19) . However, early efforts to deposit a thin, uniform, and high-quality SnO 2 ETL using a solution process were incompatible with the underlying textured FTO surface  (1, 12, (20) (21) (22) , causing optical losses. The highest reported J sc of SnO 2 -based PSCs of ~25.2 mA/cm 2   (17, 20)  still limits the overall PV performance. Here we introduce an architecture for the ETL of PSCs that consists of a compact-TiO 2 (c-TiO 2 ) blocking layer covered by a thin layer of polyacrylic acid (PAA)-stabilized QD-SnO 2 (paa-QD-SnO 2 ) deposited in a contiguous and conformal manner on the textured FTO. The uniform bilayer of paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 largely improved the perovskite's absorption of sunlight and formed an outstanding electron-selective contact with the perovskite film. The quantum size effect increased the bandgap of the QD-SnO 2 from 3.6 eV for bulk SnO 2 to ~4 eV  (21, 23)  and produced a corresponding upward shift of its conduction band edge energy. This shift aligned it well with the conduction band edge of the perovskite so that electron capture by the SnO 2 -based ETL proceeded with minimal energy losses  (5, 11, 16, 21) . PAA, a polymer binder, was added to the SnO 2 QD solution to attach the colloidal QD-SnO 2 firmly to the c-TiO 2 surface, providing a contiguous, thin, and conformal SnO 2 layer that fully covered the c-TiO 2 layer underneath. The carboxyl groups of PAA undergo strong hydrogen and coordinative bonding with the metal oxide surface, facilitating the lamination process, especially for production on a large scale  (24) (25) (26) . By choosing FTO substrates with suitable diffuse transmittance and reflectance, the textured paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer enabled a PCE of 25.7% (certified 25.4%) with a J sc of 26.4 mA/cm 2 and high stability for the corresponding PSCs. We further demonstrate that the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer could be applied to realize large PSC modules with an active area up to 64 cm 2 while maintaining a PCE of >20%. We investigated the microstructures of the spin-coated QD-SnO 2 layer on the c-TiO 2 using commercially available SnO 2 colloidal QDs with and without PAA. Unless otherwise noted, the QD-SnO 2 solution was diluted by deionized water  (1:20)  in this study. Figure  S1 , A to C, shows the top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the c-TiO 2 , QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 , and paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 , respectively. Because of the textured surface, the c-TiO 2 layer was not fully covered by the spin-coated QD-SnO 2 (fig.  S1B ). In contrast, a uniform, conformal paa-QD-SnO 2 layer was formed (fig.  S1C ). Atomic force microscopy images (fig.  S1 , D to F) further confirmed the uniform morphology of the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 (fig.  S1F ), which is different from that of the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 (fig.  S1E ). Figure  1 , A and B, shows the cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 and paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayers on FTO substrates, respectively. The QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer presented an ununiform distribution over the FTO surface with a thickness that varied from ~30 (vertex region) to ~70 nm (valley region), while the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer had a uniform and conformal distribution over the FTO surface with a uniform thickness of ~30 nm. The different distribution between QD-SnO 2 and paa-QD-SnO 2 layers can also be seen clearly from the cross-sectional SEM images (fig.  S2, A  and B ), peaks at ~2954 and ~1716 cm -1 that arise from C-H and C=O stretching vibrations of PAA (fig.  S7A ) and a characteristic peak at ~574 cm -1 of the Sn-O vibration (fig.  S7B ). The Sn-O peak shifted to ~594 cm -1 for the paa-QD-SnO 2 , and the C-H and C=O stretching vibrations shifted to ~3012 and ~1628 cm -1 , respectively (fig.  S7C ), demonstrating that PAA interacted with QD-SnO 2  (27) . We chose FAPbI 3 as the perovskite layer, and details of its fabrication can be found in the supplementary materials (SM) or a previous report  (3) . Top-view SEM images of the FAPbI 3 films spin-coated on different ETLs, including c-TiO 2 , m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 , QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 , and paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 , are shown in fig.  S8 , A to D, respectively. Compact and dense surface morphologies were observed for all the perovskite films. Figure  S9A  showed identical x-ray diffraction (XRD) peak positions for all samples at 14.1°and 28.2°, which correspond to the (001) and (002) crystal planes of a-FAPbI 3  (3) (4) (5) . All the perovskite films had identical full width at half maximum for the main (001) peak (fig.  S9B ). We conclude that the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films are not affected substantially by the different ETLs. The PSCs with an active area of 0.08 cm 2 were fabricated in a conventional n-i-p structure, FTO/ETL/perovskite/OAI/spiro-MeOTAD/Au, where OAI is octylammonium iodide and spiro-MeOTAD is 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene. We performed the quasi-steady-state current-voltage (QSS-IV) measurement (Fig.  2A ), which was used for the certification of PSCs by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Newport Inc. Details of the QSS-IV measurements are given in the SM. All the PSCs were fully aged in the ambient condition for 100 hours before the measurements. The c-TiO 2 -based cell had a low PCE of 17.27% under the QSS-IV measurement. For the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based PSC, a PCE of 23.74% with a J sc of 25.74 mA/cm 2 , an opencircuit voltage (V oc ) of 1.142 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 80.79% was obtained, which are consistent with the previous reports  (3, 7) . Compared with the mesoporous-structured devices, the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cell had a higher V oc of 1.164 V but a lower J sc of 25.12 mA/cm 2 , resulting in a PCE of 23.29%. The J sc of the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based PSC is similar to the values reported for the SnO 2 -based cells in the literature  (17, 20) . With the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 ETL, the PSC exhibited a high PCE of 25.18% with a considerably improved J sc of 26.28 mA/cm 2 , V oc of 1.177 V, and FF of 81.49%, matching the 25.39% efficiency certified by Newport Inc. (figs. S10 and S11). The conventional J-V measurements under both forward and reverse scans were also performed (fig.  S12 ). The detailed PV parameters are summarized in table  S1 . A substantially different PV value was obtained for the c-TiO 2 -based cell under QSS-IV (Fig.  2A ) and conventional J-V measurements (fig.  S12A ), whereas the other cells showed similar PV results, indicating that the c-TiO 2 -based cell is unstable and that the single c-TiO 2 layer is not a proper ETL for PSCs  (28, 29) . The contrasting feature of the c-TiO 2 -based cell compared with the other cells in Fig.  2A  and fig. S12A is discussed in note 1 of the SM. Hereafter, the c-TiO 2 -based cells will not be discussed. A statistical distribution of the PCE of all the PSCs (Fig.  2B ) shows that the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based PSC had the highest averaged values. Details of the statistical PV parameters of all different ETL-based cells are shown in fig.  S13 . The paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cell is the target of the discussions that follow. The J sc of the PSCs measured under the solar simulator was verified with external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. The target cell had slightly higher EQE than the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based PSC over the entire absorption spectrum (Fig.  2C ), resulting in a higher integrated J sc of 26.01 mA/cm 2 ; however, a relatively lower integrated J sc of 25.06 mA/cm 2 was obtained for the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based device than for the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cell (25.69 mA/cm 2 ). The high J sc of the target cell was attributed to the desired light scattering that prolongs the optical length, enhancing the light absorption by the perovskite with the conformal structured paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer over the FTO substrate. This is confirmed with the highest diffuse transmittance (haze) of paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 when compared with the other ETLs shown in fig.  S14A . The higher transmittance of paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 than the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 (fig.  S14B ) may be traced back to the thinner film thickness, as shown in the optical simulations (fig.  S14, C  and D ), which could also contribute to the high J sc . We further compared the J sc obtained for the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2based PSCs using different substrates (fig.  S15 ). The Asahi FTO glass with high diffuse transmittance was the most suitable substrate for achieving a high J sc . The effect of the ETL composition on the photon flux emitted by the PSCs measured in steady state at an excitation photon flux equivalent to 1 sun is shown in Fig.  2D . The investigated devices were complete solar cells without the Au back contact. Compared with the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2and QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2based devices, the target cell had much higher photoluminescence (PL) intensity, reaching a PL quantum yield (PLQY) of 7.5%. This indicates a reduced nonradiative recombination at the interface between perovskite and paa-QD-SnO 2 ETL. Details of the measurements and calculations of PLQY are shown in SM note 2. From the PLQY measurements, we derived the quasi-Fermi level splitting (DE F ) in the perovskite under 1 sun illumination (SM note 3) and compared the (DE F ) with the V oc measured from the same device. DE F and V oc showed the same trend, indicating that the V oc increase can be partly attributed to the reduced nonradiative recombination. The DE F / q-V oc offset (where q is the elementary charge), however, is different. For the target cell, it is 10 mV lower than that of the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2based cells, indicating a better energetic alignment at the interfaces  (30) . Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements on the surface of different ETLs (fig.  S16 ) showed that the conduction band of paa-QD-SnO 2 matched better with perovskite than the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 , which could facilitate the charge transfer from perovskite to the ETL (fig.  S17 ). Detailed analysis of the UPS data is shown in SM note 4. Figure  S18, A  and B , shows the time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of the perovskite films on different ETLs measured from both the perovskite and the glass sides. The perovskite film deposited on paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 had the fastest decay among all the samples. Because it has a low nonradiative recombination rate, the fast decay is dominated by the favored interfacial electron transfer. The electron mobility measurements (fig.  S18C ) revealed that the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 layer had the highest carrier mobility. All these results indicate a superior charge extraction from perovskite to the paa-QD-SnO 2 ETL. Regarding the reduced nonradiative recombination, we determined the EQE of electroluminescence (EQE EL ) on representative PSC devices. Figure  2E  shows an EQE EL of 12.5% for the target cell at an injection current density of 26 mA/cm 2 corresponding to the J sc under 1 sun illumination, whereas the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2and QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cells have an EQE EL of 2.5 and 8.3%, respectively, under the same conditions. Thus, the nonradiative recombination rate in the PSC was reduced by 80% simply by replacing the m-TiO 2 with a paa-QD-SnO 2 electron-selective contact layer. The highest obtained V oc of 1.22 V (fig.  S19 ), which is near the V oc predicted from EQE EL according to the reciprocity theorem  (31, 32) , measured without the metal mask reached 98% of the radiative limit V oc (1.25 V)  (2, 5) . We also conducted transient photovoltage measurements for the PSCs (fig.  S20A ). The target cell showed a slower V oc decay than the reference cells, indicating a slower charge recombination rate. The dark J-V curves (fig.  S20B ) showed the lowest reverse saturation current for the target cell, pushing the onset of the dark current to the highest voltages, which also reflected the lowest interfacial nonradiative recombination. Figure  2F  shows the light intensitydependent V oc measurements for the PSCs. For both the reference and target cells, the measured V oc was linearly dependent on the logarithm of the light intensity. The diode ideality factor n id , deduced from the slope described by n id k B T/q, where k B is the Boltzmann constant and T is temperature, was 1.83, 1.79, and 1.46 for the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2and QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cells and the target cell, respectively. The reduced n id contributed to the increased FF of the target cell, as the FF critically depends on the n id  (33) . The reduced n id is also consistent with the PLQY, TRPL, EQE EL , transient photovoltage decay, and dark J-V measurements, unambiguously supporting the conclusion of reduced nonradiative recombination of the target PSC using paa-QD-SnO 2 ETL. The decreased nonradiative recombination manifests itself by much stronger photoand electroluminescence (Fig.  2, C  and D ) as well as a lower ideality factor (Fig.  2E ) enabling very high fill factor of 83.8% to be reached by our target device (table  S2 ). Further strong support for our conclusion comes from the observation of a slower transient photovoltage decay (fig.  S20A ) and higher electron mobility (fig.  S20B ) as well as the dark J-V measurements of the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2based cell compared with the control devices. The substantial reduction of the trap-assisted nonradiative recombination is the main reason for the reduced V oc deficit of our target cell of ~310 mV as compared with ~350 mV for the mesoporous-structure cell [bandgap of our perovskite film was calculated to be 1.53 eV (3)], which is one of the lowest values reported in the field of PSCs. Scale-up of the PSCs to module size is another requirement for their commercial exploitation. We used paa-QD-SnO 2 @TiO 2 ETL to fabricate perovskite solar mini-modules with active areas up to 64 cm 2 . Details of the fabrication process for the solar modules can be found in the SM and movie S1. Figure  3A  shows the J-V curves and images of the perovskite mini-modules with different active areas. The highest PCEs achieved for the PSCs with active areas of 1, 20, and 64 cm 2 were 23.3, 21.7, and 20.6%, respectively. Movie S2 shows a typical measurement for the 64 cm 2 perovskite solar modules. Figure  S21A  illustrates a solar module with subcells connected in series with a magnified view of the contact connections, and a geometrical FF (GFF) was calculated to be 95.6% according to the SEM images (fig.  S21B ) of the interconnections. Details of the PV parameters are summarized in table  S2 . The decrease of the PCE with increased device size is mainly caused by a decreased FF. The V oc of the module (table  S2 ) divided by the number of stripes is 18.5 V/16 = 1.156 V, which is equal to the V oc of the 1 cm 2 cell. Hence, there is no additional V oc loss in the module. Therefore, we attribute the FF decrease to the increased series resistance, including transport layer resistances, contact resistances, and interconnect resistance. We sent the PSC modules to an independent laboratory (OMA Company, Republic of Korea) for certification. PCEs of 21.66% (fig.  S22 ) and 20.55% (fig.  S23 ) were confirmed for the PSC mini-modules with active areas of 20 and 64 cm 2 , respectively, which agreed well with the measurements in our laboratory, and are compared with other reported values in fig.  S24 . We further compared the statistical distribution of the PCEs for the mesoporous-based (Fig.  3B ) and target (Fig.  3C ) perovskite minimodules. For the perovskite modules with the same active area (1, 20, or 64 cm 2 ), the target modules had higher averaged PCE and narrower PCE distributions than the mesoporousbased modules. The averaged PCE of the 64 cm 2 PSC module increased by ~30% by simply replacing the m-TiO 2 with paa-QD-SnO 2 , indicating that the paa-QD-SnO 2 could be uniformly coated on the large-size substrates. The statistical distribution of the PV parameters (fig.  S25 ) further revealed that the V oc and FF of the mesoporous-based modules decreased significantly more than that of the target PSC modules. The shunt resistance of our solar modules retained a typical value of >4000 ohms•cm 2 (table  S3 ), indicating that losses from leakage currents across shunts produced during scale-up are negligible. We attribute the small decrease of V oc and FF for the target PSC modules to the low contact resistance (fig.  S26, A  and B ) because of the easier laser scribing as well as low series resistance and low interfacial defects of the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer. Figure  4A  shows the 1000-hour shelf life tested with unsealed devices in ambient air at 25% relative humidity (RH) and 25°C. The target PSC retained 80% of the maximum PCE (25.7%) after 1000-hour storage, whereas the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2and QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2based PSCs decreased to almost 30 and 40% of the initial efficiency, respectively, indicating that the target cell is more resistant to the moisture and oxygen than the widely used mesoporous structured PSCs. We also performed the operational stability test for the unsealed devices in a N 2 environment under maximum power point (MPP) tracking conditions using a light-emitting diode lamp with a calibrated light intensity of 100 mW/cm 2 . More details about the MPP tests can be found in the SM and in previous reports  (5, 7) . Figure  4B  shows that the target cell had higher PCE than the reference cell during the 350-hour MPP tracking test. From the detailed PV parameters during the MPP tracking measure-ments (fig.  S27 ), it is clear that the higher performance of the target PSC is due to the higher and rather stable V oc , which decreased less compared with the reference cells. The main degradation of the target cell is the decline of FF (fig.  S27 ), which is attributed to the de-doping of lithium from the hole-transport layer (HTL)  (5, 34) . We further tested the sealed devices under ambient conditions. Figure  S28  shows that 70.5% of the initial efficiency of the target cell was retained after 700-hour light-soaking test, whereas the efficiency of the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cell declined 45% over the same testing time. To assess the suitability of the cells for real applications, we performed an MPP stability test for the encapsulated target cell under ambient conditions. Figure  S29  shows that 95% of the initial efficiency was retained for the sealed target cell after 100 hours MPP tracking and 2 hours dark recovery under ambient conditions. The substantial decline of FF is still the main reason for the performance loss. Future studies of additive-free HTLs will be conducted to enhance the stability of PSCs. Improvements to perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have focused on increasing their power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability and maintaining high performance upon scale-up to module sizes. We report that replacing the commonly used mesoporous-titanium dioxide electron transport layer (ETL) with a thin layer of polyacrylic acid-stabilized tin(IV) oxide quantum dots (paa-QD-SnO 2 ) on the compact-titanium dioxide enhanced light capture and largely suppressed nonradiative recombination at the ETL-perovskite interface. The use of paa-QD-SnO 2 as electron-selective contact enabled PSCs (0.08 square centimeters) with a PCE of 25.7% (certified 25.4%) and high operational stability and facilitated the scale-up of the PSCs to larger areas. PCEs of 23.3, 21.7, and 20.6% were achieved for PSCs with active areas of 1, 20, and 64 square centimeters, respectively. E fforts to realize metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of >23% have focused on formamidinium-rich lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) formulations (1-7) because their narrower bandgap is closer to the Shockley-Queisser optimum than for methylammoniumbased or mixed-halide perovskites  (8) . By fully using the broad absorption spectrum of FAPbI 3 , a certified PCE of 25.21% with a short-circuit current density (J sc ) of >26 mA/cm 2 was obtained for the mesoporous-structure PSCs  (7) . However, the mesoporous-TiO 2 (m-TiO 2 ) electron transport layer (ETL) may show unwanted photocatalytic effects under ultraviolet (UV) light illumination, and the low electron mobility of m-TiO 2 limits the charge transport  (9) (10) (11) . Among alternative metal oxide ETLs (10-17) for PSCs, SnO 2 -based PSCs could potentially be more efficient and stable given that SnO 2 is UV resistant and has a higher carrier mobility than TiO 2 , which facilitates electron extraction and transport  (10) (11) (12) . Several techniques, such as spin coating  (11, 16) , atomic layer deposition (1), and chemical bath deposition (CBD)  (12, 17) , have been used to deposit the SnO 2 ETLs. Spin-coated SnO 2 ETL from a SnO 2 colloidal quantum dot (QD-SnO 2 ) solution onto the indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) substrate enabled a certified PCE of >23% for the corresponding planar-structure PSCs  (2, 16) . Recently, a thin SnO 2 ETL on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) deposited with a well-controlled CBD method enabled PSCs with a certified PCE of 25.19%, because of the improved carrier properties of SnO 2 ETL  (17) . However, compared with the m-TiO 2 -based PSCs, the SnO 2 -based PSCs still suffered from a relatively low J sc of <26 mA/cm 2 , which is attributed to the optical losses arising from reflection and destructive interference of the incident light waves at the interfaces. One approach to reduce these optical losses is to use the textured surface of FTO as the front contact that scatters the incoming radiation, destroying the coherence of the incoming light and affording light trapping by increasing the optical path length  (18) . The enhanced light absorption by the perovskite benefits the photocurrent delivered by the photovoltaic (PV) cell. Similar strategies have been used for textured crystalline silicon-based PSCs  (19) . However, early efforts to deposit a thin, uniform, and high-quality SnO 2 ETL using a solution process were incompatible with the underlying textured FTO surface  (1, 12, (20) (21) (22) , causing optical losses. The highest reported J sc of SnO 2 -based PSCs of ~25.2 mA/cm 2  (17, 20)  still limits the overall PV performance. Here we introduce an architecture for the ETL of PSCs that consists of a compact-TiO 2 (c-TiO 2 ) blocking layer covered by a thin layer of polyacrylic acid (PAA)-stabilized QD-SnO 2 (paa-QD-SnO 2 ) deposited in a contiguous and conformal manner on the textured FTO. The uniform bilayer of paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 largely improved the perovskite's absorption of sunlight and formed an outstanding electron-selective contact with the perovskite film. The quantum size effect increased the bandgap of the QD-SnO 2 from 3.6 eV for bulk SnO 2 to ~4 eV  (21, 23)  and produced a corresponding upward shift of its conduction band edge energy. This shift aligned it well with the conduction band edge of the perovskite so that electron capture by the SnO 2 -based ETL proceeded with minimal energy losses  (5, 11, 16, 21) . PAA, a polymer binder, was added to the SnO 2 QD solution to attach the colloidal QD-SnO 2 firmly to the c-TiO 2 surface, providing a contiguous, thin, and conformal SnO 2 layer that fully covered the c-TiO 2 layer underneath. The carboxyl groups of PAA undergo strong hydrogen and coordinative bonding with the metal oxide surface, facilitating the lamination process, especially for production on a large scale  (24) (25) (26) . By choosing FTO substrates with suitable diffuse transmittance and reflectance, the textured paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer enabled a PCE of 25.7% (certified 25.4%) with a J sc of 26.4 mA/cm 2 and high stability for the corresponding PSCs. We further demonstrate that the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer could be applied to realize large PSC modules with an active area up to 64 cm 2 while maintaining a PCE of >20%. We investigated the microstructures of the spin-coated QD-SnO 2 layer on the c-TiO 2 using commercially available SnO 2 colloidal QDs with and without PAA. Unless otherwise noted, the QD-SnO 2 solution was diluted by deionized water (1:20) in this study. Figure  S1 , A to C, shows the top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the c-TiO 2 , QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 , and paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 , respectively. Because of the textured surface, the c-TiO 2 layer was not fully covered by the spin-coated QD-SnO 2 (fig.  S1B ). In contrast, a uniform, conformal paa-QD-SnO 2 layer was formed (fig.  S1C ). Atomic force microscopy images (fig.  S1 , D to F) further confirmed the uniform morphology of the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 (fig.  S1F ), which is different from that of the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 (fig.  S1E ). Figure  1 , A and B, shows the cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 and paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayers on FTO substrates, respectively. The QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer presented an ununiform distribution over the FTO surface with a thickness that varied from ~30 (vertex region) to ~70 nm (valley region), while the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer had a uniform and conformal distribution over the FTO surface with a uniform thickness of ~30 nm. The different distribution between QD-SnO 2 and paa-QD-SnO 2 layers can also be seen clearly from the cross-sectional SEM images (fig.  S2, A  and B ), suggesting that PAA played a key role in forming the uniform and contiguous layer of paa-QD-SnO 2 ETL, as shown in fig.  S3 . Element mapping with energy-disperse x-ray spectroscopy of Ti (Fig.  1, C  and D ) and Sn (Fig.  1, E  and F ) revealed a coverage of TiO 2 and SnO 2 over the FTO surface for both QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 and paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayers. The selected-area electron diffraction generated by TEM for the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer (fig.  S4 ) showed that both QD-SnO 2 and c-TiO 2 were polycrystalline. The paa-QD-SnO 2 had a particle size of ~4 nm (fig.  S4C ), which is also confirmed by the TEM images (fig.  S5, A to C ) and dynamic light scattering analysis (fig.  S5, D  and E ). The interactions between PAA and QD-SnO 2 were studied by the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (fig.  S6 ) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements (fig.  S7 ). It is clear from the XPS measurements that both QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 and paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayers showed characteristic peaks attributed to Sn (fig.  S6A ); however, the Sn 3d peaks of paa-QD-SnO 2 shifted to high binding energy by ~0.2 eV compared with that of QD-SnO 2 , indicating that PAA was bonded to the QD-SnO peaks at ~2954 and ~1716 cm -1 that arise from C-H and C=O stretching vibrations of PAA (fig.  S7A ) and a characteristic peak at ~574 cm -1 of the Sn-O vibration (fig.  S7B ). The Sn-O peak shifted to ~594 cm -1 for the paa-QD-SnO 2 , and the C-H and C=O stretching vibrations shifted to ~3012 and ~1628 cm -1 , respectively (fig.  S7C ), demonstrating that PAA interacted with QD-SnO 2  (27) . We chose FAPbI 3 as the perovskite layer, and details of its fabrication can be found in the supplementary materials (SM) or a previous report  (3) . Top-view SEM images of the FAPbI 3 films spin-coated on different ETLs, including c-TiO 2 , m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 , QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 , and paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 , are shown in fig.  S8 , A to D, respectively. Compact and dense surface morphologies were observed for all the perovskite films. Figure  S9A  showed identical x-ray diffraction (XRD) peak positions for all samples at 14.1°and 28.2°, which correspond to the (001) and (002) crystal planes of a-FAPbI 3  (3) (4) (5) . All the perovskite films had identical full width at half maximum for the main (001) peak (fig.  S9B ). We conclude that the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films are not affected substantially by the different ETLs. The PSCs with an active area of 0.08 cm 2 were fabricated in a conventional n-i-p structure, FTO/ETL/perovskite/OAI/spiro-MeOTAD/Au, where OAI is octylammonium iodide and spiro-MeOTAD is 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene. We performed the quasi-steady-state current-voltage (QSS-IV) measurement (Fig.  2A ), which was used for the certification of PSCs by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Newport Inc. Details of the QSS-IV measurements are given in the SM. All the PSCs were fully aged in the ambient condition for 100 hours before the measurements. The c-TiO 2 -based cell had a low PCE of 17.27% under the QSS-IV measurement. For the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based PSC, a PCE of 23.74% with a J sc of 25.74 mA/cm 2 , an opencircuit voltage (V oc ) of 1.142 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 80.79% was obtained, which are consistent with the previous reports (3, 7). Compared with the mesoporous-structured devices, the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cell had a higher V oc of 1.164 V but a lower J sc of 25.12 mA/cm 2 , resulting in a PCE of 23.29%. The J sc of the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based PSC is similar to the values reported for the SnO 2 -based cells in the literature  (17, 20) . With the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 ETL, the PSC exhibited a high PCE of 25.18% with a considerably improved J sc of 26.28 mA/cm 2 , V oc of 1.177 V, and FF of 81.49%, matching the 25.39% efficiency certified by Newport Inc. (figs. S10 and S11). The conventional J-V measurements under both forward and reverse scans were also performed (fig.  S12 ). The detailed PV parameters are summarized in table  S1 . A substantially different PV value was obtained for the c-TiO 2 -based cell under QSS-IV (Fig.  2A ) and conventional J-V measurements (fig.  S12A ), whereas the other cells showed similar PV results, indicating that the c-TiO 2 -based cell is unstable and that the single c-TiO 2 layer is not a proper ETL for PSCs  (28, 29) . The contrasting feature of the c-TiO 2 -based cell compared with the other cells in Fig.  2A  and fig  The J sc of the PSCs measured under the solar simulator was verified with external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. The target cell had slightly higher EQE than the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based PSC over the entire absorption spectrum (Fig.  2C ), resulting in a higher integrated J sc of 26.01 mA/cm 2 ; however, a relatively lower integrated J sc of 25.06 mA/cm 2 was obtained for the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based device than for the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cell (25.69 mA/cm 2 ). The high J sc of the target cell was attributed to the desired light scattering that prolongs the optical length, enhancing the light absorption by the perovskite with the conformal structured paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer over the FTO substrate. This is confirmed with the highest diffuse transmittance (haze) of paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 when compared with the other ETLs shown in fig.  S14A . The higher transmittance of paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 than the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 (fig.  S14B ) may be traced back to the thinner film thickness, as shown in the optical simulations (fig.  S14, C  and D ), which could also contribute to the high J sc . We further compared the J sc obtained for the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2based PSCs using different substrates (fig.  S15 ). The Asahi FTO glass with high diffuse transmittance was the most suitable substrate for achieving a high J sc . The effect of the ETL composition on the photon flux emitted by the PSCs measured in steady state at an excitation photon flux equivalent to 1 sun is shown in Fig.  2D . The investigated devices were complete solar cells without the Au back contact. Compared with the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2and QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2based devices, the target cell had much higher photoluminescence (PL) intensity, reaching a PL quantum yield (PLQY) of 7.5%. This indicates a reduced nonradiative recombination at the interface between perovskite and paa-QD-SnO 2 ETL. Details of the measurements and calculations of PLQY are shown in SM note 2. From the PLQY measurements, we derived the quasi-Fermi level splitting (DE F ) in the perovskite under 1 sun illumination (SM note 3) and compared the (DE F ) with the V oc measured from the same device. DE F and V oc showed the same trend, indicating that the V oc increase can be partly attributed to the reduced nonradiative recombination. The DE F / q-V oc offset (where q is the elementary charge), however, is different. For the target cell, it is 10 mV lower than that of the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2based cells, indicating a better energetic alignment at the interfaces  (30) . Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements on the surface of different ETLs (fig.  S16 ) showed that the conduction band of paa-QD-SnO 2 matched better with perovskite than the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 , which could facilitate the charge transfer from perovskite to the ETL (fig.  S17 ). Detailed analysis of the UPS data is shown in SM note 4. Figure  S18, A  and B , shows the time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of the perovskite films on different ETLs measured from both the perovskite and the glass sides. The perovskite film deposited on paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 had the fastest decay among all the samples. Because it has a low nonradiative recombination rate, the fast decay is dominated by the favored interfacial electron transfer. The electron mobility measurements (fig.  S18C ) revealed that the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 layer had the highest carrier mobility. All these results indicate a superior charge extraction from perovskite to the paa-QD-SnO 2 ETL. Regarding the reduced nonradiative recombination, we determined the EQE of electroluminescence (EQE EL ) on representative PSC devices. Figure  2E  shows an EQE EL of 12.5% for the target cell at an injection current density of 26 mA/cm 2 corresponding to the J sc under 1 sun illumination, whereas the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2and QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cells have an EQE EL of 2.5 and 8.3%, respectively, under the same conditions. Thus, the nonradiative recombination rate in the PSC was reduced by 80% simply by replacing the m-TiO 2 with a paa-QD-SnO 2 electron-selective contact layer. The highest obtained V oc of 1.22 V (fig.  S19 ), which is near the V oc predicted from EQE EL according to the reciprocity theorem  (31, 32) , measured without the metal mask reached 98% of the radiative limit V oc (1.25 V)  (2, 5) . We also conducted transient photovoltage measurements for the PSCs (fig.  S20A ). The target cell showed a slower V oc decay than the reference cells, indicating a slower charge recombination rate. The dark J-V curves (fig.  S20B ) showed the lowest reverse saturation current for the target cell, pushing the onset of the dark current to the highest voltages, which also reflected the lowest interfacial nonradiative recombination. Figure  2F  shows the light intensitydependent V oc measurements for the PSCs. For both the reference and target cells, the measured V oc was linearly dependent on the logarithm of the light intensity. The diode ideality factor n id , deduced from the slope described by n id k B T/q, where k B is the Boltzmann constant and T is temperature, was 1.83, 1.79, and 1.46 for the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2and QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cells and the target cell, respectively. The reduced n id contributed to the increased FF of the target cell, as the FF critically depends on the n id  (33) . The reduced n id is also consistent with the PLQY, TRPL, EQE EL , transient photovoltage decay, and dark J-V measurements, unambiguously supporting the conclusion of reduced nonradiative recombination of the target PSC using paa-QD-SnO 2 ETL. The decreased nonradiative recombination manifests itself by much stronger photoand electroluminescence (Fig.  2, C  and D ) as well as a lower ideality factor (Fig.  2E ) enabling very high fill factor of 83.8% to be reached by our target device (table  S2 ). Further strong support for our conclusion comes from the observation of a slower transient photovoltage decay (fig.  S20A ) and higher electron mobility (fig.  S20B ) as well as the dark J-V measurements of the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2based cell compared with the control devices. The substantial reduction of the trap-assisted nonradiative recombination is the main reason for the reduced V oc deficit of our target cell of ~310 mV as compared with ~350 mV for the mesoporous-structure cell [bandgap of our perovskite film was calculated to be 1.53 eV (3)], which is one of the lowest values reported in the field of PSCs. Scale-up of the PSCs to module size is another requirement for their commercial exploitation. We used paa-QD-SnO 2 @TiO 2 ETL to fabricate perovskite solar mini-modules with active areas up to 64 cm 2 . Details of the fabrication process for the solar modules can be found in the SM and movie S1. Figure  3A  shows the J-V curves and images of the perovskite mini-modules with different active areas. The highest PCEs achieved for the PSCs with active areas of 1, 20, and 64 cm 2 were 23.3, 21.7, and 20.6%, respectively. Movie S2 shows a typical measurement for the 64 cm 2 perovskite solar modules. Figure  S21A  illustrates a solar module with subcells connected in series with a magnified view of the contact connections, and a geometrical FF (GFF) was calculated to be 95.6% according to the SEM images (fig.  S21B ) of the interconnections. Details of the PV parameters are summarized in table  S2 . The decrease of the PCE with increased device size is mainly caused by a decreased FF. The V oc of the module (table  S2 ) divided by the number of stripes is 18.5 V/16 = 1.156 V, which is equal to the V oc of the 1 cm 2 cell. Hence, there is no additional V oc loss in the module. Therefore, we attribute the FF decrease to the increased series resistance, including transport layer resistances, contact resistances, and interconnect resistance. We sent the PSC modules to an independent laboratory (OMA Company, Republic of Korea) for certification. PCEs of 21.66% (fig.  S22 ) and 20.55% (fig.  S23 ) were confirmed for the PSC mini-modules with active areas of 20 and 64 cm 2 , respectively, which agreed well with the measurements in our laboratory, and are compared with other reported values in fig.  S24 . We further compared the statistical distribution of the PCEs for the mesoporous-based (Fig.  3B ) and target (Fig.  3C ) perovskite minimodules. For the perovskite modules with the same active area (1, 20, or 64 cm 2 ), the target modules had higher averaged PCE and narrower PCE distributions than the mesoporousbased modules. The averaged PCE of the 64 cm 2 PSC module increased by ~30% by simply replacing the m-TiO 2 with paa-QD-SnO 2 , indicating that the paa-QD-SnO 2 could be uniformly coated on the large-size substrates. The statistical distribution of the PV parameters (fig.  S25 ) further revealed that the V oc and FF of the mesoporous-based modules decreased significantly more than that of the target PSC modules. The shunt resistance of our solar modules retained a typical value of >4000 ohms•cm 2 (table  S3 ), indicating that losses from leakage currents across shunts produced during scale-up are negligible. We attribute the small decrease of V oc and FF for the target PSC modules to the low contact resistance (fig.  S26, A  and B ) because of the easier laser scribing as well as low series resistance and low interfacial defects of the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer. Figure  4A  shows the 1000-hour shelf life tested with unsealed devices in ambient air at 25% relative humidity (RH) and 25°C. The target PSC retained 80% of the maximum PCE (25.7%) after 1000-hour storage, whereas the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2and QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2based PSCs decreased to almost 30 and 40% of the initial efficiency, respectively, indicating that the target cell is more resistant to the moisture and oxygen than the widely used mesoporous structured PSCs. We also performed the operational stability test for the unsealed devices in a N 2 environment under maximum power point (MPP) tracking conditions using a light-emitting diode lamp with a calibrated light intensity of 100 mW/cm 2 . More details about the MPP tests can be found in the SM and in previous reports  (5, 7) . Figure  4B  shows that the target cell had higher PCE than the reference cell during the 350-hour MPP tracking test. From the detailed PV parameters during the MPP tracking measure-ments (fig.  S27 ), it is clear that the higher performance of the target PSC is due to the higher and rather stable V oc , which decreased less compared with the reference cells. The main degradation of the target cell is the decline of FF (fig.  S27 ), which is attributed to the de-doping of lithium from the hole-transport layer (HTL)  (5, 34) . We further tested the sealed devices under ambient conditions. Figure  S28  shows that 70.5% of the initial efficiency of the target cell was retained after 700-hour light-soaking test, whereas the efficiency of the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cell declined 45% over the same testing time. To assess the suitability of the cells for real applications, we performed an MPP stability test for the encapsulated target cell under ambient conditions. Figure  S29  shows that 95% of the initial efficiency was retained for the sealed target cell after 100 hours MPP tracking and 2 hours dark recovery under ambient conditions. The substantial decline of FF is still the main reason for the performance loss. Future studies of additive-free HTLs will be conducted to enhance the stability of PSCs.  ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null}","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": ""polyacrylic acid-stabilized tin(IV) oxide quantum dots"", ""hole_transport_layer"": ""Spiro-OMeTAD"", ""structure_pin_nip"": ""NIP"", ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""25"", ""temperature"": ""25"", ""time"": ""1000"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""25.7"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.177"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.8"", ""efficiency_cont"": ""0.4""}, ""test_2"": {""stability_type"": ""ISOSL"", ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""700"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.45""}}"

3689,148_9," SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURES AND TABLE The ORCID identification number(s) for the author(s) of this article can be found under  https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.201907757 . is the dominant loss mechanism.  [10]  Thus, surface passivation of the perovskite is considered the most effective approach to suppress nonradiative recombination losses and, concomitantly, improve the photovoltage.  [11]  Tavakoli et al. showed that by surface passivation of the perovskite with adamantine amine a PCE of 20.93% can be achieved for mesoscopic PSCs.  [12]  A recent report by Jiang et al. indicates that highly efficient planar PSCs can achieve 23.3% with perovskite surface passivation with phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI).  [5]  In this work, we attain a PCE of 23.5% by judicious tailoring of a defect mitigating agent based on benzylammonium iodide. We conceived and synthesized the new molecular passivator 4-tert-butyl-benzylammonium iodide (tBBAI). The bulky tert-butyl substitution group of tBBAI prevents the unwanted aggregation by steric repulsion as revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). tBBAI exhibits an outstanding passivation ability as implied by increased photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) accompanied by larger quasi-Fermi level splitting (ΔE F ) in the perovskite films, resulting in a high open circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.142 V. It is worth noting that the perovskite we use is iodide-rich with I:Br = 97:3, with an optical bandgap as low as 1.55 eV. Therefore, the voltage loss of the optimized device is ≈410 mV, approaching 90% of the radiative limit. This is considered as one of the lowest voltage losses for PSCs. Timeresolve photoluminescence (TRPL) experiments reveal that the PSCs with a tBBAI interfacial layer show enhanced charge transfer from the perovskite layer to HTL than the control devices, presumably related to a reduced hole-extraction barrier due to a better contact between highly polarized perovskite layer and the nonpolarized HTL,  [9]  resulting in a significant improvement in fill factor (FF) of 82% than 75%. In addition, the device with more hydrophobic tert-butyl substitution endowed tBBAI-passivated perovskite, the better resistivity to moisture. These results combined, highly efficient mesoscopic PSCs has been achieved with PCE up to 23.5%, where V OC and FF are as high as 1.142 V and 82.1%, respectively. In addition to the outstanding PV performance, tBBAI-passivated PSCs retained over 95% of their initial efficiency during PV operation for a period of 500 h under simulated full-sun irradiation. PEAI is one of the most widely used passivation agents reported so far.  [13]  While with enhanced PV performance and operational stability compared to nonpassivated PSCs, incremental studies on chemical tailoring of PEAI are rare. Our previous study proved that by substituting the hydrogen (H) of the benzene ring with fluorine (F), the free energy of the perovskite surface was significantly reduced, endowing the perovskite with superior stability against moisture in ambient air.  [6]  The perovskite layer Cs 0.05 FA 0.85 MA 0.10 Pb(I 0.97 Br 0.03 ) 3 with 5% excess of PbI 2 was fabricated using antisolvent method  [14]  and annealed at 120 °C for 20 min before applying the modulators. The passivation agent, PEAI and tBBAI were applied by spin coating on the perovskite surface with 15 × 10 -3 m solution in isopropanol without further annealing (Figure  1B ). The surface morphology of the PEAI and tBBAI-passivated perovskite films is characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the results are shown in Figure  1C-E . For the untreated neat perovskite film, it is observed that the domain size of the perovskite crystals is around 500 nm. After passivating with PEAI and tBBAI, their appearance remains unchanged, implying that the surface passivation does not alter the morphology of the perovskite active layer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to characterize the surface elemental properties of the passivated perovskite, and the results are summarized in Figure  2A-C   in Figure  2B . In the neat perovskite film, a CO peak at ≈288 eV is observed, which is related to the oxygen and water exposure of the surface of the perovskite film.  [5]  This peak is significantly suppressed in the XPS spectra of the passivated perovskite film, proving that surface passivation with PEAI and tBBAI can effectively protect the perovskite from oxygen and moisture in ambient air.  [5]  A further XPS depth profiling for tBBAI-passivated perovskite was carried out to reveal the out-ofplane direction elemental distribution as shown in Figure  2C . Compared to the spectra of the neat perovskite film (Figure  S1 , Supporting Information), the I 3d signal gradient of perovskite/ tBBAI starts at deeper part in the film, suggesting the tBBAI layer thickness of <5 nm. The structure of the unpassivated and passivated perovskite film is characterized by XRD. As shown in Figure  S2  in the Supporting Information. The detailed XRD for 2θ < 20° is shown in Figure  2D . Similar to a previous report,  [5]  nonpassivated perovskite film shows excessive amount of PbI 2 at ≈12.8°. For the PEAI-passivated perovskite film, diffraction peaks corresponding to PEAI at 2θ = 4.3°, 8.6°, and 12.9° are observed, implying crystalline PEAI on the surface of the perovskite film. The XRD spectrum of the tBBAI-passivated perovskite film exhibits no extra diffraction peaks, which suggests an amorphous morphology of the passivation layer. We attribute this result to an increased steric hindrance due to the tert-butyl substitution of tBBAI as compared to PEAI. We investigated the optoelectronic quality of the perovskite film by TRPL and steady-state absolute intensity photoluminescence (AIPL). TRPL measurements on samples with the structure glass/FTO/mp-Al 2 O 3 /perovskite/interface layer/ without and with HTL (spiro-OMeTAD) are shown in Figure  3 . For the samples without HTL (Figure  3A ), at t > 200 ns after the excitation pulse the TRPL curves can be well fitted with a (mono-) exponential function with the decay times shown in Table  S1  in the Supporting Information. We observe a significant difference between the surface treatment with the two modulators: The decay time for the PEAI-treated perovskite film is a factor of three and for tBBAI a factor of five higher than for the nonpassivated film. We apply numerical simulations to model the TRPL measurements at times beyond 200 ns. The details of these simulations are described in the Supporting Information (Note S1). Since the only difference between the samples is the surface layers, we fitted the numerical model to the data with only one free parameter, the surface recombination velocity S. For the sample with the longest decay time (tBBAI, black dots in Figure  3A ), the decay could be caused not only by S but also by nonradiative bulk recombinations (with monomolecular recombination rate constant k 1 , see Note in the Supporting Information) or radiative bimolecular recombinations (with bimolecular recombination rate constant k 2 ). Therefore, three extreme cases are considered, where the PL decay at later times for tBBAI is caused exclusively by nonradiative (bulk) recombinations ( , 0, 0 1 1 max 2 = = = k k k S ), by bimolecular radiative (bulk) recombinations ( , 0, 0 2 2 max 1 = = = k k k S ), and by surface recombinations (k 1 = k 2 = 0). The S-fits for all these cases are summarized in Table  S1    Information. Taking into account these cases, one can estimate the surface recombination velocity for the different samples, which is 33±3 cm s -1 for the control, 8±3 cm s -1 for PEAI, and 3±3 cm s -1 for tBBAI which demonstrates the positive effect on surface defect passivation of PEAI and even more pronounced of tBBAI. Figure  4A  shows the external PLQY ext of the perovskite films with the different interface layers and with HTL measured at an excess carrier generation rate corresponding to 1 sun conditions. We determined the PLQY ext by AIPL measurements with the method described by de Mello et al.,  [15]  PLQY ( = P E E L E E , where P is the AIPL spectral photon flux and L in is the spectral photon flux of the excitation beam. The respective AIPL data are shown in Figure  S3  in the Supporting Information. The PLQY ext can be expressed in terms of the radiative (R rad ) and nonradiative (R nr ) recombination rates PLQY ext = R rad /(R rad + R nr ) which makes it a useful tool to investigate bulk, interface, and surface charge recombination characteristics. As shown in Figure  4A , the PLQY ext of PEAI is about three times and of tBBAI eight times higher than the control sample without interface layer. The interface layers cause a significant decrease of interface recombinations at the perovskite/HTL interface which implies an improved defect chemistry. From PLQY ext the quasi-Fermi level splitting ΔE F can be calculated with the following equation:  [16]  ΔE F = q V OC,rad + kT ln(PLQY ext ), where V OC,rad is the radiative limit of V OC , the calculation of which is shown in the supplementary information (Note S2, Supporting Information). ΔE F /q for the differently treated films is shown in Figure  4B . The PEAItreated film shows a ΔE F increase of 28 meV and the tBBAItreated film an increase of 48 meV compared to the control sample without interface layer. Since ΔE F /q is the maximum V OC that a PSC with this layer structure can exhibit, we present measured V OC 's of the complete PSCs with similar layer structure in Figure  4B  as well. To be comparable with ΔE F /q, which is determined from quasi-steady-state PLQY ext measurements, we measured the quasi-steady-state V OC 's, i.e., stabilized after 2 min exposure under 1 sun simulated illumination conditions. We also show the stabilized V OC 's of the same samples after 30 min light soaking under 1 sun in ambient air. With PEAI surface treatment, the V OC increased by 25 mV from 1.086 to 1.111 V and with tBBAI by 41 mV to 1.125 V compared to the control sample, which is in good agreement with the trend seen in the ΔE F measurements. The offset of ≈40 mV between the stabilized V OC and ΔE F /q can be explained by energetic misalignment at both interfaces as has been shown by Caprioglio et al.  [17]  This demonstrates the beneficial effect of PEAI and tBBAI treatment in preventing interfacial charge carrier recombination. Furthermore, it shows that tBBAI is a significantly better interface passivation agent than PEAI with a 65% higher ΔV OC increase compared to the sample without interface  ","{""perovskite_composition"": null, ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1_2"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""50-70"", ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""500"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""4-tert-butyl-benzylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""23.5"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.95""}}","{""perovskite_composition"": ""Cs0.05FA0.85MA0.10Pb(I0.97Br0.03)3"", ""electron_transport_layer"": null, ""hole_transport_layer"": null, ""structure_pin_nip"": null, ""test_1_2"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": null, ""humidity"": ""50-70"", ""temperature"": null, ""time"": ""500"", ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": null, ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": null, ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": null}, ""test_1"": {""stability_type"": null, ""passivating_molecule"": ""4-tert-butyl-benzylammonium iodide"", ""humidity"": null, ""temperature"": null, ""time"": null, ""control_pce"": null, ""treated_pce"": ""23.5"", ""control_voc"": null, ""treated_voc"": ""1.142"", ""efficiency_control"": null, ""efficiency_tret"": ""0.95""}}"

B) Stabilized V OC and quasi-Fermi level splitting ΔE F /q for the layer structure glass/FTO/compact-TiO 2 /mesoscopic-TiO 2 /perovskite/interface layer/HTL. The stabilized V OC after 30 min light soaking is also shown. passivation layer. After 30 min under 1 sun light soaking the ΔV oc 's are 32 mV for PEAI and 56 mV for tBBAI-treated films, which confirms the trend. Note that there is a 15 mV V OC drop for the control sample, 9 mV drop for the PEAI, and a negligible V OC drop for the tBBAI-treated films. This shows that the interface layers used here also increase the short-term V OC stability under light soaking in ambient air and that tBBAI shows superior performance in comparison with PEAI. To further demonstrate the effect of these interface layers on the optoelectronic properties, we measured the TRPL of the passivated perovskites films with HTL (Figure  3B ). We attribute the rapid decay of the PL signal within the first 10-60 ns to three major processes: First, carrier diffusion leads to a fast decay of carrier concentration close to the front surface of the incident light pulse;  [18]  second, halide perovskites have a positively charged mid-gap trap state caused by iodide vacancies with a large capture cross-section for electrons. Once these trap states are filled they are neutral and, hence exhibit a very low capture cross-section for holes so that the hole lifetime is in the µs range.  [19]  This fast electron capture leads to a rapid decay of the PL signal at early times. Third, hole injection into the HTL also causes a rapid decay of the PL signal with a rate proportional to the carrier concentration at the interface, which is highest within the first ≈100 ns. Whereas the first two mechanisms are the same for all our samples, the third mechanism depends on the specific interface and HTL. Hence, the difference in TRPL for the first 60 ns is caused by different hole transfer rates into the HTL. The PEAI-treated film shows a significantly faster hole extraction into the HTL compared to the untreated film but it is outperformed by tBBAI. This faster charge transfer is very likely caused by a smaller hole transfer barrier and, concomitantly, by a lower hole transfer resistance. Due to the intrinsically high polarization of the perovskite material and the low polarization of the organic and hydrophobic spiro-OMeTAD, we expect a hole transport barrier that is related to the poor contact of HTL and perovskite. With the ambipolar passivation agent bearing ammonium iodide that coordinates with the perovskite and hydrophobic ligand similar to that of HTL, the barrier shall be minimized. If we compare the difference between PEAI and tBBAI, less crystalline tBBAI is most probably creating more even coverage on the surface of the perovskite (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information), creating better contact and at the same time a better defect passivation at the interface between HTL and perovskite. To demonstrate the advantage of the new passivation agent in solar cells, PSCs are fabricated with tBBAI as passivation agent; for comparison, PEAI and nonpassivated perovskites are applied. The PSCs have the n-i-p device architecture fluorinedoped tin oxide (FTO)/compact TiO 2 /mesoscopic TiO 2 /perovskite/PEAI or tBBAI/spiro-OMeTAD/gold. I-V curves of these cells under 1 sun illumination are shown in Figure  5A  and the corresponding PV parameters in Table  1 . A champion cell with a PCE of 23.5% is achieved with tBBAI passivation, with a V OC of 1142 mV, an FF of 82.1%, and a J SC of 25.1 mA cm -2 . This V OC represents a voltage loss of 408 mV with respect to the optical bandgap of 1.55 eV (derived from the inflection point of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum in Figure  5C ), which is 89.9% of the radiative limit of V oc of 1270 mV (see Note S2 in the Supporting Information). Negligible hysteresis of 1.8% and 0.8% is observed between the forward and reverse scan of PEAI and tBBAI, respectively. By contrast, the hysteresis of nonpassivated PSC is as high as 5.5%, with 20.1% PCE for the forward scan and 21.2% for the reverse scan. The PV metrics in Figure  S6  in the Supporting Information depict the high reproducibility of the PV performance in this study. Figure  5B  shows the stabilized Adv. Mater. 2020, 32, 1907757 power output at the maximum power point (MPP) for the best performing devices under dehumidified ambient air (10% RH (relative humidity)) within the first 6 min. For tBBAI, the stabilized PCE is 23.3%, which is in good agreement with the PCEs obtained from the forward and backward J-V scans. However, we observed a decrease with PSCs from initially 22.7% to 22.2% with PEAI as a passivator, which proves the superior performance of the tBBAI-treated devices. IPCEs are shown in Figure  5C . The integrated photocurrent is in good agreement with the corresponding J SC values measured from J-V curves (Table  1 ). Figure  5D  shows the illumination intensity dependence of the V OC from which the ideality factor n id can be extracted. The unpassivated film has an n id of 1.72, PEAI passivation leads to 1.47 and tBBAI passivation to 1.34. An n id of 1 is expected for a film with only bimolecular radiative recombinations whereas an n id of 2 indicates that all recombinations are nonradiative monomolecular.  [20]  tBBAI shows the n id closest to 1 which indicates the lowest nonradiative recombination rate followed by PEAI and the unpassivated film which is in good agreement with the findings from the optoelectronic measurements. Operational stability data obtained with PSCs at MPP under 1 sun irradiation and in nitrogen atmosphere (N 2 ) are shown in Figure  6A . After 500 h, the PSC passivated by tBBAI interlayer retained 95% of its initial efficiency, in contrast to 84% for the PSC with PEAI interlayer and 70% for the nonpassivated PSC. The major contribution to the efficiency decline observed for the latter PSCs arise stems from a decrease in FF (≈87% compared to initial value), The reason for this is likely that the PEAI interlayer or the direct contact between perovskite and HTL does not form a stable interface as contrast to tBBAI. Contact angle measurements of water droplets on the surface of perovskite films with and without interfacial layers are shown in Figure  6B . The bare perovskite film, perovskite film with PEAI, and tBBAI surface treatments exhibit contact angles with a water droplet of 54°, 62°, and 82°, respectively. Using Neumann's equation,  [6]  we calculated a surface free energy of 32.9 mJ m -2 for tBBAIpassivated perovskite, which is substantially lower than 50.2 mJ m -2 for pristine perovskite film, implying a better moisture resistance for tBBAI-passivated perovskites.  [21]  To further prove this, PSCs with and without interface layers are aged under ambient condition with an RH of 50-70%, the results are shown in Figure  S7  in the Supporting Information. It is observed that after 55 days (≈1300 h), the PSC with tBBAI interlayer decreased by less than 10%, while in comparison, PSC with PEAI decreases by 16% and PSCs without interface layer decreased by over 26%. This larger performance decrease implies a faster degradation of the perovskite films due to increased moisture uptake. In conclusion, a new surface passivation agent, tBBAI was developed. Electro-optical characterizations show that tBBAIpassivated perovskite films exhibit less nonradiative charge carrier recombination, i.e., a lower defect density, and a significantly improved charge extraction from the perovskite film to the HTL. We observe a V OC increase of ≈20 mV with tBBAI compared to PEAI, and ≈50 mV compared to the perovskite films without passivation. Our tBBAI champion cell yielded PCE of 23.5%, which is among the highest PSC efficiencies achieved so far. In addition, the enhanced hydrophobicity of tBBAI compared to PEAI leads to an enhanced moisture resistivity, and thus better operational stability. PSCs with tBBAI retained over 95% of their initial PCE after 500 h MPP tracking, and over 90% of their initial PCE after 55 days ageing under ambient air with an RH of 50-70%. Our work provides a simple yet effective approach to fabricate efficient PSCs with outstanding efficiency and high operational stability.   c)  [mA cm  -2  ] J SC  d)  [mA cm  -2     Figure S1 .Figure S3 .
