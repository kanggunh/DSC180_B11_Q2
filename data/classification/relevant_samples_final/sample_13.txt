Title: Triisocyanate Derived Interlayer and High-Melting-Point Doping Promoter Boost Operational Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells
Formamidinium lead triiodide serves as the optimal light-absorbing layer in single-junction perovskite solar cells. However, achieving operational stability of high-efficiency n-i-p type devices at elevated temperatures remains challenging. In this work, we implemented effective surface modifications on microcrystalline perovskite films. This involved the nucleophilic addition of formamidinium cations and coordination of residual PbI 2 with triphenylmethane triisocyanate as well as subsequent polymerization. The in situ growth of a cross-linking network chemically anchored on the perovskite film in this approach effectively reduced trap densities, favorably altered surface work function, suppressing interface charge recombination and thus enhancing cell efficiency. Coupled with a high-meltingpoint air-doping promoter, we fabricated n-i-p type perovskite solar cells surpassing 25 % efficiency, demonstrating excellent operational stability at 65 °C.
Introduction The application of organic-inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites as light-absorbing layers in single-junction solar cells has garnered significant success, achieving a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) record of up to 26.1 %,  [1]  comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells. Presently, the integration of expensive fullerenes as electron extraction and transport layers enables the fabrication of high-temperature (65 °C or 85 °C) operationally stable p-i-n type perovskite solar cells (PSCs).  [2] [3] [4] [5]  However, achieving commensurate stability for n-i-p type PSCs, employing costeffective tin dioxide or titanium dioxide as the electron transport layer (Figure  1A ), remains an ongoing challenge. Numerous factors impact the stability of n-i-p type PSCs, including alterations in ion distribution at the interface under a high electric field, resulting in an augmented presence of deep-level defects in the outer layer of perovskite grains.  [6] [7] [8]  The extension of this polarized interface leads to increased bulk transport resistance and interface charge transfer resistance, thereby reducing the voltage and current at the maximum power point. An ideal interface layer should efficaciously passivate surface defects in perovskite, mitigate interface charge recombination, and effectively impede species diffusion across layers. The literature suggests methods to fortify the stability of n-i-p type PSCs, encompassing the utilization of molecules or ions featuring Lewis acid/base passivation sites,  [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23]  the enlargement of the size of organic cations at the surface,  [24, 25]  and the formation of a two-dimensional perovskite layer on the surface.  [26] [27] [28]  However, to date, there remains an absence of reports regarding n-i-p type PSCs boasting a PCE surpassing 25 % alongside operational stability at 65 °C. Isocyanate compounds play a pivotal role as raw materials in polyurethane production and find widespread applications in the adhesive industry. Due to the high degree of unsaturation and remarkable chemical reactivity of isocyanate groups, they readily undergo nucleophilic addition reactions with substances containing active hydrogen.  [29]  In this investigation, we strategically selected a polyisocyanate compound, triphenylmethane-4,4',4''-triisocyanate (TTI, Figure  1B ), for the surface modification of narrowband gap formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) perovskite microcrystalline films. We postulate that on the perovskite surface, TTI can undergo addition reactions with one, two, or three formamidinium cations (FA + ) or coordinate with one, two, or three Pb 2 + . Unreacted isocyanate groups react with ambient water, leading to chemical and physical crosslinking, resulting in a network structure. Intriguingly, on the surface of FAPbI 3 perovskite microcrystalline films, spincoating TTI solution followed by heat treatment can eliminate sub-micron-sized PbI 2 grains on FAPbI 3 , significantly enhancing surface smoothness. Electrical and optical measurements demonstrate that TTI surface modification eliminates some electron and hole traps, suppresses defectassisted non-radiative recombination, and homogenizes the surface work function of the perovskite film. More importantly, this surface treatment approach substantially enhances the operational stability of PSCs at 45 °C. By substituting the doping promoter in the hole transport layer (HTL) from 4-tert-butylpyridinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide  [30]  (TBPHTFSI, Fig-  ure 1C ) with a melting point of only 80 °C to 4-(tertbutyl)pyridinium 1,1,2,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane-1,3-disulfonimide (TBPHHFSI, Figure  1C ) with a melting point of 141 °C, we successfully fabricated PSCs with a PCE exceeding 25 % and markedly improved operational stability at 65 °C. The chemical structure of the hole transport material SBF-FC used in this study is also illustrated in Figure  1D . In our previous work,  [31]  SBF-FC has been demonstrated as a much better material than spiro-OMeTAD for durable n-i-p PSCs. 
 Results and Discussion 
 Reaction of TTI and FA + in Solution Our initial investigation delved into the possible reaction between TTI and formamidinium iodide (FAI) in a nitrogen atmosphere, employing 1 H NMR spectroscopy. As depicted in Figure  1E , chemical shifts at 7.18 and 7.08 ppm were observed for the two types of protons on the phenyl of TTI. Due to trace water in DMSO-d 6 , a fraction of TTI reacted, forming a urea derivative; the chemical shifts of the phenyl protons in this product shifted to 7.37 and 6.99 ppm. Moreover, the chemical environment of the four amino protons in FA + remained consistent, with a chemical shift at 8.82 ppm, while the chemical shift of CÀ H was at 7.87 ppm. Employing a 1 : 3 molar ratio of TTI to FAI in DMSO-d 6 , the solution underwent gelation after two hours at room temperature. Intriguingly, the 1 H NMR signal of the phenyl in TTI vanished completely due to gelation. Considering the theoretical molar ratio of TTI to FAI for the cross-linking reaction is 1 : 1.5, the remaining FAI in the gel interacted through hydrogen bonding with the carbonyl groups of the cross-linked products (Figure  1E ). This interaction induced a distinct chemical environment for amino protons in FA + , resulting in a singlet at 9.01 ppm and a doublet at 8.66 ppm. Simultaneously, the 1 H NMR signal of CÀ H in FA + , initially a singlet, split into a septet.  [13, 21, 32]  Remarkably, substituting TTI with an equivalent of 4-tolyl isocyanate or replacing FAI with methylammonium iodide did not lead to gel formation. Importantly, the gel formed by the reaction of TTI and FAI is insoluble in common organic solvents (such as chlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, etc.) and water. This suggests that the trifunctional TTI can cross-link with the bifunctional FAI, forming a three-dimensional network (Figure  1B ). Note that other cross-linkable organic molecules have also been explored to enhance the performamce of PSCs.  [33]   
 Structural Analysis of TTI-Modified FAPbI 3 Film In dry air (RH < 5%), a dilute TTI solution in chlorobenzene was spin-coated onto the surface of FAPbI 3 perovskite film and the resultant film was subjected to heating at 85 °C for 20 minutes. On the perovskite surface, a nucleophilic addition reaction occurred between one amino group of FA + and one isocyanate group of TTI, resulting in the formation of compound 1 (Figure  1F ). Compound 2 could be generated through the reaction of the amino group of compound 1 with another TTI molecule.  [34]  TTI also exhibited reactivity with trace amounts of water in dry air, leading to the creation of an unstable carbamic acid derivative (compound 3). Following decarboxylation, compound 3 transformed into an amine derivative (compound 4). If compound 4 reacted with another TTI molecule, a urea derivative (compound 5) was formed.  [29, 35]  Additionally, TTI had the potential for dimerization and trimerization, producing the uretdione derivative (compound 6) and the isocyanurate derivative (compound 7).  [36, 37]  Following TTI treatment, the perovskite film exhibited increased hydrophobicity, evident in the rise of the water contact angle from 59°to 79°(Figure  S1 ). Scanning electron microscopy depicted untreated FAPbI 3 perovskite film with grain sizes around 1-2 micrometers and sub-micron-sized white dot-like species on grain surfaces (Figure  2A ). Fluorescence microscopy revealed some green-emitting dots in the untreated film, potentially linked to PbI 2 impurities (Figure  2C ). Contrastingly, post TTI treatment, the white dot-like species completely disappeared (Figure  2B ), and the green-emitting dots vanished (Figure  2D ). Conventional X-ray diffraction and grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements demonstrated PbI 2 (001) diffraction peaks in the untreated film (Figures 2E-H); post TTI treatment, the PbI 2 (001) diffraction signal noticeably weakened. We speculate that the surface PbI 2 forms an amorphous adduct with TTI or its derivatives. The residual lead iodide has been suggested to suppress interface charge recombination and improve cell efficiency in some earlier literatures.  [38, 39]  However, recent study has shown that lead iodide (especially at grain boundaries) can decompose into elemental lead and iodine under illumination, which is not conducive to the operational stability.  [40]  To address this issue, lead iodide can be converted into more stable inert species.  [41, 42]  Additional experiments suggested that when the substrate changed from glass to PbI 2 -coated glass, the asymmetric stretching vibration of N=C=O in TTI shifted from 2274 cm À 1 to 2232 cm À 1 due to the reduced electron density upon its coordination to lead, proving the chemical interaction between TTI and PbI 2 (Figure  S2 ). Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements suggested that after TTI modification on FAPbI 3 perovskite film, the C=C ring-stretching vibration of the phenyl ring arises at 1530 cm À 1 (Figure  S3 ). We attempted to dissolve TTI-modified perovskite films and characterize the chemical structure of TTI-based derivatives using  1  H NMR and mass spectra, but did not obtain valuable information. This may be due to the fact that the thickness of the TTI interlayer is only about 2 nanometers as determined by the X-ray reflection method (for details, see the experimental section in Supporting Information) and the cross-linked products are insoluble in common solvents. Subsequently, we employed atomic force microscopybased infrared (AFM-IR) spectroscopy to visualize perovskite films with and without TTI modification, capturing the C=C ring-stretching vibration phenyl ring at 1530 cm À 1 . In the absence of TTI modification, minimal infrared signal was observed (Figure  2I ). Conversely, the TTI-modified perovskite film exhibited a notably enhanced infrared absorption signal, revealing uneven distribution of the TTI coating on the film's surface. Analysis indicates a lower distribution of TTI-based coatings in the convex positions of the perovskite film, while the concave positions show a higher distribution of TTI derivatives (Figure  2J ). These concave positions typically align with less stable grain boundaries,  [8, [43] [44] [45]  underscoring the significance of TTI-based species enrichment in these areas for enhancing device stability. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed enhanced signals of C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s in TTI-treated perovskite film (Figure  S4 ), with notable reductions in Pb 4f and I 3d signals due to the scattering of coating layer (Figures  2K  and 2L ). Deconvolution of untreated perovskite film's C 1s peak exposed at least four carbon binding environments (284.8 eV, 286.5 eV, 288.1 eV, and 288.9 eV) attributed to adventitious carbon species, methylammonium, formamidinium, and chemisorbed carbon dioxide. TTItreated film exhibited a significantly enhanced C 1s signal, including C=C and NÀ C, with an additional peak at 289.2 eV from urea-based carbon of TTI derivatives.  [46]  Post-TTI treatment, the peak position of Pb 4f and I 3d spectra shifted toward lower binding energy regions by 0.35 eV and 0.15 eV, respectively, indicating interaction between electron-rich atoms of TTI and its derivatives with Pb and I on the perovskite surface. TTI underwent in situ reactions with FA + on the perovskite surface, forming enlarged organic cations. Moreover, TTI and its derivatives coordinated with Pb on the perovskite surface. 
 Optoelectronic Profiling of TTI-Modified FAPbI 3 Film In Figure  S5 , TTI modification not only enhances the spatially resolved photoluminescence uniformity in the perovskite film but also leads to a concurrent 30 % increase in average photoluminescence intensity. Comparative analysis of Figures  3A  and 3B  reveals a more consistent photoluminescence lifetime in various regions of the TTI-modified perovskite film, despite a modest 5 % increase in average photoluminescence lifetime (Figure  3C ). These results underscore the effective passivation of regions with deeplevel defects by TTI derivatives, thereby suppressing nonradiative recombination. Subsequently, we fabricated electron-only and hole-only devices, determining the densities of electron and hole traps in the perovskite film through space-charge-limited current measurements, with detailed experimental procedures available in the Supporting Information. Post TTI modification, the density of electron traps in the perovskite film decreased from 9.74×10 14 cm À 3 to 6.57×10 14 cm À 3 , and the density of hole traps decreased from 7.79×10 14 cm À 3 to 5.60×10 14 cm À 3 (Figure  3D ). This reduction in trap density aligns with results from time-resolved photoluminescence measurements. Following this, Kelvin probe force microscopy was employed to analyze the spatial distribution of the work function of films (Figures  3E  and 3F ). Post TTI modification, the surface potential difference of the perovskite film decreased from 270 meV to 180 meV (Figure  3G ). Simultaneously, the surface mean work function increased from 4.38 eV to 4.49 eV, with reduced fluctuation (Figure  3H ). The microscopic mechanism underlying this phenomenon involves the induction of strong n-type semiconductor characteristics in perovskite films by coordination unsaturated lead ions on the surface.  [22]  Post TTI modification, the formation of coordination bonds between C=O and Pb weakens the n-type characteristics of the perovskite film. With an increased surface work function, the band can undergo an upward bend, mitigating electron accumulation at the interface between the perovskite and the hole transport layer upon photoexcitation, thereby suppressing interface charge recombination.  [15, 47]   
 Photovoltaic Characteristics To scrutinize the influence of TTI modification on the photovoltaic performance, we fabricated n-i-p type PSCs featuring the ITO/SnO 2 /FAPbI 3 /HTL/Au architecture. For the energy level of each layer, see Figure  S6 . The HTL constitutes a composite film of the molecular semiconductor SBF-FC blended with the air-doping promoter TBPHTFSI at an 85 : 15 weight ratio. Comprehensive details regarding cell fabrication and measurements are elaborated in the Supporting Information. Photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) characteristics were recorded under simulated AM1.5G irradiation at 100 mW cm À 2 . Statistical analyses of photovoltaic parameters (short-circuit current density, J sc ; opencircuit voltage, V oc ; fill factor, FF; power convension efficiency, PCE) for ten cells of each type are depicted in Figure  S7  and Table  S1 , elucidating the overall impact of TTI treatment and the good reproducibility of cell fabrication. The prototypical cell lacking TTI treatment manifested a J sc of 26.08 mA cm À 2 , a V oc of 1.150 V, an FF of 78.9 %, and a PCE of 23.7 %. In stark contrast, the representative TTImodified cell exhibited a comparable J sc (26.14 mA cm À 2 ), a heightened V oc (1.195 V), and an increased FF (81.8 %), culminating in an impressive PCE of 25.6 %. Note that the TTI-derived interlayer has a conductivity lower than 0.01 μS cm À 1 but does not impact hole injection due to the very thin thickness. The forward and reverse scan curves are delineated in Figure  4A , and the hysteresis index (HI) was computed using the formula HI = (PCE reverse À PCE forward )/PCE reverse . The findings revealed minimal HI values for PSCs with and without TTI modification, measuring 0.7 % and 1.4 %, respectively. Furthermore, at a fixed bias voltage of 0.970 V (for the untreated cell) and 1.035 V (for the TTI-modified cell), the current densities rapidly attained steady-state values of 24.0 mA cm À 2 and 24.5 mA cm À 2 , respectively (Figure  S8 ). These values corresponded to steady-state PCE outputs of 23.3 % and 25.4 % (Figure  4B ), aligning with the J-V results. Subsequently, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs under weak monochromatic irradiation at short-circuit were measured (Figure  4C ). Combining them with the standard AM1.5G solar spectrum (ASTM G173-03), the integrated short-circuit current densities (J EQE SC ) for PSCs with and without TTI modification were determined as 25.4 mA cm À 2 and 25.3 mA cm À 2 , respectively. The relative deviation between J sc and J EQE SC was found to be less than 3 %, indicating a negligible mismatch factor in the employed solar simulator. Utilizing the equivalent circuit outlined in Figure  S9 , we conducted numerical simulations to analyze the impedance spectra of PSCs and determine the charge recombination resistance (R re ).  [48]  Figure  4D  illustrates that, at a bias voltage of 0.9 V, following TTI modification, R re exhibited an increase from 3.9 kΩ to 8.5 kΩ, providing a good explaination for the augmentation of V oc . Subsequent to this, we evaluated the external quantum efficiencies of electroluminescence (EQE EL ) from the cells. At an injection current density of 26 mA cm À 2 (equivalent to J sc under AM1.5G sunlight), TTI modification resulted in an elevation of EQE EL from 0.5 % to 2.9 % (Figure  S10 ). The V oc loss attributable to non-radiative recombination (DV nonrad OC ) was determined through the formula DV nonrad OC ¼ À k B T q lnðEQE EL Þ, where k B represents the Boltzmann constant, T signifies the Kelvin temperature, and q denotes the elementary charge.  [49]  Following TTI modification, DV nonrad OC decreased from 136 mV to 91 mV. Consequently, V oc measurements of the cell under varying light intensities were conducted (Figure  S11 ). The semi-logarithmic plot of V oc versus light intensity underwent linear fitting, facilitating the derivation of the ideality factor (n) from the slope.  [50]  This analysis revealed an n value of 1.53 for the cell without TTI modification and 1.36 for the cell with TTI modification (Figure  4E ). By substituting the obtained n values into the Shockley diode equation,  [51]  we simulated the J-V curves (Figure  S12 ) and extracted key parameters, including the shunt resistance (R sh ) and the reverse saturation current (I s ), as detailed in Table  S2 . It is evident that TTI modification not only induced an increase in R sh but also a decrease in I s . The heightened R sh can be attributed to the formation of a dense interlayer on the perovskite surface, while the diminished I s results from reduced surface defects in the perovskite. These dual factors collectively elucidate the observed enhancements in V oc and FF. 
 Thermal Stability at 85 °C and Degradation Analysis To assess the influence of TTI modification on thermal storage stability, four cells of each type underwent exposure to an 85 °C oven within a 45 %-85 % relative humidity environment. The time-dependent evolution of PCE is illustrated in Figure  S13 . Following a 500-hour duration, cells featuring TTI modification exhibited a notable average retention rate of 94 %, surpassing the 88 % observed in cells lacking TTI modification. Representative J-V curves before and after aging, along with corresponding photovoltaic parameters compiled in Table  S3 , are depicted in Figures S14A and S14B. Post-aging, the PCE of cells without TTI modification decreased from 23.7 % to 21.0 %, characterized by a 3.4 % reduction in FF, a 49 mV decrease in V oc , and a 0.87 mA cm À 2 drop in J sc . Conversely, cells with TTI modification exhibited a PCE decrease from 25.0 % to 23.5 %, featuring a 1.8 % reduction in FF, a 30 mV decrease in V oc , and a 0.33 mA cm À 2 decrease in J sc . Notably, thermal aging resulted in a decrease in EQE, with a less pronounced decrease observed in cells with TTI modification compared to those without (Figures  S14C  and S14D ). The correlation between J sc and J EQE SC before and after aging displayed a positive linear relationship (Figure  S15 ). Following thermal aging, cells without TTI modification exhibited a 4.7-fold increase in photoluminescence lifetime (from 16 ns to 91 ns, Figure  S14E ), while cells with TTI modification showed only a 0.5-fold increase (from 27 ns to 40 ns, Figure  S14F ). It is hypothesized that the rise in photoluminescence lifetime after aging may be associated with the generation of wide-band gap species at the perovskite/HTL interface. This process could also be linked to HTL fracture, collectively reducing the rate of hole extraction from the photoexcited perovskite and resulting in an EQE decrease. X-ray diffraction analysis, as presented in Figures  S16A  and S16B , revealed an increase in the area of the PbI 2 (001) diffraction peak after thermal aging, indicating FAPbI 3 decomposition. Cells with TTI modification exhibited only a 2.0-fold increased area of the PbI 2 (001) diffraction peak, significantly lower than the 5.1-fold increased area observed in cells without TTI modification. Fluorescence microscopy imaging indicated that, after thermal aging, the perovskite layer without TTI modification exhibited numerous green luminescent points and rods from PbI 2 , while the perovskite layer with TTI modification had very few green luminescent points (Figure  S16C ). Scanning electron microscopy imaging showed that, whether TTI-modified or not, the HTLs of unaged cells formed a uniform and continuous film, completely covering the perovskite surface (Figure  S16D ). After aging, the HTL of the cell without TTI modification displayed micron-sized holes, potentially leading to short circuits and extra charge recombination pathways, causing a decrease in V oc . In contrast, the HTL morphology in the cell with TTI modification remained unchanged before and after aging (Figure  S16D ). Measurements of time-resolved photoluminescence, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy collectively affirmed that TTI modification can considerably impede the thermal decomposition of the perovskite. 
 Operational Stability Under simulated AM1.5G sunlight at 100 mW cm À 2 , we investigated the operational stability of PSCs at 45 °C in a nitrogen environment, employing the maximum power point (MPP) tracking method. The evolutions of current density (J MPP ), voltage (V MPP ), and efficiency at MPP (P MPP ) are depicted in Figures  S17  and 4F . Following a duration of 105 hours, the cell without TTI modification exhibited an 88 % retention rate of P MPP (from 23.5 % to 20.8 %), primarily attributed to a 97 % retention rate of V MPP and a 91 % retention rate of J MPP . Impressively, after 500 hours, the cell with TTI modification displayed only a marginal P MPP decrease from 25.3 % to 24.5 %, maintaining a 97 % retention rate, accompanied by corresponding retention rates of 99 % for V MPP and 98 % for J MPP . Concurrently, we assessed the operational stability of the reference cell with a phenethylammonium iodide interlayer. Despite an initially comparable PCE of 25.2 % to the cell with TTI modification, after 105 hours, the PCE of this cell diminished to 19.6 %, with a retention rate of only 78 %, primarily due to lower V MPP retention rate (88 %) and J MPP retention rate (89 %). Throughout the MPP tracking process, J-V curves were periodically recorded and fitted using the Shockley diode equation. Figure  S18  illustrates the temporal evolutions of series resistance (R s ) and shunt resistance (R sh ) for the cells. The cell without TTI modification exhibited a gradual increase in R s and a gradual decrease in R sh during the MPP process. The decline in R sh implies accelerated charge recombination, potentially linked to an increase in defects within the perovskite layer. The rise in R s may be attributed to an increase in defects and scattering centers within the perovskite layer. Conversely, these phenomena were less pronounced in the cell with TTI modification, suggesting that the robust interaction of TTI derivatives with the perovskite surface and the formation of a cross-linked interlayer substantially impede ion migration at the perovskite layer/HTL interface. Subsequently, we explored the operational stability of cells with TTI modification at 65 °C. Unfortunately, within a mere 20 hours, P MPP experienced a 17 % decay (Figure  4G ). Recalling that TBPHTFSI is an ionic crystal with a low melting point (80 °C, Figure  4H ) and can exhibit a lower melting point when mixed with impurities (such as SBF-FC, water, etc.), rapid ion migration can occur in microscale regions rich in low-melting-point substances under elevated temperature and a strong electric field. To address this issue, we synthesized a novel air-doping promoter, TBPHHFSI (Figure  1C ). Although it belongs to the same triclinic system as TBPHTFSI (Figure  S20 , Figure  S21 , and Table  S4 ), there is a significant difference in melting points; the melting point of TBPHHFSI is 141 °C (Figure  4H ). This elevated melting point can be attributed to decreased entropy of melting.  [52]  Owing to supercooling, the freezing points of TBPHTFSI and TBPHHFSI are 44 °C and 118 °C, respectively. When TBPHHFSI was blended at a weight fraction of 15 % with SBF-FC featured by a glass transition temperature of 222 °C, the glass transition temperature of the resultant composite material was reduced but was still higher than 170 °C. By employing TBPHHFSI as an air-doping promoter for the HTL, the cell demonstrated significantly enhanced stability at 65 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere, with a P MPP retention rate of 92 % after 500 hours. This underscores the pivotal role of controlling ion migration in the HTL to augment the operational stability of PSCs, necessitating the judicious selection of high cohesive energy density organic semiconductors  [53, 54]  and suitable air-doping promoters. 
 Conclusion Utilizing nucleophilic addition of formamidinium cations and coordinating residual PbI 2 with TTI, we have effectively modified microcrystalline perovskite thin film surfaces. Our strategy involves in situ growth of a chemically anchored cross-linked network, reducing trap densities, inducing favorable alterations in surface work function, and suppressing interface charge recombination. This results in a notable enhancement in the efficiency of PSCs. The TTI-derived interface layer plays a crucial role in mitigating chemical decomposition of perovskite and morphological degradation of the hole transport layer under prolonged 85 °C heating. Coupled with a high-melting-point air-doping promoter, we successfully fabricated n-i-p type PSCs with efficiency exceeding 25 % and excellent operational stability at 65 °C for the first time. This study highlights the significance of developing surface modification methods and regulating hole transport layer components for enhancing PSC stability. Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

 General Instrumentation 1 H Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were acquired using the AVANCE III 500 NMR spectrometer (Bruker). Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra were collected with a Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker). Photoluminescence mapping was performed employing a laser confocal fluorescence lifetime/intensity imaging system (MicroTime200, PicoQuant) equipped with a 640 nm picosecond pulsed diode laser for excitation. Water contact angles were assessed using a DropMeter A-100P contact angle meter. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were measured with an ESCALAB 250Xi instrument (Thermo Scientific) utilizing a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6eV). The binding energy scale was referenced to the C 1s signal. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) were acquired using the same instrument with a He I source (21.2 eV). Conventional Xray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using the SmartLab diffractometer (Rigaku), operated at 7200 W power (40 kV, 180 mA), with Cu Kα radiation ( = 0.15418 nm). Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed at the BL02U2 beamline of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Samples were measured at an incidence angle of 0.30° with respect to the substrate plane. Time-resolved photoluminescence decay measurements were conducted utilizing a Life-Spec-II fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh). Single-crystal XRD measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer. The crystal structures were determined using Olex2 software, and detailed refinement parameters are provided in the attached single crystal .cif file. Crystallographic data are deposited in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (CCDC) as supplementary publication No. 2307343 (TBPHTFSI) and No. 2307341 (TBPHHFSI). Impedance spectra were examined using an Autolab PGSTAT302N electrochemical workstation in the dark, covering a wide frequency range (10 Hz-3 MHz) with a small perturbation of 20 mV. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were conducted using a DSC Q100 V9.7 Build 291 instrument (TA) in a flowing nitrogen atmosphere, employing a heating rate of 10 o C min -1 . Scanning electron microscope images were acquired using an SU70 microscope from Hitachi. Fluorescence microscope images were captured with the ECLIPSE Ti-U system by Nikon. Atomic force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements were performed with the AFM NX10 microscope from Park Systems in tapping mode, utilizing a Pt/Cr-coated silicon tip (Multi75E-G, Budgetsensors). Atomic force microscopy-based infrared spectroscopy images were collected using the nanoIR2-FS system from Anasys Instruments, comprising an atomic force microscope operating in contact mode and a tunable quantum cascade laser (Daylight Solutions Inc.) spanning from 1800 cm 1 to 900 cm 1 . 
 Synthesis of 4-(tert-Butyl)pyridinium 1,1,2,2,3,3-Hexafluoropropane-1,3-disulfonimide (TBPHHFSI) A 5 mL aqueous solution, comprising LiHFSI (600 mg, 2 mmol) and TBP (280 mg, 2.1 mmol), underwent gradual addition of diluted hydrochloric acid (1 M, 3 mL). The resultant mixture stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes, underwent filtration and subsequent washing with deionized water. The resulting residue was vacuum-dried (0.1 mbar) at 100°C for 6 hours, yielding a white solid powder (670 mg, 78% yield).  1  H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6) : 8.84 (d, J = 6.8 Hz, 2H), 8.09 (d, J = 6.8 Hz, 2H), and 1.36 (s, 9H) ppm. 
 Fabrication of Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) The SnO2 electron transport layer and FAPbI3 perovskite layer were deposited following established procedures from prior literatures.  [3, 4]  The PSC preparation process is detailed below. A laser-etched indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate (sheet resistance: 12 Ω sq -1 , thickness: 1.1 mm) underwent a cleaning regimen, including sequential rinses with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol (IPA) in an ultrasonic bath (15 minutes each). Subsequently, a SnO2 layer was spin-coated onto ITO at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds and annealed at 150°C for 30 minutes. After UV-ozone treatment, the substrate was transferred to a dry air-filled glove box (RH < 5%) for perovskite layer deposition. A two-step spin-coating method was used, involving PbI2/RbCl (1.5 M/7.5 mM in DMF/DMSO, 9/1, v/v) on SnO2 and FAI/MACl (90 mg/13.5 mg in 1 mL IPA) on PbI2. Annealing at 150°C for 20 minutes formed the FAPbI3 perovskite layer with a slight presence of (PbI2)2RbCl and PbI2. TTI interlayer (2.5 mg mL -1 in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated at 5000 rpm and annealed at 85°C for 20 minutes. For PEAI treatment, 5 mg mL -1 PEAI solution in IPA was spin-coated onto the perovskite film at 5000 rpm for 30 seconds. The hole transport layer (HTL) was deposited using a chlorobenzene solution containing SBF-FC (50 mg mL -1 ), TBP (132 mM), and TBPHTFSI or TBPHHFSI (8.9 mg mL -1 ), spun at 5000 rpm. Finally, an 80-nm-thick gold electrode was thermally evaporated under a vacuum (< 10 -4 Pa). The resulting device (active area: 0.10 cm 2 ) was laminated with a high-quality anti-reflective film on the glass side and a waterproof adhesive tape on the gold electrode side. 
 TTI Layer Thickness Measurement We employed X-ray reflection methodology to determine the thickness of the TTI layer. Measurements were conducted using a Bruker D8 discover reflectometer equipped with Cu Kα X-ray radiation ( = 1.542 Å). Amorphous titania films were deposited onto Si wafers via atomic layer deposition (ALD), subsequently annealed at 150°C for 1 hour, and then cooled to room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. The TTI layer was applied to the titania surface via spin-coating. The X-ray beam was precisely collimated using a Göbel mirror with a 0.2 mm slit and a postsample parallel collimator. Reflectivity spectra were collected within an angular range of 0.20° ≤ 2θ ≤ 8.00°, employing a step size of 0.005° and a counting time of 1 second per step. The acquired reflectivity data were plotted against perpendicular momentum transfer (QZ), defined as QZ = 4(sinθ)/, and subjected to refinement utilizing the MOTOFIT package to derive structural parameters pertaining to both the uncoated and TTI-coated titania films. Initial structural models were established based on estimated values of the X-ray scattering length density (SLD), set at 31.2  10 6 Å 2 for the ALD titania films and 10.0  10 6 Å 2 for the TTI layer. Notably, the structural models did not incorporate a native silicon oxide layer, as the SLD contrast between the Si wafer (20.1  10 6 Å 2 ) and the native oxide (18.9  10 6 Å 2 ) was marginal. The thickness, SLD, and interfacial roughness of each layer were initially estimated employing a genetic optimization method and subsequently refined utilizing the Levenberg-Marquardt method until achieving minimal  2 values. 
 Trap Density Measurements To measure the trap densities in the perovskite layer with and without TTI modification, we fabricated the single-carrier devices. For the electron-only device, we used the same ITO, SnO2, and perovskite layers as in PSCs. A solution of PC61BM in chlorobenzene (20 mg mL 1 ) was spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The final touch involved the thermal evaporation of an 80nm-thick silver electrode in a high vacuum ( 1  10 4 Pa). On the other hand, for the hole-only device, we initiated the process by depositing a 40-nm-thick layer of PEDOT:PSS onto ITO glass. Successively, the FAPbI3 perovskite layer and the SBF-FC-based HTL were deposited onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The process concluded with the thermal evaporation of an 80-nm-thick gold layer. Dark currentvoltage (IV) curves spanning the 0 V to 2.5 V range were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. Further details of the calculations on trap density can be found in the reference.  [5]   
 Optoelectronic Measurements Photocurrent density-photovoltage (JV) curves were acquired utilizing a Keithley 2400 source meter, with Labview 14.0 automating the measurements. The AM1.5G sunlight, generated by the LS1000-4S-AM solar simulator from Solar Light Company at 100 mW cm 2 , underwent validation through a calibrated silicon solar cell. Defining the photoactive region was a black metal mask with a 0.07 cm 2 aperture area. The devices underwent both reverse scans (1.2 V → -0.1 V, incrementing in 0.005 V steps) and forward scans (-0.1 V → 1.2 V, with the same incremental step), all conducted at a scan rate of 50 mV s 1 . For external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements on PSCs, an Omni-300 monochromator (Zolix, China) and a 150 W xenon lamp (Zolix, China) were employed. The photocurrent data were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter. Monochromatic light intensity quantification relied on a Hamamatsu S1337-1010BQ silicon diode, calibrated at the National Institute of Metrology, China. In the context of LED operation, measurements occurred within a nitrogen-filled glovebox at room temperature. For the assessment of external quantum efficiency of electroluminescence (EQEEL), a custom setup was deployed, featuring a Keithley 2400 source meter, an integration sphere (FOIS-1), and a QE Pro spectrometer. 
 Operational Stability and Thermostability Tests To achieve maximum power point (MPP) tracking, a 16-channel photovoltaic tracking system (YH Electronic Equipment Business) was employed in conjunction with an SLS-LED-80A solar simulator (Solar Scientific Instrument High-tech Co., Ltd.) and a temperaturecontrollable PSC holder in nitrogen. The MPP data were acquired at 5-minute intervals utilizing the perturb and observe method, which guarantees accurate monitoring of performance parameters at the MPP. Throughout the MPP tracking process, JV curves were also periodically recorded. To evaluate the thermal stability of PSCs, they were stored in an FD56 oven (Binder) set at 85 o C. The ambient humidity surrounding the oven ranged between 45% and 85%. Intermittent JV measurements were conducted under AM1.5G conditions at the room temperature.     [a] The photovoltaic parameters were measured under the AM1.5G conditions. The 0.10 cm 2 small cells were covered with a black metal mask with an aperture area of 0.07 cm 2 for measurements. The average values were derived from ten cells for each type.      Table  S3 . Photovoltaic parameters of PSCs without and with TTI modification before and after aging. [a] The photovoltaic parameters were measured under the AM1.5G conditions. The 0.10 cm 2 small cells were covered with a black metal mask with an aperture area of 0.07 cm 2 for measurements. The aging was carried out for 500 h at 85 o C.
