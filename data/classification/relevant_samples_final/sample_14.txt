Solar energy is vital for meeting global renewable energy demands efficiently. Perovskite optical absorbers hold significant potential for high efficiency, innovative optoelectronic devices. Current study provides a detailed computational analysis to explore Potassium tin bromide (KSnBr 3 ) as a possible absorber material for hybrid photovoltaic cell and its module by using density functional theory (DFT), solar capacitance simulator SCAPS-1D and PVSyst software. The structural, electronic, and optical properties of KSnBr 3 were explored using mBJ potential in Quantum ESPRESSO. The proposed perovskite absorber has an energy band gap (E g ) of ~ 2.27 eV, showing strong potential for optoelectronic applications supported by its capability to absorb wide electromagnetic spectrum. Based on the optoelectronic properties a hybrid double absorber solar cell, Au-CuSbS 2 -FASnI 3 -KSnBr 3 -TiO 2 -AZO was designed and simulated in SCAPS-1D, incorporating TiO 2 electron transport layer (ETL), CuSbS 2 as hole transport layer (HTL) Formamidinium (FA) tin iodide CH(NH 2 ) 2 SnI 3 and KSnBr 3 as active absorbers. The device performance was evaluated and optimized through variation in layers thickness, interface defects, bandgap tuning, metal work function, and temperature. The optimally yielded electrical parameters include a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.37%, short circuit current density (J sc ) of 31.4521 mA/cm 2 , an open-circuit voltage (V oc ) of 0.9406 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 79.60%. Single cell refined parameters were used in PVSyst to analyze the solar module. The optimized input produced a power output of 547.50 watts from a 72-cell module. The findings of this study are expected to advance the development of high-performance, environmentally sustainable solar cells and their modules with better performance.
Introduction Renewable energy sources have become crucial due to worldwide energy demands driven by population growth, industrial use and socio-economic pressures. There is a compelling need for humanity to explore eco-friendly alternatives to non-renewable energy resources to mitigate drastic atmospheric effects and global warming. Solar energy is a prime source for electricity generation, harnessing the Earth's most plentiful and renewable energy resource. It is crucial for various sectors like domestic, agriculture and industry  (Yoshikawa et al. 2017; Jiang et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2020; Srivastava et al. 2022 Srivastava et al. , 2023a)) . Abundant availability of solar energy source has significant developmental impact. It is ecofriendly and avoids greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, reducing the carbon footprints. Solar energy is transformed into electrical power through the photovoltaic effect, employing solar cells. Extensive endeavors across various generations of solar cells were aimed at maximizing the performance of solar cells. However, the unparalleled surge in efficiency is attributed to the incorporation of perovskite materials, marking a transformative breakthrough in solar cell technology. Perovskite materials were initially incorporated in solar cells in 2009, attaining an initial modest efficiency of approximately 3.8%, deemed suboptimal by scientific benchmarks. Against the backdrop of the global energy crisis, scientists and engineers have intensified their efforts and showed great commitment to explore innovative renewable energy sources. Continuous and expanded research efforts in different categories of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have resulted in a substantial increase in efficiency  (Liu et al. 2019; Younis et al. 2020; Advanced Functional Materials 2022; Dai et al. 2019; Khan et al. 2019) . Photovoltaic (PV) technology, particularly solar cells, has emerged as a key player capable of replacing fossil fuels, reducing oil consumption, and mitigating environmental damage  (Owusu and Asumadu-Sarkodie 2016; Srivastava et al. 2023b; Gong et al. 2015) . PSCs have drawn a lot of attention lately because of their hybrid design, reduced exciton binding energy, inexpensive processing, long charge carrier diffusion length, excellent charge carrier mobility, and greater conversion efficiency  (Gan et al. 2020a; Srivastava et al. 2023c; Mishra et al. 2023) . Hybrid halide perovskites have captured considerable attention due to their remarkable opto-electronic characteristics. In general ABX 3 structural formulation, 'A' denotes an organic entity, such as CH 3 NH 3 (methylammonium) or CH(NH 2 ) 2 (formamidinium). 'B' designates a metal cation, including elements like Germanium (Ge), Lead (Pb), and Tin (Sn). X signifies a halide anion, like Chlorine (Cl), Bromine (Br), and Iodine (I), belonging to the halogen group  (Dixit et al. 2019; Chaudhary et al. 2023; Bishnoi and Pandey 2018) . The performance of PSC material is affected by various factors like moisture, temperature illumination and oxygen biasing, and UV. Encapsulation is one method of keeping moisture and oxygen out of PSCs, but it's more expensive and doesn't shield the device from other harmful elements like heat, light, biasing, and illumination  (Gan et al. 2020b) . PSCs are a desirable option for next-generation photovoltaic cells due to their high. PCE, variable bandgap, and low-temperature solution-process fabrication. The exceptional physical characteristics of these materials, which include adaptability to defects, light weight charge carriers, high light absorption, long distances for charge movement, resilience to defects, and flexibility in composition, can be attributed to their effectiveness  (Liu et al. 2022; Srivastava et al. 2024; Barrow et al. 2014) . Organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells are a leading, rapidly advancing technology due to their high power-conversion efficiency. Perovskite materials manifest unique attributes, including greater charge mobility, substantial diffusion length, elevated absorption coefficient, minimal exciton binding energy, enduring stability, environmental friendliness, and diminutive charge carrier. Such materials utilized as optical absorbers in solar cells are capable of efficiently capturing a maximum number of photons from electromagnetic spectrum. This results in the generation of excited electrons and photo current in the conduction band, making them suitable photovoltaic applications  (Ali et al. 2023; Weiss et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2013) . Halide perovskites have undergone extensive scrutiny through both theoretical and experimental approaches, exploring diverse chemical compositions. This encompasses lead-free variations such as (PEA) 2 PbI 4 , Phenyl-ethylammonium (PEA), CH 3 NH 3 SnY 3 (Y = Cl, Br, I and F), CsAX 3 (A = Ge, K; Y = Cl, Br), RbPbI 3 , Mg 3 SbX 3 (X = I, Br, Cl, F), Cs 2 PbI 4 , CsPbI 4 , CsPbBr 3 , Cs 2 AgxCu1-xInyTb1-yCl 6 and Cs 2 AgInCl 6 .. These compounds have shown superb promise as photovoltaic materials, particularly for infrared detection and photoluminescence applications. Consequently, they have opened new avenues of exploration for researchers in photovoltaic domain  (Snaith 2013; Rahman et al. 2023c; Harun-Or-Rashid et al. 2024a; Khan et al. 2021; Hao et al. 2015) . The drawback of lead-based perovskite lies in its toxicity, posing severe threats to human health, environmental well-being, and cognitive development. Enhancing the performance of perovskite solar cells involves mitigating recombination mechanisms, addressing interface defects, widening the absorption spectrum, extending diffusion lengths, tuning band widths, and comprehending the dynamics of charge carriers within the active perovskite absorber. Novel optical absorber materials are needed to be explored to address such issues. Organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells have garnered significant research interest due to their exceptional properties, including high electron-hole mobility, enhanced dielectric constant, and high absorption coefficients  (Khan et al. 2017; Rahman et al. 2024; Dou et al. 2014) . MAPbI 3 is the most often used perovskite material for the absorber layer in solar cells. Due to the development in solar cell technology the power conversion efficiency of PSCs increased remarkably from "-3.8% to 25.6% in last fifteen years. PSCs are now seen as a competitive alternative to traditional solar cells, because of this significant advancement  (Lenka et al. 2020; Harun-Or-Rashid et al. 2024b; Jannat et al. 2021) . The stability of MASnI 3 make it better candidate for the use of perovskite solar cell devices due to its long-term performance  (Sani et al. 2018) . The ionization potential energy of MASnI 3 is less naturally that is a key factor to maintain the stability of tin vacancies and interstitial iodine within the material  (Kim and Kim 2021) . The electronic properties of CH 3 NH 3 SnI 3 are enhanced by p-doping defects, which also improve its stability against environmental stressors. It has indirect bandgap and hexagonal phase with large carrier-effective mass along the c-axis as compared to its cubic and tetragonal phase  (Rahman et al. xxxx) . MASnI 3 have good chemical stability which absorbs photons of sunlight in ultraviolet region which is better for making photovoltaic devices (Deepthi Jayan and Sebastian 2021). The MASnI 3 absorber stands out an exceptional candidate for replacement of lead (Pb) in organo-metal-halide absorber based solar cells, providing an environmentally friendly option compared to perovskites involving lead  (Meggiolaro et al. 2020) . Solar devices constructed from MASnI 3 , especially those utilizing Sn-based perovskite, showcase exceptional air stability, for sustainable lead-free and efficient solar cells  (Zhang et al. 2018; Reza et al. 2024; Yao et al. 2017) . The theoretical maximum PCE calculations yield values of 19.9%, 26.9%, and 25.6% for PSCs based on MASnX 3 , FASnX 3 , and CsSnI 3 , respectively  (Li et al. 2019) . Organic materials are often affected by environmental factors such as temperature, moisture, and oxidation, leading to deterioration over time  (Peng and Xie 2020) . The performance and lifetime of PSCs may be negatively impacted by this degrading process  (Wang et al. 2020 ). However, inorganic HTLs are a dependable option for long-term applications because of their increased stability and resilience to environmental deterioration  (Ecker et al. 2011) . Various researchers have explored the performance of devices where Pb has been substituted with different elements such as Tin (Sn), Germanium (Ge), Copper (Cu) and Bismuth (Bi), to address the issue of lead toxicity but these materials have less performance as compared to lead based PSCs  (Yu and Aziz 2019) . Lead (Pb) and tin (Sn) share similar electronic structures and atomic sizes. Recently, tin-based perovskite solar cells have achieved an efficiency of 9.4%  (Kung et al. 2018; Sarkar et al. 2022) . The bandgap value of MASnI 3 is 1.30 eV which is closer to the predicted bandgap value of the Shockley-Queisser limit  (Ahmed et al. 2024) . Ahmad et al. used gold as the back contact, TiO 2 as the ETL material, and Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL material to simulate a 2D PSC device based on Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 optical absorber  (Shockley and Queisser 1961) . Their simulation outcomes indicated that their photovoltaic device had achieved an efficiency of 11.54%, whereas their experimental results demonstrated an efficiency of 1.66% for the corresponding configuration. The incorporation of mixed halides in PSCs, such as AB(X 1-x Y x ) 3 , has demonstrated enhanced stability in PSCs. Additionally, the ability to adjust the bandgap by varying the concentration of halides presents a notable advantage in such compositions  (Sarkar et al. 2022) . M.  Kumar et al.  have explored some stable and lead-free nontoxic double perovskite  (Kumar et al. 2021; Jain et al. 2020) . The sequential solution and processing method was devised by Clark et al.  (Clark et al. 2020)  to produce a series of APbX 3 /M MA, or Cs; X = I or Br) heterojucntions. The heterojucntions demonstrated improved device performance. Additionally, Pindolia et al.  (Pindolia et al. 2022 ) examined substitute inorganic HTL and ETL layers to develop an inorganic RbGeI 3 -based PSC that achieved an efficiency of 10.11% and a higher fill factor of 63.68%. The FTO/WS 2 /CsSn 0.5 Ge0.5I 3 /MoS 2 /Au configuration was explored by Aishwarya et al.  (Kaity et al. 2021 ) who theoretically optimized PCE at 22.17% (V oc = 0.96 V, J sc = 27.30 mA/cm 2 , and FF = 87.62%). First principle study of orthorhombic mixed iodide-bromide and iodide-chloride PVK  (Ng et al. 2018)  performed by Zhou et al. It was investigated that I-Br (MAPbIBr) and I-Cl (MAPbICl) PVK had superior carrier mobility and stability than MAPbI 3  (Fang and Yi 2017) . They examined that in contrast to the (I/Cl), (I/Br) and (Br/Cl) composite, PVK can be formed easily at the room temperature. Through first-principles methods, an investigation was conducted on CsSn (I 1-x Br x ) 3 to determine the optimal concentration of bromine (Br) to improve the stability of PSCs without decrease in their efficiency  (Li et al. 2023; Choi et al. 2023) . Li et al. used a molecular additive made up of a phenylethyl ammonium cation and a combination of appropriately mixed halide-pseudo halide anions to create a quasi-2D perovskite film based on tin (Sn). The device demonstrated a 14.6% efficiency  (Zheng et al. 2023 ). Choi et al. used a fulleropyrrolidine, a multifunctional chemical additive with a triethyl glycol monoethyl side chain, to study the effect of surface and grain boundary passivation in Sn based PSC  (Su et al. 2023) . The stability was enhanced and non-radiative recombination was inhibited by this multifunctional passivation. In order to control the microstructure, prevent Sn 2+ oxidation, and energize charge transfer Zheng et al.  (Sun et al. 2023)  added Thiourea and amidine thiourea in perovskite precursor. Using a numerical simulation of SCAPS-1D it was examined that some important factors like thickness of layers, tuning of band gap, and overall defect density as considerable effects on the performance of the device using FASnI 3 as the active material in PSC. It was reported that V oc of 0.92 V, J sc of 22.65 mA/cm 2 , with a PCE of 14.03%, and fill factor 67.74% was achieved. Duha and Borunda Investigated lead-free perovskite tandem solar by combining different perovskite like MAGeI 3 with band gap 1.9 eV and FASnI 3 bandgap of 1.41 eV to get high performance of device  (Duha and Borunda 2022) . Various critical factors of the solar cell device have been explored, including the effects of HTL, ETL, and absorber thickness on device performance, as well as the impact of varying interface defect densities  (Abdelaziz et al. 2020 ). In the current study, the structural, electronic, and optical properties of KSnBr 3 as an optical absorber material have been rigorously investigated, revealing a semiconductor bandgap of 2.27 eV. Ab-initio calculations were performed using the Quantum ESPRESSO software package with the mBJ potential to estimate the material's characteristics. Theoretical assessments encompassed the evaluation of optical characteristics, including extinction coefficient k(ω), reflectivity R(ω), optical conductivity L (ω), refractive index n (ω), real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant (ε 1 , ε 2 ) and absorption coefficient α(ω). The optical response of KSnBr 3 was verified, revealing consistent theoretical features that affirm the suitability of inorganic KSnBr 3 for optoelectronic applications. KSnBr 3 has strong tendency to absorb a significant part of incoming solar radiation. These investigations involve a thorough examination of the inorganic material KSnBr 3 for its application in optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells. Making a novel configuration of solar cell by utilization of KsnBr 3 in solar cell applications with another optical absorber material Formamidinium (FA) tin iodide CH(NH 2 ) 2 SnI 3 having E g ~ 1.30 eV in a double absorber solar cell configuration Au-CuSbS 2 -FASnI 3 -KSnBr 3 -TiO 2 -AZO has maximized the device output. Combination of organic and in-organic absorbers of different bandgaps have the capability to generate greater number of charge carriers in the form of electron hole pairs. A thorough investigation and detailed reporting of the electrical characteristics of the proposed solar cell lay the groundwork for designing and fabricating novel, efficient, low-cost, and environmentally friendly optical devices to meet energy demands effectively. 
 Methodology and numerical simulations In current investigations three different software packages Quantum ESPRESSO, SCAPS-1D and PVSyst have been employed for exploration of novel materials and simulations of devices correlated with them. Three different stages have been covered to compile the results. Initially the properties of KSnBr 3 were initially studied using firstprinciples calculations to determine its material characteristics. These calculations, have been employed to study the electronic and optical properties of the KSnBr 3 perovskite material. Semi-local Becke-Johnson (BJ) exchange-correlation potential as well as the Tran Blaha (TB-mBJ) approximations were utilized within the Quantum ESPRESSO software to carry out these calculations, offering valuable insights into the behavior of this promising material. The potential value was held constant in the interstitial and core regions to prevent irregularities at the surface and boundary of the spherical muffin-tin region. Structural and thermal stability may be determined through phonon spectrum and molecular dynamics. The structural characteristics were accurately determined using the PBEsol approximation instead of the local density (LDA) and generalized gradient GGA approximations, albeit potentially leading to a slight decrease in the accuracy of electronic properties due to the absence of a potential term in the overall Hamiltonian of the system. Advanced hybrid functionals (e.g., HSE06) or manybody perturbation theory (e.g., GW approximation), may also provide much improved accuracy for excited states and optical properties. Consequently, the Trans and Balaha modified Potential (TB-mBJ) was employed to improve the accuracy of the bandgap. For these calculations, a 12 × 12x12 k-mesh was selected, as the maximum energy released remained constant. The angular momentum and Gaussian factor (Gmax = 16, ι = 10) were also determined. The iteration procedure achieved energy convergence up to 10 -5 Ry. By leveraging density functional theory (DFT), the interactions between electrons and the crystalline structure of KSnBr 3 were meticulously analyzed, providing a deeper understanding of its behavior at the quantum level  (Schwarz et al. 2002; Shabbir et al. 2018) . The electronic properties were scrutinized which encompassed the examination of key characteristics such as band structure and electronic energy bandgap (E g ), density of states (DOS), and charge density distribution within the material. These calculations facilitated the identification of crucial electronic parameters, shedding light on the material's conductive behavior for use in applications. The investigations delved into the optical properties of KSnBr 3 . It involved the assessment of vital optical parameters including the dielectric function (ε 1 , ε 2 ), optical characteristics, including extinction coefficient k (ω), reflectivity R (ω), optical conductivity L (ω), refractive index n (ω) and absorption coefficient α(ω). By scrutinizing the optical properties, valuable insights were noticed for material's interaction with light, paving the way for its potential applications in optoelectronic devices  (Shabbir et al. 2022; Krishnamurthi et al. 2020) . The optoelectronic properties of KSnBr 3 were inspected by Density Functional Theory (DFT) and these data was integrated into SCAPS-1D solar capacitance simulator to calculate the photovoltaic characteristics of solar cell by using KSnBr 3 as an absorber material along with Formamidinium CH(NH 2 ) 2 and various HTLs and ETLs. SCAPS-1D is a simulation package has been embedded with the simulation algorithm based on continuity and Poisson's equations for simulations of solar cells. These equations describe the charge carriers (electrons and holes) transport mechanism and behavior in semiconducting materials. It is widely used software for simulation of solar cell due to its authentic capability to simulate and model several functions like defect configuration, Bulk and interface, energy distributions functions like single, uniform,Gaussian state. SCAPS-1D is specifically designed to analyze the electrical behavior of solar cell to enhance their stability and efficiency in photovoltaic research area  (Kumar et al. 2021) . The algorithm in software is coupled with partial differential-equations (PDE), of Poisson's equation and continuity equation for holes and electrons as specified. The relationship described by Eq. (  1 ) governs the behavior of electrons and holes according to Poisson's equation. This equation is smoothly integrated into the simulation package in the conventional format shown below  (Jain et al. 2020 ); In the given context, Ψ represents the electrostatic potential, E signifies the electric field, ɛs denotes the relative permittivity (static), q stands for the charge, e represents the electron, n also signifies the electron, N + d indicates the donor density,N - d signifies the acceptor density, and N def represents the defect density associated with both donor and acceptor. Equations (  2 ) and (3) jointly illustrate the continuity equations for electrons and holes, as depicted below; And (1) 2 Ψ x 2 = - E x = - s = - q s p -n + N + d + N - d ± N def (2) - j p x + G -U p (n, p) = 0 In this context, J p denotes the current density linked to holes, J n represents the current density linked to electrons, U n (n, P) represents recombination rates related to electrons, U p (n, P) signifies recombination rates linked to holes, and G denotes the generation rate associated with carriers (electrons and holes). Expressions (  4 ) and (  5 ) depict the current density for both electrons and holes, as expressed below: 
 And The symbol q represents the charge, while µ p denotes the electron mobility, and µ n stands for hole mobility. Additionally, D p signifies the diffusion coefficient associated with holes, and D n represents the diffusion coefficient associated with electrons. The SCAPS 1-D simulation software employs these equations and facilitates the computation of multiple solar cell parameters, such as current density (J sc ), efficiency, fill factor, and open circuit voltage (V oc ), across various thicknesses and temperature settings. Notably, this simulation is not limited to light environments but can also be performed in the absence of light, while accommodating diverse temperature conditions. The performance of a solar cell can be evaluated by calculating the fill factor mentioned in expression (  6 ) and efficiency in Eq. (  7 ) which is the product of fill factor and multiplication of the open circuit voltage (V oc ) and short circuit (J sc ) while P in representing the input power. The outcomes derived from the optimized individual solar cell were subsequently incorporated into the PVSyst software suite for conducting module analysis simulations. PVSyst, a software application utilized for designing, simulating, and evaluating the efficiency of solar photovoltaic systems, integrates input data such as system configuration, location-specific weather conditions, and module specifications to construct a model of the solar PV system. Leveraging this model, PVSyst can project the system's energy output and furnish details such as annual energy generation, system efficiency, and capacity factor. Furthermore, the software accommodates shading analysis, inverter efficiency, and other system losses to present an authentic portrayal of its performance. PVSyst also encompasses an extensive database of meteorological data for over 30,000 global locations, facilitating precise simulation of solar energy production across diverse weather conditions. Additionally, the software furnishes comprehensive financial analysis, encompassing costs, payback periods, and return on investment computations, which are pivotal for evaluating the economic viability of a solar PV system. In conclusion, PVSyst stands as a robust tool for optimizing the design and performance of solar PV systems  (Clark et al. 2020; Pindolia et al. 2022 ).

Furthermore, the extension of this investigation to solar panel calculations using PVsyst, based on the novel designed composition. This holistic approach provides a comprehensive understanding of KSnBr 3 and its performance across various compositions, laying the groundwork for the development of efficient, cost-effective solar modules. In essence, this study not only expands the knowledge of optoelectronic properties of proposed material but also paves the way for its integration into next-generation solar cell technologies, ultimately contributing to the advancement of sustainable energy solutions. 
 Results and discussion 
 Structural electronic &optical properties by AB-initio calculations The mBJ approximation has been applied to optimize the crystal structure of KSnBr 3 perovskite structure to obtain its gourd state characteristics. Figure  1  shows the atomic structure of KSnBr 3 with orthorhombic phase and having space group of Pnma. The crystallographic details of KSnBr₃ are revealed in this study, providing essential insights into the material's atomic arrangement and bonding characteristics.

A total of 44 atoms, including potassium (K), tin (Sn), and bromine (Br) are distributed throughout the lattice, each with specific fractional coordinates. The connectivity between atoms is elucidated through 56 bonds, and polyhedral relationships. Noteworthy bond lengths, such as the 5.35287 Å bond between K 3 and K 1 , underscore the compound's structural stability. This comprehensive The energy band diagram for KSnBr 3 material has been presented in Fig.  2 . The calculated band structure along the symmetry direction of first Brillion zone of KSnBr 3 perovskite solar cell. Evidently material exhibit semiconductor properties with an indirect band gap of value (E g ) value ~ 2.27 eV which is observed at Г-symmetry point. The energy band structure analysis shows comparable energy band gaps between Br and K-doped tin halide perovskite solar cell. The band gap of studied perovskite solar cell KSnBr 3 compound is determined by using TB-mBJ scheme to investigate band structure along with partial and total density of state. The energy band gaps obtained through TB-mBJ computations is associated with photovoltaic applications. In Fig.  2 , it can be observed that the valence band maxima (VBM) and conduction band minima (CBM) for KSnBr 3 represent with Г points and X points the first point of the Brillion zone respectively. The statement indicate that substituting chlorine (Cl) with bromine (Br) in a specific ratio leads to reduction in the material band gap which useful is for its optical properties for the performance of photovoltaic devices. The Fermi-level E F is represented by horizontal line. The KSnBr₃ compounds exhibit a predicted energy band gap of 2.27 eV, a critical parameter that significantly influences their electronic properties and potential applications. A self-consistent DFT calculation has been performed to determine the ground-state electronic structure, solving the Kohn-Sham equations iteratively to obtain electron wave functions and eigenvalues. The analysis of the calculated electronic band structure reveals the energy bands and band edges, crucial in understanding the semiconductor behavior of KSnBr₃. In this case, the predicted energy band gap of 2.27 eV indicates the minimum energy required for an electron to transition from the valence band to the conduction band. This band gap is of significant importance as it enables the compounds to accommodate higher voltages, operate at elevated temperatures, exhibit faster switching speeds, and enhance overall efficiency. Figure  2  also depicts the valence and conduction bands and predicted band gap. This diagram is crucial for understanding the electronic Fig.  2  Energy band structures of KSnBr 3 perovskite material characteristics that make KSnBr₃ suitable for applications in optoelectronic devices. The distinct semiconducting nature of the band structure underscores the potential for KSnBr₃ in various technological advancements. The calculated band gap serves as a foundation for the interpretation of the compound's electronic behavior, linking theoretical calculations to practical applications. Ultimately, the predicted energy band gap of 2.27 eV positions KSnBr₃ as a promising material for advanced optoelectronic technologies, offering a unique combination of electronic properties conducive to efficient and high-performance devices. The electronic band structure was analyzed using total density of state (TDOS) and partial density of state (PDOS) of KSnBr 3 by using TB-mBJ approximation for the explanation of conduction band mechanism and valence band mechanism which is represented in Fig.  3a  and b . The energy band gap noticed between the valence and conduction band around the Fermi level of the KSnBr 3 perovskite material originate due to result of the hybridization between Sn 5sp and 4d orbitals and various material like Br (4sp) states along with little contribution of K sp orbitals. In the KSnBr₃ perovskite, potassium typically adopts a + 1 oxidation state, contributing one electron to the compound. K has a single valence electron in the 4 s orbital Tin in the + 4 oxidation state contributes to the compound's electronic structure with its 5 s and 4d orbitals. Bromine typically adopts a -1 oxidation state, contributing seven electrons to the compound. Br has 4 valence electrons in the 4p orbital. The interactions of these orbitals with the orbitals of potassium and tin are crucial for understanding the bonding in KSnBr₃. The electronic density distribution resulting from these hybrid orbitals determines the nature of bonding, influencing the overall stability and properties of the material. There is major contribution of Br atomic orbitals in the valence band density of states and great part of atomic contributions from K and Sn atoms in the conduction band density of states. The interaction of potassium, tin, and bromine orbitals leads to the formation of hybrid orbitals, influencing the electronic structure and bonding characteristics. 
 Optical properties of KSnBr 3 The enhancement in optical performance of KSnBr 3 can be explained by examining its absorption spectra, interaction of light with different wavelength when used in the solar cell. A smaller band gap allows the material to absorb a broader range of photons, which increase its light absorption capacity which leads to a high probable efficiency of KSnBr 3  (Kaity et al. 2021; Tran 2009) . The detailed Investigation have been performed to calculate optical and structural parameters for potassium based perovskite KSnBr 3 materials, through employing the best precise exchange correlation functional. Furthermore, calculations are performed to analyze the electronic response, energy band structure, and energy band gap of KSnBr 3 material. By investigating the relationship between the position of valence band maxima and conduction band minima with the k-vector within the Brillion zone, the characteristic band gap (E g ) of KSnBr 3 is determined. Optical properties describe the interaction of sunlight when it strike on the surface of the material in electromagnetic spectrum. By analyzing the optical properties of the materials, one can understand how it may interact with different wavelength of sunlight, transparency mechanism and ability to control light behavior for various applications. The comprehensive analysis of novel inorganic KSnBr 3 involve multiple factors, including the real and imaginary parts of dielectric functions, refractive index, absorption coefficient, reflectivity, extinction coefficient energy band gap and loss spectrum. The purpose of this comprehensive investigation is to demonstrate the response of various novel materials in solar energy operated applications. The analysis of various optical properties such absorption coefficient, dielectric constant have been done to understand the linear response of electromagnetic radiation. Perovskite materials exhibit two types of transitions referred as inter-band and intra-band transitions  (Ahmad et al. 2021; Madsen et al. 2006) . The complex dielectric function function ε αβ (ω) can be expressed as ε 1 (ω) + iε 2 (ω), in which ε 1 (ω) represents the real part of the dielectric constant, which relates to the polarization of light. While ε 2 (ω) shows the imaginary part, including the amount of energy lost during the absorption of sunlight which is represented in Eq. 8. Penn's model ε 1 (0) describe bandgap of studied materials which is shown by mathematical equation Reε 1 (0) ≈ 1 + (ħ ωp /E g ) 2  . This equation is commonly used to describe the behavior of the dielectric function in certain materials or systems  (Huang et al. 2016) . Optical properties play an important role to investigate electronic structure and exploring (8) ( ) = 1 ( ) + i 2 ( ), potential application in optoelectronic devices. Figure  4a  represent the calculated dielectric constant for the perovskite compounds (KSnBr 3 ) of real parts. It shows that the dielectric function exhibits a proportional relationship to the frequency increase when examining minor peaks of lower intensity within the conduction band, specifically in the energy range of 12eVto 14 eV.Within this frequency electron transition occur due to energy lose and dielectric function become zero or negative almost. When the excitation energy is increased beyond the band gap the charge carrier transfer from the valence band to the conduction band. At high energy level both real and imaginary parts become very small. The imaginary component ε 2 (ω) denotes light absorption as given in Fig.  4b . Optical bandgap is shown by the threshold value of ε 2 (ω). This gap is enhanced relative to band gaps which gained from band structures due to Kramer-Kronig relation and employed approximations. KSnBr 3 shows large band gap in visible region which shows its effectiveness for photovoltaic applications. The optical peaks are observed at different energy level like peak at 4.1 eV energy which may be appeared due to electronic transition between (5sp) and Br (4p) orbitals for inorganic perovskite material KSnBr 3 . The electronic transition in between occupied states corresponding to valance band V B towards unoccupied states that correspond to the conduction band C B that is responsible for the observed peaks in the calculated spectra. In the low frequency region, the refractive index remains relatively constant due to the nature of the materials in response to electromagnetic wave. At lower frequencies, the energy of the photons is not sufficient to excite electrons to higher energy states within the material. However, as the energy increase, the refractive index n (ω) starts to rise to distinct electronic transitions which occurring from the valence band to the conduction band. It can be observed from the graph of refractive index that we observe a gradual increase in the value of refractive index n (0) from 2.5 eV to 3.0 eV in Fig.  5a . It is important to have a direct inter-band transition for efficient energy harvesting. This direct transition is good for efficient energy of charge carrier, which is crucial for photovoltaic application. As the energy of the photons increases, it becomes evident that there is a decrease in the inclination towards n (ω), and subsequently it will go in higher energy range. Figure  5 (b) represent the extinction coefficient which is usually denoted as k(ω). It describes the attenuation of an electromagnetic wave as it propagate through a material. It provide information about the absorption and scattering process that occur within the material. The extension coefficient, represented by k (ω), exhibits noticeable anisotropy within the energy range of 2-12 eV for photons which is shown in Fig.  5(b ). Photon energy increase as the reflectivity decrease in the visible electromagnetic spectrum of materials. The k (ω) is proportional to the optical absorption by the relation ∶ ( ) = ω.k(ω) c  (Shabbir et al. 2018) . Figure  5 (c) display the reflectivity spectra for KSnBr 3 novel inorganic material which demonstrate marvelous absorption of photons in interband transition within the visible range 2-7 eV which is the responsible for maximum reflectivity that confirm potential applicability of this material in solar cell applications. Multiple peaks in the visible region of electromagnetic radiation can be observed when there are optical transition occurring from the valence band to the conduction band. An abrupt decrease in reflectivity spectrum has been observed from 6 eV which might be collectively plasma resonance. Photon energy increase as the reflectivity decrease in the visible electromagnetic spectrum of all halide perovskite materials. Optical absorption coefficient of kSnBr 3 is calculated by the PBE-Sol approximation which are shown in Fig.  5d . The absorption coefficient value is high in the range of 12-14 eV which shows that the photon absorption occur in visible region spectrum due absorption between the p and s orbitals of halide ions of Br in the valence band and the s-orbital in the conduction band. If photon energy is increased it suggests more number of photons which observed in visible region. The majority of the examined compounds indicate significant absorption within the energy range of 2-14 eV. Calculated absorption coefficient α (ω) of KSnBr 3 shows that primary absorption peak at around 4 eV, a secondary broader peak centered at 5 eV and third peak roughly at 6 eV. The maximum values observed in the reflection spectra are associated with the plasma frequency (ω), which is commonly linked to the energy loss function (L) in visible region around 14(eV) of KSnBr 3 novel inorganic perovskite material which is represented in Fig.  5e . The energy loss function (L) is commonly linked to the plasma frequency which is usually denoted by L (ω), Materials with suitable band gap in the visible range absorb photons with energies and utilize them efficiently corresponding to wavelength of visible light. The loss function L(ω) versus photons energy graph is represented in Fig.  5e , where L(ω) exhibits increasing trend on growing photonic energy to higher level. The electronic and optical attributes of KSnBr 3 perovskite compound ensure its suitability as an effective light absorber in solar cell technology. Its electronic band structure displays favorable electronic transitions, while its optical behavior showcases an absorption spectrum conducive to efficient light absorption. These findings underscore KSnBr 3 as a potential and promising candidate for enhancing the photovoltaic performance of solar energy conversion devices such as solar cells. 
 Solar cell design Based on the suitability of the KSnBr 3 material for solar cell applications, it has been employed in the solar cell composition to evaluate its performance. Layered perovskite solar cell configuration consist of electrons transport layer (ETL), a light-absorbing layer which is also called the active layer, a hole transport later (HTL) and conducting oxide layer such as Aluminum-doped Zinc oxide (AZO) layer with glasslike transparent conductive material at front and back metal contact with suitable metal work function. Solar cell is fundamentally constructed with three different layers, an optical absorbing layer, which is kept in between HTL and ETL. KSnBr 3 is used as an absorber material, TiO 2 used as ETL and CuSbS 2 as HTL material respectively. Solar Capacitance simulator SCAPS-1D has been employed to simulate transport properties, current density, recombination mechanism and electric field distribution. The hetrojunction architecture model and device structure used for the simulated solar cell is Au-CuSbS 2 -FASnI 3 -KSnBr 3 -TiO 2 -AZO is illustrate in Fig.  6 . The methodology for numerical investigations has already been expressed in section-2 to obtain the optimized performance of a single cell. One of the main reason for the selection of these layers is the energy band alignment of the structural layers to follow the principle for charge carrier transport in the proposed composition of the solar cell. There were several considerations related to the selection of these layers in perspective of high conductivity, high charge carrier mobility, non-toxic nature and greater stability. Gold (Au) is preferred as a back metal contact in solar cells due to its excellent conductivity, chemical stability, and superior work function, which enhances charge carrier extraction and overall device efficiency. TiO₂ is favored as an electron transport layer (ETL) in solar cells due to its high electron mobility, excellent transparency, and optimal energy level alignment, which enhance electron extraction, reduce recombination, and improved efficiency. Likewise, CuSbS2 is an ideal hole transport layer (HTL) in solar cells due to its high hole mobility, suitable energy alignment, and low cost. It enhances hole extraction, reduces recombination, and improves overall device stability. FASnI 3 is strategically included in solar cell composition Au-CuSbS 2 -FASnI 3 -KSnBr 3 -TiO 2 -AZO hybrid structure due to its promising photovoltaic properties. It features an optimal bandgap of approximately 1.3 eV, which may be considered ideal for absorbing a broad spectrum of sunlight, leading to efficient energy conversion. It exhibits greater charge carrier mobility, which ensures efficient charge transport and reduces recombination. Importantly, as a tin-based perovskite, it offers a less toxic alternative to lead-based perovskites, making it more environment friendly while maintaining high performance, thus enhancing the overall efficiency and sustainability of the solar cell. The presented study is unique in a way that novel hybrid solar cell composition has been designed with a focus toward non-toxicity, low cost, high efficiency and greater stability. In the proposed composition Au-CuSbS 2 -FASnI 3 -KSnBr 3 -TiO 2 -AZO first-time integration of FASnI 3 , a tin-based perovskite, with the newly explored KSnBr 3 inorganic perovskite absorber in a hybrid solar cell structure has been performed and after optimizing the performance of a single cell the solar module parameters have also been explored using PVSyst software. The calculated energy band profile for Au-CuSbS 2 -FASnI 3 -KSnBr 3 -TiO 2 -AZO solar cell composition has been presented in Fig.  7 . The optimized values of the energy band   A novel solar cell configuration of Au-CuSbS 2 -FASnI 3 -KSnBr 3 -TiO 2 -AZO has been proposed which follow the solar cell principle and exhibits promising results. The characteristic parameters which have been inserted in the software for simulations have been calculated by DFT and verified from recent literature have been mentioned in Table-1. A total current density of 31.4521 mA/cm 2 at an open circuit voltage measuring 0.9406 V fill factor of 75.60% is achieved with power conversion efficiency of 22.36% by employing KSnBr 3 and Formamidinium CH(NH 2 ) 2 SnI 3 as optical absorbers as shown in Fig.  8 . Throughout the investigation, thickness, defects and carrier concentration were systematically adjusted in order to obtain the most optimized outcomes. The investigations reveal that the optimum performance was observed for the thickness value of 0.010 µm for TiO 2 , 0.010 µm absorber layer KSnBr 3 , 3.5 µm for CH(NH 2 ) 2 SnI 3 and 0.100 µm for CuSbS 2 . The calculations of various parameters such as thickness, energy band-gap, electron affinity, dielectric permittivity, density of states (DOS) in the conduction band and valence band, electron/hole thermal velocity, electron mobility, hole mobility, donor (Nd), and acceptor (Na) concentrations are crucial for accurate simulations in SCAPS 1D. Optimized thickness plays a pivotal role in determining the physical dimensions of the solar cell layers, impacting the absorption of incident light and the transport of charge carriers. The energy band-gap (eV) represents the minimum energy required for electron excitation, influencing the semiconductor's absorption properties and electrical behavior. Electron affinity and dielectric permittivity characterize the material's interaction with electrons and its ability to store and transmit electrical charge, respectively, affecting charge transport and recombination processes. Electron/hole thermal velocity and mobility parameters dictate the speed at which charge carriers move through the material, impacting device performance and efficiency. Finally, donor and acceptor concentrations (Nd and Na) determine the semiconductor's doping level, influencing its conductivity and electrical properties. Fig.  8  characteristics for the optimized KSnBr 3 solar cell Accurate determination of these parameters through theoretical calculations ensures precise modeling and simulation of solar cell behavior in SCAPS 1D. By inputting realistic values for these parameters, software can effectively predict device performance, optimize device designs, and explore new materials and configurations for enhanced efficiency and reliability. These parameters are either calculated by DFT and in some cases taken from verified literature (Table  1 ). Quantum efficiency (QE) plot signifies crucial information in solar cell characterization, offering insights into the device's spectral response and identifying regions for efficiency enhancement through material and structural optimizations. Figure  9  shows the relationship between the quantum efficiency and wavelength of incident radiation. It indicate that the greatest absorption of photons occur within the wavelength range of visible region. The high value of quantum efficiency means better absorption of the light. A decrease in efficiency is noticed as the wavelength extends into the infrared region. Beyond these points, there is a noticeable degradation in device performance. The trend shown in the inset of Fig.  9  aligns with the energy bandgap theory for semiconductors, as photon energy decreases in going from UV region to IR region, fewer photons possess sufficient energy to excite charge carriers across the bandgap, resulting in diminished absorption and lesser QE beyond the visible spectrum. In UV range, photons have higher energy than the bandgap, promoting efficient electron excitation. But, as wavelengths shift higher, photon energy decreases, causing fewer electron-hole pairs to be generated due to deficient energy to overcome energy bandgap. The decreasing trend highlights the recombination losses in IR region. The recombination rate signifies the rate at which charge carriers recombine in the form of pairs, reducing the device efficiency. This critical parameter gets influenced by material properties, defects, and operating conditions. Higher recombination rates result in bigger losses, impacting the cell output. Minimizing recombination is pivotal for increasing photovoltaic efficiency and optimizing the device operation. Total recombination rate cm-3. s of electrons and holes rate cm -3. s is shown in Fig.  10  with the effect of variation of surface depth X (µm) against recombination cm-3. s of optimized solar cells. Highest values 9.27E +20 cm -3. s recombination rate is observed at the beginning indicating the surface recombination effects. Once the photons get absorbed within the interior recombination rate is much smaller than the overall charge carrier generation. At the outset, near top surface, defects and surface recombination centers give rise to higher recombination rates due to increased surface to volume ratio. But, as thickness grows, carriers encounter less defects and travel longer distances, reducing the probability of recombination. Moreover, at greater depths, carriers experience less Auger recombination due to reduced carrier density. These factors collectively enhance the observed trend of diminishing recombination rates with increasing thickness of the solar cell. The performance of solar cell is decreased due to increasing recombination as the carrier diffusion length improves which could lead potentially decline in solar cell efficiency. Carrier recombination encompasses three main types: radiative recombination, Auger recombination, and Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination, all of which contribute to the overall recombination process. The recombination process is relatively week at the lower end of spectrum when compare to the rate at which carrier are generated. Numerical simulation has been performed on a solar cell configuration with the structure Au-CuSbS 2 -FASnI 3 -KSnBr 3 -TiO 2 -AZO.The simulation mainly focuses on varying the defect density at the interface among distinct structural layers within various range. The relationship of generation rate and surface depth (µm) against diffusion length is shown in Fig.  11 . During the carrier generation electron hole are created when an electron is excited from the valence band to conduction band it produce a hole in the valence band. Electron-hole pairs creation can be determined by photon flux N phot (λ), x) equation. The process of recombination is the inverse process of generation in which conduction band electrons and holes are coupled and annihilated. Solar cells recombination rate can be determine by charge carrier lifespan and density. The recombination of electron-hole pairs is reduced due to the presence of defect states within the absorber layer. The recombination rate distribution is not uniform due to grain boundaries and (9) G(( ), x) = a(( ), x)N phot (( ), x) flaws in active layer. More than 98% photons exhibit within the wavelength range of 300 to 900 nm, while fewer 2% undergo recombination through alternative mechanism such as Auger and SRH processes. The carrier mobility of CuSbS 2 has remarkable effect on performance of device efficiency. Due to increasing recombination the value of acceptor density become higher and device efficiency decrease. The thickness of structural layers is adjusted along with the addition of suitable buffer layer to obtain maximum generation rate higher that the recombination rate. The quantity of defects within perovskite films plays important role which indicate device performance of solar cell because these layers are responsible for generating photoelectrons. The performance of photovoltaic parameters depends on behavior of electron-hole pair recombination and defects states. Crystalline structure of perovskite materials leads to a reduction in charge recombination which ultimately improved device performance. Carrier generation G eh 1.0410 22 cm -3 s against diffusion length is found maximum at 3.6 µm. The device performance gets decreased by increasing diffusion length and carrier recombination. The semiconducting layers possess an optical band gap that specifically allows the absorption of radiation within the ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum due to higher intensity of absorption in these regions. Results indicates a spatial separation of generation and recombination mechanisms within different regions of the solar cell. At greater depths, where the generation rate predominates, efficient light absorption and carrier generation occur due to the growing effect of incident photons. But, near the surface, elevated recombination rates propose that the presence of surface defects or traps facilitate carrier recombination. Surface recombination centers, such as dangling bonds or impurities, act as non-radiative recombination pathways, hindering carrier extraction and reducing device efficiency. Optimizing the balance between generation and recombination processes throughout the absorber region is crucial for maximizing the solar cell's performance and overall efficiency. Variation in the defect densities at the interface versus the electrical parameters has been carried out. This analysis provides insights into how varying defect densities impact device  
 GeH Fig.  11  Generation rate and surface depth for optimized KSnBr 3 solar performance. As defect density rise, carrier recombination rates typically increase, leading to decreased electrical parameters. Conversely, lower defect densities correlate with improved device characteristics, including higher short-circuit current and efficiency. Understanding this correlation guides optimization strategies, such as interface passivation and material engineering, aimed at minimizing defect-related losses and enhancing the overall performance of the solar cell. Figure  12  shows the histogram displaying the relationship between interface defect densities and electrical parameters of the fine-tunedperovskite solar cell. The figure suggests that interface defect densities increase as the recombination rate is increased which degrade device efficiency. Due to enhancement in recombination and number of traps at the interface the power conversion efficiency of device is decreased. The simulation results show that interface defect density of 10E10 cm -3 could be recognized through the optimization value of solar cell performance. Interface defects can influence carrier transport within the device. By varying the interface density in package, a change in carrier mobility conductivity and current-voltage characteristics has been noticed. An inverse relation has been noticed between wavelength and photon absorption. In the composition of the solar cell Au-CuSbS 2 -FASnI 3 -KSnBr 3 -TiO 2 -AZO all of the structural layers have been systematically optimized to obtain the best thickness value of the layer to make it cost effective. TiO 2 -ETL thickness variation significantly effects the solar cell device performance. The thickness of electron transport layer has been increased from 0.010 to 0.20 μm in fifteen steps and it has been noticed that the electrical parameters of solar cell (V oc , J sc , FF% and PCE % ) were found best at 0.010 μm value. Likewise, CuSbS 2 layer which is utilized as HTL in the device structure has been optimized between 0.100 to 0.200 μm thicknesses. CuSbS 2 -HTL have given significant electrical parameters at the thickness value of 0.10 μm and Formamidinium (FA) CH (NH 2 ) 2 SnI 3 at 3.5 μm. Absorber layers plays an important role for the optimum performance of device. KSnBr 3 and FASnI 3 have been utilized as absorber materials in the novel proposed Au-CuSbS 2 -FASnI 3 -KSnBr 3 -TiO 2 -AZO configuration of the solar cell. The thickness of KSnBr 3 has been varied between 0.001 to 0.015 μm. There has been an increasing trend in the fill factor whereas decreasing trend in the V oc , J sc , and PCE % . The observed trends in the performance of solar cell with varying thicknesses may be elucidated by considering the interplay Fig.  12  Interface defects vs Electrical Parameters between optical absorption, charge transport, and recombination processes. As the thickness increases, more photons are absorbed within the absorber layer, leading to an increase in number of generated electron-hole pairs, hance boosting J sc . However, beyond an optimal thickness, excessive light can lead to higher charge carrier recombination, resulting in a decline in both V oc and FF%. The fill factor tends to increase with thickness initially as the increased absorption enhances the charge carrier density and improves charge collection efficiency. However, beyond the optimum thickness, the increased charge carrier recombination outweighs the benefits of greater absorption, causing the fill factor to drop. The decrease in V oc and J sc beyond the optimal thickness is attributed to increased charge carrier recombination at thicker layers due to longer carrier transit times and increased likelihood of carrier trapping. It leads to a reduction in the voltage and current extracted from the device, ultimately decreasing the efficiency. The optimal thickness of 0.010 μm likely represents a balance between efficient light absorption and minimized charge carrier recombination. At this thickness, the benefits of increased light absorption are maximized without substantial detriment from enhanced recombination, resulting in the peak overall device performance for the inorganic perovskite optical absorber layer. The fill factor tends to peak at this thickness, indicating optimal charge carrier collection efficiency without significant losses. The optimized value of the thickness strikes a balance between the benefits of increased absorption and the drawbacks of enhanced recombination, resulting in the highest overall device performance, as indicated in the Fig.  13 . Any variation in the specified thickness may deteriorate the device performance. The band gap of the absorber layer has a significant influence on the photon absorption of PSCs. The optimized values of thicknesses in Au-CuSbS 2 -FASnI 3 -KSnBr 3 -TiO 2 -AZO composition give best performance. The response of the solar cell against temperature is shown in Fig.  14 . The solar cell performance was analyzed by changing the temperature within the range of 270-350 K to study its resultant effects. It has been observed that open circuit voltage V oc is maximum at 270 K and it decreases from 0.992 to 0.892 V with increasing temperature and due to reverse saturation current phenomenon. There is a Fig.  13  Effect of thickness for absorber layer KSnBr 3 suitable increase of QE values from 21.14 to 22.68% due to increasing current density and as the thickness of light absorber layer. The value of FF is decrease from 79.8 to 73.5% may be due to change in interface defect density and recombination. A small increasing trend of J sc values has been noticed from 31.40 to 31.55 mA/cm 2 due increasing temperature and greater number of collision of phonon movements. Variation in temperature induce modifications in the series resistance, which subsequently effect other important parameters such as bandgap, electron and hole recombination and carrier mobility. Plotting electrical parameters against temperature reveals interesting trends. The observed decrease in fill factor as temperature rises can be attributed to heightened electron-hole recombination rates and greater surface recombination effects. Conversely, V oc tends to increase with temperature due to the drop in the semiconductor bandgap, augmenting the available voltage across the cell. Likewise, J sc rises with temperature as more photons possess adequate energy to generate electron-hole pairs. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency generally increases with temperature, reflecting overall effects of V oc and J sc variations. These trends underscore the intricate balance between charge carrier generation, recombination, and their transport phenomenon within the solar cell. 
 Solar module characteristics The output of the proposed solar cell configuration Au-CuSbS 2 -FASnI 3 -KSnBr 3 -TiO 2 -AZO has been employed in well-established PVsyst simulation package to obtain the output characteristics of the module. The obtained electrical parameters were adjusted as input parameters for a solar panel comprising of 72 cells in series with standards thickness 30 mm and weight 30 KG. The dimensions of the panel have been adjusted to be 2200 mm × 1100 mm by looking at the trends in the market. There exist several combinations of solar cells commercially, but to keep the cost effectiveness and light weight features the number of cells have been considered. Solar module performance in response to incident solar irradiation has been specified in Fig.  15 . The IV characteristics of the solar panel illustrate a clear relationship between irradiance intensity and output power. As the irradiance intensity enhance from 200 W/m 2 to 1000 W/ m 2 in equal steps, there is a noticeable increase in the output power of the panel. This trend seem to be consistent with the fundamental behavior of photovoltaic systems, where higher incident sunlight levels result in increased electron excitation and ultimately, higher current generation within the semiconductor material of the cells. The increase in current output from 101.3 watts to 525.2 watts across the tested irradiance range underscores the direct correlation between sunlight intensity and its electrical power production capability. This phenomenon highlights the module's ability to efficiently convert incident light into usable electrical energy. Furthermore, the consistent increments in output power with each step increase in irradiance intensity reveal a reliable and predictable nature of the solar module's performance under varying climate conditions ("Modelling and numerical simulations of eco-friendly double absorber solar cell "Spiro-OmeTAD, CIGS, MASnI 3 , CdS, ZnO" and its PV-module"Organic Electronics 117 2023). The solar panel performance in response to variation in temperature in shown in Fig.  16 . The output analysis of solar module performance in response to temperature variation, conducted using PVsyst, reveals a noticeable degradation in panel efficiency as temperature increases. The degradation is revealed in the decrease of the maximum power point (Pmpp) from 547.5 watts at 10 °C to 508.6 watts at 70 °C. The mechanism behind this phenomenon can be attributed to the temperature dependence of various factors manipulating solar cell performance. Firstly, as temperature rises, the semiconductor material's electrical conductivity enhance, leading to higher dark current and hence reduced efficiency. Additionally, the decrease in bandgap energy with temperature causes an increase in the number of paired charge carriers generated, contributing to increased recombination losses. Moreover, the temperature coefficient of the solar Fig.  15  IV characteristics of solar module at different values of incident irradiation cell cause a decline in V oc with increasing temperature, thus shifting the operating point away from the maximum power point. PVsyst utilizes sophisticated models to calculate these temperature-dependent effects accurately. By incorporating detailed empirical data, PVsyst calculates the panel performance under changing temperature conditions, providing valuable insights for system design and optimization. The detected degradation in panel performance underscores the importance of temperature management strategies in PV systems to mitigate efficiency losses and increase energy output. The power output characteristics of the solar module have been shown in Fig.  17 . The results exhibit a clear relationship between irradiance intensity and output power. As the irradiance intensity gets higher from 200 to 1000 W/m 2 in equal steps, there is a gradual increase in the output power of the module. This direct correlation stems from the basic principle of photovoltaic systems, where higher incident sunlight levels result in greater electron excitation and subsequent current generation within the semiconductor material of the cells. The observed enhancement in output power from 101.3 watts to 525.2 watts across the tested irradiance range emphasizes the panel ability to efficiently convert incident solar radiation into functional electrical energy. This increase in power output is crucial for maximizing the energy yield of photovoltaic systems, predominantly in regions with high solar irradiance levels. Also, the consistent increments in output power with each step growth in irradiance intensity highlight the predictable and consistent nature of the solar panel performance under varying climate conditions. The basis for the power output characteristics is essential for correctly predicting the energy production of solar photovoltaic systems and improving their design for maximum efficiency. By harnessing the power of sunlight efficiently, PV characteristics of solar panels may play a vital role in the transition towards sustainable and renewable energy. The presented results have been found to be consistent with theoretical calculations  (Chowdhury et al. 2020) . The analysis of solar module power versus voltage characteristics in response to temperature variation has been conducted using PVsyst and presented in Fig.  18 . It unveils a distinct degradation in panel performance as temperature gets higher. This degradation is evident in the reduction of the maximum power point (Pmpp) from 547.5 watts at 10 °C   1, 528.5, and 518.6  watts corresponding to temperature increments of 15 °C. The underlying mechanism driving this phenomenon lies in the temperature dependence of several factors governing solar cell performance. As temperature rises, the electrical conductivity of the semiconductor material increases, leading to elevated dark current and lesser efficiency. Additionally, the decrease in bandgap energy with temperature amplifies the generation of pairs of charge carriers, contributing to heightened recombination losses and lesser efficiency. Moreover, temperature coefficient of the solar cell reduce V oc with rising temperature, thereby shifting the operating point away from the highest power point. PVsyst employs refined models to accurately calculate these temperature dependent features, integrating panel performance under changing conditions of temperature. The observed degradation underlines the critical importance of temperature management strategies in photovoltaic systems to moderate efficiency losses and optimize energy output. Understanding these temperature-dependent features may prove to be essential for designing and operating efficient solar photovoltaic systems under changing environmental effects. The proposed model can be executed for output power calculations for any geographical site. The presented research has been done to investigate the novel perovskite material KSnBr 3 using AB-initio analysis to understand its electronic and optical properties. Subsequently, the explored has been incorporated into a solar cell composition alongside Au-CuSbS 2 -FASnI 3 -TiO 2 -AZO, and simulated using SCAPS 1D software for single solar cell performance. Further, the solar cell is simulated in PVsyst to assess its potential in solar panel applications. The incredible findings highlight the promising characteristics of KSnBr 3 and its compatibility within the solar cell composition. The integration of KSnBr 3 enhances the overall performance of the solar cell, demonstrating its potential for practical application in photovoltaic systems. The presented research emphasizes the significance of KSnBr 3 to advance the efficiency and effectiveness of solar energy technologies. Subsequent simulation studies in SCAPS 1D software illustrate the incorporation of KSnBr 3 within a solar cell composition, showcase its potential to enhance solar cell performance. PVsyst simulations emphasize the feasibility of integrating KSnBr 3 into solar panel configurations. The highlights of these investigations indicate the viability of KSnBr 3 as a promising candidate for improving solar cell and panel efficiency, thus emphasizing its significance in advancing the field of renewable energy  (Qasim and Malik 2023; Izadi et al. 2021) . 
 Conclusion A comprehensive computational investigation of the inorganic KSnBr 3 perovskite material through density functional theory illustrate its potential for use in optoelectronic devices. The structural, electronic and optical properties, KSnBr 3 demonstrated a promising energy bandgap (~ 2.27 eV) and broad-spectrum for photon absorption capabilities. The inorganic KSnBr 3 perovskite material was employed as optical absorber in a novel solar cell configuration Au-CuSbS 2 -FASnI 3 -KSnBr 3 -TiO 2 -AZO along with organo-metal-halide absorber Formamidinium (FA) tin iodide CH(NH 2 ) 2 SnI 3 with bandgap (1.30 eV) to obtain optimized solar cell performance.
