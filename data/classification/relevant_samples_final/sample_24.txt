Title: Supporting Information Perovskite surface passivation using thiophene-based small molecules for efficient and stable solar cells

EXPERIMENTAL 
 Materials SnO2 (15%) and acetonitrile (ACN, 99.6%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Lead iodine (PbI2, 99%), methylammonium iodide (MAI), Spiro-OMeTAD (99.5%), PCBM (99.5%), 4-Tert-butylpyridine (4-t-BP) and Li-bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonic) imide (Li-TFSI) were all brought from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology. Thiophene-2acetamide (TAA, 99.5%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%), chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%) and dimethyl-formamide (DMF, 99%) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 
 PSC device fabrication ITO glass substrates were etched by the mixture of Zn powder and HCl aqueous solution (1:5). Then, they were cut into 1.5×1.5 cm 2 pieces, followed by cleaning sequentially in deionized water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol for 15 min under sonication. The SnO2 solution was prepared by mixing SnO2 nanocrystalline and deionized water by volume ratio of 1:5. TCA is dissolved in isopropanol with different concentrations (1, 2 and 3 mg/ml) and TAA is dissolved in isopropanol with different concentrations (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mg/ml). The MAPbI3 precursor solution was prepared by adding 159 mg MAI and 461 mg PbI2 into the DMF/DMSO (volume ratio 9:1) mixed solvent. The hole transport layer (HTL) was employed with Spiro-OMeTAD in CB solution (72.25 mg/mL) with 28.75 uL 4-t-BP and 17.5 μL Li-TFSI/ACN (520 mg/mL) added. PSCs were fabricated by the following procedures. SnO2 layer was deposited on the ITO substrates by spin-coating 40 μL SnO2 solution at the rate of 3000 r/min for 30s, then it was heated at 150 °C for 30 min on a heating table. The MAPbI3 layers were deposited using the one-step anti-solvent spin-coating method. The precursor solution was spin-coated on the SnO2 layer at 5000 r/min for 36 s, and 1 mL of diethyl ether was continuously dripped on the spinning substrate at 21 s after the start of the procedure. After annealing on a hotplate at 100°C for 10 min, a dense MAPbI3 film was obtained. The surface passivation was performed by spin-coating 40 μL Th, TCA or TAA solution onto the as-formed MAPbI3 layer at the rate of 4000 r/min for 30s, then the films were heated at 60°C (Th treatment) and 100 °C (TCA, TAA treatment) for 10 min, respectively. For the HTL, the Spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated on the formed MAPbI3 layer with or without the passivation agents at a rate of 3000 r/min for 35 s. At last, Ag top electrodes (100 nm) were thermally evaporated in vacuum (< 1.0×10 -3 Pa). The effective area of PSCs is determined to be 0.1 cm 2 . 
 Powder samples fabrication for FT-IR measurement 3 mg of TCA or 10 mg of TAA powder were mixed with 461 mg of PbI2 powder and dissolved in DMF solvent firstly. The mixture was stirred for 12 h. The solutions were then dried on a heating table at 100 °C for 0.5 h, generating the TCA-PbI2 or TAA-PbI2 mixed powder. Secondly, the pure TCA, TCA-PbI2, pure TAA or TAA-PbI2 mixed powder were totally mixed with KBr powder in an approximate ratio of 1:100, and then pressed into a circular sheet. 
 Characterization The FT-IR spectra were measured by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR, Tensour27). The UV-Vis absorption data were collected using an ultraviolet S4 spectrometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu). The morphologies of MAPbI3 films were observed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) (S-4800, Hitachi). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured by AXIS Supra (Kratos), and the binding energy in XPS is corrected by aligning C 1s peaks. The carrier recombination and dynamic behaviors of perovskite materials were characterized by using steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) (Pico Quant Fluo Time 300). The carrier recombination and transport behaviors in PSCs were evaluated using an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Versa STAT 4, Princeton Applied Research). Illuminated current density-voltage (J-V) characterization was conducted under standard condition (AM1.5 G spectrum, 25 o C) with a calibrated light intensity of 100 mW/cm 2 , using a source meter (2400, Keithley) and a solar simulator (94022A, Newport).

Title: Perovskite Surface Passivation Using Thiophene-Based Small Molecules for Efficient and Stable Solar Cells
The suppression of perovskite surface defect recombination is very critical in obtaining high-efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Ammonium salts with long carbon chains or forming two-dimensional (2D) perovskites are usually used to passivate defects. However, they might limit carrier extraction or transport due to the electrical insulation of long-chain organic ligands. Herein, we propose a small molecule of thiophene-2-acetamide (TAA) to passivate surface defects of a methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 , where MA is methylammonium) perovskite film. The results suggest that the S atom of thiophene suppresses Pb 0 defects and the -C�O group passivates the uncoordinated Pb 2+ by forming chemical bonds with Pb 2+ . The -NH 2 group further enhances the interaction between TAA and perovskite surface defects by forming hydrogen bonds with I -. Moreover, carrier extraction is promoted significantly from the perovskite film to the hole-transport layer. The incorporation of the TAA additive is found to enhance the crystallization of films via a strong interaction between the -C�O group and Pb 2+ of the perovskite precursors. The synergistic effect of surface passivation and enhanced crystallization has been successfully demonstrated in the champion MAPbI 3 PSCs, resulting in a significantly enhanced conversion efficiency from 18.35% to 20.62%. Notably, the device stability under 1-sun illumination and high humidity (∼85%) in air has significantly been improved.
INTRODUCTION Organohalide perovskites (PVSK) have received extensive attention in recent years due to their remarkable advantages, such as high absorption coefficients, tunable band gaps, long carrier diffusion lengths, and solution processing,  1, 2  leading to a considerable increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) from 3.8% in 2009 to 25.7% now.  3  However, the serious carrier recombination caused by easily formed defect traps in perovskite limits its further improvement, based on the theoretical S-Q limit of the conversion efficiency (30.5%).  4  Taking the typical methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ) perovskite (where MA is methylammonium) as an example, these defects include vacancies (V MA , V Pb , and V I ), interstitials (MA i , Pb i , and I i ), and substitutional defects (MA Pb , Pb MA , MA I , I MA , Pb I , and I Pb ).  5  Although most of them are shallow-level defects, previous studies demonstrate that deep-level traps [such as Pb i , antisites (MA I , I MA , Pb I , and I Pb )] are mainly located on the surface of perovskite, irrespective of single-crystal or polycrystalline film.  6, 7  Surface defects are thus the dominated recombination source, with the trap defect density 2 orders of magnitude larger than that in the bulk.  8  On the other hand, the formation of these surface defects also hinders carrier extraction or transport from the perovskite to the carrier-transport layer.  9  Hence, it is of vital importance to reduce or suppress the surface defects, especially deep-level traps,  10  to enhance carrier management for high-efficiency PSCs. Long-carbon-chain amine salts or two-dimensional (2D) perovskites are widely used to passivate surface defects. Duong et al. applied a series of bulky organic cation bromides containing different alkylamine chain lengths to boost the FA/ MA/Cs/Rb PSC efficiency to 19.1%.  11  Jiang et al. used phenethylammonium iodide to passivate the surface defects (I vacancies and grain boundaries) of MAFA mixed perovskite, leading to the conversion efficiency of the device increasing to 23.3%.  12  Li et al. introduced 2-(2-pyridyl)ethylamine (2-PyEA) molecules with 2D structure on the surface or into the bulk perovskite, boosting the FA/MA PSC efficiency to 23.2%.  13  Wang et al. used the 2-aminoacetamidobenzotrifluoride molecule, which contains an electron-donating group (-NH 2 or -C�O) and the hydrophobic group of -CF 3 to passivate defects and enhance the stability of the MAPbI 3 perovskite, with the conversion efficiency increasing to 21.62%.  14  However, the electrical insulating nature of longchain organic ligand cations impedes charge extraction or transport from the perovskite film to the hole-transport layer (HTL) in n-i-p structures. Furthermore, the majority of passivation agents are able to passivate only a single trap defect, limiting further enhancements in the device performance. In this work, we report on the use of thiophene-2-acetamide (TAA) small organic molecules to passivate surface trap defects in perovskite materials. Our findings demonstrate that TAA not only effectively suppresses the formation of uncoordinated Pb 2+ and Pb 0 defects but also enhances carrier transport. In addition, the crystallization of perovskite films is improved as TAA is added to the bulk. The champion MAPbI 3 PSCs exhibit a significantly increased PCE from 18.35% to 20.62%, along with increased stability in air under high moisture and illumination conditions. 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The interactions between different groups of thiophene (Th)based molecules and the perovskite surface are first investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Figure  1a . Two peaks of 138.48 and 143.38 eV are observed in the Pb 4f orbital, which correspond to Pb 4f 7/2 and Pb 4f 5/2 , respectively. After the Th treatment, the positions of the two peaks move to lower binding energy by 0.1-0.2 eV. This is attributed to the bonding of an electron-rich S atom in Th and the electron-deficient Pb 2+ ion on the perovskite surface.  15, 16  After the introduction of thiophene-2-acetic acid (TCA), the positions of the two peaks of Pb have a greater shift, which indicates that -C�O in TCA and Pb 2+ ions have a strong interaction.  17  The TAA treatment further shifts the Pb 4f binding energy downward, which could be ascribed to the additional effect of forming a hydrogen bond between -NH 2 in TAA and I -in the PbI 6 2-octahedron.  18  For the XPS spectra (Figure  S1 ), the peaks of I 3d in the TAA-treated sample also shift to lower binding energy, which may be due to the reduced formation of I vacancies by forming hydrogen bonds (N-H••• I).  19  In addition, the two peaks of neutral lead (Pb 0 ) almost disappeared with the treatment of Th molecules. The reason should be ascribed to the coordination between an electronrich S atom of Th and unsaturated Pb 2+ ions.  20  Parts b and c of Figure  1  show Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of TCA and TAA with and without PbI 2 powders, respectively. Compared with the pure TCA powder, the vibrational characteristic peak of -C�O in the TAA-PbI 2 complex moves from 1698 to 1661 cm -2 (Figure  1b ). Similarly, after TAA was mixed with PbI 2 , the position of the vibrational characteristic peak of -C�O shifted from 1657 to 1625 cm -1 (Figure  1c ). In addition, the vibrational peak of -NH 2 in the TAA-PbI 2 complex powder also moves from 3172 to 3138 cm -1 . The characteristic peak shifts of the functional groups suggest an interaction between the -C�O and -NH 2 groups of TAA with Pb 2+ ions and anions of perovskite, which agree with the XPS results. Figure  1d  illustrates the role of TAA in the perovskite surface trap defects. It is proposed that the presence of -C�O groups in TAA could effectively inhibit the formation of Pb I antisite defects through Lewis base-acid interaction between the -C�O group and Pb I .  21  The electron-rich S atom of Th can also bond to Pb 2+ ions and passivate Pb 0 trap defects.  22  The formation of hydrogen bonds between -NH 2 and I -further reduces the formation of I-related defects (V I ). The passivation effect of Th-based small molecules on perovskite surface defects is further investigated by photoluminescence (PL) measurements. Th, TCA, or TAA is spincoated onto the surface of MAPbI 3 perovskite films prepared via the one-step antisolvent approach to optimize its concentration first (Figure  S2 ). Note that the wavelength of the excitation source used for PL measurements is 375 nm, with a penetration depth of ∼20 nm in the perovskite film,  23  whose thickness is approximately 550 nm (Figure  4b ). As shown in Figure  2a , the PL intensities of perovskite films are obviously improved after the treatment with Th-based molecules. Treatment of the perovskite film with TAA results in the highest PL intensity, in the order of TAA > TCA > Th > control. This suggests that nonradiative recombination at the perovskite surface is significantly reduced. Figure  2b  displays the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay curves of the corresponding films, which are fitted by the function 24 = + + I t I A t A t ( ) exp( / ) ( / ) 0 1 1 2 2 (1) where A 1 and A 2 are the decay amplitudes, t represents the decay time constant, and τ 1 and τ 2 are the fast and slow decay components, respectively. τ 1 is attributed to the trap-assisted nonradiative recombination, while τ 2 is related with the radiative recombination process.  25  The average carrier lifetime can be calculated based on the formula 26 = + + A A A A ( )/( ) avg 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 (2) After TAA passivation, τ 2 and the average lifetime τ avg increase the most in contrast to the control, for which τ 2 increases from 68.6 to 158.0 ns and τ avg increases from 55.3 to 154.4 ns (Table  S1 ). The increase of τ avg is primarily attributed to the passivation of perovskite surface defects by TAA, which reduces nonradiative recombination loss.  27  On the other hand, the hole-extraction or -transport capability is investigated using glass/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD structure.  28  As shown in Figure  2c , the Th molecule treatments significantly lower the PL intensity, and TAA modification has the most notable effect. The PL quenching phenomenon indicates the enhancement of carrier extraction from the perovskite to the HTL layer. The TRPL spectra are fitted with eq 1 (Figure  2d ), with the fitted parameters listed in Table  S2 . τ 1 represents carrier extraction or transport between the perovskite film and HTL.  29  Compared with the control sample, τ 1 and τ 2 of the TAAtreated sample are the smallest, resulting in τ avg decreasing from 27.1 to 10.3 ns. The results indicate that carriers are efficiently extracted from the perovskite layer to the HTL by the TAA treatment. Both the reduced surface recombination and improved carrier extraction can contribute to an enhanced photovoltaic performance of PSCs. To assess the effect of Th small molecules on the device performance, we prepared 20 devices for each group with different passivation treatments, based on the configuration of indium-tin oxide (ITO)/SnO 2 /MAPbI 3 /Spiro-OMeTAD/ Ag. The statistical output parameters of PCEs, short-circuit current density (J SC ), open-circuit voltage (V OC ), and fill factor (FF) exhibit improved performance with good repeatability after the passivation treatments (Figure  3a-d ). The average PCE for the control devices is 17.70%, and it is improved to 18.65%, 19.45%, and 19.80% with the treatment of Th, TCA, and TAA, respectively. Compared with the control (1.07 V), the devices after TCA or TAA treatment have higher V OC (∼1.11 V). Besides, the V OC distribution of TAA-treated devices is narrower than those of TCA treatment, indicating that the former has a better passivation effect with high repeatability. The FFs of the devices are remarkably improved with Th molecule modification. The highest FF is obtained by TAA treatment (77.6%), much higher than that of the control (72.5%), indicating that carrier transport through the perovskite/HTL interface is significantly improved. The enhancement of V OC and FF is ascribed to the reduced recombination and increased extraction of carriers, as evidenced by the PL results. In addition, the J SC values of the devices slightly increase after TCA or TAA treatment, which should be attributed to improved carrier transport and collection. Figure  3e  shows the light-intensity-dependent V OC for the control and Th-small-molecule-treated PSCs. The TAA-treated device exhibits a more linear increase in V OC with a decreased nanoparticle density of 1.50, in comparison to that of the control (1.95). The results demonstrate that TAA treatment significantly reduces surface-trap-assisted recombination.  30, 31  Figure  3f  shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra of the control and Th-small-molecule-treated devices. The EIS spectra of the devices were recorded in the dark, applied with a bias of 0.6 V. The circuit model includes series resistance (R s ), transport resistance (R tr ), and recombi- nation resistance (R re ) of the testing circuit.  29, 32  The results show that the device treated with TAA has a smaller R tr and a larger R re than other devices, indicating that more effective carrier extraction and lower recombination loss are achieved.  33  For investigation of the TAA passivation treatment on perovskite surface defects, it is found that the film crystallinity improves and the grain sizes increase (Figures  S3  and S4 ), which can be attributed to recrystallization of the film.  34  In order to further study the influence on perovskite crystallization, the TAA molecules are introduced to the perovskite precursor solution, and the optimum concentration is determined to be 0.1% molar ratio by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Figure  S5a ) and PL measurements (Figure  S5b ). Figure  4a  shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the control, the perovskite film with TAA additive (TAA@PVSK), and the film with both bulk and surface treatment by TAA (TAA@PVSK/TAA). It can be seen that the TAA additive is helpful in increasing the perovskite grain sizes, and the number of small grains is further reduced via the synergistic effect of additive and surface modification (TAA@ PVSK/TAA). The cross-sectional SEM images of the control and TAA@PVSK/TAA films are shown in Figure  4b . The grains of TAA@PVSK/TAA are more vertically monolithic than the control without TAA. This demonstrates that TAA not only passivates the surface trap defects but also enhances the crystallization of perovskite films. Figure  4c  shows the XRD patterns of the control and PVSK/ TAA and TAA@PVSK/TAA films. All of the films clearly exhibit major diffraction peaks associated with the perovskite phase, corresponding to the planes of (110) and (220). The intensity of the (110) diffraction peak slightly increases by surface modification, while it increases significantly by the dual role of surface and bulk treatment by TAA. The full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the (110) crystal plane is analyzed to demonstrate the TAA treatment on the crystallinity of perovskite films (Figure  4d ). The fwhm values of 0.187, 0.173, and 0.161 are determined for the control and PVSK/ TAA and TAA@PVSK/TAA films, respectively. The TAA@ PVSK/TAA perovskite film exhibits the highest diffraction intensity and the lowest fwhm value of the (110) crystal plane. The XRD results show that the crystallinity of the perovskite films is improved with the preferential growth direction of the perovskite crystals. The π-conjugated bond of the Th ring in TAA is responsible for the preferential growth of the (110) plane of perovskite crystal.  2, 35  The interaction of the -C�O group and Pb 2+ in the precursor could form a coordinative intermediate, which slows crystal growth.  14, 36  The improvement in the crystallinity of the perovskite film results in an increase of UV-vis absorbance in the wavelength range of 450-750 nm (Figure  S6 ), which is in agreement with a previous study.  37  The PL and TRPL spectra of the control and PVSK/TAA and TAA@PVSK/TAA films deposited on glass substrates are further investigated. Note that the PL measurements were conducted from the perovskite film side because PL excitation from the perovskite or glass side has a negligible influence on the obtained PL results (Figure  S7 ). Figure  5a  shows that the PL intensity of the TAA@PVSK/TAA perovskite film is much and slightly higher than those of the control and PVSK/TAA film, respectively, indicating a further reduction in chargecarrier recombination. The TRPL spectra are presented in Figure  5b , with the extracted parameters listed in Table  S3 . τ avg of the TAA@PVSK/TAA film (216.9 ns) is significantly longer than that of the control (99.3 ns) or the PVSK/TAA film (161.2 ns). Because the preparation of perovskite films is very susceptible to the external environment, τ avg of the control sample in Figure  5b  (preparation in air during autumn) is higher than that in Figure  2b  (preparation during summer with higher humidity and temperature). The results confirm the passivation effect of TAA on the surface or bulk defects of the perovskite films. The space-charge-limited-current measurements of a single electron device (ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/ PCBM/Ag) and a single hole device (ITO/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag) are used to quantitatively estimate the density of the trap states (n t ) of the perovskite films, as shown in parts c and d of Figure  5 , respectively. The voltage at which the ohmic regime transitions to the trap-filled one is determined by fitting a kink point voltage, which is referred to as the trapfilled limit voltage (V TEL ).  38  n t of the perovskite film can be calculated based on the equation 39 = n V eL 2 t TEF 0 2 (3) where L is the thickness of the film, e stands for the electronic charge, and ε 0 and ε represent the vacuum dielectric constant and dielectric constant of MAPbI 3 (ε = 28.8), respectively. The calculated electron trap densities are 4.42 × 10 15 , 3.04 × 10 15 , and 1.52 × 10 15 cm -3 for the control and PVSK/TAA and TAA@PVSK/TAA devices, respectively. The hole trap densities are 1.23 × 10 16 , 1.02 × 10 , and 8.9 × 10 15 cm -3 for the control and PVSK/TAA and TAA@PVSK/TAA devices, respectively. The reduced trap densities of electrons and holes are attributed to the effective defect passivation and the improved crystal quality of the perovskite film treated by TAA. The dark J-V curves of the control and PVSK/TAA and TAA@PVSK/TAA PSCs are shown in Figure  5e . The reverse saturated current density (J 0 ) is estimated by the equation  40  Ä Ç Å Å Å Å Å Å Å Å Å i k j j j y { z z z É Ö Ñ Ñ Ñ Ñ Ñ Ñ Ñ Ñ Ñ = J J qV nkT exp 1 0 (4) where n characterizes the ideality factor, q denotes the electric charge, T describes the temperature, and k denotes the Boltzmann constant. The calculated J 0 values for the control and PVSK/TAA and TAA@PVSK/TAA devices are 1.27 × 10 -11 , 5.85 × 10 -14 , and 3.51 × 10 -16 mA cm -2 , respectively. This indicates that charge recombination is largely suppressed due to a better rectification effect.  41  Then, the capacitancevoltage (C-V) curves of the devices are obtained by Mott-Schottky measurement, as shown in Figure  5f . The Mott-Schottky curve can be used to extract the built-in potential (V bi ) of the device, which is obtained by the intercept of the fitted line and the X axis.  42  The PSC of TAA@PVSK/TAA displays a V bi value (0.98 V) higher than that of the control (0.94 V). The improved V bi and reduced carrier recombination can benefit the improvement of V OC of PSCs.  43  Figure  6a  shows the J-V curves of the control and PVSK/ TAA and TAA@PVSK/TAA PSCs, with the output parameters listed in Table  1 . The TAA@PVSK/TAA device has the best performance. V OC increases from 1.08 to 1.11 V, J SC increases from 23.0 to 23.7 mA cm -2 , and FF increases from 73.5% to 78.4%, leading to a much higher PCE (20.62%) for the TAA@PVSK/TAA device, in contrast to the control (18.25%). The improvements of V OC and FF are mainly due to the enhanced charge-carrier management as a result of the synergistic effect of surface defect passivation and crystallization enhancement. The increase of J SC is attributed to both the increased absorption (Figure  S6 ) and the improvement of carrier transport,  44  which leads to more carriers generated and collected in the device. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) response of the target device is improved in the wavelength range 350-750 nm (Figure  S8 ), leading to the integrated J SC increased from 22.3 to 23.2 mA cm -2 , which is in good agreement with the improved J SC results (Figure  6a ). Figure  6b  illustrates the steady-state photocurrent and power output tracking at the maximum power point for 120 s of the PSCs. The control and PVSK/TAA and TAA@PVSK/TAA devices show stabilized current densities of 20.9, 21.3, and 21.8 mA cm -2 , respectively. The corresponding stabilized PCEs of the devices are 17.83%, 18.86%, and 19.79%, respectively. Nevertheless, it takes a relatively long time to achieve saturated J SC and PCE, which could be due to the large hysteresis of the devices (Figure  S9 ). The TAA treatment can substantially passivate the surface defects, reducing the hysteresis index to some extent. Note that we did not make any modification to the SnO 2 electron-transport layer or the SnO 2 /perovskite interface, which has a dominated influence on the hysteresis for the device with the n-i-p structure.  45, 46  In the next step, the enhancement of carrier transport across the interface of the perovskite/electron transport layer will be designed to further improve the conversion efficiency and suppress the hysteresis of PSCs. To investigate the stability of the PSCs, the devices were first stored in air with the humidity kept at ∼35% or 65% during the test. The evolutions of normalized PCEs for the devices with or without TAA treatment are shown in Figures  S10  and 6c . The TAA@PVSK/TAA device keeps 85% of its initial PCE, while the control only retains 63% after storage for 320 h at 35% relative humidity (Figure  S10 ). At a high relative humidity of 65%, the PVSK/TAA and TAA@PVSK/TAA devices keep 68% and 76% of their initial PCEs, respectively, whereas the control retains only 47% of its initial PCE after storage in air for 320 h, as shown in Figure  6c . The stability measurements of the devices were further studied using a Xe lamp under the simulated work conditions with 1-sun light illumination (100 mW cm -2 ) at a higher humidity of 85% (Figure  6d ). The control device keeps 74% of its initial PCE after exposure for 3 h. The PCE of the TAA@PVSK/TAA device is found to retain 91% of its initial value after aging for 3 h. The results confirm that the stability of the PSCs is significantly improved under high humidity and illumination. The enhancement of moisture resistance is ascribed to the hydrophobicity of the Th ring in a TAA molecule and the improved crystallization of the erovskite film with reduced grain boundaries. The improvement of light stability can be attributed to suppressing the migration of I -and passivating the iodine-associated defects (V I ) by the formation of hydrogen bonds with the -NH 2 group and I -.  47   
 CONCLUSIONS In summary, we have developed an effective passivation strategy based on a small Th molecule with multifunctional groups to passivate or reduce the perovskite surface defects. It is demonstrated that the uncoordinated Pb 2+ and Pb 0 defects are effectively passivated by the -C�O group of TAA and the S atom of the Th ring; besides, the I vacancies are suppressed by the formation of hydrogen bonds between -NH 2 and I -. The introduction of TAA also improves carrier extraction at the perovskite/HTL interface and enhances crystallization of the perovskite film. With the synergistic effect of surface defect passivation and crystallization enhancement, the PCE of the champion MAPbI 3 PSC (TAA@PVSK/TAA device) has achieved 20.62%, much higher than that of the control (18.35%), which are mainly attributed to the suppressed recombination and improved transport of charge carriers. Moreover, the TAA treatment also benefits the significant enhancement of moisture and light stability of the devices.
