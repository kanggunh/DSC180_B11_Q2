Title: Zirconium Doping to Enable High-Efficiency and Stable CsPbI 2 Br All-Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells
All-inorganic wide-bandgap perovskite CsPbI 2 Br has attracted much attention because of its inherent thermal stability and ideal bandgap for the front subcell of tandem solar cells (TSCs). However, the low power conversion efficiency (PCE) and poor moisture stability of CsPbI 2 Br still restrict its future commercialization. Herein, zirconium tetrachloride (ZrCl 4 ) was doped into CsPbI 2 Br films to modulate the crystal growth and improve the film quality. The partial substitution of the B-site Pb 2+ of CsPbI 2 Br with Zr 4+ suppresses the unwanted phase conversion from the crystallized black α-phase to the δ-phase, resulting in improved phase stability. Consequently, the humidity and thermal stability of the film are greatly improved. Additionally, the incorporation of ZrCl 4 suppresses nonradiative recombination and forms a matched energy-level alignment with the hole-transport layer (Spiro-OMeTAD). Benefiting from these features, the ZrCl 4 -doped CsPbI 2 Br perovskite solar cell (PSC) shows an outstanding efficiency of 16.60% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.29 V. The unencapsulated devices simultaneously show excellent humidity and thermal stability, retaining over 91% of PCE initial after 1000 h of aging in ambient air conditions and 92% PCE initial after 500 h of continuous heating at 85 °C in a nitrogen environment, respectively. Furthermore, ZrCl 4 -doped CsPbI 2 Br was employed as the front subcell of perovskite/organic TSCs and achieved a remarkable PCE of 19.42%, showing great potential for highly efficient and stable TSCs.
■ INTRODUCTION Over the past decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attained power conversion efficiencies (PCE) greater than 26%.  [1] [2] [3] [4]  Volatile organic cations used in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites, such as methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA), are intrinsically unstable under elevated operation temperatures, leading to the progressive degradation and catastrophic failure of devices.  5, 6  Replacing these volatile A-site organic cations with more stable inorganic cations such as Cs would greatly enhance the thermal and environmental stability of the perovskite.  7, 8  The existing Cs-based inorganic perovskite, depending on the ratio of the anion, can be divided into three types, CsPbI 3 ,  [9] [10] [11]  CsPbI 2 Br,  10, 12  and CsPbBr 3 ,  [13] [14] [15]  with a tunable bandgap E g ranging from 1.7 to 2.3 eV. Among them, CsPbI 2 Br has many advantages, including inherent structural stability with a suitable Goldschmidt tolerance factor and proper band gap (E g ∼ 1.91 eV), and thus, it is ideal for the front subcells of perovskite-based tandem solar cells (TSCs).  [16] [17] [18]  However, the relatively low PCE and poor phase stability of CsPbI 2 Br PSCs still restrict their future commercial applications. The relatively low PCE of CsPbI 2 Br PSCs is limited by the low open-circuit voltage (V OC ). Although the wide band gap of CsPbI 2 Br perovskite principally possesses a high V OC , CsPbI 2 Br usually suffers from serious nonradiative recombination, leading to a huge open-circuit voltage loss (E loss = E g -V OC ). This significant E loss might originate from the inappropriate Goldschmidt tolerance factor, a high density of defects in the film due to the rapid crystallization of the perovskite film, and energy-level mismatch with transport layers.  [19] [20] [21]  Therefore, phase control,  [22] [23] [24] [25]  crystallization control,  26, 27  interface modification,  28  and additive-energineering  29  strategies are proposed to overcome issues of a large V OC deficit and low PCE. Among various optimization strategies, B-site (Pb site) doping has appeared as an effective method to adjust the tolerance factor, passivate defects, and fabricate high-efficiency and stable all-inorganic PSCs.  [30] [31] [32]  For example, Yang reported a new inorganic CsPb 1-x Ge x I 2 Br perovskite, which has a longer carrier lifetime and lower trap density.  33  It has the highest efficiency when the Ge content is 0.2% (PCE = 10.8%). Liu et al. found that the yellow phase of CsPbI 2 Br could be suppressed by using the InCl 3 additive.  34  Guo et al. reported that Nb 5+ doping into CsPbI 2 Br could stabilize the α-phase by replacing Pb 2+ , leading to an increase in V OC and PCE.  35  Doping at the B-site (Pb site) was illustrated to effectively improve the phase stability of CsPbI 2 Br. Zr ions have a smaller ionic radius (84 pm) than Pb ions (119 pm), and it is easier to replace Pb. Therefore, we incorporated zirconium tetrachloride (ZrCl 4 ) into the CsPbI 2 Br perovskite in this study. Compared to undoped CsPbI 2 Br, the ZrCl 4 -doped CsPbI 2 Br film shows a uniform film morphology with a smaller grain size. The ZrCl 4doped perovskite film not only exhibits a decreased trap density and enhanced carrier lifetime but also reduces energylevel mismatch with the hole-transport layer. Consequently, the optimized device achieves a remarkable PCE of 16.60% with a high FF (81.14%) and V OC (1.29 V). In addition, the ZrCl 4 -doped CsPbI 2 Br PSC also shows significantly improved humidity and thermal stability. 
 ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In general, CsPbI 2 Br is not stable in the black cubic α-phase under ambient conditions, and it tends to rapidly convert into a thermodynamically favorable yellow δ-phase (E g = 2.82 eV), which is not a photoactive phase. Because of the relatively small size of Cs + cations (r = 174 pm) in A-site cations, the Goldschmidt tolerance factor t ( = + + t r r r r 2 ( ) A X A X ; r A , r B , and r X represent the radii of the A, B, and X sites, respectively) of CsPbI 2 Br is below 0.9.  35  In addition, because of the hygroscopic and unstable chemical properties of perovskite materials, the halide vacancies are drastically increased when water molecules come in contact with the perovskite surface. These halide vacancies reduce the α/δ phase transition barrier and promote the unwanted α/δ phase transition.  36  Thus, ambient moisture would accelerate this α-phase to the δ-phase transition at low temperatures (<250 °C). On partially replacing the Pb 2+ (r = 119 pm) with Zr 4+ (r = 84 pm), the tolerance factor t of CsPb 1-x Zr x I 2 Br gradually increases from 0.85 to 0.95. It is known that the α-phase of CsPbI 2 Br would become more stable as t approaches the ideal tolerance factor range of 0.9-1.  [37] [38] [39]  Therefore, we hypothesize that the partial replacement of Pb 2+ with Zr 4+ would form the stable α-phase of CsPbI 2 Br. Figure  1a  depicts the UV-vis spectra of CsPbI 2 Br films with and without 0.4% ZrCl 4 doping. The absorbance of the 0.4% ZrCl 4 -doped film in the visible range (450-700 nm) is slightly enhanced compared to the control film. The absorption edge of 0.4% ZrCl 4 -doped thin films shows a negligible shift (<1 nm) compared with the control films, indicating that ZrCl 4 doping has little effect on the E g . The E g of the films is calculated to be about 1.91 eV by extracting from the absorption edge (Figure  S1a ), conforming to the theoretical band gap of CsPbI 2 Br.  40  To determine how doping with ZrCl 4 changes charge recombination and the exciton lifetime, we perform PL and TRPL measurements for a CsPbI 2 Br film with various concentrations of ZrCl 4 dopants. As shown in Figures  1b  and S1b , the peak intensity of PL first increased and then decreased on progressively increasing the concentration of the ZrCl 4 additive. In comparison to the control film, the 0.4% ZrCl 4 -doped film exhibits a blue-shifted PL (∼4 nm) and a considerably increased PL intensity. This phenomenon can be explained by ZrCl 4 doping suppressing the nonradiative recombination and reducing the defect density in the perovskite film. Figure  1c  shows the carrier dynamics of ZrCl 4 -doped CsPbI 2 Br films studied by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy. TRPL decay curves were fitted by the function y = A 1 exp(-t/τ 1 ) + A 2 exp(-t/τ 2 ) + y 0 . Table  S1  provides the detailed fitting parameters. The average   properties. In addition, 0.4% ZrCl 4 -doped films show Zr 3d characteristic peaks of 180.8 and 186.7 eV, indicating that ZrCl 4 interacts with the lattice of CsPbI 2 Br. Figure  2a ,d shows the surface morphology of CsPbI 2 Br films with varying concentrations of ZrCl 4 , as determined by SEM images. In Figure  S3 , the statistical histogram of grain size is displayed; 850 nm is the average size of the control film. In contrast, the average grain sizes of CsPbI 2 Br films with 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6% ZrCl 4 dopant were 690, 590, and 460 nm, respectively. Clearly, as the concentration of ZrCl 4 increases, the average grain size of the CsPbI 2 Br films reduces. Furthermore, the surface of the 0.4% ZrCl 4 -doped film is smoother, and the grain size distribution of crystallites is more uniform, which is beneficial for charge transport. This result is in line with a prior study that found that the high surface energy of the CsPbX 3 perovskite film made it easier to stabilize films with smaller grains.  41  This result can be explained by previous reports that these smaller grains enhance the CsPbX 3 perovskite film stability because of its high surface energy. In addition, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was utilized to determine the distribution of ZrCl 4 in CsPbI 2 Br films. As shown in Figures  2e  and S4 , I and Br elements are uniformly distributed without visible-phase segregation in the film. Figure  2g ,f also shows the film morphology measured by AFM. The root-mean-square roughness of control films is 33.7 nm, while the roughness of 0.4% ZrCl 4 -doped CsPbI 2 Br films is decreased to 25.6 nm. The reduced roughness implies that the ZrCl 4 -doped CsPbI 2 Br films may have better physical and electrical contact with the adjacent hole-and electrontransport layers. To investigate how the enhancement mechanism of the ZrCl 4 additive affects photovoltaic performance, PSCs with the n-i-p structure of ITO/ZnO/CsPbI 2 Br/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag were fabricated. The J-V curves of the champion devices for CsPbI 2 Br PSCs with different doping contents of ZrCl 4 are shown in Figure  3a , and the related photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table  1 . The optimal PCE of control PSCs was 14.17% with a V OC of 1.21 eV, a J SC of 15.45 mA/cm 2 , and a filling factor (FF) of 76.04%. All photovoltaic characteristics of PSCs were greatly enhanced compared to those of the control devices when 0.4% ZrCl 4 was doped into the CsPbI 2 Br perovskite. The 0.4% ZrCl 4 -doped PSCs achieved the best efficiency of 16.6%, V OC = 1.29 V, J SC = 15.84 mA/cm 2 , and FF = 81.14%. The hysteresis index was calculated according to HI = (PCE Reverse -PCE Forward )/PCE Reverse . It can be concluded that 0.4% ZrCl 4 doping can significantly reduce the HI. The stabilized PCE and steady-state J SC of the control and optimized devices obtained at the maximum power point (MPP) for 300 s are shown in Figure  3b . The stabilized PCE and steady-state J SC of the optimized ZrCl 4 -doped CsPbI 2 Br device are 15.39% and 15.29 mA/cm 2 , respectively. In contrast, the stabilized PCE and steady-state J SC of the devices without ZrCl 4 doping are 13.55% and 14.76 mA/cm 2 , respectively. Figure  3c  exhibits the EQE spectra of CsPbI 2 Br PSCs without and with 0.4% ZrCl 4 doping. The significantly enhanced EQE of 0.4% ZrCl 4 -doped PSCs indicates that the addition of 0.4% ZrCl 4 can improve light absorption and reduce charge recombination. The integrated current density increases from 15.04 to 15.50 mA/cm 2 , which is within about 5% deviation of the J sc from the J-V measurements. As shown in Figure  S5 , space charge-limited current (SCLC) tests were used for CsPbI 2 Br films without and with the 0.4% ZrCl 4 dopant. The insets display the corresponding device structures of the electron-only device ITO/ZnO/CsPbI 2 Br/ PCBM/Ag and hole-only device ITO/PEDOT/CsPbI 2 Br/ MoO 3 /Ag. The trap-filling limit voltage (V TFL ) values are 0.27 and 0.14 eV for CsPbI 2 Br devices without and with the 0.4% ZrCl 4 dopant in the electron-only structure, respectively. The V TFL values are 0.22 and 0.17 eV for CsPbI 2 Br devices without and with the 0.4% ZrCl 4 dopant in the hole-only structure, respectively. The trap-state density (N trap ) of the film can be calculated from the formula below = N V eL 2 trap 0 TFL 2 (1) ε 0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite, e is the charge quantity of the element, and L denotes the thickness of films. The N trap values of CsPbI 2 Br devices without and with the 0.4% ZrCl 4 dopant are 2.72 × 10 15 and 1.56 × 10 15 cm -3 , respectively. Lower N trap values indicate that the addition of ZrCl 4 leads to a significant decrease in the trap-state density of CsPbI 2 Br films. Figure  S6  shows the decay curves of TPV and TPC for CsPbI 2 Br PSCs without and with the 0.4% ZrCl 4 dopant. TPV fitting results show that the carrier recombination life of the 0.4% ZrCl 4 -doped device is 520 μs, which is much longer than that of the device without ZrCl 4 doping (230 μs), indicating reduced carrier recombination. The TPC fitting results indicate that the carrier recombination life of the 0.4% ZrCl 4 -doped device is 0.15 μs, which is shorter than that of the device without ZrCl 4 doping (0.52 μs), indicating quicker charge carrier transport and extraction. As shown in Figure  S7 , ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) measurement was performed to study the ZrCl 4 doping effect on the electronic energy state of the CsPbI 2 Br film. The E cutoff values of CsPbI 2 Br perovskite films without and with 0.4% ZrCl 4 doping were 17.62 and 17.70 eV and the E onset values were 1.83 and 1.85 eV, respectively. Based on the equation E VBM = hν -(E cutoff -E onset ), where hν is the photon energy of the excited light source and its value is 21.22 eV,  42  the valence band maximum (E VBM ) energies were calculated to be -5.43 and -5.37 eV, respectively. Then, according to the formula E CBM = E VBM + E g , the conduction band minimum (E CBM ) can be calculated, and all relevant data are summarized in Table  S2 . Figure  3e  depicts the energy-level diagrams of the control and 0.4% ZrCl 4 -doped CsPbI 2 Br PSCs. The incorporation of 0.4% ZrCl 4 causes an upshifting of the E CBM and E VBM . Especially, the upshift of E VBM of CsPbI 2 Br shows a better energy alignment with the HOMO level of Spiro- OMeTAD, and it reduces the energy barrier between that two layers, which is more beneficial for hole extraction. Furthermore, the Mott-Schottky analysis was performed to examine the separation of charges in devices. The built-in potential of the 0.4% ZrCl 4 -doped CsPbI 2 Br device (1.18 V) is higher than that of the control device (1.10 V). The increase in V bi implies a more efficient charge separation and charge transfer.  43  In addition, using light-intensity-dependent V OC to study the carrier recombination mechanism (Figure  3f ), the corresponding ideal factor (n) of PSCs through a linear fitting of V OC with the light intensity function is 1.31 for the 0.4% ZrCl 4 -doped CsPbI 2 Br device and 1.92 for the control device. The closer the value of the ideal factor (n) is to 1, the less trapassisted recombination it possesses. In 0.4% ZrCl 4 -doped PSCs, the lower value of the factor n suggests that trap-assisted recombination is markedly reduced.  As stability is critical to perovskites, Figure  4a  shows the water contact angle images of CsPbI 2 Br films without and with 0.4% ZrCl 4 doping. The contact angle of the CsPbI 2 Br film doped with 0.4% ZrCl 4 increased from 25 to 55°, which indicated that the ZrCl 4 -doped CsPbI 2 Br film should be more resistant to humidity. Figure  4b  compares the unencapsulated CsPbI 2 Br films without and with 0.4% ZrCl 4 doping when placed in a 45% relative humidity (RH) ambient environment at room temperature. The control films gradually transformed from black to yellow within 120 min. While the color of the 0.4% ZrCl 4 -doped CsPbI 2 Br films remained black, only the edges of the film partially turned yellow after 80 min. The storage and thermal stabilities of the CsPbI 2 Br device were also measured. In ambient air (25 °C, 20 ± 5%RH, dark state), the unencapsulated 0.4% ZrCl 4 -doped device retained more than 91% of the initial efficiency after 1000 h, while the control device retained 71% of the original efficiency (Figure  4c ). Under a N 2 atmosphere at 85 °C conditions, the 0.4% ZrCl 4doped device demonstrated excellent thermal stability, maintaining an initial efficiency of 92% after 500 h (Figure  4d ). In contrast, the efficiency of the control device quickly declined to 66% of its initial value. It is well-known that unexpected α-to-δ phase transitions of CsPbI 2 Br are the main reason for device degradation.  44  In this circumstance, the improved stability of ZrCl 4 -doped CsPbI 2 Br devices is attributed to the optimized perovskite film morphology, giving rise to a suitable Goldschmidt tolerance factor by releasing the lattice strain. Recently, thanks to the rapid progress of narrow-bandgap nonfullerene acceptors, tandem wide-bandgap perovskites, and narrow-bandgap organic photoabsorbers, the construction of high-efficiency TSCs has become promising.  17, 18  Motivated by the wide band gap (1.9 eV) and high V OC of ZrCl 4 -doped CsPbI 2 Br, we constructed perovskite/organic TSCs with the n-i-p structure of ITO/ZnO/CsPbI 2 Br/P3HT/MoO 3 /Ag/ PFN-Br/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/MoO 3 /Ag. Figure  5a  shows the best J-V curve and photovoltaic parameter of the tandem device. The organic solar cells based on PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F showed a PCE of 10.65%, with a V OC of 0.71 V, a J SC of 22.45 mA/cm 2 , and an FF of 67.14%. The resultant tandem device showed a PCE of 19.42%, with a V OC of 1.84 V, an FF of 73.76%, and a J SC of 14.34 mA/cm 2 . Figure  5b  shows the EQE of the front and rear subcells of the tandem device. The EQE response of the front subcells ranges from 300 to 670 nm, and the integrated current is 14.32 mA/cm 2 . The EQE response of the rear subcells ranges from 500 to 1000 nm, and the integrated current is 14.34 mA/cm 2 . The integrated currents of the front junction and rear junction are relatively well matched. The integrated current is very close to the measured J SC . We use the optical transfer matrix model to simulate the photon absorption distribution and predict the current density generation in the subcells of TSCs in order to balance the current in the front and rear subcells.  45, 46  The refractive index (n) and absorption coefficient (k) of each functional layer used in the model are shown in Figure  S8 . Figure  5c  represents the photon absorption distribution in the optimized device. The majority of incident photons within the 300-650 nm wavelength range are absorbed by the 170 nm of the perovskite front cell, while photons ranging from 650 to 950 nm are absorbed by the organic rear cell, exhibiting uniform absorption throughout the film. In the wavelength range of 550-650 nm, two subcells exhibit competitive absorption. Additionally, the P3HT film used as the hole-transport material in the perovskite front cell absorbs a small number of photons, resulting in potential optical loss of the device. To obtain higher efficiency in the future, it is crucial to identify a hole-transport layer with a lower optical absorption. Figure  5d  displays the theoretical maximum J SC of TSCs by varying the thickness of two photoactive layers. Experiments showed that the best thicknesses for the front and rear cells were between 300 and 350 nm and between 40 and 200 nm, respectively. 
 ■ CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, we initially incorporated ZrCl 4 into the CsPbI 2 Br film to simultaneously improve its efficiency and stability. A low amount (0.4%) of ZrCl 4 doping substantially improves the film quality, suppresses nonradiative recombination, and facilitates energy-level alignment with the holetransport layer. ZrCl 4 -doped PSCs achieved a relatively high PCE of 16.60% with a remarkable V oc of 1.29 V. The partial substitution of Pb 2+ with Zr 4+ enhances the phase stability of CsPbI 2 Br and suppresses the unwanted phase transition from the α-phase to the δ-phase. Both the humidity and thermal stability of the device are significantly improved. Furthermore, we demonstrate high-efficiency (PCE = 19.42%) perovskite/ organic TSCs by combining a wide-bandgap CsPbI 2 Br front cell and low-bandgap organic rear cells.
