Title: Additive enhanced passivation and lead immobilization of waste expandable polystyrene for perovskite photovoltaics
Every year, millions of tons of expandable polystyrene (EPS) are released into the environment, posing significant environmental pressure due to its slow natural decomposition that takes hundreds of years. Current recycling methods for EPS include organic solvent dissolution and recycling, composite material preparation, and building decoration. However, these methods are costly and have low utilization value. In this study, we propose an innovative approach by incorporating waste EPS into the assembly process of printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p-MPSCs). Our findings reveal that EPS can not only utilize its uncoordinated Pb 2+ coordination through the large π bond of the benzene ring, but also the functional groups of C=O and C≡N in its additives, benzophenone peroxide and azobisisobutyronitrile, respectively, play an efficient role in passivating lead defects. Furthermore, EPS effectively acts as a moisture barrier, preventing moisture from entering the interior of the device. This significantly improves device stability and immobilizes lead ions, preventing lead leakage. Our approach not only provides an efficient and environmentally friendly method to recycle EPS, but also offers new solutions to address fundamental scientific challenges in perovskite solar cells, such as lead leakage and stability issues.
Introduction Expanded polystyrene, also known as expandable polystyrene (EPS), offers a range of advantages including a low relative density (1.05 g cm -3 ), low thermal conductivity, minimal water absorption, resistance to impact and vibration, excellent heat and sound insulation, moistureproof properties, effective vibration reduction, and impressive dielectric properties. It finds extensive application as a shockproof packaging material for delicate and valuable items such as mechanical equipment, instruments, household appliances, handicrafts, and fast-food packaging. However, with the rapid growth of the global economy, the accumulation of waste EPS foam plastics has become a pressing issue. Currently, the worldwide EPS production has reached a staggering 370 million tons, and this figure continues to grow at a rate of 12 million tons annually  [1] . The disposal of EPS foam has emerged as a significant contributor to environmental pollution, as its natural degradation can take hundreds of years, placing immense strain on our living environment  [2] . In response to the aforementioned challenges, several EPS foam recovery techniques have been developed, with the most prevalent involving the use of organic solvents such as toluene, xylene, and benzene for dissolution and recovery  [3] . However, due to the high cost of recycling and limited utilization value, recent efforts have shifted towards exploring various processes that utilize polystyrene as a composite material for high-value recycling  [4] . For instance, the Saíz research team successfully employed polystyrene dissolution and recycling to create a gypsum composite material, resulting in reduced gypsum density, improved heat resistance, and enhanced bending performance  [5] . Similarly, the G. A. S. Juan team combined EPS waste with cement-based adhesives to develop an environmentally friendly and cost-effective insulation layer for housing  [6] . Additionally, the H. Wiebeck team utilized biological solvents to degrade waste EPS, transforming it into materials suitable for 3D printing and building decoration purposes  [7] . These examples illustrate that current EPS foam recycling efforts primarily focus on material modification, with limited exploration of its potential applications in the field of photovoltaics. Perovskite solar cells have emerged as a prominent representative of third-generation solar cells, garnering significant attention. Leveraging its unique ionic crystal characteristics and remarkable tolerance for impurities, passivation has become a pivotal approach to enhance the photoelectric conversion performance of perovskite solar cells. Notably, polystyrene has proven to be instrumental in passivating perovskite defects and bolstering device stability. In a groundbreaking study in 2016, the S. H. Im research team pioneered the use of polystyrene as a passivation layer for the perovskite active layer, effectively isolating the TiO 2 electron transport layer and the polytriarylamine hole transport layer by employing it as an insulation layer  [8] . Building upon this work, Meng et al. successfully enhanced the photoelectric conversion efficiency from 19.3 % to 20.2 % by introducing polystyrene-assisted deposition of perovskite thin films. Impressively, after 30 days of stable tracking, the initial efficiency retention rate reached an impressive 90%  [9] . Subsequent investigations into perovskite passivation further pushed the boundaries, achieving a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 20.46 %  [10] . By simultaneously passivating the upper and lower interfaces using polystyrene, the open circuit voltage was elevated to 1.149 V  [11] . In this study, we present a novel approach to incorporating expanded polystyrene (EPS) with a polystyrene content exceeding 90% into printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p-MPSCs). Through a unique assembly process of the device structure, the chlorobenzene solution of EPS foam was successfully infiltrated into the device via the carbon electrode. The combination of polystyrene and perovskite led to a passivation effect, while the additives present in EPS foam, such as C=O in benzoyl peroxide and C≡N in azodiisobutyronitrile, played a crucial role in enhancing this passivation effect. As a result, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the device significantly increased from 14.20 % in the control group to 15.78 % (the reported PCE record value in the literature is 16.24 % based on MAPbI 3 γ-butyrolactone solution)  [12] . Furthermore, addressing a key concern in perovskite solar cells, namely lead leakage, the use of EPS demonstrated an effective locking effect on lead ions in p-MPSCs. Consequently, our work not only presents a new environmentally friendly approach for recycling EPS foam through photovoltaic applications but also highlights the exceptional lead fixation capabilities of EPS in p-MPSCs. 
 Results and discussion The schematic representation of the basic structure for p-MPSCs is depicted in Scheme 1. The substrate comprises Fluorine-doped tin oxide conductive glass, followed by a sequential screen-printed deposition of m-(mesoporous) TiO 2 , m-ZrO 2 , and a carbon layer from bottom to top. To complete the device assembly, the precursor solution of perovskite is carefully added dropwise onto the carbon layer, allowing for diffusion throughout the device and subsequent crystallization. In this study, we explore the utilization of discarded expanded polystyrene (EPS), which is dissolved in chlorobenzene and added dropwise to the assembled p-MPSCs. To investigate the interaction between components in EPS and perovskite, we employed Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to analyze the changes in bond displacement and organic functional groups in EPS before and after the modification. The Raman spectrum test results presented in Fig.  1a  demonstrated that EPS exhibited a prominent N=N peak signal at approximately 1090.6 cm -1 , which was not observed in pure polystyrene (Fig.  S1a )  [13] . This observation was consistent with the results of elemental analysis (Table  S1 ) and could be attributed to the presence of the initiator azodiisobutyronitrile in the EPS preparation process. Furthermore, the infrared spectrum in Fig.  1b  revealed a distinct characteristic peak at 1654.7 cm -1 in EPS, which corresponded to the stretching vibration of C=O in benzoyl peroxide (as inferred from the EPS preparation process). Upon the addition of PbI 2 , the stretching vibration peak of C=O shifted from 1654.7 cm -1 to 1679.7 cm -1 , indicating an interaction between C=O and the uncoordinated Pb 2+ . Additionally, the EPS FTIR spectra displayed peaks at 1045.2 cm -1 and 1085.7 cm -1 , corresponding to the C-H bending vibrations on the benzene ring. After mixing with PbI 2 , these C-H bending vibration peaks shifted to 1026.0 cm -1 and 1066.5 cm -1 . This shift can be attributed to the electrostatic interaction between the electron cloud of the large π bond in the benzene ring of polystyrene and the uncoordinated Pb 2+ , as a passivating role. The research findings uncover intriguing interactions between the benzene ring of polystyrene, the C=O group of benzoyl peroxide in EPS, and uncoordinated Pb 2+ , through electrostatic forces. Furthermore, the presence of a peak corresponding to N=N in the Raman spectrum provides evidence for the existence of azodiisobutyronitrile. This is further supported by XPS analysis, which detects characteristic functional groups of azodiisobutyronitrile, including C-N, N=N, and C≡N peaks in EPS (Fig.  S2b )  [14] . Importantly, the C≡N group, with its lone pair electrons, can also function as a passivating group for uncoordinated Pb 2+ defects. The passivation effect of the functional groups of additives and polystyrene in EPS on Pb 2+ defects can also be demonstrated through XPS testing. As presented in Fig.  1f , the XPS analysis of Pb 4f orbitals in perovskite thin films, both before and after EPS modification, reveals a significant shift in the binding energy of Pb 4f 5/2 and Pb 4f 7/2 orbitals. Specifically, the binding energy decreases from 143.08 and 158.18 eV in the control group to 142.88 and 137.98 eV, respectively. This shift of 0.2 eV towards lower binding energy signifies an intriguing increase in the electron cloud density surrounding lead ions, indicating an electron-donating effect of the passivator  [15] . Additionally, the O 1s spectrum of EPS in Scheme 1. Schematic diagram of waste EPS foam passivating perovskite defects and preventing lead leakage. X. Zhu et al. Fig.  1g  displays a C=O peak at 532.18 eV. However, upon the introduction of lead iodide, this peak shifts to a higher binding energy of 532.68 eV. This shift suggests a decrease in electron cloud density and emphasizes the electron-donating nature of the C=O group when interacting with uncoordinated Pb 2+ . Notably, the O 1s spectrum of the perovskite film in the control group, derived from 5-AVAI in the precursor solution, exhibits a C=O peak at 531.78 eV (Fig.  S2a ) which does not affect the evaluation of the passivation effect of the additive  [15] . In Fig.  S2c , the binding energy of C≡N in EPS after modification, compared to control group, shifted from 396.38 eV to 397.08 eV. This shift indicates a decrease in electron cloud density after the interaction of C≡N with perovskite, confirming its electron-donating effect on uncoordinated Pb 2+ . Furthermore, Fig.  S2d  shows that the binding energy of I 3d 5/2 in the I 3d orbit remained relatively unchanged, appearing at  630.38 eV, before and after EPS modification. However, the binding energy of the I 3d 3/2 orbital shifted from 618.98 eV to 618.88 eV, with a small offset of 0.1 eV. This suggests that the interaction strength between the passivator and Pb 2+ is significantly stronger than that of I -. The deviation in the I -related orbitals may be attributed to the alteration of the Pb-I bond energy due to the interaction between the passivator and Pb 2+ , or the electrostatic repulsion between the large π bond of the benzene ring and I -. Based on these test results, it can be concluded that in EPS, in addition to the interaction between the large π bond of the benzene ring in polystyrene and uncoordinated Pb 2+ , the additives benzoyl peroxide and azodiisobutyronitrile indeed contribute to the auxiliary passivation effects. In general, the addition of a passivator not only enhances the passivation effect but also improves the crystallization performance of perovskite  [16] . To investigate the morphological changes induced by the interaction between EPS and perovskite, we examined the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of the device before and after EPS passivation. Fig.  2a  and Fig.  S9a  clearly shows the presence of perovskite crystals on the surface of the control group. However, after EPS modification (Fig.  2b  and Fig.  S9b ), the size of the perovskite crystals increased, indicating a secondary growth process during EPS modification. Additionally, the EPS film uniformly covers the electrode surface and effectively compensates for grain boundaries. Furthermore, the crystallinity of perovskite is also evident in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) test results. As depicted in Fig.  2c , the application of EPS treatment did not induce any discernible shifts in the corresponding diffraction peaks, thereby suggesting that EPS treatment did not elicit alterations in the crystal structure of the perovskite material. For control and EPS-treated samples, the XRD diffraction peaks were consistently observed at 14.25 • , 28.57 • , 32.00 • , 40.70 • , and 43.20 • , which corresponded to the crystal planes (1 1 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 0), (2 2 4), and (3 1 4) of the perovskite crystals, respectively  [12] . Nevertheless, after EPS modification, the intensity of all diffraction peaks was significantly enhanced, and the full width half maximum (FWHM) (Table  S3 ) of main peaks such as (1 1 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 0) was reduced, indicating a significant improvement in the crystallinity of the perovskite material. This finding aligns with the observations made using FESEM. Furthermore, the improved crystallinity of the perovskite material also contributes to its enhanced light absorption capabilities. As illustrated in Fig.  2d , following EPS modification, the UV-visible absorption of the perovskite material surpassed that of the control group within the visible light spectrum of 400-600 nm. In the context of photovoltaic devices, the enhancement of light absorption capabilities serves to augment the short-circuit current density of the device  [17] . The energy levels of the active layers play a crucial role in determining the separation of excitons, interface charge injection, and transport within the device. To investigate the energy level changes of the perovskite material before and after EPS modification, we utilized UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) in conjunction with UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. Initially, we constructed the Tauc diagram (Fig.  2e ) from UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and determined that the band gaps of the perovskite material before and after EPS modification were 1.57 eV and 1.58 eV, respectively. Additionally, the UPS energy spectrum test results (Figure  S3 ) revealed that the Fermi energy levels of the perovskite material in the control group and the EPSmodified devices were -3.92 eV and -2.97 eV, respectively. The bottom energy levels of the conduction band for both were -3.50 eV and -2.44 eV, respectively. Based on the obtained energy level data, we generated an energy level distribution map of the assembled device (Fig.  2f ). As depicted in Fig.  2f , after EPS modification, the Fermi level of the perovskite film shifted towards the conduction band, resulting in an n-type transition that facilitates electron transport. The increased conduction band energy level helps to prevent the reverse transfer of electrons, reducing the recombination of electrons with holes at the carbon electrode  [18] . Simultaneously, the elevated valence band energy level reduces the energy difference between the valence band and the carbon electrode, enabling holes to traverse the ZrO 2 layer and be collected by the carbon electrode. The suppression of reverse electron transfer and the improvement in hole collection ability both contribute to mitigating non-radiative charge recombination processes within the device. The suppression of non-radiative recombination within the device can be directly observed through the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra. Fig.  3a  demonstrates that the PL intensity of the EPS-treated perovskite thin films significantly increases. This enhancement is attributed to the effective passivation of defects in the perovskite, leading to a reduction in composite centers and an increase in exciton luminescence intensity. These results indicate that the use of EPS successfully passivates surface defects in the perovskite and suppresses the non-radiative recombination process within the device  [19] . Furthermore, the TRPL spectrum in Fig.  3b  provides insights into the charge attenuation rate by fitting using the double exponential function in formula 1. f (t) = ∑ 2 i=1 a i exp( -t/τ i ) + B ( 1 ) τ ave = ∑ 2 i=1 a i τ 2 i / ∑ 2 i=1 a i τ i (2) where, when i = 1 and 2, τ 1 and τ 2 represents fast decay life and slow decay life, α 1 and α 2 represent relative amplitude, B represents offset constant of baseline. It is widely accepted that τ 1 and τ 2 correspond to the carrier lifetime of non-radiative recombination and radiative recombination in perovskite thin films, respectively  [20] . The average lifetime (τ ave ) of the charges in both processes can be calculated using the formula 2. The fitting and calculation results are presented in Table  S2 . As shown in The ability to repair defect states observed in the above research can also be quantified by calculating the density of defect states (N t ) using the space charge limiting voltage (SCLC) method. The device structure used in the experiment is FTO/NiO/ZrO 2 (perovskite)/C pure hole structure. In Fig.  3c , the SCLC curve typically shows three regions: the low voltage region, where the current linearly increases with voltage and the curve slope n = 1, representing the Ohmic contact region; the defect filled region, where carriers are continuously captured by the defect until all defect states are filled with carriers, and the curve slope n > 3; and the high-pressure zone, which is the SCLC zone where n = 2. The trap filling limit voltage (V TFL ) is defined as the tangent intersection between the low voltage zone and the defect filling zone  [21] . The N t values can be obtained by substituting V TFL into formula 3. N t = 2ε 0 εV TFL /eL 2 (3) where, N t represents the density of defect states, ε 0 and ε represents the vacuum dielectric constant and relative dielectric constant of perovskite, respectively (ε 0 = 8.8 × 10 -12 F/m, ε = 28.8), e is the unit charge (e = 1.6 × 10 -19 C), and L represents the thickness of the perovskite active layer  [22] . Based on the SCLC measurement shown in Fig.  3c , the V TFL for the control group and EPS-modified devices were found to be 1.22 and 1.07 V, respectively. Using formula 3, the corresponding defect density of states were calculated to be 4.77 × 10 15 cm -3 and 4.18 × 10 15 cm -3 . The EPS treatment resulted in a 12.4 % reduction in the defect state density, which is consistent with the qualitative characterization of PL and TRPL mentioned earlier. To further explore the impact of EPS modification on the carrier recombination dynamics in the device, we evaluated the correlation between the J-V characteristics and light intensity (ranging from 10 to 100 mW cm -2 ). The open-circuit voltage (V OC ) versus light intensity relationship, as shown in Fig.  3d , was fitted using formula 4. V OC = nkTln(I)/q + C (4) where, n is the ideal factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the basic charge, and C is a constant  [23] . According to the findings in the literature, the curve depicting the open circuit voltage relative to light intensity exhibits a smaller slope and approaches kT/q, indicating a lower number of defect states and reduced non-radiative recombination intensity within the device. The fitting results in Fig.  3d  demonstrate that the slope of the control group's curve is 1.69 kT/q, whereas after EPS modification, the slope decreases of the perovskite solar device (PSVK) to 1.50 kT/q. This further confirms that EPS modification effectively passivates defects, suppresses nonradiative recombination, and enhances the photovoltaic performance of the device. Fig.  3e  presents the relationship curve between the shortcircuit current (J SC ) and light intensity. According to the double logarithmic J SC ∝ I α linear relationship, where I represents the light intensity, the value of α closer to 1 indicates a lower bimolecular recombination intensity within the device. In Fig.  3e , the slope of the control group's curve is 0.93, while the slope of the EPS-modified device increases to 0.97. The increased slope after EPS modification signifies a decrease in bimolecular recombination strength, which is advantageous for improving the device's charge transfer capability  [24] . In photovoltaic devices, the efficient separation and transmission of charges are closely linked to the magnitude of the built-in potential (V bi ) present within the device. To determine the value of V bi , the Mott-Schottky curve test was performed (Fig.  3f ). By analyzing the relationship between the reciprocal of the square of the capacitance and the bias voltage, as outlined in formula 5, the built-in electric field can be identified by locating the bias voltage (intercept of the abscissa) at which 1/C 2 equals zero. 1 C 2 = 1 εε 0 qA 2 N (V bi -V) (5) where, C is the measured capacitance, ε 0 and ε are the vacuum dielectric constant and relative dielectric constant of perovskite, A is the area of the perovskite active layer, and N is the doping concentration of the semiconductor  [25] . Fig.  3f  illustrates that the V bi can be determined by identifying the intersection point between the tangent of the linear region and the Xaxis. In the control group, the V bi is measured to be 0.56 V, while in the EPS-modified device, it increases to 0.64 V. This improvement in V bi signifies an enhancement in the device's capability to separate photogenerated electrons and holes, as well as an improvement in carrier transport. The optimization of the device's energy levels through EPS modification plays a significant role in reducing the likelihood of electron reverse transmission and recombination within the device, leading to these positive outcomes  [26] . To evaluate the impact of the improved V bi on charge transfer Fig.  3 .

X. Zhu et al. performance, we conducted transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements on both the control group and the EPS-modified device (Fig.  3g ). The TPC curves clearly demonstrate that the transient photocurrent attenuation rate of the EPS-modified devices is significantly higher compared to the control group. By performing single exponential fitting, we determined that the charge transfer time for the control group is 1.57 ms, whereas for the EPS-modified devices, it is reduced to 1.18 ms. This indicates a substantial enhancement in the charge transfer rate, driven by the higher built-in potential achieved through EPS modification. Furthermore, the slowing down of the decay rate of transient photovoltage (Figure  S4 ) provides additional evidence of the repair of defect state centers and the suppression of non-radiative recombination. From an electrochemical impedance perspective, the non-radiative recombination ability can be assessed by examining the recombination impedance (R rec )  [27] . This parameter can be determined by analyzing the Nyquist plot obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In Fig.  3h , the diameter of the semicircle corresponds to the value of R rec . By performing fitting and calculations, we found that the control group had an R rec of 176.93 Ω, while the EPS-modified devices exhibited a significantly improved R rec of 800.77 Ω. This enhancement in R rec indicates that EPS modification effectively improves the device's ability to suppress non-radiative recombination. Furthermore, carrier recombination plays a crucial role in limiting the improvement of the device's optoelectronic performance. As depicted in Fig.  3i , after EPS modification, the dark current of the device is significantly reduced. This reduction can be attributed to the improved energy level matching and the higher built-in potential achieved through EPS modification. The enhancement of the optical and physical performance discussed earlier ultimately translates into improved photoelectric conversion performance in the device. Fig.  4a  illustrates the J-V curves of the champion devices in both the control group and the EPS-modified device. The corresponding photoelectric performance parameters are summarized in Table  1 . As depicted in Fig.  4a  and Table  1 , the repair of defects through EPS modification leads to a significant increase in the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE). Specifically, the PCE improves from 14.20% in the control group (with V OC = 0.91 V, J SC = 23.10 mA cm -2 , FF = 67.71%) to 15.78% in the EPS-modified device (with V OC = 0.93 V, J SC = 25.00 mA cm -2 , FF = 67.67%). The statistical results (Figure  S5 ) further validate the positive impact of EPS modification on the photovoltaic performance, particularly in terms of the open circuit voltage and short circuit current density. It is worth noting that perovskite solar cells, as ionic crystals, can exhibit hysteresis effects due to ion migration and carrier recombination, which have become fundamental challenges in this field  [28] . The hysteresis effect in perovskite solar cells can be quantified using hysteresis index, which is determined by the formula (PCE reverse -PCEforward )/PCE reverse , where PCE reverse and PCE forward represent the photoelectric conversion efficiency obtained from voltage reverse and forward scanning, respectively  [29] . Figure  S6  illustrates the hysteresis index of the control group and the EPS-modified devices, which are found to be 14.8 % and 9.3 %, respectively. These results indicate that the multicomponent synergistic effect of EPS can effectively suppress ion migration and minimize carrier recombination. Furthermore, the relative magnitude of the short-circuit current density obtained from the J-V test can be confirmed by analyzing the monochromatic incident photonto-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE). Fig.  4b  demonstrates the photoresponsive platform of the perovskite solar cells for both the control group and the EPS-modified devices, within the wavelength range of Fig.  4 . A) J-V curve of the optimal device before and after eps modification. b) ipce curve and ipce curve of devices before and after eps modification. c) Steady-state output characteristics of control group measured at the maximum power point. d) Steady-state output characteristics of devices EPS modified measured at the maximum power point. 350 to 750 nm. In this aspect, it is noteworthy that the EPS-modified devices exhibited higher IPCE values across all wavelengths compared to the control group. This indicates that the EPS modification effectively enhanced light absorption and charge generation in the perovskite solar cells. The relative magnitude of the integrated current aligns with the results obtained from the J-V test, further reinforcing the validity of the findings. However, it is important to acknowledge that there is a significant difference between the integrated current value and the test value, which could be attributed to the absence of light soaking. Light soaking, a process involving continuous light exposure to stabilize device performance, was not implemented in this study  [30] . In the steadystate output tests illustrated in Fig.  4c  and d , the control group and the EPS-modified devices achieved photoelectric conversion efficiencies of 13.84% and 15.29% at steady-state output power, respectively. These values are in close agreement with the results obtained from the J-V test, further validating the effectiveness of the EPS modification in enhancing the overall performance of the perovskite solar cells. Stability is a crucial factor in determining the commercial viability of devices beyond their photovoltaic performance. Currently, perovskite solar cells face a major challenge in terms of stability, particularly when exposed to high humidity conditions. Perovskite materials tend to decompose when in contact with water, leading to a decline in photovoltaic performance and potential issues such as lead (Pb) leakage and environmental pollution  [31] . To address this challenge, we conducted tests to assess the impact of EPS modification on device stability in a high humidity environment of 80 ± 5% over a period of 5 days. Figure  S7  illustrates the results of the continuous XRD tracking test. In the control group, no significant diffraction peaks of PbI 2 were observed, indicating that the perovskite remained stable. Conversely, the control group's perovskite exhibited a gradual decrease in diffraction peak intensity, suggesting that the crystal structure or morphology was affected by the presence of more water molecules. In contrast, the perovskite in the EPS-modified devices maintained a relatively high diffraction peak intensity, indicating improved stability. To further evaluate the effectiveness of EPS in enhancing device stability under real application conditions characterized by high temperature and humidity, we subjected unpackaged devices to a double 85% test (85 ℃ and 80 ± 5% relative humidity). Fig.  5a  demonstrates the response of the control group and the EPStreated device under the strict double 85 % test conditions. The control group underwent a rapid phase transition, leading to the appearance of a yellow phase after 2 days. However, the black perovskite phase remained intact until the 5th day in the EPS-treated device. To further analyze the changes that occurred during the double 85% test, we conducted XRD tracking for 5 days, as depicted in Fig.  5b  and c . In the control group, a diffraction peak of PbI 2 was observed after 1 day, and the diffraction peak of perovskite completely disappeared on the second day. Conversely, in the EPS-treated device, although the diffraction peak intensity of perovskite decreased, higher intensity perovskite diffraction peaks were still present after 5 days. This indicates that EPS modification provides superior stability even under harsh conditions. Furthermore, we conducted an additional test by directly dropping water onto the surface of the p-MPSCs carbon electrode. In the control group, the conductive glass side quickly turned yellow, indicating the degradation of perovskite. In contrast, the EPS-treated group remained black, suggesting better protection against water-induced degradation (Fig.  5e ). Furthermore, we conducted an additional test to assess the hydrophobic properties of the EPS-treated device and its impact on stability. The EPS processor was soaked in water for 15 min, and as shown in Fig.  5f , it maintained a black phase with only a small amount of yellow phase appearing at the edge. This indicates that the EPS modification provides effective protection against water-induced degradation. The improvement in device stability achieved through EPS modification can be attributed to multiple factors. Firstly, the FESEM image (Fig.  2b ) reveals that EPS coating and grain boundary repair effects contribute to enhanced stability. Additionally, the modification of EPS improves the hydrophobic properties of the device, which is a crucial factor in enhancing stability. As the results of the measuring the contact angle of water (Fig.  5d ), the control group exhibited contact angles of 29.8 • on the perovskite thin film and 46.9 • on the PSVK. However, after EPS modification, these contact angles increased significantly to 100.6 • and 92.86 • , respectively. These results demonstrate that EPS modification significantly improves the hydrophobicity of the device, thereby inhibiting the entry of water molecules and preventing the degradation reaction of perovskite. Lead leakage is a significant concern in perovskite solar cells. To assess the inhibitory effect of EPS on lead leakage, we conducted a test using Pb concentration test strips. Water droplets were added to the surface of both the control group and EPS-modified devices for a specific duration. Samples were then taken, and Pb concentration test strips were used to measure the lead ion concentrations. Figure  S8  illustrates the results of this test. A standard colorimetric card was used for comparison. The control group device exhibited a lead concentration of 50-100 mg/L, as indicated by the color change on the test strip. In contrast, the EPS-modified device did not show any color change, suggesting a lead concentration close to zero. Although quantitative data is not provided, based on these results, we can conclude that EPS modification has a very high inhibition rate on Pb leakage. Fig.  5g  shows the results of a 1500-hour photovoltaic performance tracking experiment conducted on both the control group and EPSmodified devices that were not encapsulated. The experiment was carried out at room temperature and 50 ± 5% relative humidity. The control group device exhibited a sharp decrease in photoelectric conversion efficiency, reaching only about 40% of the initial value after 300 h. In contrast, the EPS-modified devices were able to maintain over 95% of the initial efficiency value even after the same duration. This highlights the significant improvement in stability achieved through EPS modification. It is important to note that when we tracked the optoelectronic performance of the packaged devices under the same conditions, they exhibited almost the same stability as the unpackaged devices modified with EPS. This indicates that the surface EPS modification can effectively replicate the effect of device packaging. Furthermore, we conducted a separate experiment where the control group and EPS-modified unpackaged devices were tracked for nearly 150 h at 85 ℃ and 50 ± 5% relative humidity. The control group device experienced a drastic decrease in photoelectric conversion efficiency, reaching only 25% of the initial value. On the other hand, the EPS-modified device was able to maintain 55% of the initial value. 
 Conclusion In summary, the current recycling processes for waste expandable polystyrene (EPS) foam, which causes white pollution, are not only costly but also have low recycling value. In this study, we propose an innovative approach by incorporating EPS into the passivation process of printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p-MPSCs). Through infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, and other analyses, we have discovered that the passivation effect occurs not only on the benzene ring of polystyrene but also with the assistance of the C=O group in the additive benzophenone peroxide and the C≡N group in azobisisobutyronitrile, effectively passivating the uncoordinated Pb 2+ ions. Through this passivation process, the modified devices exhibit superior performance in terms of energy level alignment, modification of surface defects in perovskite, suppression of charge recombination, and inhibition of non-radiative recombination. Additionally, the encapsulation effect of EPS on the electrode surface effectively prevents water molecules from degrading the perovskite crystals inside the device and immobilizes lead ions to prevent lead leakage. The introduction of waste EPS not only enhances the photovoltaic performance of the devices and significantly improves their stability but also plays a crucial role in addressing the major scientific challenge of lead leakage in perovskite solar cells.

 Table S2 S2 , the control group exhibited τ 1 , τ 2 , and τ ave values of 13.63, 56.47, and 19.27 ns, respectively. After EPS modification, these values increased to 16.26, 164.49, and 40.75 ns, respectively. The results indicate that EPS passivation slows down the recombination rate of excitons by reducing the number of defect centers.
