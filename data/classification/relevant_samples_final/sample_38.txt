Title: Defect Passivation and Crystallization Regulation for Efficient and Stable Formamidinium Lead Iodide Solar Cells with Multifunctional Amidino Additive
Amidino -based additives show great potential in high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the role of different functional groups in amidino-based additives have not been well elucidated. Herein, two multifunctional amidino additives 4-amidinobenzoic acid hydrochloride (ABAc) and 4-amidinobenzamide hydrochloride (ABAm) are employed to improve the film quality of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) perovskites. Compared with ABAc, the amide group imparts ABAm with larger dipole moment and thus stronger interactions with the perovskite components, i.e., the hydrogen bonds between N‚Ä¶H and I -anion and coordination bonds between C = O and Pb 2+ cation. It strengthens the passivation effect of iodine vacancy defect and slows down the crystallization process of ùú∂-FAPbI 3 , resulting in the significantly reduced non-radiative recombination, long carrier lifetime of 1.7 Œºs, uniformly large crystalline grains, and enhances hydrophobicity. Profiting from the improved film quality, the ABAm-treated PSC achieves a high efficiency of 24.60%, and maintains 93% of the initial efficiency after storage in ambient environment for 1200 hours. This work provides new insights for rational design of multifunctional additives regarding of defect passivation and crystallization control toward highly efficient and stable PSCs.
Introduction Organo-inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising photovoltaic technology due to their advantages of low-cost solution processing, tunable band gap, high optical absorption coefficient and long carrier diffusion length.  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]  Among various perovskites, formamidinium lead concentration and better grain orientation in perovskite films, endowing the PSC with a high PCE of 26.08%. These results indicate that the interactions between additives and perovskite components as well as the crystallization behaviors are highly important for the defect passivation and film quality of FAPbI 3 perovskites. Recently, our group employed an amidino-based additive (3-amidinopyridine) to fix I -anion vacancy defects due to its strong chemical bonds with Pb-I framework, and realized a high PCE of 25.3%.  [32]  In addition, the other amidino-based additives have also been incorporated to improve the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs via forming 2D/3D polycrystalline perovskites or surface treatment.  [6, 33, 34]  These results demonstrate the great potential of amidino-based additives in realizing high-performance PSCs. Beside amidino group, other functional groups in these additives can also interact with the perovskite precursors. Nevertheless, the systemically understanding of the role of different functional groups in the amidino-based additives is still lacking. Herein, we select two benzamidine additives with different functional groups on the para-position of amidino to realize both multi-sites defect passivation and crystallization regulation of FAPbI 3 perovskite films towards efficient and stable PSCs. Compared with 4-amidinobenzoic acid hydrochloride (ABAc), the additive 4-amidinobenzamide hydrochloride (ABAm) exhibits larger polarity due to the localized charge distribution. This promotes the stronger hydrogen bonds between N‚Ä¶H and I -anion and coordination bonds between C = O and Pb 2+ cation. The stronger interactions further slow down the crystallization dynamics and enhance film crystallinity of ùõº-FAPbI 3 perovskites. With reduced I -vacancy and undercoordinated Pb 2+ defects and improved crystalline morphology, the resultant PSC achieves a PCE of 24.6% and maintains 93% of initial efficiency after storage in ambient environment for 1300 h, which is significantly better than the untreated device. 
 Results and Discussion Figure  1a  shows the molecular structure and electrostatic potential distribution (ESP) of ABAc and ABAm, respectively. ABAc and ABAm possess the same amidino group attached to the benzene ring but distinct groups at the para-position, i.e., a carboxyl group for ABAc and an amide group for ABAm. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation results show that the negative charges are mainly located at O atom of C = O, and the positive charges enrich in OH of carboxyl group and amidino group for ABAc.  [35]  As carboxyl group is replaced by amide group, both the negative charges at O atom of C = O and the positive charges at amidino group increase for ABAc. These results demonstrate that the functional group at the para position can influence the charge distribution in amidino group.  [36]  As a result, ABAc and ABAm exhibit the dipole moments of 5.40 and 6.41 D, indicative of the stronger polarity of ABAm. The interactions between additives and precursor components or perovskites are investigated by using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H-NMR), Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The 1 H-NMR spectra of the additives without/with PbI 2 in solution phase are shown in Figure  1b . For the neat ABAc solution, the two strong signals around 8 ppm can be attributed to the protons in benzene ring, and the signals at 9.31 and 9.54 ppm with moderate intensity can be assigned to the protons in amidino group,  [37]  while the weak signal at 13.51 ppm should be the proton in carboxyl group. After PbI 2 was incorporated, the proton signals from benzene ring and amidino showed upfield shifts, and the signal in carboxyl group was suppressed. These should be owing to the increased electron shielding caused by the formation of I‚Ä¶H-N or I‚Ä¶H-O hydrogen bonds. Similarly, the mixture of ABAm and PbI 2 showed downfield signals for all the protons in comparison to the neat ABAm, indicating that the charge transferred from I -anion to ABAm. Nevertheless, the single proton signal for amidino group split into two peaks as PbI 2 was added, indicative of the two different chemical environments of protons in amidino group. It may be due to only one H in NH 2 of amidino can form hydrogen bonding with I -anion. The FTIR spectra also changed as PbI 2 was added into the additives. As shown in Figure  1c  and Figure  S1  (Supporting Information), the stretching vibration peak of OH was significantly suppressed and the N-H stretching vibration peak became broad and stronger for ABAc after incorporating PbI 2 . It may be owing to the partial breakage of O-H‚Ä¶O hydrogen bonds and the formation of more N-H‚Ä¶I hydrogen bonds. In addition, the stretching vibration peak of C = O shifted to lower wavenumber, which may be due to the coordination interaction between electron-rich C = O group and Pb 2+ cation.  [37]  As PbI 2 was added into ABAm, the stretching vibration of N-H was suppressed, suggesting that the preformed N-H‚Ä¶N hydrogen bonds was suppressed and the partial N-H interacted with I - anion. Nevertheless, the stretching vibration of C = O of ABAm was broader and stronger after adding PbI 2 , which may be due to the increased coordination interaction between the ABAm with large polarity and Pb 2+ cation. Figure  1d  shows the XPS spectra of lead (Pb) 4f, iodine (I) 3d and nitrogen (N) 1s for the perovskite films without (the control sample) and with ABAc and ABAm additives. The Pb 4f 5/2 and Pb 4f 7/2 peaks were located at 143.57 and 138.70 eV for the control sample, which shifted to 142.78 and 137.91 eV for ABAc-treated sample and 142.49 and 137.65 for ABAm-treated sample, respectively. Similarly, the perovskite film with ABAm also showed the larger down shift of binding energy for I 3d and N 1s peaks in comparison to the film with ABAc. It indicates that more negative charges were enriched in Pb, I and N when the film processed with ABAm, which may be caused by the stronger electron donating ability of ABAm with larger polarity to the perovskite components than that of ABAc. The above results demonstrate that the two additives can interact with perovskite components in both solution and solid states, while ABAm showed stronger binding ability with perovskite components than ABAc due to its larger polarity. To understand the effect of additives on the crystallization dynamics of FAPbI 3 perovskites, in situ photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was performed during spin-coating and thermal annealing process. The perovskite precursor solutions without or with the additives showed similar PL signal evolution during spin-coating (Figure  S2 , Supporting Information), where a strong PL signal at ca. 700 nm was observed after anti-solvent dripping at 10 s and then quickly disappeared. This PL signal evolution can be attributed to the formation of ùõº-FAPbI 3 crystal nucleus caused by local over-saturation and then the re-dissolution.  [38]  Nevertheless, the three precursor films showed significantly different crystallization processes during thermal annealing. Figure  2a  shows the in situ PL spectra of the perovskite precursor films without (the control sample) and with the additives annealed at 150 ¬∞C for 10 min, and the evolution of PL intensity is shown in Figure  2b . For the control sample, the PL intensity rose rapidly and reached the maximum at 12 s, indicating that ùõº-FAPbI 3 formed quickly during post-annealing. The subsequent rapid decline in PL intensity from 12 to 44 s could be attributed to the dissolution of the crystallites caused by the volatilization of residual solvent. As thermal annealing further extended, the PL intensity slowly increased and then gradually decreased. It may be owing to the recrystallization of perovskites and then formation of stacking defects (i.e., the grain boundaries, and the degradation of ùõº-FAPbI 3 perovskite).  [39]  In contrast, the additives treated samples displayed higher PL intensity during the whole annealing process, indicative of the suppressed stacking defects by the additives. The PL intensity of ABAc-and ABAm-treated samples reached their maximum values at 25 and 35 s, which were 13 and 23 s later than that of the control sample. It suggests that the conversion process from precursor to ùõº-FAPbI 3 perovskite was retarded by the additives, which may be due to the strong binding ability between the additives and precursor components.  [40]  Additionally, the crystallite dissolution and recrystallization processes were also delayed for the additives-treated samples. Compared with the ABAc-treated sample, the ABAm-treated sample showed both the higher PL intensity and postponed crystallization dynamics during annealing, which may facilitate the formation of high-quality perovskite photovoltaic layer. The morphologies of different perovskite films were further characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Figure  2c  shows the top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of different perovskite films. For the control film, large holes formed in the grain boundaries, and small voids appeared in the crystalline grains. These defects may be caused by the fast volatilization of processing solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide. When the additives were used, these stacking defects were eliminated. Nevertheless, compared with ABAc-treated sample, the longitudinal distribution was more regular and the grain size was larger in ABAm-treated perovskite film (Figure  S3 , Supporting Information). The tightly compacted and vertically aligned grains are beneficial for the charge transport in solar cells. The I/Pb ratio of the perovskite films was further investigated by energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). As shown in Figure  2d  and Figure  S4  (Supporting Information), the I/Pb ratios were estimated to be 2.82, 2.91, and 2.98 for the control, ABAc-and ABAmtreated perovskite films. These results suggest that the iodine vacancy defect can be effectively suppressed with additive engineering, especially in ABAm-processed sample. It may be owing to the strong interactions between ABAm and I -anion. The root-mean-square roughness of the control and ABAc-, ABAmtreated films were 25.5, 23.8, and 22.1 nm as characterized by AFM, indicative of the smoother surface of ABAm-treated film (Figure  2c ), which was consistent with the SEM results. The flat surface can help the contact between perovskite layer and the top hole-transporting layer. In addition, the water contact angle increased from 55.2¬∞for the control sample to 60.7¬∞and 64.7¬∞for ABAc-and ABAm-treated samples, which may be should be beneficial from the hydrophobic benzene ring in the additives. The enhanced hydrophobicity may alleviate the perovskite degradation caused by the moisture. The film crystallinity was checked by XRD. As shown in Figure  2f , the control film showed two strong signals at 14.15¬∞and 28.30¬∞. According to the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) file for FAPbI 3 (No. 96-901-0), these two diffraction peaks can be assigned to the (100) and (200) diffractions of ùõº-FAPbI 3 perovskite with cubicoctahedral structure.  [22]  Compared with the control sample, the ABAc-treated sample showed a stronger (100) diffraction at the same position. In contrast, the (100) peak shifted to 14.08¬∞with the strongest intensity for ABAm-treated sample, suggesting that the PbI 6 octahedral framework can be affected by ABAm. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of (100) peak were calculated to be 0.102¬∞, 0.101¬∞and 0.098¬∞for the control, ABAc-and ABAm-treated films (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information), suggesting that the film crystallinity was dramatically enhanced by ABAm. The above results demonstrate that ABAm with strong interactions with perovskite components can not only slow down the crystallization dynamics of ùõº-FAPbI 3 , but also reduce the amount of residual solvent by partially replacing the solvent to coordinate with perovskite precursors. This further resulted a highly-crystalline perovskite film with large compact grains and fewer stacking defects. The optoelectronic properties of the different perovskite films were further investigated by using optical spectroscopies, dark I-V behaviors and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Figure  3a  shows the absorption spectra of the control, ABAc-and ABAm-treated perovskite films. The three films showed similar absorption, and delivered the same optical band gap (E g ) of 1.54 eV (see the tauc plots in Figure  S6 , Supporting Information). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra are shown in Figure  3b, c . Compared with the control film, the PL intensity gradually increased as ABAc was added, and was further strengthened when ABAm was used. In addition, the PL peak location blue-shifted from 819 nm for the control and ABAc-treated films to 813 nm for ABAm-treated film. These suggest that the non-radiative recombination in the ùõº-FAPbI 3 perovskite film was mostly reduced when ABAm additive was used.  [23]  The reduced charge recombination was further verified by TRPL spectra in Figure  3c . The biexponential fitting was performed for the TRPL spectra of different perovskite films. The fast and slow carrier lifetimes were determined to be 0.97, 1.39, 2.20 and 0.33, 0.46, 0.67 Œºs for the control film and the perovskite films with ABAc and ABAm, which indicates that the trap-induced nonradiative recombination in both surface and bulk was effectively suppressed with ABAm engineering.  [41]  The resultant average lifetimes were 0.87, 1.27, and 1.74 Œºs for the control, ABAc-and ABAm-treated films (Table  S1 , Supporting Information). The long-lived charge carriers in ABAm-treated film was also found in PL mapping. As shown in Figure  3d , the PL lifetime significantly increased in ABAm-treated film in comparison to the control and ABActreated films. The longer carrier lifetime may facilitate the charge transport and improve the photovoltaic performance in solar cells. The trap density (n trap ) was estimated from the dark currentvoltage curve of single charge carrier device.  [42]  As shown in Figure  3e , the ABAm-treated perovskite film exhibited a low trapfilling voltage (V TFL ) of 0.100 V, which was significantly lower than the control and ABAc-treated films (the V TFL values were 0.231 and 0.217 V for the control and ABAc-treated films, respectively). The corresponding n trap values were determined to be 5.91 √ó 10 16 , 5.56 √ó 10 16 and 2.56 √ó 10 16 cm -3 for the control, ABAcand ABAm-treated films. The longer carrier lifetime, lowest V TFL and n trap suggest that the ABAm treatment can successfully improve the charge carrier dynamics in the perovskite film. This is consistent with improved crystallization morphology with reduced grain boundaries and eliminated stacking defects as well as the effective defect passivation owing to the strong interactions between ABAm and perovskite components. The UPS characterization was performed to study the electronic structure of perovskite films and the energy level alignment in the photovoltaic device. As shown in Figure  3g  and Figure  S7  (Supporting Information), compared with the control film, the ABAc-and ABAmtreated films showed downshifted Fermi level, conduction band minimum and valence band maximum by 0.08 and 0.16 eV, respectively. As a result, the energy barrier between perovskite layer The influence of additive treatment on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs was finally investigated. The n-i-p devices with a structure of FTO/TiO 2 /FAPbI 3 /spiro-OMeTAD/Au were prepared. The optimal content of ABAc and ABAm additives was 2.5 mg mL -1 in the precursor solutions for the PSCs (Figures  S8, S9 , and Tables  S2, S3 , Supporting Information). The J-V curves of the optimal PSCs based on the different perovskite films are in Figure  4a , and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table  S4  (Supporting Information). The control filmbased device showed a moderate PCE of 22.77% with an open circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.138 V, a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 25.09 mA cm -2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 79.75%. In contrast, the devices based on ABAc-and ABAm-treated films exhibited higher PCE of 23.58% and 24.60% due to the simultaneously improvement of V OC , J SC and FF. The high PCE of 24.60% for ABAm-processed device is comparable to the state-ofthe art PSCs processed with other additive (Table  S5 , Supporting Information),  [6, 32, 33, 37, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48]  indicative of the versatility of ABAm additive. Besides the high photovoltaic performance, the introduction of ABAm can also significantly suppress the hysteresis effect, i.e., decreasing the hysteresis index from 6.6% for the control device to 2.9% for the ABAm-treated device (Figure  S10  and Table  S5 , Supporting Information). It may be owing to the strong binding interactions between ABAm with the I -anion and the reduced stacking defects. The statistical analysis of photovoltaic efficiency over 20 devices for different conditions are shown in Figure  4b . The control, ABAc-and ABAm-treated devices displayed the average PCEs of 22.42 ¬± 0.30%, 23.37 ¬± 0.15% and 24.34 ¬± 0.09%, which showed similar trend as the optimal device. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimal devices are shown in Figure  4c . The integrated J SC values were 24.96, 24.99 and 25.15 mA cm -2 for the devices based on the control, ABAc-and ABAm-treated devices. The integrated J SC values were consistent with the values measured in J-V curves (the error was less than 2%). Figure  4d  shows the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of different devices, and the fitting parameters are summarized in Table  S6  (Supporting Information). Compared with the device based on the control and ABAc-treated films, the device based on ABAm-treated film showed the largest recombination resistance (R rec ). It can hinder the recombination of the carriers in perovskite film, and allow the effective charge extraction in PSC device. The capacitance-voltage (C-V) curves of different devices are shown in Figure  4e . The measured built-in potential (V bi ) values of the PSC devices based on the control, ABAc-and ABAm-treated films were 1.026, 1.051 and 1.081 V, respectively. The larger V bi can improve the charge separation, and thus lead to a higher V OC in ABAm-processed device. The evolution of V OC with light intensity (In(I)) is shown in Figure  4f . The slopes of the fitting line decreased from 1.35 k B T/q for the control device to 1.25 k B T/q for the ABAm-processed device (the k B , T and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature and elementary charge). It means that the trap-assisted charge recombination was significantly inhibited by ABAm treatment. The control and ABAm-processed devices showed the steady-state output PCEs of 22.89% and 24.10% and J SC values of 24.87 and 25.10 mA cm -2 after operation at the maximum power point for 10 min (Figure  4g ), indicating the reliability of our PSC devices. Besides the improved photovoltaic performance, the ABAmprocessed device also showed better stability in ambient environment. The evolution of PCE for the unpackaged devices during storage at room temperature with relative humidity (RH) of 35-40% is shown in Figure  4h . The device based on the control film continuously degraded during storage, which lost over 10% of the initial efficiency at 600 h and ca. 17% of the initial efficiency at 1200 h. The device based on ABAc-treated film showed slightly better stability, which maintained 89% of the initial efficiency after storage for 1200 h. In contrast, the device based on ABAmtreated film show negligible degradation at 600 h (only 1% loss in device efficiency), and maintained 93% of the initial efficiency after storage in ambient condition for 1200 h. The enhanced device stability should be owing to the better stability of ABAm-treated film. To verify this, we investigated stability of the control and ABAm-treated perovskite films in an accelerated condition, i.e., in a high humid environment with a RH of 80%. As shown in Figure  S11  (Supporting Information), for the control perovskite film, the optical images showed that non-uniform defects formed at 4 h, and partial areas became gray at 12 h, and most of them turned into white and gray after 18 h, indicating of the seriously decomposition of perovskite film. The SEM image revealed that many non-conductive irregular grains (white regions) with holes had emerged, and some of the grains had fused to form a fuzzy surface after storage for 18 h. The XRD results demonstrated that the partial ùõº-FAPbI 3 has turn into ùõø-FAPbI 3 in 2 h, and the ùõº-FAPbI 3 almost decomposed in 18 h. In contrast, the ABAmtreated perovskite film did not show obvious change during storage before 12 h in optimal images, and only few of grains became non-conductive in 18 h in SEM image. The alleviated phase transition can be further probed by XRD, where the ùõø-FAPbI 3 only appeared after 12 h storage at high humidity, and then gradually increased at 18 h. All the above results indicate that the addition of ABAm can significantly improve the storage stability of perovskite film in ambient and humid environment. It should be noted that the ABAm-treated film endowed higher PCE and better stability than the control and ABAc-treated film even fabri-cated in open environment (Figure  S12  and Table  S7 , Supporting Information), indicative of the superiority of ABAm additive in realizing high-performance and stable PSCs. Generally speaking, the water and oxygen molecules prefer to absorb at the defect sites at the surface and grain boundaries, which further react with the perovskite components and accelerate the degradation.  [12]  Thus, the enhanced ambient stability of the ABAm-treated perovskite films may be brought about by the following factors: First, the ABAm additive can passivate the iodine vacancies in perovskites films by the strong and specific interactions, i.e., the hydrogen bonds between N‚Ä¶H and I -anion and coordination bonds between C = O and Pb 2+ cation. The reduced defects can effectively inhibit the adsorption and diffusion of water and oxygen molecules, and improves the environmental stability of ABAm treated perovskite films. Second, the large and compact grains with higher crystallinity in ABAm treated film can restrict the water and oxygen penetration from the grain boundaries or voids. Third, the benzene ring in ABAm can enhance the hydrophobicity of perovskite film (as evidenced from contact angle test), which can alleviate the absorption of water molecules at the surface. 
 Conclusion In this study, we have demonstrated efficient and stable ùõº-FAPbI 3 -based PSCs by synergistic manipulating the defect passivation and crystallization dynamics with multi-functional benzamidine additives. The amide group at the para-position could effectively increase the dipole of ABAm additive, which enabled the strong interactions with perovskite components. This not only improved the defect passivation of I -vacancy and undercoordinated Pb 2+ , but also promoted the crystallization of ùõº-FAPbI 3 to form high-crystalline large grains. The combination of reduced tacking defect, suppressed non-radiative recombination and improved charge carrier lifetime in ABAm treated perovskite film contributed to the simultaneously enhancement of V OC , J SC and FF, enabling a high PCE of 24.60% for PSC device. Moreover, the increased hydrophobicity and optimal crystalline morphology effectively improved the long-term stability in ambient condition by inhibiting the phase transition from ùõº-FAPbI 3 to ùõø-FAPbI 3 . This work reveals the critical role of multifunctional amidino additives in defect passivation and crystallization control to construct efficient and stable FAPbI 3 -based PSCs.

Title: Defect Passivation and Crystallization Regulation for Efficient and Stable Formamidinium Lead Iodide Solar Cells with Multifunctional Amidino Additive

Experimental Section 1. Materials Formamidinium iodide (FAI), Pb (II) iodide (PbI2), and spiro-OMeTAD were purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd. (Yingkou, China). Methylammonium chloride (MACl) and phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) were obtained from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Co. and 4-Amidinobenzoic acid hydrochloride (ABAc) and 4-Amidinobenzamide hydrochloride (ABAm) were purchased from Bide Pharmatech Ltd. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (anhydrous, 99.8%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (anhydrous, ‚â• 99.9%) were obtained from Alfa Aesar Inc. Chlorobenzene (CB) (anhydrous, 99.8%) and isopropanol (IPA) (anhydrous, 99.5%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. 4-tertbutylpyridine (t-BP, 99%) and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, 99.95% trace metals basis) were purchased from Aladdin. 
 Solution preparation, perovskite synthesis and device fabrication Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with a planar n-i-p structure of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2/FAPbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. FTO glass substrates (2.5 √ó 2.5 cm) were cleaned by ultrasonication in a cleaning detergent (Hellmanex III, Sigma-Aldrich) mixed with pure water (v:v = 1~1.5:100) for 30 min. After that, the substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in pure water for 30 min, and repeated for three times. Finally, the substrates were dried under a nitrogen flow and treated with ultraviolet ozone (UVO) for 15min. The electron transport layer (ETL) TiO2 with a thickness of 8 nm was prepared by immersing the FTO glass substates in 200 mL aqueous solution with 4.5 mL titanium tetrachloride for 60 min at 70 ¬∞C, and then annealed at 200 ¬∞C for 30 min in air. After treatment with UVO for 15 min, the FTO/TiO2 substrates were transferred into glove box for fabricating perovskite layer. The FAPbI3 perovsktite was synthesized from the solution precursors. PbI2 and FAI were dissolved in a solvent mixture of DMF and DMSO (volume ratio: 4:1) with a concentration of 1.5 M, where MACl (30.2 mg mL -1 ) and ABAc and ABAm additives (1-5 mg mL -1 ) were added to the precursor solutions. The perovskite precursor solution (70 ŒºL, filtered through a 0.45 Œºm filter) was spread over the FTO/TiO2 substrate and spin-coated at 6000 rpm for 50 s, followed by dripping the antisolvent diethyl ether (1 mL) at 10 s. The precursor film was further annealed at 150 ¬∞C for 10 min to form crystalline perovskite layer with a thickness of ca. 450 nm. After cooling down to room temperature, 60 ŒºL PEAI solution (5 mg mL -1 in isopropyl alcohol) was spin-coated onto the perovskite films at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 90 mg Spiro-OMeTAD, 36 ŒºL t-BP, 22 ŒºL Li-TFSI solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1mL acetonitrile) in 1 mL CB, and spin-coated onto the top of the perovskite layer at 5000 rpm for 30 s as hole transport layer with a thickness of 90 nm. Finally, 80-nm-thick Au electrodes were deposited on top of Spiro-OMeTAD layer by thermal evaporation to complete the device. The active area of the solar cells is 9 mm 2 . 
 Characterization. The nuclear magnetic resonance hydrogen spectro-scopy ( 1 H-NMR) tests were performed at performed using a JNM-ECZ400S/L1 with a frequency of 400 MHz. The deuterated DMSO was used as the solvent. The absorption spectroscopy was performed on a UV-vis NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 950). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were carried out using a photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were measured with a Bruker Vertex 70. In situ PL spectra was recorded by a QE-Pro (Ocean Optics) spectrometer with an FPB-405 optical probe located ca. 5 mm above the sample. The PL signals of the samples were recorded sequentially during spin-coating and thermal annealing process. The spectrometer is set to kinetic mode with an integration time of 0.3 s for each spectrum. The samples were excited by a continuous wave laser with the peak emission wavelength of 405 nm. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out with a Dimension ICON atomic force microscope (Bruker Co. Ltd., USA) in tapping mode. The morphologies of the perovskite films and cross-sectional images of the PSCs were obtained using a fieldemission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (HITACHI, SU-8020). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Rigaku Smart Lab (X-ray Source: Cu KŒ±, ÔÅ¨ = 1.54 √Ö). The EIS and C-V curves were measured with an electrochemical workstation (Modulab XM, USA). The water contact angles were measured using a DataPhysics OCA 20. The steady state PL and timeresolved photoluminescence (TRPL) were measured on PicoQuant FT-300 spectrometer with an excitation wavelength at 510 nm from front-side, and the samples were deposited on glass sides. The carrier lifetime was determined using the following equation: F(t) = ‚àë ùê¥ i exp(- ùë° ùúè i ) + A0 where Ai and œÑi are the amplitude and carrier lifetime of the ith process, and A0 is the background signal intensity.  [1, 2]  The average carrier lifetime was calculated according to the following equation: ùúè ave = ‚àë ùê¥ i ùúè i 2 ‚àë ùê¥ i ùúè i J-V characteristics of the PSCs were measured using a solar simulator (AM 1.5 G, SAN-EIELECTRIC XES-40S2-CE) calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell. EQE spectra of the PSCs were measured using a Q Test Station 500TI system (Crowntech, Inc., USA). The where …õ0 is the dielectric constant of the vacuum, …õ is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite, e is the unit charge, L is the device thickness, and VTFL is the trap filling voltage.
