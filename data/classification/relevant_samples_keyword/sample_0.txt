Title: Surface Dedoping for Methylammonium-Free Tin-Lead Perovskite Solar Cells
For Sn-Pb-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs), surface p-doping-related defects including Sn vacancies, FA vacancies, and I-related defects substantially impact the local work function and band structure, thus resulting in inefficient carrier transfer kinetics at the perovskite/C 60 interface. Herein, a surface dedoping strategy is rationally designed based on synergistic passivation of p-doping-related defects, in which shallow-level defects are compensated and localized electronic states caused by deep-level defects are removed. Accordingly, the back surface electrical-field by a concomitantly formed n/n + homojunction as well as reduced surface potential fluctuations minimize the electron extraction barrier. The electron mobility and built-in voltage are greatly enhanced, and carrier lifetimes are elongated to over 7 μs. Meanwhile, the cooperative stabilization of surface components suppresses I -ion migration and Sn 2+ oxidation. The resulting MA-free Sn-Pb PSCs deliver a champion efficiency of 22.05%, along with maintaining 94% of the initial efficiency after 1200 h of aging in N 2 .
P b-based organic-inorganic halide perovskites as emerg- ing light-absorber materials have achieved unprecedented breakthroughs in photovoltaic applications. Nevertheless, the bandgap (E g ) range of a traditional Pbbased perovskite is ∼1.5-1.7 eV, and it has achieved ∼85% of its maximum theoretical efficiency of ∼30%.  1  Encouragingly, compositional engineering at the B-site partially or entirely replaced by Sn 2+ is a paramount strategy to lower the bandgap, in which 25-30% Sn content in mixed Sn-Pb perovskites achieves an ideal E g (1.3-1.4 eV) for the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction solar cells. Possessing excellent thermal and operational stability, cesiumformamidinium (CsFA)-based Sn-Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still exhibit a lower efficiency than methylammonium (MA)-containing systems. This is mainly attributed to more severe nonradiative recombination and inferior charge transport dynamics, causing a serious open-circuit voltage (V oc ) and fill factor (FF) deficit.  2, 3  The surfaces of perovskite films usually possess higher structural disorder and defect density than the bulk, dominant in affecting the photoelectrical performance of perovskite materials.  4  Yang et al. illuminated that the carrier lifetime of perovskite films is limited by surface recombination, suggesting that detrimental defects serving as nonradiative recombination centers are prevalent on the perovskite surface.  5  Owing to disordered crystallization, easier Sn 2+ oxidation, and escape of volatile species, the top surface region of Sn-Pb perovskite is vulnerable to defect formation. The energetically favorable defects at the surface can create electronic states specific to the surface, which substantially impact the local work function, band structure, and electron behavior.  [6] [7] [8]  Under illumination and applied electric field, surface defects serving as random dopants influence quasi-Fermi level splitting and exacerbate ion migration, aggravating open-circuit voltage (V oc ) losses and the hysteresis effect of devices.  9  Moreover, perovskite microstructure degradation always initiates at the surface due to the metastable structural disorder. Environmental species, such as oxygen/water molecules, preferentially coordinate with the undercoordinated ions caused by fragile Sn-I frameworks to trigger Sn 2+ oxidation and phase transition.  10, 11  A high-quality surface at the contact interface is crucial to achieving superior device performance. Considering the charge transport in the vertical direction of PSCs, the band misalignment and interfacial recombination that originate from surface imperfections predominantly limit the carrier dynamics at the perovskite heterojunction interfaces. For Pbbased n-i-p PSCs, Gao et al. utilized a silicon naphthalocyanine derivative in antisolvent to passivate the deep-level donor defects Pb 0 which pin the Fermi level (E f ) close to the conduction band minimum. The greatly relieved E f pinning and resulting p-type surface polarity promoted hole transport at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface, enabling a high efficiency of 24.30% and excellent operational stability.  12  For p-i-n devices, it was illuminated by quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) measurement that the open-circuit voltage (V oc )limiting recombination is mainly at the perovskite/C 60 contact interface.  13, 14  Hence, determining defect types at the perovskite surface and alleviating the adverse electronic doping and instability caused by surface defects at the perovskite/C 60 contact interface are anticipated to enable efficient charge transport and prominent stability of Sn-Pb PSCs. Herein, synergistic passivation of the p-doping-related defect (V FA , V Sn , I-related defect, Sn 4+ ) through combining imidazolium (IM) and 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzamidoxime (CF 3 BOM) salts is rationally designed to realize surface dedoping, in which the shallow-level defects are compensated and the localized electronic states caused by deep-level defects are removed. Accordingly, the concomitantly formed n/n + homojunction induces a back-surface electric field aligned with a built-in electric field, and the surface potential fluctuations are greatly reduced, thus minimizing the electron extraction barrier and nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/C 60 interface. Moreover, effective defect regulation nearly doubles the carrier lifetimes and electron mobility. The resultant devices based on MA-free Sn-Pb perovskite deliver a champion efficiency of 22.05% and a steady-state efficiency of 21.72%. The enhanced barrier of I -ion migration and Sn 2+ oxidation by surface treatment agents stiffen the Sn-I framework, which enables a more stabilized surface. The unencapsulated devices retained 94% of the initial efficiency after 1200 h of storage in N 2 and 87.2% after 1000 h of aging under continuous illumination. This work represents a promising strategy for surface reconstruction to address the pressing performance and stability issue of PSC. The defect properties of perovskite materials affect the type and density of charge carriers and, thus, their electrical properties. Based on first-principles theory (DFT) calculations, it is interesting to find that the conductivity of the MAPbI 3 perovskite changes from intrinsic good p-type, moderate to good n-type when the chemical potential changes from an Irich (Pb-poor), moderate to Pb-rich (I-poor) environment.  15  Jiang et al. reported that the iodide vacancy (V I ) associated with the I-poor surface induces n-type doping to the perovskite surface.  16  Koch et al. utilized photoemission measurements to conclude that metallic lead (Pb 0 ) serving as donor defects results in n-type character.  17  For p-i-n Sn-Pb-based PSCs, as shown in Figure  1a , surface p-type doping induces upward band bending at the perovskite/C 60 interface, resulting in inefficient electron extraction and nonradiative recombination by surface traps and band tail states of the C 60 layer. It is considered that surface p-doping is related to a Sn-poor (I-rich) surface, in which the Sn vacancy (V Sn ) is the primary and most stable defect due to the facile Sn 2+ oxidation at the defective surface (Sn 2+ → Sn 4+ + V Sn + 2h + → Sn 4+ + V Sn 2-+ 4h + ).  18, 19  Moreover, superficial organic cations (e.g., FA + ) are more readily liberated at elevated temperatures and undergo chemical reactions with surrounding molecules, rendering numerous A-site vacancies (e.g., V FA ) at the surface.  20  Zhong et al. illuminated that the A-site vacancy is energetically the most advantageous species among all acceptor defects independently on the growth conditions, which could inject more holes into the perovskite and dominantly contribute pdoping of the Sn-based perovskite.  21  In order to illuminate the effect of V Sn and V FA defects on the Sn-Pb perovskite surface, we then calculated the density of states (DOS) of the (001) FAPb 0.7 Sn 0.3 I 3 surface containing V FA and V Sn . Figure  S1a, b  shows that V FA and V Sn defects as p-type defects could pin E f around the valence band (VB) edge. V FA presents delocalized shallow electronic states around the VB edge, while V Sn presents the deep energy level characteristics with localized electronic states within the bandgap. Besides, superficial Sn 4+ defects caused by Sn 2+ oxidation are identified as deep-level acceptor defects.  22, 23  Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations in Figure  S1c  demonstrate that, despite shallow defect characteristics, V FA can reduce the I -ion migration barrier from 1.04 to 0.58 eV due to the reduced steric hindrance. Moreover, a high concentration of V Sn could create a locally Irich environment, thus reducing the formation energy of Irelated defects.  19, 24  Thus, high-density V Sn and V FA together with the easily occurring I -ion migration promote the formation of the I-Sn antisite (I Sn ), I-FA antisite (I FA ), and I interstitial (I i ) defects. DOS results in Figure  S1d ,e illustrate that I Sn and I FA as p-type defects could introduce deep localized electronic states, exacerbating the nonradiative recombination. Figure  S1f  illustrates that I i defects present delocalized shallow electronic states around the VB edge. However, under light illumination, iodine (I 2 ) generation by I i collision can further lead to Sn 2+ oxidation.  11, 25  The schematic illustration of surface p-doping-related defect formation and interaction is summarized in Figure  1b . The facile volatilization of FA + cations (process 1) and Sn 2+ oxidation (process 2) at the surface lead to high-density V FA and V Sn defects. The presence of V FA and V Sn exacerbates the formation of I-related defects including I Sn , I FA , and I i (processes 3, 4, 5). Collectively, the presence and formation of surface p-doping-related defects are interrelated. Based on the DFT calculations, electronic states of surface pdoping-related defects in band energy levels are summarized in Figure  1c . On the one hand, deep-level defects could exacerbate interfacial nonradiative recombination. On the other hand, high-density defects pinning the E f close to VB edge lead to upward band bending at the perovskite/C 60 interface, thus influencing QFLS. Therefore, for p-i-n Sn-Pb-based PSCs, surface p-doping-related defects play dominant roles in hindering charge transport dynamics at the perovskite/ C 60 interface. Then a rationally designed surface treatment by combining IM and CF 3 BOM synergistically compensates and passivates surface p-doping-related defects. IM is selected to compensate for V FA , and CF 3 BOM is selected to reduce deeplevel Sn 4+ and V Sn defects. Meanwhile, both surface treatment agents synergistically passivate the I-related defects (I Sn , I FA , I i ). The schematic illustration of binary surface treatment is depicted in Figure  1g , and the effect mechanism is studied in detail in the following sections. Considering the advantages of thermal stability, the MA-free perovskite with a chemical composition component of FA 0.7 Cs 0.3 Sn 0.3 Pb 0.7 I 3 was chosen as the light-absorbing layer, with the ideal bandgap (∼1.32 eV) determined by the Tauc plot method (Figure  S2 ). The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) depth profiling technique was performed to examine the energetic modulation of perovskite films.  26  The Fermi level (E f ) of the control film before etching (control surface) is located at -4.72 eV, while the control film after 20 nm etching presents an E f of -4.22 eV, indicating the stronger p-type nature of the perovskite surface (Figure  S3 ). The perovskite films after binary surface treatment are simplified to the target film. Figure  2a  presents the UPS spectra of the target film, and the corresponding energy level scheme is demonstrated in Figure  2b . The E f level shifts upward for target films (target surface, -4.07 eV) and is much closer to the conduction band maximum (CBM), demonstrating a more n-type nature compared to the bulk. The surface transformation of p-to more n-type indicates the relieved surface pdoping.  8  The formation of the n/n + homojunction between the bulk and surface of the perovskite is conducive to build an additional electric field directed from the shallow surface to the bulk (Figure  2c ). The back-surface electrical field contributes to the enhancement of the built-in electrical voltage (V bi ), which is known as field-effect passivation. The V bi enhancement was further proved by capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements (Figure  S4 ), in which V bi increases from 0.61 to 0.75 V for the target device and suggests a much higher driving force for charge transport dynamics. Meanwhile, the concomitantly downward band bending at the perovskite/C 60 interface could minimize the electron injection barrier and promote hole departure from the surface, thereby mitigating the nonradiative recombination caused by surface traps and band tail states of the C 60 ETL.  27  Accordingly, an improvement in the solar cell performance can be anticipated. Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy was performed to investigate the ultrafast charge transfer and recombination kinetics of the perovskite films. A global analysis of the TA spectra on the perovskite films sandwiched between a PEDOT: PSS hole transport layer and C 60 electron transport layer was further conducted to extract the detailed time constants that are associated with hot carrier relaxation, charge diffusion, and charge transfer. As depicted in Figure  S5 , four kinetic components were obtained in decay-associated spectra for control and target films.  28  The τ 1 stands for the time constant for hot carrier relaxation, and τ 2 is related to the charge carrier diffusion process from the perovskite layer to the interface. As shown in Figure  2d , the reduced τ 2 from 364.4 to 221.1 ps refers to the faster charge diffusion, which manifests the inhibited trap-assisted recombination of the target film. The τ 3 represents the time constant of charge transfer, significantly decreasing from 36.98 ps for control films to 2.35 ps for the target film, suggestive of remarkably promoted charge transport dynamics. Hence, effective defect manipulation realizes the interface carrier dynamics management. Then the mechanism of defect passivation by binary surface treatment was further investigated. As shown in Figure  3a , the oxidation perovskite precursor exhibits a color change form dark-red color to yellow, confirming the reduction of Sn 4+ by CF 3 BOM. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements in Figure  3a  show that the stretching vibration of reductive groups (�NOH) for pure CF 3 BOM (3345.7 cm -1 ) nearly disappeared when CF 3 BOM was mixed with SnI 4 , suggesting a complete depletion of the �NOH groups through reaction R1.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements in Figure  3b  show that Sn 4+ /(Sn 4+ +Sn 2+ ) contents of the CF 3 BOM post-treated film exhibit a remarkable decrease from 41.5 to 3.7% owing to the reduction effect of oxime groups, suggesting the decrease in V Sn defects at the surface. Furthermore, the shift of the C�O (1657.6 cm -1 ) stretching vibration of the oxidative product (CF 3 BAM) to a lower wavenumber in Figure  S6  indicates a coordination interaction between Sn 2+ /Pb 2+ ions and electron-rich groups.  29  As reported, the undercoordinated Sn 2+ dangling bonds are susceptible to absorption of oxygen molecules, thereby exacerbating Sn 2+ oxidation. Then DFT calculation in Figure  3c  reveals that the absorption energy (E abs ) values of the oxygen molecule on iodide vacancies (V I ) were enhanced from -1.95 to -1.59 eV. Meanwhile, the charge density difference (CDD) and Bader charge analysis reveal that the charge transfer (E ct ) from Sn to O atoms decreases from 0.42 to 0.37 e, suggesting an enhanced barrier for oxygen absorption on undercoordinated Sn 2+ ions. These results are evidence that not only does CF 3 BOM reduce the superficial Sn 4+ defects but also the oxidative product CF 3 BAM suppresses further Sn 2+ oxidation. Meanwhile, the slight shift of N-H stretching vibration peaks (3374.5 and 3179.3 cm -1 ) confirms the formation of hydrogen bonding between N-H in the amino groups and I -ions, benefiting the stabilization of surface I - ions and passivation of I-related defects.  30  Collectively, the Lewis acid-base interaction and hydrogen bonding formed between CF 3 BAM and the perovskite benefit the stabilization of metal halide octahedra.  31, 32  The IM + cation (∼258 ppm) with a five-membered ring aromatic has ionic radii similar to those of the FA + cation (∼253 ppm) and thereby could fill V FA without any disturbance to the 3D perovskite structure. The surfacesensitive grazing incidence XRD measured at an incident angle of 0.5°demonstrates that the main (200) diffraction peak of the perovskite films shifts to a lower 2θ angle with increasing amounts of IM + owing to lattice expansion (Figure  S7 ). Then we grew pure FAPb 0.7 Sn 0.3 I 3 and IM-FAPb 0.7 Sn 0.3 I 3 (30% molar ratio) powder crystals (Experimental Section in the Supporting Information). The 1 H liquid-state NMR spectra in Figure  3d  show that the peak located at δ = 7.69 ppm belongs to �CH (c + d) of protonated imidazolium (IM + ). For the FASn 0.7 Pb 0.3 I 3 crystal, the peak located at δ = 7.80 ppm belongs to �CH (b) of FA + . For the IM-FASn 0.7 Pb 0.3 I 3 crystal, based on the peak area ratio of �CH (b, 1.60 for FA + ) and �CH (c + d, 1.00 for IM + ), the ratio of FA + and IM + is calculated to be 3.2:1. This indicates that around 23.8% of A- sites in the perovskite crystal are occupied by IM + , proving that V FA in the perovskite lattice can be easily filled by IM + cations. We then utilized DFT calculations to disentangle the doping effect of the IM + cations. V FA is divided into two categories, V FA Pb and V FA Sn , of which V FA Pb stands for V FA surrounded by only [PbI 6 ] 4-and V FA Sn means that V FA is surrounded by simultaneously existing [PbI 6 ] 4-and [SnI 6 ] 4-octahedra. DFT calculations in Figures  3e  and S8  illuminate that the electronic states around the VB edge caused by V FA Pb and V FA Sn are nearly removed to recover the DOS of the defect-free surface. Furthermore, FTIR measurements in Figure  S9  elucidate that N-H stretching vibration peaks (3131.3 and 2971.7 cm -1 ) were shifted to a higher wavenumber, which is ascribed to hydrogen or/and an ionic bonding interaction. Furthermore, the interactions between I -and both IM/CF 3 BAM are elucidated by the shift of I 3d XPS to higher binding energy, which is conducive to I-related defect passivation and I -anion fixation (Figure  S10 ). DOS results in Figure  3f  predict that the localized electronic states caused by I Sn move to the VB and greatly decrease after both IM and CF 3 BAM passivation.  34  Figure  S11  shows that the electronic states at the VBM edge caused by the I i and I FA defects are almost completely eliminated to recover the DOS of the defect-free surface after both IM and CF 3 BAM passivation. Collectively, p-dopingrelated defect passivation by binary surface treatment was substantiated, benefiting the suppression of nonradiative recombination and thus V oc enhancement. The optoelectronic characteristics of perovskite films were characterized to investigate the passivation effect. Steady-state (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were conducted with the configuration of glass/ perovskite films. The average carrier lifetime (τ avg ) of TRPL decay curves in Figure  4a  can be fitted by the two-exponential equation, and the corresponding lifetimes are listed in Table  S1  = + + A A A A avg 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 (1a) Remarkably prolonged carrier lifetimes (7.12 μs) are obtained for the target film, which is nearly double that of the control film (3.98 μs). In particular, the fast decay time (τ 1 ) which relates to the surface defect-assisted nonradiative combination increases from 0.94 to 1.51 μs for the target film.  33  Compared with the control film, a 6-times higher PL emission intensity was observed in target films (Figure  S12 ). The PL and TRPL results collectively corroborate the superior defect passivation of the binary surface treatment. Then space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements were conducted to estimate the trap density and charge mobility (Figures  4b  and S13 ). Trap densities (N t ) could be quantitatively estimated by the trap-filled limit voltage (V TFL ) through the equation 28 = N V qL 2 t 0 r TFL 2 (2) where ε 0 and ε r are the vacuum permittivity and relative dielectric constant, respectively, and L is the perovskite thickness (∼700 nm). The calculated trap density based on electron-only devices decreased from 4.05 × 10 15 for the control film to 1.99 × 10 15 cm -3 for the target film. The 2-fold lower trap density suggests effective defect compensation and passivation. Electron mobility (μ) can be extracted through the Mott-Gurney law = J uV L 9 8 D r 0 2 3 (3) Figure  4b  shows that the calculated electron mobility of the control film is 1.31 × 10 -2 cm 2 •V -1 •s -1 and increases to 2.30 × 10 -2 cm 2 •V -1 •s -1 for the target film, suggesting the effectiveness in enhancing electron conductivity. Figure  4c ,d displays the typical pseudocolor TA spectra of the relative optical density (ΔA) as a function of pump-probe delay time and probe wavelength, respectively. The negative ΔA signal at around 850 nm stands for ground-state bleaching (GSB) originating from the band-edge state filling with photoexcited carriers, of which the recovery kinetics mirrors the carrier depopulation process.  35  A high-energy photon upon excitation to the conduction band will go through three processes: (1) hot carrier relaxation, (2) nonradiative recombination by surface trap states, and (3) radiative recombination by electron and hole recombination (Figure  4e ). The corresponding kinetic decay curves of GSB peaks in Figure  4e  show that the fitted decay time of the target film (2436 ps) is nearly two times that of the control film (1249 ps). The slower decay is associated with the reduced carriers captured by surface defects, providing compelling evidence that the target strategy effectively attenuated the surface defectassistant nonradiative recombination. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements substantiate that the surface treatment did not influence the crystallization of the bulk perovskite (Figure  S14a ). Consistently, the surface morphology and grain size of perovskite films are not obviously changed after surface treatment (Figure  S14b, c ). Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was conducted to unveil the effect on the surface's electrical nature (Figure  4f, g ). The inhomogeneous surface potential of the perovskite films means the local surface charge variations originating from the more reactive surface defects.  17  According to the following equation, the contact potential difference (CPD) = (W f,tip -W f,sample )/e (W f denotes the surface work function in air), the increased potential is correlated with reduced W f of the perovskite film. The target film exhibits a distinct increased average CPD and a narrower CPD distribution, indicating reduced energetic disorder and relieved surface p-type doping (Figure  S15 ). For another, the CPD of grain boundaries (GBs) is higher than that of the grain interior (GIs), meaning positively charged regions corresponding to downward band bending. Figure  4h ,i displays the statistics for CPD at GBs and GIs for the control and target film, and the barrier height (ΔCPD) is determined by the average potential difference between GBs and GIs (ΔCPD = CPD GB -CPD GI ). For the control film, the pronounced downward bending band at GBs (ΔCPD = 100 mV) facilitates electron accumulation and exacerbates nonradiative recombination via charged defects at the GBs. In striking contrast, the barrier height of target film decreased by half (ΔCPD = 50 mV), contributing to the suppression of in-plane electron transport and enhancement of out-of-plane transport across the ETL interface. In order to illuminate the advantages of the surface dedoping strategy, PSCs were fabricated with an inverted device structure comprising ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/C 60 / BCP/Ag (Figure  5a ). The devices fabricated with target perovskite light absorbers are simplified to target devices. The current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the best-performing control and target devices under forward and reverse direction scan are shown in Figure  5a , and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table  1 . For the forward scan, the control devices yielded a champion PCE of 16.20% with a V oc of 0.784 V, a J sc of 27.67 mA•cm -2 , and a FF of 74.66%. The IM-and CF 3 BOM-treated devices delivered champion PCEs of 18.88 and 19.11%, respectively (Figure  S16 ). Encouragingly, a conspicuously enhanced PCE of 22.05% was achieved for the target devices as a consequence of a greatly enhanced V oc of 0.910 V and FF of 81.24%. The greatly decreasing V oc deficit is expected to accompany a decrease in surface recombination velocity originating from the reduced surface defects, and they are also qualitatively consistent with the enhancement in TRPL lifetime. Moreover, the greatly enhanced FF profits from the facilitated electron transport and suppressed interfacial recombination. The target device exhibits greatly ameliorated hysteresis, which is related to the suppression of defect migration and interfacial charge accumulation. The steady-state power output (SPO) at the maximum power point (MPP) of devices was performed to reveal the performance reliability (Figure  S17 ). Under applied biases of 0.66 and 0.76 V, the control and target devices delivered stabilized PCEs of 15.58 and 21.72%, respectively, suggesting reliable photovoltaic performance. Besides, the statistical photovoltaic parameters of 20 devices shown in Figures 5b confirm the higher reproducibility of the binary surface-treatment strategy. Subsequently, light-intensity-dependent V oc measurements were performed to illuminate the charge-carrier behaviors in devices, as shown in Figure  5c . As reported, the deviation of the slope from (k B T/q), called the ideality factor, is associated with defect-assisted charge recombination.  36  The target device gives a slope of 1.32k B T, which is much smaller than that of the   5d  show that the charge recombination lifetime (τ rec ) is prolonged from 117 μs for the control device to 194 μs for the target device, affirming the reduced charge recombination losses. The charge transport lifetime (τ tr ) determined by TPC decay curves decreases from 0.95 to 0.55 μs, suggesting the heightened charge transport efficiency (Figure  S18 ). As a further comparison, the dark current measured from the dark J-V curves in Figure  S19  demonstrates that the target device exhibits a 1 order of magnitude lower dark current than that of the control device, again confirming the decrease in background carrier concentration and defect density.  37  Meanwhile, the higher slope at the forward bias voltage region manifests the reduced series resistance of devices, which corroborates the promoted charge transport dynamics at the perovskite/C 60 interface. The chemical degradation caused by I -ion migration and Sn 2+ oxidation is a fundamental factor to deteriorate the stability of mixed Sn-Pb PSCs. It is believed that the presence of V I and I interstitial defects, which serve as shuttles for halide hopping, promote I -ion migration.  38  Both IM + cations and CF 3 BAM could interact with I -ions, which is conducive to restrict the movement/vibration of I species to suppress V I formation and I -ion migration. Moreover, the decrease in V FA and V Sn density could also strengthen the ion migration barrier. Then models were constructed to calculate the I -migration energy between two V I surrounding the Sn-I framework. The barriers for I -ion migration increased from 1.04 to 3.52 eV for IM + doped in V FA Sn and increased from 0.74 to 2.37 eV after CF 3 BAM absorption (Figures  5e  and S20 ). Furthermore, the activation energy (E a ) of ion migration was obtained from temperature-dependent electrical conductivity measurements through the Nernst-Einstein relation = T T ( ) e E k T 0 / a B (4) where k B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.  39  The E a of the target device is estimated to be 185 meV, which is higher than that of the control counterpart (104 meV), suggesting the larger energy of ions or defects to be activated at the surface (Figure  5f ). Furthermore, time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) was utilized to elucidate the effect on the internal ion migration and accumulation caused by devices aging. Figure  5g  records the TOF-SIMS elemental depth profiling of control and target devices after aging in a N 2 glovebox for 1200 h. For the control device, I -ions not only distribute within C 60 layers but also seriously diffuse to the Ag electrode. As reported, I -ion intercalation leads to numerous voids of C 60 ETL and causes irreversible degradation of the Ag electrode, seriously deteriorating the device performance.  10, 40  In striking contrast, lower concentration and shallower penetration of the I -ion in the C 60 layer and Ag electrode were observed in aging target devices, suggesting the ameliorated I -ion migration during the aging process. Meanwhile, the target device exhibited enhanced resistance to Ag diffusion relative to the control device, benefiting the stability enhancement of devices. Owing to the higher-density defects of the surface than the bulk, the generation and release of I 2 is more likely to happen at the surface under light illumination. Unlike Pb-based perovskites, I 2 could oxidize surface Sn 2+ to Sn 4+ and accelerate the surface p-doping, leading to the PCE decline. More seriously, the I 2 formation and Sn 2+ oxidation could deteriorate the Sn-I lattice, exacerbating perovskite degradation.  11, 25  Figure  5h  shows that the release of I 2 from the control perovskite film was faster than that from the target films, as evidenced by UV-vis absorption spectra obtained from exposing chlorobenzenesubmersed films to light. Then the shelf-storage and light-stability measurements were collected for devices without encapsulation in a N 2 atmosphere. The shelf-storage stability test in Figure  5i  demonstrates that control devices lost nearly 50% after 1200 h of storage, whereas target devices maintained 94% of the initial PCE. Figure  S21  records the light-stability measurement of devices under one sun continuous illumination in a N 2 atmosphere. The PCE of control devices declined to less than 50% after 600 h of aging. In striking contrast, 87.2% of initial PCE after 1000 h aging was maintained for target devices. These results collectively confirm the propitious merits of binary surface treatment on stability enhancement, which stems from both defect passivation and component stabilization at the surface. In summary, a surface dedoping approach was proposed to achieve efficient electron extraction and stabilize the Sn-I framework at the perovskite/C 60 interface. The passivation mechanism of p-doping-related defects (V FA , V Sn , I-related defect, Sn 4+ ) was deeply studied by experiments and DFT calculations. Comprehensive defect passivation nearly doubles the electron mobility and carrier lifetimes. The surface energetic transformation induces a favorable n/n + homojunction for improving the built-in electric field and electron extraction dynamics at the perovskite/C 60 interface. The expedited charge transport dynamics was confirmed by TA and TPC measurements. Meanwhile, binary surface-treatment agents effectively suppress I -ion migration and Sn 2+ oxidation, enabling a more stabilized surface. A champion PCE of 22.05% was achieved for the resulting MA-free Sn-Pb-based PSCs. The unencapsulated devices retained 95% after 1200 h of storage in N 2 and 87.2% after 1000 h of aging under continuous illumination. This work provides new insights into energy level optimization at the heterojunction interface of photovoltaic devices.

Experimental Section 1.1 Perovskite Precursor Solution preparation: 1.8 M Cs0.3FA0.7Pb0.7Sn0.3I3 precursor solution was prepared by mixing 1.26 M FAI, 0.54 M CsI, 1.26 M PbI2, 0.54 M SnI2, 0.054 M SnF2, 2.5 mg/mL PEACl and 3 mg/mL Pb(SCN)2 1.2 Preparation of Post-treatment Solution: Firstly, the IM/IPA solutions with different IM concentration (1, 2, 3 mg/mL) were prepared and then stirred for 1 h at room temperature. Based on the PSCs fabrication, we confirmed that the optimal IM concentration was 2 mg/mL. The separated CF3BOM solution was prepared by dissolving different concentrations (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 mg/mL) of CF3BOM in IPA. The optimal CF3BOM concentration was 1.5 mg/mL. For the mixed IM/CF3BOM solution, different amounts of CF3BOM were added into the fabricated IM/IPA solution and the optimal IM/CF3BOM is 2 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL, respectively in 1 mL co-solvent DMSO/DMF (1:3 volume ratio). Then adding a small amount of tin powder (5 mg/mL) into the precursor solution and vigorously stirring at 35°C for 5 h to reduce Sn 4+ . Finally, the precursor solution was filtered by 0.22 µm PTFE filter before fabricating the perovskite films. . 1.3 Synthesis of FAPb0.7Sn0.3I3 and IM-FAPb0.7Sn0.3I3 single crystal: In an airtight glass bottle, PbO (156.2 mg) and SnO powder (40.41 mg) was dissolved in a mixed solvent with 1.7 mL H3PO2 aqueous solution and 3.4 mL aqueous HI solution under heating and stirring conditions. When the solution cooled to room temperature, FAAc (1 mmol, 104.1 mg) was added and some precipitate formed rapidly. Then, heat and stir above mixed system until the solid gradually dissolved to form a clear yellow solution. Finally, stop heating and stirring, and as the solution cooled slowly, black perovskite crystals would nucleate and grow. Under N2 atmosphere, the FAPb0.7Sn0.3I3 single crystals were isolated by suction filtration and dried sufficiently on a hot plate at 70°C. Similarly, the IM-FAPb0.7Sn0.3I3 single crystals was obtained by the addition of FAAc (1 mmol, 104.1 mg) and imidazole (0.3 mmol, 20.4 mg). For the 1 H liquid NMR measurement, the single crystals were dissolved in DMSO-d6 solvent, respectively. 
 Device fabrication: The patterned glass/ITO substrates were consecutively cleaned by detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol in 15 minutes ultrasonic bath, and then dried with N2 flow, followed by plasma treatment for 20 min. PEDOT: PSS hole transport layer was fabricated by an aqueous dispersion that was filtered by a 0.45 µm PVDF filter and then spin-coated on the glass/ITO substrate utilizing a spin-program of 4700 rpm for 30s. The wet films were then annealed in ambient environment at 150C for 20 min. followed by transferring to N2 glovebox (H2O, O2 <0.1 ppm) and degassing at 150 C for 30 min. The perovskite films were deposited by spin-coating the above precursor solution with two-step spin-coating procedures: (1) 1500 rpm for 10s with an acceleration of 200 rpm•s -1 and (2) 4000 rpm for 40 s with an acceleration of 1500 rpm•s -1 . Ethyl acetate (150 µl) as antisolvent was rapidly dripped onto the spinning substrate over an interval of 1 s during the second spin-coating step at 25 s before the end of the procedure. Then two-steps annealing was utilized: leaving without annealing for 3 min and subsequently annealing at 150°C for 15 min. When the fabricated perovskite films were cooled down to room temperature, the post-treatment solution was dynamically spin-coated onto the perovskite film at 4000 rpm for 30 s and immediately annealed again at 100°C for 8 min. Subsequently, the fabricated substrates were transferred to a vacuum deposition chamber, in which 25 nm of C60 (deposition rate of 0.01 nm•s -1 ), 5 nm of BCP and 120 nm Ag electrode were consecutively deposited by thermal evaporation on the above substrate to the perovskite solar cells. 1.5 Characterization: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, NEXUS670), 1 H liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, Bruker 400 MHz) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Escalab 250Xi electron spectrometer) were conducted to elucidate the interaction between the post-treatment agent and perovskite. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and grazing incidence XRD (GIXRD) were performed on a Rigaku Smartlab 9kW. The top-view and cross-sectional images were recorded by the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, SU-70). The surface potentials were characterized by SPM-9700 atomic force microscope in Potential Channel equipped with PPP-EFM probe. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurements were carried out by ION-TOF SIMS 5. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured by Specord Plus 200 Spectro-photometer. Steady-state (PL) were both characterized by FLS920 all functional fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh) of which the xenon lamp light source was with a wavelength of 478 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was measured by FLS1000 all functional fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh). The Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy was carried out by a regenerative laser pulse generated by a Ti: Sapphire amplifier (800 nm fundamental, 100 fs pulse length, and 1 KHz repetition rate) and Helios (Ultrafast Systems) spectrometers. The laser fluences in the TA measurements were 1.3 μJ•cm -2 for excitation at 780 nm and a probe in the region of 800-1600 nm (near-infrared region). The SCLC measurements were measured by Keithley 2420 source measurement unit under dark. UPS measurements was measured by PHI5000 VersaProbe III (Scanning ESCA Microprobe) SCA (Spherical Analyzer) employing a He I (hv = 21.22 eV) under a bias of -10 V. The current density-voltage (J-V) curves were measured by a Keithley 2450 analyzer under the stimulated AM 1.5 G illumination. Capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements were performed by CHI660E electrochemical workstation. Transient photovoltage/photocurrent (TPV/TPC) spectra were recorded by Tektronix MDO3032 with a wavenumber of 485 nm. The ionic conductivity (σ) was extracted from the current response of a lateral perovskite device, with a configuration of Au/perovskite (50 μm)/Au, under an applied electrical field of 0.4 V/µm and was measured by the ionic conductivity measurement (Keithley 4200-SCS). 
 DFT Calculation methods: The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) was employed to perform the first principles computations based on density functional theory (DFT). The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was utilized as the exchange-correlation functional. The projector augmented wave pseudopotentials were chosen to describe the ion-electron with a kinetic energy cutoff energy of 420 eV. To avert the fictitious interaction with its periodic image, a vacuum region of 30 Å was used. The electronic energy and force convergence criteria were set to 10 -6 eV and 0.05 eV Å -1 , respectively. A supercell with 3×3×3 periodicity and 1×1×1-center k-point mesh was utilized in the condition of defect formation energy while 2×2×1center k-point mesh was utilized in the condition of density of states (DOS). All the calculations were based on the FA-I or Pb/Sn-I terminal on the thermodynamically stable (001) crystal plane. The formation energy of a defect in charge state q is given by: Ef = Edefect -Efree -∑ , where Edefect and Efree are the total energies of the defect and defect-free surfaces, respectively. ni and are respective the number and chemical potential of added (ni>0) or removed (ni<0) for i-type atom. The adsorption energy of adsorbate molecules on perovskite surface was calculated as follows: Eperovskite+molecule -Eperovskite -Emolecule, where Eperovskite+molecule, Eperovskite, and Emolecule is the total energies of the absorption system, perovskite and molecules, respectively. For the migration of I -anion, a slab model was built on the basic of 2×2×3 supercell and a 2×2×1 gamma (Γ) centered k-space mesh sampling was employed in the first Brillouin zone. Nudged elastic band (NEB) was carried out to examine the energy profiles and eight grids were used to simulate the migration pathway.
