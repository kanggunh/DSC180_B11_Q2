Title: Enhanced Photovoltaic Performance of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells Employing a Cerium Oxide Passivation Layer
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.7%, establishing them as strong candidates for next-generation solar cell technology owing to their unique optoelectronic properties and solution processability. However, defects at grain boundaries and interfaces within the perovskite layer limit both stability and performance. Therefore, this study aims to mitigate these challenges by introducing a thin layer of amorphous cerium oxide (CeO x ) as an inorganic passivation layer, offering advantages over conventional organic passivation layers. A thin amorphous CeO x passivation layer enhances the built-in electric field in the perovskite, improving charge transfer without the increased resistance of thick layers generally used as electron transport layers (ETLs). This approach yielded an inverted PSC with a PCE of 19.30%, securing high performance with photostability. This result highlights the potential of thin CeO x passivation to enhance the efficiency and stability of PSCs.
Introduction Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a next-generation photovoltaic technology, recently achieving an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 26.7%  [1] . This significant milestone underscores their potential as leading next-generation solar cell candidates, primarily owing to their unique optoelectronic properties and the simplicity of their solution-based fabrication. However, despite these advancements, PSCs are prone to form defects at the perovskite grain boundaries and surface. These defects, resulting from the low formation energy of the perovskite, serve as recombination sites, undermining the overall stability and performance of the solar cells  [2, 3] . Therefore, this study aims to address these challenges for successful PSC commercialization. Researchers have addressed the effect of these defects through various strategies, including composition or crystallization control, surface passivation, and interfacial engineering  [4] [5] [6] . Passivation layers are essential for minimizing recombination losses between the perovskite and charge transport layer, enabling high open-circuit voltage (V OC ) in PSCs  [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Organic molecules are generally used to reduce defects and achieve high photovoltaic performance of PSCs  [14, 15] . However, they are highly sensitive to light, moisture, and heat, limiting PSC stability  [16] . Consequently, developing inorganic passivation layers, inherently resistant to environmental stress, offers a promising approach for improving PSC stability. Cerium oxide (CeO x ) offers high chemical stability and suitable bandgap energy (E g ) for charge transfer  [17] [18] [19] [20]  , making it a promising material for optimizing energy alignment, improving charge extraction property, and enhancing PSC stability  [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Therefore, developing a CeO x -based passivation layer for a perovskite light-absorbing layer can enhance charge extraction while passivating defects in PSCs. Here, a thin amorphous CeO x -based passivation layer was introduced between the perovskite layer and electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted PSCs. This layer facilitates electron transfer from the perovskite to the ETL and reduces trap sites by passivating surface defects, achieving a PCE of 19.30%, improved by the reinforced built-in electric field.

Methylammonium bromide (MABr) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) were obtained from Greatcell Solar. Lead iodide (PbI  
 Fabrication of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells Patterned ITO substrates were sequentially cleaned by sonication for 10 min each in detergent solution, deionized water, and IPA. NiO was synthesized for the deposition of a hole transporting layer (HTL), following a previously reported method  [26] . Water-dispersed NiO solution (10 mg/mL) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 170 °C for 10 min. The NiO-coated ITO substrates were then transferred to an N 2 -filled glove box, and Me-4PACz solution in ethanol (2 mg/mL) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Perovskite precursor was prepared by dissolving PbI 2 and PbBr 2 in a DMF:DMSO 4:1 ratio solution at 1.5 M concentration, respectively, and stirred overnight. FAI and MABr were added to each solution at 1.365 M concentration to prepare FAPbI 3 and MAPbBr 3 solutions with a 9% excess of PbX 2 . Finally, the prepared 1.5 M CsI stock solution was mixed with FAPbI 3 and MAPbBr 3 solutions to prepare Cs 0.05 FA 0.8 MA 0.15 Pb(I 0.8 Br 0.2 ) 3 perovskite precursor solution. This solution was spin-coated onto the hole transport layer at 4000 rpm for 35 s, with 0.25 mL of CB applied to the spinning film after 25 s. The deposited film was then annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. After cooling, the PC 61 BM ETL was spin-coated sequentially at 2000 and 4000 rpm for 20 s each, using a 20 mg/mL concentration of PC 61 BM precursor solution. The spin-coated layer was then dried on the hot plate at 100 °C for 5 min. The CeO x powder was dispersed in acetic acid at 5 mg/mL concentration and spin-coated between the perovskite and PC 61 BM layers at 5000 rpm for 20 s and then dried at 100 °C for 10 min. The BCP layer was spin-coated on the PC 61 BM layer at 4000 rpm for 20 s and dried at 100 °C for 1 min. Finally, a 100 nm thick Ag electrode was deposited using a thermal evaporator. For space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements, a SnO 2 layer was deposited on the ITO substrates instead of the HTLs by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing on a hot plate at 150 °C for 1 h. 
 Characterization Film morphologies and surface potential energy were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Verios G4 UC, FEI) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM, XE-100, Park Systems). The optical properties of the thin films were assessed using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, Theta probe base system, Thermo Fisher Scientific Co.) and a UV-Vis spectrometer (UV-2600i, Shimadzu). The absorption coefficient (α) for direct bandgap semiconductors near the band edge was calculated using the formula αhν = A(hν-E g ) 2 , where A is the proportionality constant, hν denotes the photon energy, and E g is the optical bandgap energy. Specifically, E g was estimated by extrapolating the tangent line to the plotted curve. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were obtained using a Fluoromax-4 spectrometer (iHR320, HORIBA Scientific) with a 463 nm excitation wavelength to determine the PL maximum and lifetime of the perovskite film. Capacitance-voltage measurements were conducted at a fixed frequency (1 kHz) under dark conditions using an SP-300 (BioLogic). The current density-voltage (J -V) curve and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) characteristics of the devices were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter under a Xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Newport 91160 s, AAA class). A Silicon solar cell calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) was used to adjust the light intensity to AM 1.5G 1 sun conditions (100 mW•cm -2 ). The voltage was swept at a 20 mV rate with a 20 ms delay during the reverse sweeping direction from 1.4 V to -0.1 V. The devices were measured using a SUS304 aperture with an area of 0.09 cm 2 . 
 Results and Discussion We prepared a pristine inverted PSC with the following configuration: indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent electrode/ NiO/Me-4PACz/Cs 0.05 MA 0.15 FA 0.8 Pb(I 0.8 Br 0.2 ) 3 /PC 61 BM/ silver (Ag) top electrode. To introduce the CeO x passivation layer, CeO x powder was dispersed in acetic acid and deposited between the perovskite layer and the PC 61 BM ETL through a solution process. Figure  1a  presents a schematic diagram of an inverted PSC incorporating a CeO x layer. The structure of the inverted PSC with CeO x was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), revealing the CeO x thin film positioned between the perovskite and PC 61 BM layer. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed to confirm that the CeO x layer possesses an appropriate energy level for extracting charges from the perovskite. Figure  1b  shows the resulting band diagram for the CeO x layer-deposited inverted PSCs. The Cs 0.05 MA 0.15 FA 0.8 Pb(I 0.8 Br 0.2 ) 3 perovskite has a 1.68 eV E g . The CeO x layer exhibits a conduction band minimum (CBM) of -4.0 eV and a valence band maximum (VBM) of -7.5 eV, which is suitable for extracting light-generated electrons from the perovskite. We assessed the current-voltage (J -V) characteristics of the PSCs with and without the CeO x passivation layer, respectively. Figure  1c  shows the incorporating the CeO x layer, PSC demonstrated improved photoelectric properties compared to that of the pristine inverted PSC, achieving a PCE of 19.30% (V OC = 1.17 V, short-circuit current density (J SC ) = 20.41 mA/cm 2 , and fill factor (FF) = 81.08%). By contrast, the pristine inverted PSC exhibited a PCE of 17.63%, with a V OC of 1.11 V, J SC of 20.08 mA/cm 2 , and FF of 79.37%. The CeO x layer-deposited PSCs showed improved photovoltaic performance, particularly with an increased V OC, compared to that of the pristine inverted PSCs. These findings indicate that the successful incorporation of a CeO x layer into inverted PSCs structure can significantly enhance the PCE with optimized energy level alignment. To determine the cause of the increased V OC related to the CeO x layer, we used Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to analyze the surface potentials of both the pristine perovskite thin film and the CeO x layer-deposited perovskite thin film (Fig.  2a ). The pristine perovskite film exhibited a downward shift in surface potential, while the CeO x layerdeposited perovskite film showed an upward shift compared to that of the biased tip. This increase in surface potential indicates that the Fermi level (E F ) is positioned closer to the CBM  [27] . In Fig.  2b , we also plotted the potential Figure  2c  illustrates the energy level diagram of the gradient junction as a function of the CeO x passivation layer. The surface potential upward shift observed in the KPFM measurement reflects a reduced energy level difference between the E F and CBM. The amorphous CeO x facilitates the formation of a gradient homo-junction in the CeO x layer-deposited perovskite film  [28] [29] [30] , enhancing electron extraction at the interface by lowering the work function (WF)  [31] . This reduced WF minimizes the energy barrier for electron transfer from the perovskite to the PC 61 BM layer, thereby increasing the V OC of PSCs. Moreover, the CeO x layer reinforces the built-in electric field at the perovskite-ETL junction, aiding the release of trapped charge carriers. This reinforced electric field promotes efficient electron-hole separation, boosting charge transfer and reducing non-radiative recombination losses  [32] . The WF reduction and enhanced electric field at the interface improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs incorporating CeO x layers. We further examined the effect of reinforced built-in electric field on the charge carrier transfer behavior in PSCs with CeO x layer, by performing the space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurement (Fig.  3a ). Based on slope changes, we categorized the data into three distinct regions: slope 1 signifies the ohmic region (I ∝ V) at low voltages, slope 2 represents the Child region (I ∝ V 2 ), and slope 3 indicates the trap-filled limit (TFL) region (I ∝ V 3 ). The J -V curves of both the CeO x layer-deposited and pristine perovskite film exhibit ohmic behavior at low voltages, transitioning to TFL behavior at higher voltages. To quantitatively determine the V TFL behavior in perovskite films with CeO x layer, trap density was calculated using the Mott-Gurney law Eq. (  1 ): where N trap is the trap density, q is the elemental charge (1.6 × 10 -19 C), ε is the average relative dielectric constant, ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, and L is the perovskite film thickness  [33] . Calculated trap densities for pristine and CeO x layer-deposited perovskite film were 1.12 × 10 16 cm -3 and 5.85 × 10 15 cm -3 , respectively. The lower N trap and higher current density in the CeO x layer-based perovskite film compared to that in the pristine perovskite film indicate that the CeO x layer effectively passivates surface defects, enabling rapid charge carrier transfer. To further verify carrier extraction at the CeO x -perovskite layer interface, we conducted steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements with substrate-side excitation. The perovskite and PC 61 BM ETL were deposited on a glass substrate, with and without a CeO x layer. Figure  3b  shows that the CeO x layer-deposited perovskite film exhibited a PL peak around 770 nm with a reduced intensity compared to that of the pristine perovskite film. This indicates that the CeO x layer facilitates charge extraction from the perovskite layer. (1) N trap = 2⋅ 0 ⋅ ⋅V TFL q⋅L 2 In addition, we analyzed detailed exciton dynamics through time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay measurements, calculating the PL decay lifetimes of pristine and CeO x layerdeposited perovskite films (Fig.  3c ). A bi-exponential model was applied to fit the TRPL spectra, calculating lifetime (τ i and τ avg ) and decay amplitude values (A i ) (Table  1 ). The τ i and τ avg values were obtained from Eq. (  2 ) and Eq. (  3 ). Depositing the CeO x layer on the perovskite thin film decreased the average PL lifetime (τ avg ) from 2.27 µs to 1.60 µs, indicating rapid extraction of photoexcited excitons in the perovskite layer. Therefore, non-radiative recombination and surface trap states were suppressed, which are consistent with the SCLC results. To examine the effect of the CeO x layer on the depletion region, capacitance -voltage measurements were conducted to plot Mott -Schottky curves (Fig.  4a ). The CeO x layerdeposited device exhibited a higher built-in potential (V bi ) than that of the pristine device, indicated by a 0.1 V increase in the tangent line intercept. This higher V bi value demonstrates a broader depletion region width (W D ) in the CeO x layer-deposited PSCs, facilitating enhanced electron-hole pair separation through the reinforced built-in electric field  [34, 35] . The excellent dielectric properties of the CeO x layer facilitate a reduction in electron-hole binding energy, enabling efficient electron extraction with minimized charge accumulation  [30, [36] [37] [38] . The combination of the enhanced charge extraction and electric field induces efficient electron transfer, lowers trap density, and reduces non-radiative recombination. To further evaluate the effect of the CeO x layer on the photoelectric conversion of PSCs, the incident-photon-to-charge (2)  conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were conducted (Fig.  4b ). PSCs with the CeO x layer exhibited increased external quantum efficiency (EQE) across the entire wavelength range, attributed to the reduced trap density and enhanced built-in electric field owing to the passivation effect on the perovskite layer. The integrated J SC , derived from IPCE curves, was 19.15 mA/cm 2 for pristine PSCs and 20.09 mA/cm 2 for CeO x layer-deposited PSCs, highlighting improved electron extraction property of the CeO x layer. To assess the role of the CeO x layer in enhancing PSC stability, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) measurements were conducted. The unencapsulated CeO x layer-deposited PSC was exposed to AM 1.5 G illumination under constant bias, demonstrating consistent photostability attributed to the presence of the CeO x layer (Fig.  4c ). The CeO x layer effectively passivates trap states and reduces non-radiative recombination, enabling the PSCs to maintain reliable power output throughout the test duration.

 Conclusion Embedding an inorganic CeO x passivation layer between the perovskite light-absorbing layer and the PC 61 BM ETL in PSCs significantly enhanced PCE and ensured consistent photostability. The CeO x layer reinforced the built-in electric field within the perovskite-ETL interface, facilitating more efficient electron transfer to the ETL while reducing trap-induced non-radiative recombination. These combined effects improved photovoltaic performance, underscoring the potential of the inorganic CeO x layer as an effective passivation material for stable, high-performance PSCs.
