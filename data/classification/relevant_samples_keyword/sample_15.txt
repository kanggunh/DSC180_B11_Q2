Title: Buried Interface Passivation of Sn-Pb Narrow-Bandgap Perovskite for Highly Efficient All-Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells
All-perovskite tandem solar cells (ATSCs) present a remarkable opportunity to overcome the Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit of single-junction solar cells. However, the stability of ATSCs significantly lags that of their pure Pb-based single-junction counterparts. Recent studies have identified that the widely used poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole transport layer in narrow-bandgap (NBG) tin-lead (Sn-Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hinders the efficiency and stability. Herein, a patching strategy to optimize the interface between perovskite and PEDOT:PSS is proposed. Both theoretical and experimental studies reveal that PenA þ and Ac À can decrease defect states at the interface and strengthen the binding between PEDOT:PSS and Sn-Pb perovskite. Furthermore, the pentylammonium acetate (PenAAc) interlayer improves carrier extraction and suppresses the oxidation of Sn 2þ to Sn 4þ . With the PenAAc buried layer, the fabricated NBG PSCs obtain an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.86%, along with significantly enhanced device stability. By integrating the buried passivated NBG Sn-Pb perovskite with a 1.75 eV wide-bandgap PSC, the two-terminal ATSC achieves a PCE of 26.54%. This work provides a valuable approach to fabricate efficient and stable NBG PSCs.
Introduction Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most promising thin-film photovoltaics (PVs) due to their superior optoelectronic properties, such as ultra-long carrier diffusion lengths, long-span bandgaps (E g ), and rapidly evolving efficiencies.  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  Currently, single-junction PSCs based on pure-lead have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.1%, which is close to the Shockley-Queisser (S-Q) efficiency limit.  [6]  Stacking perovskites with different bandgaps to make all-perovskite tandem solar cells (ATSCs) is an effective method to overcome the S-Q limit.  [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17]  Undoubtedly, solution processing and less energy-consumption manufacturing processes make ATSCs a highly attractive PV technology, leading to the development of a sustainable, carbon-neutral society. Over the past few years, the highest certified efficiency of ATSCs has increased to 29.1%, significantly surpassing that of single-junction devices. However, the stability of ATSCs is inferior to that of their pure Pb-based counterparts. Recent studies have shown that the limited stability of ATSCs is largely due to the relatively poor light stability of tin-lead (Sn-Pb) narrowbandgap (NBG) perovskite subcells.  Currently, the hole transport layer (HTL) widely used in Sn-Pb PSCs is poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). This HTL offers superior properties, including better wettability for Sn-Pb perovskite film deposition and more matched energy levels for charge extraction. However, the undesirable corrosive and hygroscopic properties of PEDOT: PSS accelerate the degradation of perovskite layer. The quality of buried PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface has a direct influence on the Sn-Pb mixed perovskite. For a long time, inorganic HTLs, organic small-molecule HTLs, and polymer HTLs were studied to replace PEDOT:PSS in Sn-Pb PSCs. For example, the inorganic nickel oxide (NiO x ) has been extensively studied.  [31, 39]  However, the PEDOT:PSS HTL still holds an irreplaceable position for Sn-Pb PSCs. To tackle this problem, herein, we employed pentylammonium acetate (PenAAc) as an insertion layer between the Sn-Pb perovskite layer and the PEDOT:PSS HTL to fabricate highly efficient and stable ATSCs.  [40]  The PenAAc interfacial layer enhanced the bonding energy of the PEDOT:PSS/ perovskite interface and passivated interfacial traps.  [41]  Consequently, the champion PCE of fabricated Sn-Pb NBG PSCs, utilizing the PenAAc interlayer with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PenAAc/Sn-Pb perovskite/C 60 /BCP/Ag, was improved from 17.54% to 21.86%. After 1000 h of continuous illumination under one-sun illumination in N 2 glovebox (≈25 °C), the unencapsulated PSCs with the PenAAc interlayer retained 90% of its initial efficiency, while the control device only retained 50%. Furthermore, by integrating the Sn-Pb NBG with a 1.75 eV wide-bandgap (WBG), we fabricated two-terminal ATSCs with a PCE of 26.54%. 
 Results and Discussion 
 Sn-Pb NBG PSCs Performance The Sn-Pb NBG PSCs with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ Cs 0.1 MA 0.3 FA 0.6 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 /C 60 /BCP/Ag were fabricated to evaluate the effect of PenAAc interlayer on improving the device performance. The current density-voltage ( J-V ) curves (Figure  1a ) showed the control PSCs (without the PenAAc layer) and w/PenAAc PSCs (with the PenAAc layer) measured under a standard AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm À2 ). For the control device, we measured a PCE of 17.31% in forward-scan with an open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 0.783 V, a short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 31.70 mA cm À2 , a fill factor (FF) of 69.72%, and a PCE of 17.54% in reverse-scan with a V OC of 0.782 V, J SC of 31.76 mA cm À2 , an FF of 70.62%, and hysteresis index (HI) of 0.013 (HI = (PCE Reverse -PCE Forward )/PCE Reverse ). Compared with the control PSCs, the best PenAAc-modified device achieved a PCE of 21.74% in forward-scan (V OC : 0.851 V, J SC : 32.40 mA cm À2 , FF: 78.84%) and 21.86% in reverse-scan (V OC : 0.854 V, J SC : 32.39 mA cm À2 , FF: 79.02%) and with an HI of 0.005. It is important to emphasize that the w/PenAAc device exhibits much lower hysteresis than the control device, confirming the improved charge transport at the Sn-Pb perovskite/HTL interface. The steady-state power output (SPO) increased from 16.70% to 21.84% with the introduction of the PenAAc interlayer (Figure  1b ). Moreover, the J SC values extracted from the J-V measurements are within 5% of the corresponding integrated J SC values from the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) (Figure  1c ). The statistical box plots of the PCE parameters shown in Figure  1d  indicate that the introduction of PenAAc also improved the reproducibility of the devices. The dark J-V curves shown in Figure  1e  illustrated that the PenAAc-modified device had a higher shunt resistance than the control device, which means a smaller leakage current in PSCs. Mott-Schottky measurements (Figure  1f  ) revealed a built-in potential (V bi ) of 0.54 V for the control device and 0.62 V for the w/PenAAc device, confirming the enhanced charge transport and reduced recombination with the buried interlayer PenAAc. We also carried out the light intensitydependent V OC measurements of the devices to explore the effect of PenAAc on reducing charge recombination. As shown in Figure  1g , the ideality factor (n) is approximately 1.93 kT q À1 for the control device and 1.54 kT q À1 for the PenAAc-modified device. A lower n for PenAAc represents an ameliorated interface and less recombination. In addition, the long-term operational stability of the Sn-Pb PSCs was tested under continuous illumination at 100 mW cm À2 , at room temperature in a N 2 glove box for 1000 h. As shown in Figure  1h , the PenAAc-modified device still maintained an efficiency greater than 90% of its initial state, but only retained 50% of its efficiency for the control device. 
 Mechanism To understand the mechanism of PenAAc interlayer on improving the Sn-Pb NBG PSCs performance, we utilized CP2K to carry out density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We first calculated the bonding energy of PEDOT:PSS/perovskite and PEDOT:PSS/PenAAc/perovskite interface. As shown in Figure  S1 , Supporting Information, with the introduction of PenAAc, the adsorption energy (E b ) was increased from À0.783 eV (control) to À0.902 eV (w/PenAAc), indicating an enhanced interface robustness. The increased interface bonding is beneficial for reducing the possibility of forming Sn 4þ or other uncoordinated dangling bonds and improving the interface quality. Besides interface bonding, the positive and negative electronegative groups (-NH 3þ and -COO À (-Ac À )) in PenAAc could also form chemical interactions with the perovskite via hydrogen bond (Figure  S2 , Supporting Information). To better understand this chemical interaction, we categorized the buried interface into two models: FA-I terminated surface and Sn-I terminated surface. In the first model, when the surface terminated is FA-I, PenAAc formed acceptor-type (donor-type) passivation via the hydrogen bond FA-H-Ac. Additionally, the passivation effect of PenAAc on the I vacancy was clearly visible on the density of states (DOS) plots (Figure  2a-c ). In the second model, Ac À and undercoordinated Sn 2þ formed a bond through the Sn-Ac bond. Since the Sn-Ac bond formed, the donor-type defects were passivated. This assumption was supported by the X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements in Figure  2d ,e. PenAAc-modified film exhibited a shift toward a higher binding energy of the Pb 4f peaks and discovered a significant decrease of Sn 4þ ratios in Sn 3 d (Table  S1 , Supporting Information). The decrease of Sn 4þ content indicated that the insertion of PenAAc layer reduced the amount of uncoordinated Sn 2þ on the surface, resulting in the formation of Sn-Ac bonds. Moreover, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Figure  2f  ) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (Figure  S3 , Supporting Information) provided a consistent result. We observed a shift in the position of the N-H vibrational peak from 3444.2 cm À1 for the control films to 3463.5 cm À1 for the PenAAc-modified film, indicating the presence of Lewis acidbase interactions. 
 Optoelectronic Properties In addition, the absorption spectra (UV-vis) indicated that PenAAc interlayer did not change the bandgaps of the Sn-Pb perovskite (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information). Top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information) images show the morphology of perovskite films deposited on substrates with or without PenAAc modification. As shown in Figure  3a , with the introduction of the proper concentration (5 mmol L À1 ) of PenAAc, the XRD intensities of the diffraction peaks are greatly enhanced, implying that the PenAAc interlayer improved the crystallinity. To further confirm the improved film quality with PenAAc, we measured the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) (Figure  3b ) of the ITO/PEDTO:PSS/Sn-Pb perovskite with and without PenAAc interlayer. The molar concentrations of PenAAc were 0, 2, 5, 8 and 10 mmol L À1 in this measurement. The highest PLQY (2.4%) was achieved when the PenAAc concentration was 5 mmol L À1 , which was consistent with the XRD results in Figure  3a  and the distribution of PCE in Figure  S6 , Supporting Information. To further explore the influence of PenAAc on the photoelectric properties of the Sn-Pb, we conducted space-charge-limitedcurrent measurements using hole-only devices (Figure  S7 , Supporting Information). The structure of the hole-only devices is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Sn-Pb perovskite/PTAA/Ag. We obtained trap-filled-limited (V TFL ) results of 0.33 V for the control device and 0.15 V for the PenAAc-modified device. The trap density (N trap ) of the perovskite film was calculated according to Eq. (  1 ):  N trap ¼ 2ε 0 εV TFL eL 2 (1) where L is the perovskite film thickness (≈850 nm), V TFL is the trap-filling voltage, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the Sn-Pb perovskite, ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, e is the elementary charge of the electron; the proportional relationship is clear. Using the formula N trap , we calculated that N trap is 1.55 Â 10 15 for the control and 7.07 Â 10 14 cm À3 for the PenAAc-passivated devices. We performed time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) (Figure  3c ) on Sn-Pb perovskite with PEDOT:PSS HTL to study the impact of PenAAc interlayer on carrier transport dynamics. With the insertion of PenAAc, the carrier lifetime of the w/PenAAc (26 ns) is much shorter than the control (108 ns), indicating the faster charge-carrier transfer from perovskite to PEDOT:PSS (Table  S1 , Supporting Information). The contact angles were measured to characterize the infiltration of the substrate. As shown in Figure  S8 , Supporting Information, the perovskite precursor contact angle of PEDOT:PSS films decreases from 55.91°to 31.57°with the addition of the PenAAc interlayer. The decreased contact angle is beneficial for the deposition of perovskite films, especially for Sn-Pb perovskites.    
 ATSCs Finally, we fabricated two-terminal ATSCs by integrating the Sn-Pb NBG perovskite with a 1.75 eV WBG.  [42, 43]  The crosssectional SEM image of the ATSC showed that all layers are well obvious and well isolated from each other (Figure  4a ). The sharp and smooth interfaces in WBG and NBG perovskites are beneficial for charge carriers transport. The WBG PSCs exhibited a V OC of 1.31 V, a J SC of 18.99 mA cm À2 , and an FF of 82.09%, yielding a PCE of 20.42% in reverse-scan (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information). Figure  4b  shows the J-V curves of the champion ATSCs. The PCE under the reverse-scan was 26.54% (V OC : 2.11 V, J SC : 15.91 mA cm À2 , FF: 79.05%), while that was 26.26% under forward-scan (V OC : 2.11 V, J SC : 16.03 mA cm À2 , FF: 77.64%). The hysteresis was negligible between the reverse and forward scans. The PCE measured from the J-V curve is consistent with the stable power output PCE of 26.33% (Figure  4c ). 
 Conclusion In this work, we have introduced a novel molecule, PenAAc, which could enhance the bonding energy between perovskite and PEDOT:PSS HTL, thus reducing the possibility of forming Sn 4þ or other dangling bonds at the interface. Besides interface bonding, both theoretical and experimental studies showed that the positive and negative electronegative groups (-NH 3þ and -COO À (-Ac À )) in PenAAc could also form chemical interactions with perovskite via hydrogen bonds. This chemical interaction could passivate traps at the interface. The PCE of the NBG PSCs was significantly improved from 17.54% to 21.86%. Furthermore, by integrating the Sn-Pb NBG with a 1.75 eV WBG, the fabricated two-terminal ATSCs achieved a PCE of 26.54%. Our work highlights the potential for further development of efficient and stable all-perovskite tandem devices without getting rid of PEDOT:PSS HTL.   Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

Title: Supporting Information Buried Interface Passivation of Sn-Pb Narrow-Bandgap Perovskite for Highly Efficient All-Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells
Pentylammonium acetate (PenAAc, 99.5%), cesium iodide (CsI, 99.99%), methylammonium iodide (MAI, 99.5%), formamidine iodide (FAI, 99.5%), lead bromine (PbBr2, 99.99%), C60 (99%), PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083) and BCP (99.5%) were purchased from the Xi'an p-OLED Crop. Lead iodide (PbI2, 99.99%) and [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz, >99.0%) were purchased from TCI. Other chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise notes. All of the purchased chemicals were used directly as received with no purification. 1.2 Device Fabrication 1.2.1 Single-junction Solar Cells: We purchased indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass from Yingkou Youxuan Commercial & Trading Co., Ltd. During the cleaning process, we used detergent, deionized water, and isopropanol (IPA) for 10 min with an ultrasonic cleaner. Before the process of spin coating PEDOT:PSS, the cleaned ITO glass was treated with UV-ozone for 18 min and cooled. PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083) was deposited on the precleaned substrates at a spin speed of 3888 rpm for 30 s. The substrates were annealed at 130 ℃ for 20 min. For the PenAAc-modified processing, PenAAc was dissolved in IPA and spin-coated on PEDOT:PSS at 3500 rpm for 30 s. In addition, we treated the control with pure IPA in the same way. The perovskite precursor was dissolved in a mixture of DMF and DMSO (volume ratio of 4:1) with the chemical formula FA0.6MA0.3Cs0.1Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 (1.8 M). The precursor solution was spin-coated on the substrate using a two-step procedure (1000 rpm for 10 s and 4000 rpm for 40 s), and dripped with 450 μL of anti-solvent chlorobenzene at 15 s in the second step. Then, we
quickly put the sample to hotplate at 100 °C for 10 min for annealing. At the end, we transferred the sample to a vacuum chamber for layer deposition of C60 (~25 nm), BCP (~7 nm), and Ag (~100 nm) at a high vacuum degree (< 9.0×10 -4 Pa) with rates of 0.1, 0.2, and 1 A s -1 , respectively. 1.2.2 All-Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells: Me-4PACz (0.5 mg/mL) was first spin-coated on ITO substrates at 3,000 rpm for 30 s and annealed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 10 min. After cooling, the substrates were immediately transferred to the glovebox. The precursor solution (1.2 M) of FA0.9MA0.05Cs0.05Pb(I0.65B0.35)3 was dissolved in mixed solvents of DMF and DMSO (volume ratio of 4:1). The precursor solution was stirred for 2 h at 20 ℃ and then filtered through 0.22-μm PTFE membrane before use. Wide-bandgap perovskite films were deposited on top of Me-4PACz via a two-step procedure (1500 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 40 s), with 200 μL of chlorobenzene antisolvent added dropwise after 20 s of the second step. The substrates were then transferred onto a hotplate and heated at 100 ℃ for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were transferred to the evaporation system. Then, C60 (~25 nm) was deposited on the top of the perovskite by thermal evaporation (Wuhan PDVACUUM Technologies Co.,Ltd.). Next, the substrates were transferred to an atomic layer deposition (ALD) system (Jiaxing KEMICRO Electronic Equipment Co.,Ltd.) to deposit 20 nm SnO2 at 100 ℃. After ALD, the substrates were transferred to a thermal evaporation system to deposit a 0.8 nm layer of Au cluster on SnO2. The PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated on the top of the front cell and annealed in air at 130 ℃ for 30 min. After cooling, the substrates were immediately transferred to a N2 glovebox for the deposition of a narrow-bandgap layer. Finally, C60 (~25 nm), BCP (~7 nm), and Ag (~100 nm) layers were thermally deposited in a vacuum chamber (< 9.0×10 -4 Pa) with rates of 0.1, 0.2, and 1 A s -1 , respectively. 
 Characterizations The perovskite films were characterized by X-ray diffration (XRD, D8 Advance), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fischer, ESCALAB Xiþ), photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY, Enlitech) and Raman spectroscopy (LabRAM Odyssey). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were captured using Hitachi SU8010 field-emission scanning electron microscope. UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (LambDA 750 S, PerkinElmer). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed with a Nicolet 6700 instrument. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was measured using excitation with a 640 nm light pulse from a Delta Flex Fluorescence Lifetime System (Horiba Scientific Com., Japan). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices were measured using a solar cell quantum-efficiency measurement system. Urbach energy was measured by an Enli Tech instrument. The thickness of the perovskite films was measured by Filmetrics. The current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the devices were measured by a Keithley 2450 source meter in the room environment (~25 ℃, ~25% RH). The light source was a solar simulator (Oriel 94023 A, 300 W) with an AM of 1.5G. The intensity of the light was 100 mW cm -2 , as calibrated by a standard silicon reference solar cell (Oriel, VLSI standards). All the devices were tested using a black metal aperture with a defined active area of 0.058 cm 2 .  Table1.
