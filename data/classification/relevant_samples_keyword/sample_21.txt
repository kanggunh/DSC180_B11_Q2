Title: Synergetic Porous Insulating and Passivation Layer Design for High-Efficiency and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells
Perovskite solar cells have attracted extensive attention due to their simple manufacturing process and high efficiency. However, defects between the perovskite and hole transport layer can lead to nonradiative recombination of photogenerated carriers and severe ion migration, which accelerates the degradation of such devices. Here, we chose to deposit an Al 2 O 3 porous insulating layer on the surface of the perovskite film. At the same time, we chose to introduce NMABr (1-Naphthylmethylamine Bromide) into Al 2 O 3 as a modifier to overcome the issue that applying Al 2 O 3 alone may hinder interfacial carrier transport due to the uncontrolled morphology. The addition of NMABr not only has a passivation effect but also changes the morphology of the Al 2 O 3 layer. Under the synergistic effect of Al 2 O 3 and NMABr, a porous insulating contact layer is better formed, which is conducive to carrier transport and improves the stability and efficiency.
P erovskite solar cells (PSCs) are highly attractive for future commercialization due to their tunable bandgap, abundant raw materials, easy synthesis, and compatibility with various perovskite-based tandem devices.  [1] [2] [3]  However, if they are to be further commercialized, long-term stability is an issue that must be addressed. This problem is determined by the intrinsic properties of the perovskite material on the one hand  [4] [5] [6]  and by the uncontrolled interfacial reaction between the perovskite layer and its adjacent charge transport layer/metal electrode in the device, on the other hand.  [7] [8] [9]  The field of perovskites has accumulated various strategies to optimize the synthesis of perovskite materials, including their structure, crystallinity, and other optoelectronic properties.  [10] [11] [12]  Thus, in order to guarantee future advancements in commercialization of PSCs, interface and surface modification are essential to ensure further developments in improving device stability.  [13] [14] [15] [16]  In heterojunctions, proper energy level alignment is essential for charge transfer and prevents hole-electron recombination in the device, resulting in better photovoltaic performance. The wide bandgap layer formed by two-dimensional (2D) perovskites helps to promote hole extraction, hinder electron transfer, and reduce the possibility of hole-electron recombination,  17  which provides a strategy to solve the above problems. In addition, 2D perovskites are hydrophobic and photostable,  [18] [19] [20]  which make 2D perovskites potentially important in optimizing the performance of photovoltaic devices. In 2022, Zhang et al. used DMePDAI 2 to modify the surface layer of a two-dimensional DJ phase to improve PSC performance.  21  In 2022, Azmi et al. deactivated the trap state and inhibited ion migration by customizing the number of octahedral inorganic sheets in the two-dimensional perovskite (2DP) passivation layer for the three-dimensional perovskite active layer, which is formed by ammonium iodide molecules at the electron-selective interface.  22  In 2023, Karabag et al. synthesized a series of phenylethylammonium (PEA + ) and its derivatives and found that the substitution position had a more pronounced effect on device performance than the identity of halogens, providing guidance for understanding the effect of various large organic cations on the performance and stability of 3D/2D PSCs.  23  In 2024, Ma et al. employed a bimolecular treatment method with phenylmethylammonium iodide (PMAI) and octylammonium iodide (OAI) as comodifiers for a bimolecular kinetic competitive adsorption strategy that effectively prevented the transition of three-dimensional perovskite layers to low-dimensional surface structures.  24  Another strategy to improve the stability of the device is to introduce a metal oxide layer at the appropriate interface of the perovskite solar cell. This method has been extensively studied and reported, and its effectiveness has been confirmed to be of great significance in improving the stability of PSCs. In 2020, Choi et al. reported a novel method involving the infiltration of metal oxide nanoparticles into hole transport materials to enhance the device stability. Unlike traditional methods to prevent thermal decomposition of perovskites, this method is designed to prevent loss of efficiency by dissipating heat buildup within the device.  25  In 2023, Choi et al. deposited alumina (AlOx) on OAI through an atomic layer to take advantage of the benefits of organohalide salts without creating undesirable defects.  26  Peng et al. used alumina to fabricate porous insulator contact (PIC) perovskite solar cells, which reduced the nonradiative recombination of perovskite at HTL contact through a combination of reduced contact area and passivation, a design that achieved up to 25.5% efficiency in p-i-n devices.  27  In 2024, Jiao et al. prepared an ultrathin Al 2 O 3 layer on the surface of perovskite by in situ hydrolysis and condensation of aluminum triisopropanol (ATIP) by solution treatment at room temperature, which prevented water from entering and inhibited iodine ion migration, and greatly improved its thermal and wet stability.  28  On this basis, we chose to deposit an Al 2 O 3 porous insulating layer on the surface of the perovskite film. Al 2 O 3 can induce the self-healing of perovskites and inhibit the migration of ions to the hole transport layer under light. In addition, Al 2 O 3 can form a porous insulating layer, which reduces the nonradiative recombination at the contact area of the hole transport layer by reducing the contact area between the perovskite and the hole transport layer. At the same time, 1-naphthalene methylammonium bromide (NMABr) was introduced into Al 2 O 3 as a modifier because NMABr was able to grow a very thin layer of 2D perovskite in situ in 3D perovskite, forming 2D/3D heterojunctions. As a passivation material, it can reduce the number of surface defects and remove residual PbI 2 on the surface, while the hydrophobic nature of the naphthalene moiety in NMABr can enhance the moisture resistance of perovskite films. Under the synergistic effect of Al 2 O 3 and NMABr, a porous insulating contact layer is better formed, and the defects are passivated, while the stability and efficiency are improved. We investigated the effect of using different passivators (Al 2 O 3 , NMABr, and a mixture of NMABr+Al 2 O 3 ) on perovskite films by a two-step sequential method. First, the surface morphology of the perovskite films with the above variables was analyzed by SEM. As shown in Figure  S1 , the NMABr+Al 2 O 3 passivation did not significantly change the surface morphology of the perovskite film compared to the original sample, while the perovskite film passivated by NMABr alone did not have the original grain characteristics; this is because NMABr readily reacts with residual PbI 2 on the surface of perovskite films to form low-dimensional perovskites. The surface of the Al 2 O 3 -treated perovskite film is covered with a large number of alumina nanoparticles, which hinders carrier transport, and the aggregation and growth of Al 2 O 3 on the rough surface of the perovskite may not be in close contact with the perovskite surface as on the flat surface; there is a gap between the Al 2 O 3 and the perovskite surface, which invalidates the passivation effect.  27  As shown in Figure  1 , it is clear that the control film has an uneven and rough surface, which reduces shunt resistance and also contains a large number of nonradiative recombination centers. Fortunately, the NMABr+Al 2 O 3 modified perovskite film has an island-like morphology (marked with red coils),  28  because alumina and NMABr grow in situ together on the surface of the 3D perovskite, which helps the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer to better contact each other. In addition, a homogeneously dense, pinhole-free, larger-grained perovskite thin film was obtained by NMABr+Al 2 O 3 modification, as shown in Figure  S2 . The SEM results show that the modification of the passivated material can effectively reduce the grain boundaries in the perovskite film, reducing the nonradiative recombination of carriers. In order to further explore the interaction between the perovskite surface and the post-treated material, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed to observe the vibrational changes in chemical bonds and coordination sites. Figure  2 (a) shows that the peak intensity at 1711 cm -1 corresponds to the Cï¿½N tensile vibration of the formamide (FA) cation. After treatment with NMABr and NMABr+Al 2 O 3 , respectively, the peak at 1711 cm -1 showed a slight increase in intensity compared to that of the control film. In addition, in the FTIR results, it was found that the N-H tensile vibration peaks (3407 and 3269 cm -1 ), as shown in Figure  2 (b), and the C-H bending vibration peak (1352 cm -1 ) derived from FA shifted toward higher wavenumbers (namely, 3407 cm -1 to 3411 cm -1 , 3269 cm -1 to 3227, and 1352 cm -1 to 1357 cm -1 ), as shown in Figure  2(a) . The displacement of the C-H bending vibration peak may be due to the reaction between NMABr and FAI, and the exchange of small ion Br + with large ion I -, which promotes ion exchange between NMA + and FA + , resulting in the shift of the C-H peak. At the same time, by anchoring the amino group (-NH 2 ) in NMABr to the surface of the perovskite crystal nucleus or forming an intermediate phase based on Pb-N bonding, the position of the N-H tensile vibration peak changes. To further investigate the effect of the passivation layer on the perovskite layer, we also characterized it by XPS. As shown in Figure  2 (c), The core-level XPS spectra of Pb 4f electrons High-quality thin films and grain boundary passivation will help reduce nonradiative recombination. To verify this, we performed PL and TRPL measurements on these corresponding perovskite films, respectively. As shown in Figure  3 (a), the resulting surface-treated perovskite films all showed enhanced luminescence intensities compared to the original films, indicating that the nonradiative defects of the NMABr+Al 2 O 3 surface treated perovskite films were effectively suppressed. The TRPL decay is then measured to study the carrier lifetime within the perovskite layer, as shown in Figure  3(b) . The average carrier lifetime (Ï ave ) can be obtained by using the following equation, where there is a fast decay component (Ï 1 ) and a slow decay component (Ï 2 ).  30   
 = + + A A A A A A ( ) ( ) ave 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 (1) The fitting parameters are listed in Table  S1 . The average lifetimes of NMABr (Ï ave = 0.529 Î¼ s) and Al 2 O 3 (Ï ave = 0.646 Î¼ s) were significantly higher than the original film (Ï ave = 0.355 Î¼ s). Excitingly, the average carrier lifetime was significantly increased after the NMABr+Al 2 O 3 passivation (Ï ave = 1.026 Î¼s). Thus, it is clear that the NMABr+Al 2 O 3 treatment is more effective than the NMABr treatment in achieving surface defect passivation. In addition, we performed PL and TRPL measurements of the perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD devices, in the presence of a transport layer, a shorter carrier lifetime means a more efficient carrier transport.  31  As shown in Figure  S3(  To gain a deeper understanding of the effect of thin film passivation on device performance, we fabricated devices with ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/PCBM/Ag structures and calculated trap densities based on space charge limiting current (SCLC) curves in the dark. The defect density N t can be calculated as follows: = N V L 2 q TFL t r 0 2 (2) where Îµ 0 is the vacuum permittivity, Îµ r is the relative permittivity, L is the thickness of the deposited perovskite layer, and q is elementary charge. Evaluating the data in Figure  3 , the V TFL values of the control device, Al 2 O 3 , NMABr, and NMABr+Al 2 O 3 are 0.26, 0.48, 0.23, and 0.21 V, respectively, and correspondingly, using the defect density N t in eq 2, compared to the control device (2.85 Ã 10 12 cm -3 ), the Al 2 O 3based device has a higher trap density of 5.26 Ã 10 12 cm -3 , while the NMABr and NMABr+Al 2 O 3 -based devices have lower trap densities of 2.52 Ã 10 12 cm -3 and 2.3 Ã 10 12 cm -3 , respectively. The results show that the surface defects of the perovskite film are reduced after the addition of the NMABr +Al 2 O 3 layer, which is consistent with the results of PL and TRPL. After evaluating the trap density, recombination loss, and carrier dynamics of perovskite films, the associated transport and recombination resistance in perovskite devices were studied by electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As shown in Figure  4 (a), we set the measurement conditions at a bias potential of 0.7 V under the dark conditions of 10 5 â¼ 0.01 In addition, the NMABr+Al 2 O 3 -treated devices had lower Rct, indicating improved charge transfer resistance and better charge collection due to NMABr+Al 2 O 3 passivation. These results suggest that NMABr+Al 2 O 3 modification does reduce carrier recombination in the perovskite layer and improves carrier transport at the perovskite/HTL interface, which is expected to yield a higher device fill factor. Notably, NMABr +Al 2 O 3 is more effective than NMABr, which is consistent with the results of PL and TRPL. To further understand the effect of the passivation layer on carrier transport behavior, the dark J-V curves of the control and interface-modified devices were characterized, as shown in Figure  4(b) . The dark current densities of the control device, Al 2 O 3 , NMABr, and NMABr +Al 2 O 3 are 2.63 Ã 10 -3 mA/cm 2 , 1.78 Ã 10 -3 mA/cm 2 , 1.08 Ã 10 -3 mA/cm 2 , and 2.20 Ã 10 -4 mA/cm 2 , respectively, and the dark current density of the NMABr+Al 2 O 3 modified perovskite device is an order of magnitude lower than that of the control device. The reduction of the dark current confirms that the modification of NMABr+Al 2 O 3 between the perovskite and the hole transport layer can suppress nonradiative recombination. We study the built-in potential of PSCs by measuring the capacitance-voltage (Mott-Schottky) of the device. By employing the ITO/SnO 2 /PVK/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag structure, the built-in potential values associated with Voc are extracted directly from the X-intercept of the straight line in the curve. The Mott-Schottky curves for the devices before and after passivation are shown in Figure  4 (c), with V bi values of 0.75, 0.74, 0.78, and 0.80 V extracted from intercept 1/C 2 = 0, respectively, from the control device and the Al 2 O 3 , NMABr, and NMABr+Al 2 O 3 modified devices. NMABr+Al 2 O 3 modified devices show higher V bi , suggesting that the introduction of NMABr+Al 2 O 3 helps to increase the output voltage and current of the PSCs. In contrast, the control device and the device with the introduction of aluminum alone exhibit a lower built-in potential and a higher residual charge at the contact interface, which is consistent with the Jsc and Voc trends obtained in the J-V curve. To further characterize these devices, a light intensity dependence test of Voc was performed. The ideal factor can be extracted by analyzing the dependence of Voc on the light intensity, which is also commonly used to evaluate the charge recombination of perovskite solar cells. As shown in Figure  4 (d), the linear model shows the slopes of 0.103, 0.120, 0.098, and 0.073, respectively. The ideal factors of the four devices can be calculated as respectively: 1.72 KT/q, 2.01 KT/q, 1.64 KT/q, and 1.22 KT/q. According to the literature, the Shockley-Read-Hall compound effect is not obvious when the diode ideal factor approaches 1.  32  Among these four devices, the ideal factor of the NMABr +Al 2 O 3 modified device is closest to 1, which indicates that NMABr+Al 2 O 3 suppresses trap composite reorganization at the perovskite/HTL interface, and the NMABr+Al 2 O 3 modified device has the lowest defect density. Figure  5 (a) shows the J-V curves for the control and interface-modified devices with champions PCE (%), Voc (V), Jsc (mA cm -2 ), and FF (%) as shown in Table  1 . The observed improvement in Voc and FF is attributed to the density of trap states that are suppressed. Compared with the control device, the efficiency of the Al 2 O 3 -modified device is reduced due to the voids between Al 2 O 3 and the perovskite surface that can occur and invalidate the effect of contact area reduction and passivation, and the accumulation of excessive alumina nanoparticles will lead to the deterioration of the charge extraction contact. However, the efficiency of NMABr+Al 2 O 3 comodification devices is increased about 2 percentage points, because NMABr can help Al 2 O 3 grow in situ from the perovskite layer to form islanded alumina that helps the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer contact, and the optimized interface can facilitate charge transport to improve the performance during the period. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the control device and the NMABr +Al 2 O 3 interface modification device are shown in Figure  5 (b), with integrated current densities of 24.12 and 24.47 mA cm -2 , respectively, which are in good agreement with the J-V curve values in Figure  5 (a) (difference <5%). In order to verify the repeatability of the performance of perovskite solar cells after passivation, we fabricated and tested the photovoltaic parameters of 10 cells in each of the perovskite devices prepared under different variables and performed statistical distribution; the specific data are shown in Figure  S4 . The experimental results show that the performances of NMABr + Al 2 O 3 are significantly higher than those of other devices, especially the improvement of FF and Voc. Devices based on the NMABr+Al 2 O 3 interface modification are significantly more efficient than other devices, and the average efficiency of the devices exceeds 23%. The increase of V OC and FF may be due to the formation of 2D perovskites on the surface of perovskite films by NMABr, and the passivation of the 2D perovskite reduces the defect density and reduces the nonradiative recombination. Through SCLC testing, it can be seen that the film treated with NMABr shows a lower defect density, and less nonradiative recombination contributes to the improvement of Voc. The increase in FF may be due to the higher Rrec and lower Rct, suggesting that NMABr+Al 2 O 3 modification does reduce carrier recombination in the perovskite layer and improves carrier transport at the perovskite/HTL interface. This shows that the use of NMABr+Al 2 O 3 as a passivation layer can effectively enhance the performance and reliability of the device. To investigate the stability of hybrid PSCs with and without NMABr+Al 2 O 3 , the prepared unencapsulated PSCs were stored in a nitrogen environment, and after 1118 h, the passivated device retained 93% of the initial efficiency, while the control device had only 84% of the initial efficiency, as shown in Figure  S5 . In air with a temperature of 65 Â°C and a relative humidity of 25-35%, tracking the PCE of nonencapsulated devices over time, as shown in Figure  5 (c), after 900 h of storage, the NMABr+Al 2 O 3 passivated PSCs maintained an initial efficiency of more than 85%, while the control device only maintained an initial efficiency of 75% over the same period. In summary, the effect of the passivation material NMABr +Al 2 O 3 on the properties and stability of perovskites is investigated in this paper. Al 2 O 3 is modified by NMABr to grow a porous insulating layer on the surface of the perovskite film while passivating the remaining Pb 2+ on the surface. At the same time, as a passivation material, it can reduce the number of surface defects, remove the residual PbI 2 on the surface, and enhance the moisture resistance of perovskite films by removing residual PbI 2 on the surface. After the introduction of NMABr+Al 2 O 3 between the perovskite and the hole transport layer, the contact between the perovskite and the hole transport layer can be better due to the formation of isolated alumina, thereby reducing the recombination of interfacial electron-hole pairs. The efficiency of the device after passivation with NMABr+Al 2 O 3 is 24.07%. NMABr +Al 2 O 3 passivates perovskite films, thereby improving the dampness and thermal stability of perovskite devices. In air with a temperature of 65 Â°C and a relative humidity of 25-35%, tracking the PCE of nonencapsulated devices over time, after 1000 h of storage, the NMABr+Al 2 O 3 passivated PSCs maintained an initial efficiency of more than 85%.

 a), PL quenching can be clearly observed. As expected, the NMABr+Al 2 O 3treated perovskite films exhibited more pronounced quenching than the other films, suggesting that the NMABr+Al 2 O 3 layer can improve the efficiency of carrier transport and carrier extraction from the perovskite film to the hole-transport layer. The time-resolved photoluminescence curves of the corresponding samples are shown in Figure S3(b), showing the attenuation lifetimes of the four devices. Upon addition of the NMABr+Al 2 O 3 layer, faster TRPL attenuation was observed, suggesting improved interfacial carrier transfer. In addition, the average lifetimes of the control and passivated films (Al 2 O 3 , NMABr, and NMABr+Al 2 O 3 ) were 312.89 449.49, 275.52, and 197.62 ns, respectively. This reduction trend further demonstrates the beneficial effects of NMABr+Al 2 O 3 in promoting efficient carrier transport and inhibiting nonradiative recombination.

Title: Supporting information Synergetic porous insulating and passivation layer design for high-efficiency and stable perovskite solar cells

Experimental section Materials: Cesium iodide (CsI, 99.99%), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.99%), methylammonium iodide(MAI, 99.5%), formamidinium iodide(FAI, 99.5%), 2,2â²,7,7â²-Tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9â²-spiro-bifluorene(Spiro-OMeT AD, 99.5%), Methylamine hydrochloride(MACl, 99.99%), 4-Tert-butylpyridine (t-BP, 96%), bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, 99.9%) were supplied by Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, anhydrous), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%, anhydrous), chlorobenzene (CB, 99.9%, anhydrous) and isopropanol (IPA, 99.99%, anhydrous) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles (15 wt.% in water) were obtained from Alfa-Aesar. Al2O3 dispersion (30nm, 20 wt.% of isopropanol, Macklin) were diluted and used in solar cell manufacturing. Precursor solution preparation: Dilute the SnO2 colloidal dispersion with 1:3 deionized water. Mixed solution of PbI2 precursors (PbI2: CsI= 695.1 mg: 3.9mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of mixed solvent (DMF: DMSO=9:1) and stirred at 70 â for 12h. A mixture of FAI precursors (FAI: MAI: MACl=90 mg:4 mg:9 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml IPA. The Spiro-OMeTAD mixture was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg Spiro-OMeTAD powder in 1 mL CB, and then adding 17.5 Î¼L Li-TFSI solution (520 mg Li-TFSI dissolved in 1 mL acetonitrile). Finally, 28.8 Î¼L TBP was added. Preparation of passivation agent: 5mg of NMABr was added to 1ml of IPA solution, heated and stirred on a 50â magnetic stirrer for 12h, after which 5ul of Al2O3 isopropyl alcohol solution was added to obtain a mixed solution of NMABr and Al2O3. Device fabrication: ITO glass was placed in the stain remover, deionized water and anhydrous ethanol successively for ultrasonic cleaning treatment, each step lasted 20 minutes. The ITO was first dried with nitrogen and then subjected to UV-ozone for 15 minutes. The following is the preparation of perovskite solar devices. First, to prepare the electron transport layer, we choose SnO2 and spin coating the SnO2 precursor solution at 4000 r/min for 20s. The perovskite layer was prepared by two-step spin coating process after annealing in ambient air at 180 â for 20 min. First, the PbI2 precursor mixture was spin-coated on SnO2 for 30s at 1500 r/min, and then annealed for 10s at 70 Â°C in a glove box. Secondly, the FAI precursor mixture was spin coated on PbI2 layer for 30s at 1700 r/min, and then annealed at 150 â in ambient air (30%~40% RH) for 15min. For the treatment of NMABr and Al2O3, the prepared mixture of NMABr and Al2O3 was spin-coated at 4000 r/min for 30s and annealed at 100â for 5min. Cool to room temperature ,the Spiro-OMeTAD mixture was spun on the perovskite film for 30s at a rate of 3000 r/min. Finally, a 200 nm silver electrode was obtained by thermal evaporation at a pressure of 2Ã10 -4 Pa
