Achieving optimal efficiency in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) necessitates the creation of a light-absorbing layer with superior crystallization, minimal defect concentration, exceptional stability and better energy level alignment. In this context, the active layer of the PSCs comprises (Cs 0.15 FA 0.81 MA 0.04 PbBr 0.14 I 2.86 ), incorporating MAPbBr 3 quantum dots doped with toluene as an anti-solvent to enhance device performance, achieving a Photovoltaic Conversion Efficiency (PCE) of 18.9 %. Furthermore, GuBr is introduced at the interface between NiOx and photovoltaic active layer for effective interface modification. These improvements lead to optimized devices, particularly with GuBr modification at doping amount of 3 mg/ml, showcasing an impressive PCE of 20.6 %. Noteworthy attributes of these devices include a short-circuit current density of 24.7 mA/cm 2 and an open-circuit voltage (V oc ) value of 1.02 V. Significantly, the altered film retained more than 81 % of its original effectiveness for a prolonged duration surpassing 10 days. The conclusive findings underscore the successful attainment of high efficiency and high stability through the employed design strategy in PSCs.
Introduction Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have garnered substantial interest in recent years as semiconducting materials for diverse optoelectronic applications, exhibiting promising performance in photodetectors, fieldeffect transistors, lasers, and solar cells  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Despite achieving a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 26.1 % in the latest developments  [10] , enhancing the efficiency of lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) remains a focal point of extensive research efforts. Challenges persist, including low crystallinity, elevated trapstate density, and heightened moisture sensitivity in lead halide perovskite films  [11] [12] [13] [14] . An effective strategy involves consistent optimization of the perovskite film through modifications to the perovskite layer and the application of interface engineering techniques  [15, 16] . Recent advancements in fundamental research and the making of perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have successfully contributed to leveraging QDs to improve the overall performance of PSCs. Our research group has effectively utilized octylammonium bromide (OABr) incorporation into quantum dots MAPbBr 3 to enhance exciton binding energies (E b ), surface morphology, and stability, thereby improving the efficiency of quantum dots MAPBr 3 devices  [17] . In a related study, Zheng and collaborators employed an anti-solvent added with CsPbBrCl 2 quantum dots to decrease the density of defect states in MAPbI 3 perovskite layers by the spin-coating process, showcasing the surface passivation effect of the oleic acid ligand  [18] . Despite these advancements, challenges persist in achieving high efficiency and stability of QDs. Recent investigations into the character of ligands in QDs have highlighted the positive impact of amine ligands, such as oleylamine (Olm), in perovskites  [19, 20] . Presently, widely adopted methods for QD preparation contain the thermal injection method (TIM) and the ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) approach  [21] [22] [23] [24] . The latter has gained popularity among researchers due to its straightforward process and suitable operation. In this study, we synthesized green light MAPbBr 3 QDs from single crystals using LARP, incorporating them into an anti-solvent and injecting them onto the perovskite active layer (Cs 0.15 FA 0.81 MA 0.04 PbBr 0.14 I 2.86 ). This approach resulted in enhanced efficiency in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In the quest to develop the performance of inverted (p-i-n) structured perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the hole transport layer (HTL) plays a crucial role. Various p-type semiconducting materials, such as graphene oxide, CuSCN, CuO, Cu 2 O, and poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6trimethylphenyl)amine), have been extensively explored and involved as HTMs in these inverted PSCs  [25, 26] . Inorganic HTMs, as opposed to organic counterparts, exhibit superior hole-transporting capabilities, enhanced stability, and cost-effectiveness. Particularly noteworthy is NiOx, characterized by its wide energy bandgap (3.6 to 4 eV) and p-type semiconductor properties, which has demonstrated success in inverted PSCs devices. This success is attributed to its favorable mobility of charge carrier and well-matched work function, achieved by fine-tuning the concentration of Ni 2+ or O 2-, thereby aligning with the energy levels of perovskites  [27, 28, 29] . Moreover, previous research indicates that the incorporation of monovalent elements or divalent elements into NiOx can significantly enhance its electrical conductivity, leading to improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) in devices  [29, 30] . Introducing an interface layer among the perovskite and the NiOx emerges as a viable strategy to alleviate latticework mismatch-induced boundary defects and enhance the alignment of energy levels, thereby further enhancing the performance of PSCs. In a recent development, our research group demonstrated the effective use of an ionic liquid (IL) introduced at the NiOxperovskite interface as a modification layer. This innovative approach resulted in noticeable improvement in the optoelectronic properties of PSCs, achieving an impressive efficiency of 22.11 %  [31] . In a separate study by J. Chang et al., a CsBr (as a modified layer) was inserted between the HTL (NiOx) and the perovskite layer to alleviate latticework mismatch-induced interface stress. This intervention promoted more systematic growth of crystal and enhanced hole extraction/transfer, contributing to improved device performance  [29] . However, the complete impact of using buffer layers (alkali metal halide) to reduce latticework mismatch and enhance interface contact quality remains unclear. Additionally, the utilization of Guanidinium Bromide (GuBr) as a buffer layer to control crystal connection properties between the HTL and perovskite layer has been hardly explored. In this work, we explore the use of single crystals as the material for perovskite quantum dots and employ Ligand Assisted Reprecipitation (LARP) to synthesize MAPbBr 3 quantum dots. The active layer of perovskite solar cells consists of (Cs 0.15 FA 0.81 MA 0.04 PbBr 0.14 I 2.86 ), with MAPbBr 3 quantum dots doped with toluene as an anti-solvent to enhance device performance. Furthermore, GuBr is introduced at the interface between NiOx and photovoltaic active layer as a modification layer (see in Fig.  1(a) ), with a detailed examination of its impact on both optical and electrical properties. Significantly, the NiOx/GuBr combination enhances the alignment of energy levels between the NiOx hole transport layer (HTL) and the perovskite layer, leading to enhanced charge extraction and transport while minimizing charge recombination, as shown in Fig.  1(b ).  [32, 33]  This strategic modification leads to significant improvements in the optoelectronic properties of the PSC, to bring on an outstanding efficiency of 20.6 %. Moreover, the modified device exhibits an impressive performance and high stability. 
 Materials and methods 
 1. MAPbBr 3 QDs preparation In the process of preparing the blend solution of toluene mixed MAPbBr 3 QDs  [17] , we begin by adding 15 ml of a toluene anti-solvent to the MAPbBr 3 QDs. Following this, the centrifuge tube is positioned in an ultrasonic oscillator for a duration of 20 min to aid in the dissolution of the quantum dot powder within the toluene. This meticulous procedure ensures the uniform dispersion of the components, culminating in the successful preparation of the toluene -MAPbBr 3 QDs blend solution. Fig.  2  shows the process of MAPbBr 3 QDs. 
 Device preparations First of all, we prepared the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate with clean process ready. The precursor for the NiOx hole transport layer (HTL) was prepared by dissolving 2910 mg of nickel nitrate in 10 mL of ethylene glycol (C 2 H 6 O 2 ), to which 0.67 mL of ethylenediamine (C 2 H 8 N 2 ) was added. This mixture was stirred overnight at 25 •C. The solution of NiOx HTL was deposited onto the FTO substrate by spin method, and then treatment with annealing at 120 • C for 10 min and baking at 300 • C for 1 h. The solution of Cs 0.15 FA 0.81 MA 0.04 Pb-Br 0.14 I 2.86 perovskite was mixed by combining 13 mg of CsI, 21.2 mg of CsBr, 4.47 mg of MABr, 139 mg of FAI, and 461 mg of PbI 2 in 1 mL of DMSO: DMF (1:4) solution. Subsequently, the guanidinium bromide (GuBr) material was drop-cast onto the NiOx /FTO glass, and then went to annealing on a 90 • C for 10 min. Next, the blend solution of Cs 0.15 FA 0.81 MA 0.04 PbBr 0.14 I 2.86 mixed MAPbBr 3 QDs was dropped onto the GuBr/NiOx/FTO substrate as the active layer. After the spin step, the active layer was sintering at 100 • C for 10 min. Following, C 60 (20 nm), BCP (5 nm), and silver (Ag, 100 nm) were evaporated onto the perovskite/GuBr/NiOx/FTO substrate. 
 Characteristics The UV-Vis spectrometer and Hitachi F-7,000 fluorescence spectrophotometer were used to evaluate absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis employed a PANalytical Xray diffractometer with Cu target Kα radiation. Scanning electron microscopy (JSM-7610F; JEOL) and a ZEISS Sigma field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) examined the perovskite film's surface morphology. The photovoltaic characteristics was employed assembly a solar simulator (PS105), Keithley 2400 digital source meter, and LSQE-R QE system.  
 Results and discussion 
 Optimize of active layer -Inner modified engineering In this section, the active layer composed of Cs 0.15 FA 0.81 MA 0.04 Pb-Br 0.14 I 2.86 -MAPbBr 3 QDs with different amount of toluene as an antisolvent to optimize material and device performance. The absorption spectrum in Fig.  3  Fig.  4  plots the X-ray diffraction (XRD) of Cs 0.15 FA 0.81 MA 0.04 Pb-Br 0.14 I 2.86 -MAPbBr 3 QDs with different amount of toluene as an antisolvent. It can be found that there is no obvious peak at 13 • (which is the PbI 2 peak), indicating that the crystallization condition of the perovskite film is good and the film has not decomposed into PbI 2 . There are obviously strong diffraction peaks at 14.24 • and 28.58 • , corresponding to the perovskite (1 1 0) and (2 2 0) cubic phases  [31] . Among all samples, the 15 ml toluene doped quantum dot MAPbBr 3 film has the highest intensity at 14.24 • and 28.58 • , indicating that its film has the best crystallization condition. The J-V curves of doping MAPbBr 3 with different concentrations in the spin-coated Cs 0.15 FA 0.81 MA 0.04 PbBr 0.14 I 2.86 perovskites anti-solvent toluene are shown in Fig.  5(a) . When the 15 ml of MAPbBr 3 QDs antisolvent toluene is added, the fill factor, current density, and open circuit voltage (Voc) of the prepared perovskite solar cells all tend to increase, from 74 %, 23.5 mA/cm 2 , and 1.0 V for undoped sample to 75.8 %, 24.1 mA/cm 2 , and 1.03 V. The photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) also increased from 17.9 % to 18.9 %. This shows that the increased grain size and the reduction of holes and the probability of carrier recombination help to increase the Voc of the solar cell, thereby affecting the efficiency of the device. Fig.  5 (b) shows the PCE statistics of cells. 
 Interface layer -Outer modified engineering In this work, the active layer incorporated into perovskite solar cells is composed of (Cs 0.15 FA 0.81 MA 0.04 PbBr 0.14 I 2.86 ), where MAPbBr 3 QDs are intentionally doped with toluene (15 ml) as an anti-solvent, serving as a control device for comparative analysis. To further optimize device efficiency, we introduce varying concentrations of guanidinium bromide   (GuBr) at the interface between NiOx and the perovskite layer. This GuBr acts as a modification layer to enhance the interface in the target devices. The concentrations tested include 1, 3, 6, and 9 mg/ml. This meticulous approach aims to explore the impact of GuBr concentration on the performance of PSCs, providing a comprehensive understanding of the modifications at the interface for potential efficiency improvements. The absorption spectrum in Fig.  6 (a) depicts the absorption characteristics of control and GuBr surface-modified perovskite films at varying concentrations. Notably, a distinct absorption band within the 750 nm to 800 nm range aligns with the peak excitation wavelength measured by PL spectrum. Films treated with a GuBr concentration of 3 mg/ml exhibit a slightly elevated absorption rate, indicating enhanced photon absorption and improved crystallinity. This suggests improved JSC and overall component efficiency. Nevertheless, at concentrations of 6 mg/ml and 9 mg/ml, excessive Br ions lead to a reduction in film absorption, thereby impacting the element's efficiency adversely. In Fig.  6 (b), the PL spectra of GuBr-modified perovskite films are presented for various concentrations. The most pronounced peak is observed at a GuBr concentration of 3 mg/ml, signifying superior film crystallinity and reduced defects. However, at concentrations of 6 mg/ml and 9 mg/ ml, excessive GuBr leads to a decrease in PL peak intensity and an enlargement of surface pore size  [34] . Notably, the wavelength remains consistent at 778 nm across different doping concentrations, highlighting favorable conditions for efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In Fig.  7 , X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis provides a direct assessment of the crystal quality and characteristics of perovskite (PVSK) layers. These layers, fabricated under varying GuBr concentrations, are compared to a control sample. Notably, at a GuBr concentration of 3 mg/ ml, the perovskite crystal orientations (1 1 0) and (2 2 0) exhibit the highest intensity, indicative of superior crystallinity  [31] . However, at concentrations of 6 mg/ml and 9 mg/ml, the intensity of these diffraction peaks decreases compared to the 3 mg/ml concentration, suggesting a slight reduction in film quality. This decline is attributed to excessive Br anions causing surface fogging and compromising film integrity. The interface modification enhances interactions between NiOx films and the perovskite active layer, mitigating the impact of interface defects on carrier transport. Importantly, XRD analysis indicates that the introduction of the GuBr interlayer does not alter the overall crystalline structure of the perovskite film, as evidenced by consistent profiles in comparison to films on different substrates (FTO/NiOx/PVSK) and (FTO/NiOx/GuBr/PVSK). This consistency underscores the robustness of the perovskite film's crystallinity with the incorporation of GuBr. In Fig.  8 , the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images provide a  detailed examination of both the control perovskite films and those subjected to GuBr modification at varying concentrations. Specifically, the surface analysis reveals that the perovskite film, when treated with a GuBr (3 mg/mL), exhibits a notable reduction in pore density coupled with an enlargement in the average grain size. This observation strongly suggests that the presence of GuBr on the NiOx surface contributes positively to enhancing both the crystallinity and coverage of the perovskite film. Contrastingly, as the GuBr concentrations escalate to 6 and 9 mg/mL, a distinct shift occurs. Excessive Br ions at these higher concentrations lead to an evident increase in pore formation on the perovskite film surface. Additionally, there is a conspicuous difference in the average grain size, signaling a decline in film quality. These nuanced SEM findings underscore the sensitivity of the perovskite film morphology to varying GuBr concentrations, highlighting the critical importance of optimal doping levels for achieving desired structural characteristics and overall film quality. In Fig.  9 , the SEM cross-section offers a detailed examination of a complete solar cell device, illustrating the impact of interface modification with GuBr at a concentration of 3 mg/ml. The intricate layering of the device is revealed through precise measurements of individual components. The NiOx/GuBr interface, crucial for the modification process, exhibits a thickness of approximately 30 nm. Subsequently, the perovskite film, a central component in the solar cell, shows a thickness ranging from 450 nm to 500 nm. The uppermost layer, created through evaporation, plays a significant role in the device structure. Specifically, the C 60 layer is measured at 20 nm, and the subsequent BCP layer has a thickness of 5 nm. The cumulative effect of these layers results in a final device thickness ranging from 500 nm to 550 nm. This comprehensive description provides a thorough understanding of the layer thicknesses and their contributions to the overall architecture of the solar cell device  [35] . In second phase of investigation, we focused on the passivation effects of GuBr at the interface between NiOx and the active layer of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), as illustrated in Fig.  10(a) , the outcomes presented in Table  1  encompass critical parameters such as power conversion efficiency (PCE), current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF). The investigated PSCs, utilizing a trans-isomer (p-i-n) configuration, were subjected to varying concentrations of GuBr. The reference cell, devoid of GuBr, demonstrated a respectable PCE of 18.9 %. Upon introducing GuBr at a concentration of 1 mg/ml, a discernible enhancement in PCE to 19.2 % was observed. Remarkably, the highest PCE of 20.6 % was achieved at a GuBr concentration of 3 mg/ml, accompanied by a stabilized maximum power point (MPP) at 19 %. However, a marginal reduction in PCE was noted at 6 and 9 mg/ml when compared to the 3 mg/ml cell. These results underscore the positive impact of GuBr on optimizing the interface of the active layer, highlighting its role in enhancing the performance of the PSCs. Following GuBr modification, the EQE spectrum displayed significant enhancements over an extensive wavelength range when compared to the control sample, as vividly illustrated in Fig.  10(b ). The Remarkably, the incorporation of GuBr led to notable improvements in photovoltaic characteristics for the PSCs, manifested by a more limited distribution region. This observation underscores the effectiveness of GuBr in positively influencing the photovoltaic characteristics of the cells.  [36, 37] . Expanding on our initial findings, we conducted further investigations into the prolonged stability of the processed photovoltaic devices. In Fig.  12 (a), we illustrate the ambient stability judgements performed on both cells with (GuBr, 3 mg/ml) and without modified engineering, still encapsulated within a nitrogen ambient. Remarkably, the efficiency of the control sample without modified engineering decreased to 65.5 % (-0.345 %/time) of its initial value after a 10-day aging. In contrast, the cells with modified engineering exhibited higher characteristics, maintaining 81.5 % (-0.185 %/time) of their initial power conversion efficiency after a reliability test of period of 10 days, as depicted in Fig.  12(b ). The results emphasize a significant improvement in reliability with comparison to the control sample without modified engineering, representing a notable advancement  [38] [39] [40] [41] . 
 Conclusions In summary, the active layer composition of our perovskite solar cells (PSCs) involves (Cs 0.15 FA 0.81 MA 0.04 PbBr 0.14 I 2.86 ), with the incorporation of MAPbBr 3 quantum dots doped with toluene as an anti-solvent, resulting in a commendable photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.9 %.
