Title: Interstitial occupancy by extrinsic alkali cations in Perovskites and its impact on ion migration

DOI: 10.1002/adma.201707350 X is a halide anion (I -, Br -or Cl -or their mixture). Tuning the ABX 3 composition has been widely reported to not only affect the efficiency of the PSCs but also greatly impact on the stability of the perovskite layer. Accordingly, compositional effects have become a critical area for both fundamental research and device optimization.  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Among the various perovskite analogs, MAPbI 3 and FAPbI 3 are the first two material systems that have demonstrated high photovoltaic efficiency,  [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]  and have also been studied extensively in terms of stability. It was found that FAPbI 3 has a better thermal stability than MAPbI 3 ,  [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22]  however, it lacks structural stability at room temperature because of weak interactions between the FA cation and the inorganic framework, and an undesirable yellow δ-phase is usually formed in the FAPbI 3 film.  [19, 20]  Recently, the limitations of pure MAPbI 3 and FAPbI 3 systems have been addressed by using mixed A cations. Pellet et al. developed MA/FA mixed perovskites and found that the yellow δ-phase of FAPbI 3 could be suppressed.  [3]  Additionally, Lee et al. discovered that partially substituting FA + with Cs + not only induced a preferable crystallization of FA perovskite into a photoactive phase but also enhanced the moisture-stability and thermal stability of FAPbI 3 .  [4]  Furthermore, McMeekin et al. observed that the phase instability issue of wide-bandgap (1.75 eV) Br-I mixed halide FA perovskites could be resolved through incorporating Cs, making it a promising perovskite absorber for tandem solar cells.  [5]  The improved structural stability was explained by Yi et al., elucidating that Cs assists the crystallization of the black phase in the FA perovskites due to entropic stabilization.  [6]  Saliba et al. developed a more complex Cs/MA/FA triple cation perovskite with improved stability, efficiency, and reproducibility of the PSCs.  [7]  The same researchers later reported that incorporating a small amount of Rb + cations in the perovskite further improved the efficiency and photostability of the Cs/MA/FA PSCs.  [8]  More recently, smaller alkali cations, such as K + and Na + , were introduced into MAPbI 3 or MA/FA mixed perovskite precursor solution to tune the perovskite thin film morphology  [23] [24] [25]  and electronic properties.  [26] [27] [28] [29] [30]  It is argued that the incorporation of these small alkali cations can improve charge injection property or reduce trap density, thus eliminating current-voltage (I-V) hysteresis and promoting the efficiency and stability of the PSCs.  [26, 28]  During the preparation of this manuscript, we became aware Recent success in achieving highly stable Rb-containing organolead halide perovskites has indicated the possibility of incorporating small monovalent cations, which cannot fit in the lead-halide cage with an appropriate tolerance factor, into the perovskite lattice while maintaining a pure stable "black" phase. In this study, through a combined experimental and theoretical investigation by density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the incorporation of extrinsic alkali cations (Rb + , K + , Na + , and Li + ) in perovskite materials, the size-dependent interstitial occupancy of these cations in the perovskite lattice is unambiguously revealed. Interestingly, DFT calculations predict the increased ion migration barriers in the lattice after the interstitial occupancy. To verify this prediction, ion migration behavior is characterized through hysteresis analysis of solar cells, electrical poling, temperature-dependent conductivity, and time-dependent photoluminescence measurements. The results collectively point to the suppression of ion migration after lattice interstitial occupancy by extrinsic alkali cations. The findings of this study provide new material design principles to manipulate the structural and ionic properties of multication perovskite materials. 
 Multication Perovskites Organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention in recent years because of their rapidly rising efficiency from 3.8%  [1]  to over 20%  [2]  and the extraordinary optoelectronic properties of the perovskite active layer. The general chemical formula of perovskite materials is ABX 3 , where A is a monovalent organic (methylammonium, MA + or formamidinium, FA + ) or inorganic (Cs + ) cation, or a mixture of both; B is Pb 2+ or Sn 2+ , or a mixture of both; and of an experimental work  [31]  investigating the influence of different alkali cations (Cs + , Rb + , K + , Na + , and Li + ) on the structural and electronic properties of MA/FA perovskite thin films, and the authors observed perovskite lattice expansion after incorporation of K + , Na + or Li + and the corresponding bandgap variation. Interestingly, Rb + , K + and Na + and Li + have a small ionic radius with unfavorable Goldschmidt tolerance factor for occupying the A site of the Pb-I network.  [22]  This observation indicates that the incorporation of extrinsic alkali cations may occur through different mechanisms, which could add another dimension for tuning the lattice structure of perovskite materials. How these extrinsic cations occupy in the perovskite lattice has not been investigated so far. Besides thermal decomposition and lattice distortion, ion migration (resulting from the diffusion of native defects) is another thermodynamic process often associated with instability, such as photoinduced phase segregation in wide-bandgap perovskite materials  [32, 33]  and ion migration-induced degradation of perovskites in the presence of oxygen and light.  [34, 35]  Ion migration also accounts for anomalous device behaviors such as I-V hysteresis in PSCs  [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42]  and a switchable photovoltaic effect.  [43]  Experimental and theoretical studies by Frost and Walsh.  [38]  asserted that the prevalent ion migration process in perovskites is vacancy-mediated anion (i. e., I -or Br -) diffusion. The diffusion of the anions was predicted to be affected by their local chemical environment,  [44] [45] [46] [47]  including the orientation of the organic cations  [45]  and the formation energy of the defects.  [36, 46, 47]  Experimentally, the ionic transport properties can be varied through material fabrication processes or ambient conditions, which essentially modify the composition, morphology, or defect concentration of the perovskite films. Suppressing ion migration is not a trivial task. Methods such as increasing crystal size and controlling grain boundary defects have been proposed.  [13, 47]  Since both the presence of defects and their migration is intrinsic to perovskites,  [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49]  the development of strategies to eliminate or suppress ion migration in the bulk is essential. In this study, we explore a new mechanism to suppress ion migration in bulk perovskites through the interstitial incorporation of small alkali cations in the lattice of state-of-the-art Cs/MA/FA triple cation perovskites. First, we demonstrate that incorporating extrinsic alkali cations (i.e., Rb + , K + , Na + , or Li + ) into Cs/MA/FA perovskite introduces lattice expansion, which is typically associated with interstitial occupancy of ions. Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the possible ion incorporation patterns, we discovered that interstitial occupancy by extrinsic alkali cations is indeed energetically more favorable than A site substitution. Interestingly, the DFT calculations also predict increased ion migration barriers in the lattice after the interstitial occupancy. To verify this theoretical prediction, we characterized the ion migration behavior via hysteresis analysis of solar cells, electrical poling, temperature-dependent conductivity, and time-dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The results collectively point to the suppression of ion migration after the lattice interstitial occupancy by extrinsic alkali cations. Thin films of Cs 0.11 MA 0.15 FA 0.74 Pb(Br 0.17 I 0.83 ) 3 (abbreviated as Cs/MA/FA for convenience) perovskite were used as the control sample and fabricated by depositing the precursor solution on a SnO 2 -coated fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate according to a previously reported spin-coating process  [50]  (described in detail in the Experimental section). To introduce the extrinsic alkali cations (Rb + , K + , Na + , or Li + ) into the perovskite films, their corresponding iodide salt (RbI, KI, NaI, or LiI) was added to the Cs/MA/FA perovskite precursor solution with varying molar concentrations from 0.5 to 8%. The percentage was referred as the molar concentration of the alkali cations in the perovskite precursor solution. After formation of the perovskite films, we first investigated the effect of the extrinsic alkali cations on the perovskite crystal structure and film morphology. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Figure  1a  and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Figure  1e-i    cations does not change the crystallinity or morphology of the Cs/MA/FA perovskite films. However, when zooming in to the main peak corresponding to the (310) crystal planes of the perovskite (Figure  1b ), a clear peak shift toward lower angles is observed. Generally, substitution of perovskite A cations (i.e., FA + , MA + , or Cs + ) with smaller cations results in lattice contraction, and thus a shift of the main XRD peak to a higher angle.  [3] [4] [5]  Indeed, when we added an additional 2% Cs + to the Cs/MA/FA perovskite, we observed a slight shift of the XRD peak toward a higher angle, corresponding to a lattice contraction due to the smaller size of Cs + as compared to FA + and MA + (Figure  S1a ,b, Supporting Information). Therefore, the opposite shift of the XRD peak to a lower angle may correspond to lattice expansion, which could occur through interstitial occupancy by the alkali cations or the reduction of bromide anion in the lattice. In order to determine which of the above is the dominant mechanism, we further incorporated RbI, KI, NaI or LiI into the pure iodide precursors of Cs 0.11 MA 0.15 FA 0.74 PbI 3 . As shown in Figure  S2  (Supporting Information), for the pure iodide perovskites, the main XRD peaks also shifted to a lower angle, suggesting that the perovskite lattice expansion should mainly result from the interstitial occupancy of alkali cations. The theoretical validation of such interstitial occupancy will be described in the next section. We also noted that no new phase was formed in the K + -or Na + -doped perovskites when the doping concentration was increased from 0.5 to 8% (Figure  1c ; Figure  S1e , Supporting Information), whereas >2% Rb + or Li + doping readily resulted in precipitation of a secondary phase δ-RbPbI 3  [8, [51] [52] [53]  (Figure  1f ; Figure  S1c , Supporting Information) or δ-CsPbI 3 (Figure  S1g , Supporting Information) phases in the perovskites, manifesting a size-dependent dopant concentration tolerance. To verify the hypothesis of alkali ion occupancy at the interstitial site of the perovskite lattice, we subsequently investigated the energetics and the alkali cation incorporation mechanisms by using DFT calculations. We calculated and compared the formation energies (ΔH 0K ) at zero temperature (0 K) of the pure FAPbI 3 perovskite and FAPbI 3 with alkali cations (Cs + , Rb + , K + , Na + , and Li + ) incorporated at an A site or interstitial site (i.e., the site between two A sites, as shown in Figure  2b, d ). Detailed descriptions of the reactions, the model choices, and the methodology can be found in the Computational Methods section. The results of thermodynamics of the pure perovskites without alkali cations are also provided in Table  S1  (Supporting Information). We investigated alkali cation substitution at an A site or occupancy at an interstitial site in FAPbI 3 , MAPbI 3 , FAPbBr 3 , MAPbBr 3 perovskite lattices. Because FA + as a cation and I -as an anion are the most abundant species in the experimentally studied FA x MA 1-x Pb(I y Br 1-y ) 3 system, the ΔH 0K of alkali cation (Cs + , Rb + , K + , Na + , and Li + ) incorporation with several concentrations in FAPbI 3 (Figure  2c ; Table  S2  and Figure  S3 , Supporting Information) perovskites are mainly analyzed (results for other material systems are also provided in Figure  S4  in the Supporting Information). In general, we observe that incorporating alkali cations at either an A site or an interstitial site yields a more positive ΔH 0K than the pure perovskite host because of lattice volume shrinkage (in the case of A site substitution) or lattice volume expansion (in the case of interstitial site occupancy). Specifically, the variation of ΔH 0K exhibits the following trends (Figure  2c ): 1) The ΔH 0K of the interstitial occupancy increases linearly with increasing alkali cation concentration. In contrast, the change in ΔH 0K for A-site substitution as a function of alkali  cation concentration is minor and almost reaches zero for low alkali cation concentrations (<12.5%). 2) The increase in ΔH 0K is cation size-dependent: a) For A site substitution, the larger the alkali ions, the smaller the increase in ΔH 0K ; the difference in ΔH 0K between the largest (Cs + ) and smallest (Li + ) ion substitution is large (i.e., 0.07 eV). b) For interstitial occupancy, the opposite holds; the difference in ΔH 0K between the interstitial occupancy of the largest (Cs + ) and smallest (Li + ) cations is small (i.e., 0.01-0.02 eV). The combination of these trends leads to the following conclusions: 1) Both types of occupancy are thermodynamically possible when the percentage of alkali cations is small (≤6%). 2) When the concentration of alkali cations decreases, the interstitial occupancy starts to be favorable; and the smaller the alkali cation, the higher the concentration below which it tends to prefer the interstitial sites. 3) Even at very low concentration (0.5%), the interstitial occupancy of the largest alkali cations (Cs + ) is still less favorable than A site occupancy. In addition, we also explored the possibility of incorporating alkali cations (Cs + , Rb + , K + , Na + , and Li + ) at the B site (Pb) of FAPbI 3 perovskite. As Table  S3  (Supporting Information) shows, the formation energies of B site substitution are significantly higher than both A site substitution and interstitial site occupancy for all alkali cations regardless of their ionic radius (Cs + , Rb + , K + are larger and Na + and Li + are smaller than Pb 2+ ). Further evidence for the favorable energetics of interstitial occupancy for extrinsic alkali cations is provided by analysis of the diffusion barrier of the alkali cations reported in Figure  S5  (Supporting Information). To illustrate the theoretical findings, we propose a lattice model schematically depicted in Figure  3 . Figure  3a-c  shows a side view of the lattice structure of the Cs/MA/FA perovskite lattice without (a) and with small amounts of Rb + (b) and K + (c) incorporated in the lattice. Being a large cation, Cs + is demonstrated both experimentally (our work and previous works  [3] [4] [5]  ) and theoretically to occupy the A sites. Rb + has an intermediate size. Therefore, Rb + can be incorporated at both types of sites and can easily diffuse between these types of sites (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information). Finally, the small K + tends to occupy the interstitial sites, evidenced by the favorable thermodynamics and sizable diffusion barriers to the A sites (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information). We further extended the theoretical investigation to the question how the interstitial ions affect the migration of ionic native defects (i. e., iodide or bromine vacancy), a prevailing process in organolead halide perovskites that is often associated with I-V hysteresis in PSCs  [39] [40] [41] [42] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48]  and photoinduced phase separation.  [32, 33]  We calculated vacancy-mediated I -diffusion with and without alkali cation K + interstitial occupancy in FAPbI 3 . As shown in Figure  2d , we investigated several diffusion pathways (ab, ac, and ad) to distinguish the influence of the local environment on individual diffusion paths. The environmental effect of each path can be identified based on the distance to the interstitial alkali cations (ab vs ad), the orientation of the FA cations (ab vs ac), or the direction of the diffusion paths (ab vs ba). The calculated I -diffusion barriers are found to range from 0.16 to 0.49 eV. This energy range is comparable to several DFT results for FAPbI 3 ,  [47, 54]  MAPbI 3 , which range from 0.08 to 0.65 eV using different approximation schemes, different DFT codes, and taking into account several local environments.  [36, 42, [44] [45] [46] [47]  As shown in Figure  2e , the incorporation of interstitial K + leads to sizable increase in the diffusion barriers for all diffusion paths (from 0.11 to 0.59 eV). Through careful analysis of the trends in the diffusion barriers and their associated atomic arrangement, we determined three main roles of the interstitial K + in increasing diffusion barriers. First, the K + suppresses the I -diffusion through partially blocking of the diffusion pathways. Second, more energy is required to create an iodide vacancy when K + cations are present than when they are not, as evidenced by the increased formation energies in Table  S4  (Supporting Information). Third, the incorporation of K + cations alters the orientation of the FA + cations, by pulling these cations from their original (111) orientation to (110) orientation (Figure  S6 , Supporting Information), in order to maximize their interaction with the surrounding FA cations. The result of this reorientation is also a change of the dipole direction, pointing more in the direction of the K + , and consequently alters the I -diffusion barriers. The dipole-orientation-induced diffusion barriers were also found in MAPbI 3 ,  [45]  although with a much larger range of the activation barriers (0.06 to 0.65 eV). This large range of activation barriers is probably due to the larger dipole moment of the MA cation as compared to the FA cation.  [38]  The DFT calculation results predict increased ion migration barriers through K + interstitial occupancy. To verify this prediction, we characterized the ion migration behavior through I-V hysteresis analysis of the PSCs, electrical poling, temperature-dependent conductivity, and time-dependent PL measurements of the perovskite materials. We first studied the I-V hysteresis of the PSCs based on the Cs/MA/FA perovskite films. The perovskite films with various alkali cation species and doping concentrations were incorporated into the device with the structure FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite/ N2,N2,N2′,N2′,N7,N7,N7′,N7′-octakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9′spirobi[9H-fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetramine (spiro-MeOTAD)/Au (Figure  4a ). The current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the corresponding PSCs are presented in Figure  S7  (Supporting Information). We extracted the power conversion efficiency (PCE, from the reverse scan) and the hysteresis index, HI  [53]  = -       HI PCE P CE PCE reverse f orward reverse , from the J-V curves (Figure  S7 , Supporting Information) and summarized them in Table  S5  (Supporting Information) to analyze the variation of the PCE and J-V hysteresis as a function of doping concentration. We also noted that the J-V hysteresis of the PSCs is highly related to the preconditioning treatment of the devices, such as exposure to the applied bias, light illumination or dark, and varied scan rates.  [41, [55] [56] [57]  In order to fairly compare the hysteresis behavior of the PSCs with and without doping, we adopted the commonly used J-V measurement for all the devices without any intended preconditioning treatment, i.e., no bias, no preillumination and with a scan rate of 0.1 V s -1 . We analyzed the variation of the PCE and J-V hysteresis as a function of doping concentration. We found that additional Cs + or Li + incorporation had no positive effect on the hysteresis of the Cs/MA/ FA PSCs; by contrast, Rb + , K + , and Na + doping at appropriate concentrations dramatically reduced hysteresis. This result agrees well with the DFT prediction of suppressed I -migration, whereas the large hysteresis observed in Li + -doped PSCs could be attributed to the small size and high mobility of Li + cations,  [58]  which were not considered in the DFT calculations. It was also noted that increasing the Rb + concentration to over 2% in the perovskite deteriorated the device performance, whereas increasing the Li + or Na + concentration to over 4% adversely increased the hysteresis. The decreased PCE of the PSCs with a high Rb concentration resulted from the formation of photoinactive δ-RbPbI 3 impurities in the perovskite film, and the increased hysteresis of the PSCs with a high Na + concentration resulted from additional Na + migration in the perovskites.  [58]  By comparing all PSC devices, we conclude that K + incorporation yields the widest doping concentration window for effectively reducing hysteresis while maintaining high photovoltaic efficiency, coinciding with the results of a very recent work reporting that incorporating K into the Cs/MA/FA perovskite reduced the hysteresis of PSCs.  [59]  Figure  4b -e displays the PCE statistics, HI statistics, J-V curves, and stabilized power output of the PSCs with 1% K + doping and without doping, respectively. The PSCs with 1% K + doping demonstrated improved stabilized PCE from 18 to 19% (Figure  4e ), which, according to Figure  4c , is associated with reduced hysteresis. We also embedded K + into MA/FA perovskites, and again observed the lattice expansion and reduced hysteresis of PSCs, as shown in Figure  S8  and Table  S6  in the Supporting Information, demonstrating the universality of interstitial doping in the mixedcation perovskite materials. We note that the I-V hysteresis is a combination effect of ion migration and charge trapping (or  trapping induced charge recombination);  [40, 41, 60]  thus, the hysteresis phenomenon could be alleviated by either suppressing ion migration or reducing charge trapping at the perovskite/ charge transport layer interface. In our experiment, the alkali cations were incorporated into the perovskite film through modification of precursor solution, and we have confirmed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling that the alkali cations distribute uniformly throughout the perovskite film (data not shown); therefore, the interface passivation effect by the alkali cations is quite unlikely, and the observed hysteresis reduction should originate from suppressed ion migration. To confirm that the reduced hysteresis was not caused by an interface modification effect in the PSCs, we examined the ion migration behavior through electrical poling  [43, 61]  experiments in a lateral conductor device structure (Figure  5a ). In such experiments, a constant bias is applied between two parallel electrodes with 100 µm spacing, generating an electric field that induces a drift of the charged ions or defects. Accordingly, regions with p-type doping by negatively charged ions/ vacancies and n-type doping by positively charged ions/vacancies are created next to the positive and negative electrodes, respectively,  [62] [63] [64]  resulting in a reversible p-i-n structure in the perovskite layer.  [43]  Upon illumination, the poled device generates an open-circuit voltage (V oc ), the magnitude of which is determined by the built-in potential (V bi ) of the p-i-n structure. V oc is essentially determined by the doping concentration on the p and n sides. Specifically, the more ions piled up at the electrodes, the higher the V oc . As shown in Figure  5b , the nonpoled triple cation (Cs/MA/FA) perovskite device yielded zero V oc because of the symmetry of the electrode structure; after poling the device at 100 V for 30 s, a photovoltaic effect under 1 sun illumination was observed, with a V oc of 0.38 V. By contrast, the perovskite with 1% K + doping exhibited a nearly halved V oc of 0.2 V after the same poling process, clearly indicating reduced ion migration. Similar results were obtained for perovskite devices with Rb + or Na + doping (Figure  5b ) and with various poling electric fields (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information). Using the conductor structure, we further characterized the activation energy (E a ) of ion migration in the pure and K + -doped Cs/MA/FA perovskite materials through temperaturedependent conductivity measurement. The conductivity values under various temperatures were extracted from the J-V curves under dark condition, which were then used to calculate activation energy through Nernst-Einstein relation  [65]  : σ(T) = (σ 0 /T) exp(-E a /kT), where k is Boltzmann's constant, σ 0 is a constant, and T is the temperature. As shown in Figure  5c , two slopes are identified from each dataset, likely corresponding to two conduction mechanisms: electronic conduction and ionic conduction. In the low-temperature region (200-260 K), the ion motion is frozen or largely suppressed and the conductivity is determined by electronic conduction; when the temperature exceeds 260 K, ionic conduction begins to contribute to the electric current. The transition temperature from electronic to ionic conduction identified here is also in good agreement with the results of a recent work.  [65]  The conductivity increase with increasing temperature reflects the role of thermal activation in ion migration. The E a of the ionic conduction was fitted to be 0.06 and 0.10 eV for the pure and K + -doped Cs/MA/FA perovskite, respectively, indicating the increased E a of the perovskite material by K + doping, which agrees well with the increased ion migration barriers predicted by the DFT calculations in Figure  2e . Photoinduced phase segregation has been a key issue limiting the V oc of wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells. The process is believed to occur through ion migration. Therefore, we extended the interstitial doping treatment to wide-bandgap perovskite materials in which I -is partially replaced by Br -. The Br -to I -ratio was increased from 1:5 to 2:3 while maintaining the same composition of A-site cations in the Adv. Mater. 2018, 30, 1707350 perovskite precursor solution. The Tauc plot in Figure  S10  (Supporting Information) suggests that the bandgap of the Cs 0.11 MA 0.15 FA 0.74 PbBr 1.2 I 1.8 film is 1.78 eV. We performed timedependent PL measurements on Cs 0.11 MA 0.15 FA 0.74 PbBr 1.2 I 1.8 and 1% K + -doped Cs 0.11 MA 0.15 FA 0.74 PbBr 1.2 I 1.8 thin films by using an excitation source with a power density of 38 mW cm -2 and a wavelength of 405 nm. The perovskite film without doping exhibited a rapidly rising PL peak that is red-shifted from the original one, which is a typical indication of phase segregation. By contrast, the K + -doped perovskite film revealed highly suppressed phase segregation, as shown in Figure  5d, e . We also considered doping with other extrinsic alkali cations (Figure  S11 , Supporting Information). We found that Rb + -and Na + -doped perovskites exhibited suppressed PL peak red-shifts, whereas the Li + -incorporated perovskite exhibited a strong time-dependent red-shift of the PL peak, which may again be related to the high mobility of Li + in the perovskite. The interstitial cation-enhanced photostability of wide-bandgap perovskites may be particularly useful for achieving high-efficiency tandem solar cells. Although this study has mainly focused on K + -doped FA/ MA/Cs perovskite films, we also verified 1) the interstitial occupancy of Rb + , Na + , and Li + and 2) the ion migration suppression effects of Rb + and Na + . A key difference among these alkali cations is the size-dependent doping concentration effect. The related major observations are summarized as follows. First, the large alkali cation Cs + prefers to occupy the A sites of the perovskite lattice, and incorporation of a small amount of excess Cs + in Cs/MA/FA perovskite has negligible effects on the lattice structure and hysteresis of the PSCs. Second, doping with extrinsic alkali cations of a moderate size, such as Rb + , K + , or Na + , remarkably reduces the hysteresis of the PSCs. Of those cations, the large Rb + cations have a stronger tendency to segregate from the Pb-I cages to form a yellow phase; therefore, they can only be used at very low concentrations. The small Na + cations can be incorporated into the perovskite lattice at higher concentrations, but are less effective in blocking ion migration than Rb + and K + cations. Third, Li + cations may participate in, instead of suppress, ion migration due to their small size and high mobility, even though these cations can still occupy interstitial sites. Taking together, the following principles should be considered when applying interstitial cations to modulate ion migration in perovskite materials. First, the "optimal size" of the interstitial cation is defined by the basic framework of the perovskite lattice (or more specifically, the size of the interstitial sites). In this study we identified K + as the optimal interstitial cation for FAPbI 3 , but the conclusion may vary in other perovskite systems with significantly different lattice constant. Second, the size variation of interstitial cation always induces combined effects: on one hand, increasing the cation size will result in a higher energy barrier for ion migration; on the other hand, it will narrow down the concentration window where interstitial occupancy is energetically favored over A site occupancy. From fabrication point of view, the latter effect may not be ideal for achieving high reproducibility. In conclusion, we successfully incorporated extrinsic alkali cations (Rb + , K + , Na + , and Li + ) into Cs/MA/FA perovskite films, and experimentally as well as theoretically, based on DFT calculations, demonstrated that these alkali cations can occupy the interstitial sites of the perovskite lattice. The DFT calculations further reveal that the occupancy selection between the A site and interstitial site is cation size dependent. The DFT calculations also predict that the interstitial ions raise the migration energy barrier for native halide defects. We experimentally verified this prediction through characterizing the defect migration-related material or device behaviors upon light or electrical excitation. Our experiments indicate that the incorporation of properly sized alkali cations, such as K + , results in reduced I-V hysteresis of PSCs, weakened poling effects, and improved photo stability of wide-bandgap mixed-halide perovskites, all pointing to suppressed ion migration. This study not only highlights the possibility of the incorporation of interstitial cations in the perovskite lattice but also suggests a simple bottom-up approach to manipulate the local structural and ionic properties of perovskite films without altering the film morphology and crystallinity. 
 Experimental Section Perovskite Precursor Solution: MA/FA perovskite: 1.1 m PbI 2 (Sigma-Aldrich), 0. MA/FA/Cs perovskite with wide bandgap: 0.77 m PbI 2 , 0.55 m PbBr 2 , 0.7 m FAI, and 0.5 m MABr were dissolved in a mixture of anhydrous DMF/DMSO with a volume ratio of 4:1. 1.5 m stock solution of CsI in DMSO was successively added to the MA/FA mixed perovskite solution with a volume ratio of 10:90. Solar Cell Fabrication: FTO (DHS-FTO22-15N, HeptaChroma) substrates were subsequently cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol, followed by an UV-ozone (PSD-UV8, NOVASCAN) treatment for 15 min. The SnO 2 electron transport layer was spin-coated onto the FTO substrate by a modified process reported in the previous work.  [66]  The spincoating rate was set at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by a gradient heating and baking at 180 °C for 1 h on a hotplate. After cooling to room temperature, all SnO 2 layers were treated by an UV-ozone machine for 15 min. Then, all SnO 2 coated FTO substrates were transferred to the glove box for the fabrication of the perovskite layer and spiro-MeOTAD hole transport layer. All perovskite layers were deposited through a consecutive two-step spin-coating process (1000 rpm for 5 s and 6000 rpm for 30 s), and 12 s before the end of the second step, 160 µL chlorobenzene as antisolvent was dripped on the perovskite, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 1 h.

Finally, a 80 nm thick gold electrode was deposited via thermal evaporation with a mask area of 0.05 cm 2 . 
 www.advmat.de www.advancedsciencenews.com Measurement and Characterization: The crystal phases of the perovskite films were identified by an X-ray diffraction system with a Rigaku ru-300 diffractometer using CuKα 1 irradiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Pictures of the film morphologies and the cross-section of the device structure were made by high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy (HR-FESEM, FEI, Quanta 400). The current-voltage (I-V) curves were measured with a scan rate of 0.1 V s -1 (Keithley Instruments, 2612 Series SourceMeter) under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm -2 ) generated by a 94011A-ES Sol series Solar Simulator. PL measurements were taken by a continuous-wave laser source with a wavelength of 405 nm and a power density of 38 mW cm -2 at room temperature. The electrical poling of the device was conducted by applying different biases on the electrodes with 100 µm spacing for 30 s in the dark, and the current-voltage (I-V) curves were measured under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm -2 ) by a Keithley 2612 source meter. Computational Methods: DFT calculations were performed at the level of GGA in the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)  [67]  parameterization as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).  [68] [69] [70]  For hybrid halide perovskites containing MA and FA, long-range van der Waals interactions have been taken into account via the TS (Tkatchenko and Scheffler) scheme.  [68]  The predicted trends for the formation energies of all hybrid perovskites (MA/FAPbI/Br) using the PBE parameterization with and without van der Waals corrections are the same (see Table  S1 , Supporting Information). However, like most of the dispersion correction schemes, the TS correction scheme performs differently for all and hybrid systems.  [71]  Therefore, for the sake of consistency, the PBE parameterization without van der Waals correction was adopted when investigating the thermodynamics of the alkali ion incorporation in FA perovskites. The outermost s, p, and d (in the case of Pb) electrons are treated as valence electrons of which the interactions with the remaining ions is modeled by pseudopotentials generated within the projector-augmented wave method.  [72]  The diffusion barriers were calculated using the nudged elastic band method in conjunction with the climbing image method.  [73] [74] [75]  Unless specified otherwise, 2 × 2 × 2 supercells of pseudocubic structures were modeled and allowed to fully relax (cell shape, volume, and ion positions) during the structural optimization. An energy cutoff of 500 eV and 3 × 3 × 3 k-point meshes are used to achieve energy and force convergence of 0.1 meV and 2 meV Å -1 , respectively. The formation of pure FAPbI 3, and FAPbI 3 with alkali metal incorporated in A, B, and interstitial sites can be described by the following reactions, respectively FAI PbI FAPbI  + + = FAI PbI AI A FA PbI 2 1 - 3 X X X (3) FAI 1 PbI 2 AI FAPb A I A 2 ( 1 ) 3 X X X X X ( ) + - + = + - ( (2) ) 4 where X is the concentration of the A (alkali) ions incorporated in the perovskite lattice. A positive value of ΔH 0K indicates that the formation of the compound is thermodynamically not favorable. Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

Title: Efficient and Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells Manufactured by Pulsed Flash Infrared Annealing
approach to enhance the stability of the material under device working condition, i.e., light and thermal stress.  [6, 7]  ABX 3 halide perovskites most commonly used in solar cells contain cesium, methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA) in the A site, Pb in the B, and Br and I in the X site of the crystalline lattice.  [1, [8] [9] [10]  Compositions based on organic cations, such as MA and FA, can be prepared with a bandgap of around 1.5 eV, which is suited for an efficient single junction solar cell.  [11]  However, the presence of organic cations, and in particular the volatile MA, is linked to the relatively poor thermal stability and the high sensitivity to humid air, which affect most of the perovskite compositions employed in highly efficient PSCs.  [12] [13] [14] [15] [16]  Swapping entirely or in part the organic with inorganic cations, such as cesium (Cs), can help to enhance the stability of halide perovskites at the cost of a bandgap higher than 1.5,  [17, 18]  which is suboptimal for a single junction solar cells. For example, the fully inorganic CsPbI 3 perovskite has a bandgap of 1.7 eV, which is not optimal for single junction but is instead nearly ideally suited for perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell.  [19] [20] [21]  Unfortunately, CsPbI 3 is only stable in the photovoltaic active perovskite structure -black phase -at temperatures above 300 °C,  [22] [23] [24] [25]  which is not useful for applications. Partially (or completely) replacing iodide (I) with bromide (Br), i.e., exploring CsPbI x Br (3-x) compositions, can stabilize the active photovoltaic phase at room temperature with progressively increasing bandgap as the bromine content increases. This mixed halide approach is extensively used to prepared stable inorganic halide perovskite both for photo voltaic and light emitting devices.  [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32]  As restricted to photovoltaics, it is a challenge controlling the interplay between phase stability, which can be obtained by enhancing the Br content, while maintaining the smallest possible bandgap. Indeed, the larger ionic radius of I as compared to Br upsets the stability perovskite, which tends to relax in a photovoltaic inactive delta phase.  [33] [34] [35] [36] [37]  The I/Br ratio must be therefore adjusted to achieve the lowest possible bandgap without sacrificing the perovskite phase stability. In the search for the best I/Br ratio, CsPbI 2 Br (I 67%, Br 33%) has been so far indicated as the optimum to achieve the highest efficiency PSC with a stable inorganic perovskite.
Organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells have achieved impressive power conversion efficiency over the past years, yet operational stability remains the key concern. One strategy to improve long-term stability is to replace the thermally unstable organic with inorganic cations comprising the perovskite lattice. Here, for the first time, pulsed infrared light is used to drive the crystallization of inorganic mixed halide CsPbI x Br (3-x) perovskite films in solar cells with a power conversion efficiency exceeding 10%. By varying the iodide-bromine ratio systematically, it is found that to keep the inorganic perovskite black phase stable at the room temperature, the iodine content needs to be limited to lower than 60% -bromine content higher than 40%. The finding revises previous reports claiming stable compositions with higher iodine contents, which is systematically exploited to reduce the perovskite bandgap with the aim to enlarge the light absorption spectra and thus to boost the device efficiency. It is demonstrated that the newly defined stable compositional range enables devices that retain 90% of the efficiency after stressing the perovskite at 200 °C for 1 h. This result demonstrates that inorganic halide perovskites are stable materials for high-temperature applications such as concentrated photovoltaics. 
 Introduction Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown impressive lab-scale efficiency gains in a few years. However, additional work is needed to deliver a viable PSC technology for large-scale production.  [1] [2] [3]  This work includes the device stability and the close related stability of the perovskite primarily as one of the materials comprising the device.  [4, 5]  Tuning the chemical composition of the perovskite seems one of the most promising recently a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12%  [39]  for PSCs using CsPbI 2 Br. Together with the latest work, most of the previous publications identified in I 67%, Br 33% the best halide composition.  [40]  We believe that many research groups ended up with the same I/Br ratio since it can be prepared straightforwardly by dissolving an equimolar amount of the two precursors PbI 2 and CsBr in solution. Preparing different I/Br ratios requires at least three of the following precursors, PbI 2 , PbBr 2 , CsI, and CsBr, some of which are difficult to dissolve, imposing inconvenience during film preparation, and challenging to process in a thin film to prepare PSCs. In this work, we identify a window of compositions that revises previous reports, allowing bromine contents higher than 40% (iodine lower than 60%) in the preparation of stable inorganic mixed halide CsPbI x Br (3-x) perovskites. We make use of pulsed flash infrared annealing (p-FIRA) as a versatile new method to control the crystallization of inorganic perovskite films in solar cells with a PCE exceeding 10%. We prove the extraordinary thermal stability of inorganic perovskites reporting PSCs that retain 90% of the efficiency of a pristine perovskite film after heating for 1 h at 200 °C. 
 Results and Discussion 
 Stable Inorganic Perovskite Mixed Halide Composition We prepared a library of mixed halide compositions of inorganic CsPbI x Br (3-x) perovskite films from a single solution of the three precursors CsBr, PbI 2 and PbBr 2 , as detailed in the Experimental Section. Figure  1a  shows the optical transmission spectra for perovskite films prepared from different compositions around 60% of iodine (40% of bromine, CsPbI 1.8 Br 1.2 ). According to literature, increasing iodine content redshifts the absorption onset -lowers the bandgap. The plot in Figure  1b  displays the bandgap estimated from the optical transmittance spectra as a function of the iodine content. The trend is linear for freshly made films as reported in the literature, however, after 100 h of storing in the dark with a relative humidity lower than 35%, all the samples with iodine content above 60% exhibited a marked blueshift of the bandgap. The change in bandgap was also obvious comparing by eye freshly made and 100 h old films (inset Figure  1b ). Such a change is indicative of instability for the films prepared from the compositions with iodine content higher than 60%.  [41, 42]  Cesium-based perovskites prepared from mixed halide compositions adopt an orthorhombic crystal structure at room temperature.  [43] [44] [45]  However, for the pure iodide composition, the stable crystal structure below 300 °C is the "delta," also called yellow-phase (see the Supporting Information), which is unsuited for photovoltaic.  [37, [45] [46] [47]  Figure  1c  shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern for samples with 60% and 67% iodide contents, where the two main peaks at 30 and 15 2θ are characteristic of the orthorhombic perovskite structure.  [48] [49] [50]  We reported additional compositions in the Supporting Information. The same Figure  1c  displays the XRD pattern (red lines) for the same films left in the dark for about 100 h at room temperature and relative humidity lower than 38%. We can observe that while the pattern of the film I60%/Br40% (CsPbI 1.8 Br 1.2 ) remained substantially unchanged, the pattern of the film I67%/Br33% (CsPbI 2 Br) reported several new peaks that are indicative of a lower symmetry crystal structure. This result strides with the previous literature, which indicated CsPbI x Br (3-x) perovskites with iodine content higher than 60% as the path toward stable PSCs. Electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) was carried out to extract the Kikuchi patterns of the perovskite films as reported in Figure  1d . The contrast between the Kikuchi lines and the background provides a qualitative measurement of the crystallinity of the film. The as-prepared I60%/Br40% (CsPbI 1.8 Br 1.2 ) film shows a strong Kikuchi contrast, which is still well discernible after 100 h. The I67%/Br33% (CsPbI 2 Br) sample, on the other hand, displays a weaker contrast at 0 h, which decays almost completely after 100 h. This trend indicates a stable and higher crystallinity of CsPbI 1.8 Br 1.2 . On the contrary, the pattern of CsPbI 2 Br is indicative of lower crystallinity that decays over time.  [38]  We summarized the result of our finding in the schematic of Figure  1e . A boundary placed at 60% iodine/40% bromine interrupts the continuous line of iodine/bromine compositions. All the compositions with iodine content lower than 60% -bromine content higher than 40% -have a stable orthorhombic perovskite structure at room temperature. CsPbBr 3 crystallizes in the orthorhombic (Pnma) space group, adopting a distorted perovskite structure, the distortion occurs through two successive phase transitions at 88 and 130 °C, transforming the crystal structure to tetragonal (P4/mbm) and cubic (Pm-w).  [51] [52] [53]  All the compositions with bromine content lower than 40% -iodine higher than 60% -evolves toward the delta phase, which is characteristic of the 100% iodine composition. The phase stability sets the lower accessible bandgap for CsPbI x Br (3-x) perovskite to 1.9-2 eV. To support the phase stability finding, we made perovskite solar cells (see the Experimental Section for details) with halide compositions of I62%/Br38% and I65%/Br35%. After 100 h of storing devices in normal environment condition, they showed a loss in efficiency of 15% and 50%, respectively (Figure  S2 , Supporting Information). 
 Thermal Stability In addition to the challenge of preparing a phase stable CsPbI x Br (3-x) perovskite, which we demonstrated for iodine content below 60%, the thermal stability  [17, 54, 55]  is a fundamental requirement for PSC applications.  [57, 58]  Standard terrestrial solar cells working condition need for 85 °C stable materials and devices, but significantly higher temperature are required for applications such as concentrated photovoltaics.  [56]  In Figure  2a , we compared inorganic perovskite comprising three different halide compositions, with an iodine content below 60%, with the most widely used hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, i.e., the MA, FA mixed composition MA 0.15 FA 0.8 Cs 0.05 PbI 2.5 Br 0.5 . All three inorganic perovskite films maintained their color upon extended annealing at 200 °C, a temperature that is almost 3 times higher than standard solar cell operating temperatures. In contrast, the hybrid perovskite film rapidly changed color from black to a yellow as soon as the temperature passes 100 °C.  [16, 57, 58]  The XRD patterns in Figure  2b  support the stability of the inorganic perovskite showing that the main two peaks at 16° and 30° remain practically unchanged upon heating at 200 °C for 1 h. On the contrary, the XRD pattern proves that the hydride perovskite film degrades to PbI 2 , which suggest the complete loss of the organic component. Figure  2c  shows the transmittance spectra of the inorganic perovskites before and after annealing. The absorption onset of each inorganic composition remains stable. We explored the thermal degradation mechanisms of the hybrid and inorganic halide perovskite using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).  [56]  Figure  3a  shows the TGA weight losses curves of 3 inorganic and the hybrid perovskite compositions for a temperature ramped up to 600 °C at 0 °C min -1 . The hybrid perovskite reported a clear weight loss at about 250 °C, followed by a plateau and a second marked weight loss at ≈400 °C. We explained the two-stage process to the degradation of the organic cations (MA and FA) at around 300 °C followed by loss of halide above 400 °C.  [10, 57, 59]  As expected from the absence of the organic component, all the inorganic perovskite compositions reported a significant weight only after passing 400 °C. To identify any thermally induced structural transitions of the inorganic compositions, we performed a DSC analysis as shown in Figure  3b . The curve for the iodide-rich stoichiometry (red line) exhibits an exothermic feature at ≈330 °C, which we attributed to the transition from orthorhombic to cubic perovskite structure as previously discussed.  [24, 37]  The 50% I/Br perovskite composition also shows this transition, albeit less pronounced, while the bromine-rich material lacks completely of this feature, suggesting the most thermal stable chemical composition. Thermal decomposition of all the inorganic materials sets in well above 400 °C, starting from the less stable rich in iodide and finishing with the rich bromine composition.  [6, 60, 61]    
 Grain Size Tuning Using p-FIRA Thermal annealing of films after preparation is typically used to influence film morphology. Since the PSC performance strongly depends on the structure and morphology of the perovskite layer, detailed annealing protocols, e.g., flash annealing, and prolonged heating steps often result in efficiency gains.  [62, 63]  While the use of FIRA has been reported in our previous work,  [64]  prolonged annealing with high-intensity IR light may cause perovskite degradation. Here, we have modified the FIRA protocol using very short high-intensity IR pulses and optimized this protocol to obtain homogeneous compact inorganic perovskite films. Since perovskite crystallization proceeds by nucleation and growth, the optimization of the film morphology requires control over both the nucleation and growth processes. In a reasonably flat TiO 2 layer nucleation causes the formation of surface islands which subsequently grow and fuse.  [65]  Both the kinetic processes take place far from thermodynamic equilibrium and are affected by the heat flow. The p-FIRA method offers unprecedented control over the whole kinetic processes, dialing in, for example, the activation energy as a function of the irradiation time.  [66]  Figure  4a  shows different pulse sequences consisting of 20 ms short flashes that are repeated 0-25 times, followed by a 2 s annealing pulse. The variation of the oven temperature measured with an infrared camera is also plotted. Figure  4b  shows the resulting perovskite film morphology. With only the 2 s annealing pulse, the formation of ≈10 μm sized cuboids is observed. With the addition of 20 ms flashes, the cuboid shapes become more homogeneous, and the cuboid density increases with increasing flash number. This trend suggests that the flashes can initiate perovskite nucleation, multiplying the nuclei with each flash of an extended series of flashes. The longer annealing pulse is less effective in causing crystal nucleation, instead of enabling already nucleated crystals to grow. As evident from Figure  4b , a higher nucleation density ultimately results in more homogeneous films, rendering them nearly pinhole free when 25 flash pulses are used. Figure  4c  shows in comparison a triple cation containing hybrid perovskite film resulting from a 2 s FIRA pulse, reproducing the large crystal domains that this system forms upon simple FIRA annealing, as previously reported.  [64]  A more detailed analysis of p-FIRA crystal formation is shown in the Supporting Information, also showing that film quality does not significantly change for more than ≈23 pulses. The cross-section of the 25-pulse sample in Figure  4d  confirms the excellent homogeneity of this sample across the thickness of the perovskite film. Note that the overall irradiation process takes place in less than 50 s and stabilizes the perovskite phase without halide evaporation. The compactness of the 25-pulse film is a prerequisite for device manufacture. 
 Photovoltaic Performance and Stability We used inorganic perovskite compositions CsPbI x Br (3-x) with x = 1.8 (I60%, Br40%), 1.5 (I50%, Br50%), and 1.2 (I40%, Br60%) to prepared PSCs as detailed in the Supporting Information. Figure  5a  shows the current-voltage (JV) curves of each champion devices for the three compositions and the PCE histogram for 10 devices for each composition. The composition with the highest content of iodide enabled higher PCE devices, as expected from the smaller bandgap. The devices prepared with the bromine-richer perovskite reported the highest open-circuit voltage (V oc ) value of 1.3 V consistent with the largest bandgap.  [10]  The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum collected for the champion device is reported in Figure  5b  displaying a short-circuit current of 12 mA cm -2 , which is close agreement with the value (12.3 mA cm -2 ) extracted from the JV curve in Figure  5a . The EQE plot also confirms a bandgap of roughly 2.0 eV (640 nm) for this particular halide composition. The stability PSCs with the three stoichiometries were tested in two ways. The first batch of devices was irradiated for 1000 h with an AM1.5 spectrum under an inert atmosphere, followed by a JV measurement. In a second stability test, the perovskite layers were annealed at 200 °C for 1 h before finalizing the device manufacture with the deposition of the hole selective contact (poly(triarylamine) (PTAA), see the Experimental Section) and the gold contact. Figure  5c  shows the PCE of freshly made (control) and stressed devices under light (100 h AM1.5) or high temperature (1 h at 200 °C), including the PCE distribution (box plot) for 5 independent devices prepared for each stoichiometry. Despite the harshness of the stability measurements, the PCE values deteriorated only by 10-16% compared to the control devices, with bromine-rich devices showing slightly higher stability (10-11% losses) compared to iodide-rich devices (13-16% losses). A comparison of the JV curves for 1000 h AM1.5 and 200 °C-annealed devices made from the CsPbI 1.5 Br 1.5 perovskite are shown in the Supporting Information. Table  1  lists the champion device performance parameters collected for each chemical composition. We observe that performance loss upon both light and thermal stress arises almost exclusively from a deterioration of the short-circuit current (J sc ), while the V oc and the fill factor (FF) remained unaffected or they even improved. The light soaking experiment of 1000 h with an AM1.5 spectrum demonstrated the photostability of the optimized mixed halide inorganic perovskite. According to the report by Hoke et al., this result suggests the absence of halide segregation that may hamper the photostability of mixed halide perovskites.  [67] [68] [69]   
 Conclusions Our study demonstrates a new strategy to manufacture inorganic halide perovskites, paving the way for their use as efficient and thermally stable photovoltaic. We made use of p-FIRA to manufacture compact and pinhole free films of mixed halide CsPbI x Br (3-x) inorganic perovskites. We screened through the iodine/bromine mixed halide compositions with the aim to identify the most stable and effective material for solar cells. In contrast with past works, we found that a bromine content higher than 40% is needed to get a stable perovskite phase. Thus, we used stable compositions to demonstrated perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency exciding 10%. Most impressive, the devices retained 90% of their efficiency after heating the perovskite film at 200 °C for 1 h. This combination of thermal stability and device performance is unprecedented. This result demonstrates the technological viability of perovskite for high-temperature applications such as concentrated photovoltaics. 
 Experimental Section Photovoltaic devices were fabricated on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)coated glass (Pilkington NSG TEC). The substrates were cleaned with Hellmanex soap, followed by 30 min sonication in a Hellmanex 2% water solution, 15 min sonication in isopropyl alcohol, and 5 min of oxygen plasma etching. Then, 30 nm thick TiO 2 compact layers were deposited onto the FTO by spray pyrolysis at 450 °C from a precursor solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in anhydrous ethanol and acetylacetonate. After spraying, the FTO substrates were left at 450 °C for 5 min before cooling to room temperature. Then, a mesoporous TiO 2 layer was deposited by spin coating for 10 s at 4000 rpm with a ramp of 2000 rpm s -1 , using a 30 nm particle size TiO 2 paste (Dyesol 30 NR-D) diluted in ethanol to achieve 150-200 nm thick mesoporous layers. After spin coating, the FTO substrates were dried at 100 °C for 10 min, and the films were annealed on a programmable hot plate (2000 W, Harry Gestigkeit GmbH) to crystallize TiO 2 at 450 °C for 30 min under dry air flow. Li doping of the mesoporous TiO 2 , as described elsewhere,  [70]  was accomplished by spin coating a 0.1 M solution of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonylimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) in acetonitrile at 3000 rpm for 10 s followed by another sintering step at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to 150 °C, all the substrates were kept on the fume hood (with relative humidity below to 38%) for the deposition of the perovskite films.  Perovskite Solar Cell Preparation: The organic salts were purchased from Dyesol; the cesium and lead compounds from TCI. The hybrid perovskite precursor solutions were deposited from a precursor solution containing CH 5 N 2 I (1 M), PbI 2 (1.1 M), CH 3 NH 3 Br (0.2 M), and PbBr 2 (0.2 M) in anhydrous dimethylformamide:dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 4:1 v:v. Note that this composition contained a lead excess as reported elsewhere.  [71]  Then CsI, dissolved as a 1.5 M stock solution in DMSO, was added to the mixed perovskite precursor to achieve the desired triple cation composition. The inorganic perovskite precursor solution was deposited from a precursor solution containing CsI (1.2 M), and to obtain the three final stoichiometries of CsPbI x Br (3-x) , a variation of PbI 2 (0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 M) and PbBr 2 (1, 0.9, and 0.8 M) for x = 1.2, x = 1.5, x = 1.8, respectively. To hybrid perovskite films, a hybrid-containing solution was spin-coated at 6000 rpm 20 s, and 100 μL of chlorobenzene antisolvent was poured onto the spinning substrate 5 s before the end of the program. The substrates were then annealed at 100 °C for 1 h in a nitrogen-filled glove box. After perovskite annealing, the substrates were cooled down within a few minutes. Perovskite films made by the FIRA included the spin coating of the perovskite solution in a single step at 4000 rpm for 10 s.  [64]  The substrates were then IR irradiated in the FIRA oven, with 20 ms pulses from 0 to 25 and 2 s flashing and all the substrates were kept there for 10 s additionally before removal. The FIRA processing was carried out in a standard fume hood. Immediately after cooling the perovskite films, a PTAA (Merck) solution (35 × 10 -3 M in toluene) was deposited by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 20 s. PTAA was doped with Li-TFSI (Sigma-Aldrich),) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, Sigma-Aldrich). The molar ratio of the additives to PTAA was: 0.0825 and 3.9 for Li-TFSI and TBP, respectively. Finally, an 80 nm thick gold top electrode was thermally evaporated under high vacuum. Photovoltaic Device Testing: For photovoltaic measurements, a solar simulator from ABET Technologies (Model 11016 Sun 2000) with a xenon arc lamp was used, and the solar cell response was recorded using a Metrohm PGSTAT302N Autolab. The intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated to 100 mW cm -2 using a silicon reference cell from ReRa Solutions (KG5 filtered). JV curves were measured at reverse and forward bias at a scan rate of 10 mV s -1 ; this slow scan rate was used in all JV measurements to minimize hysteresis effects. A shadow mask with a 0.1 cm 2 aperture was used to define the active device area. The EQE setup used was integrated inside the nitrogen-filled glove box with an inert atmosphere including an Oriel Instruments QEPVSI-b system, a Xenon arc lamp -Newport 300 W, a chopper (put at 35.5 Hz), and Newport Cornerstone 260 monochromator. A silicon diode was used to calibrate the lamp to subtract the background light noise. The monochromatic light spot was controlled such that the spot fit inside the active area of the device and the sample was ≈1.05 mm away from the light source. EQE measurements were carried out at short circuit. Temperature Measurements: The temperature in the FIRA chamber was measured using a K-type thermocouple connected to an Analog Devices AD595 amplifier interfaced with Labview software. Material Characterization: Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were carried out on a Tescan MIRA 3 LMH with a field emission source operated at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV using an octane-pro energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector. Electron backscattering diffraction was performed with HKL Advanced EBSD System using a Nordlys Nano Camera. Powder X-ray diffraction was performed in transmission geometry with Cu target (λ = 1.5401 Å) using an STOE STADI P diffractometer. Optical transmission measurements were performed using a Zeiss Axio-Scope A1 Pol using a Zeiss EC Epiplan-Apochromat 20 × objective and a xenon light source (Ocean Optics HPX-2000). For spectroscopic measurements, an optical fiber (QP230-2-XSR, 230 μm core) collected the light reflected from the sample. The spectra were recorded by a spectrometer (Ocean Optics Maya2000 Pro), and a standard white diffuser was used as a reference. DSC measurements were performed using a Mettler-Toledo STAR system under a N 2 atmosphere. Experiments involving different heating and cooling cycles were performed on ≈3 mg samples placed in standard DSC pans at 10 °C min -1 . Thermogravimetric analysis for powder materials was carried out in a PerkinElmer TGA 4000. 2-3 mg samples were placed in ceramic pans, and the weight loss was monitored between 25 and 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C min -1 under a nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL min -1 . Powder samples were carefully scraped off the substrates right after annealing. Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

of photochemical and environmental stresses. X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig.  4B ) analysis showed that performance degradation corresponded to the decomposition of the crystalline perovskite material into PbI 2 , which was not observed for the fully coated devices (see section 6 in the supplementary materials). Given the stabilizing effect of the fluoropolymeric coating applied on both sides of the cells, a second aging test was designed to verify the stability of the front/back-coated PSCs under real outdoor atmospheric conditions, where temperature variations, precipitation phenomena, and pollution are typically encountered. A batch of five cells was exposed on the terrace of the Politecnico di Torino building in Turin (45°06′N, 7°66′E), located in northwest Italy, in a humid subtropical climate zone from October to December 2015. The PSCs were subjected to highly variable climatic conditions, as outdoor temperatures ranged from -3°to +27°C, and 27 out of 92 days were characterized by heavy rain and storms  (33) , as shown in Fig.  4C . The front/back-coated PSCs exhibited long-term stability retaining 95% of their initial efficiency after this test by (i) protecting the perovskite from UV radiation, converting it into exploitable visible photons; (ii) acting as a moisture barrier, thus preventing hydrolytic phenomena of the perovskite material; and (iii) keeping the front electrode clean by means of the easy-cleaning characteristics of this fluorinated polymer. Similar results were found for outdoor tests performed during Summer 2016, and the data collected are available in section 7 in the supplementary materials. To demonstrate the water resistance of the photopolymerized fluorinated coatings, we kept five solar cells for 1 month in a closed chamber in the presence of a beaker containing boiling water (95% RH, fig.  S1C ), and the photovoltaic response was evaluated once a week. After 1 month, four of the five cells withstood the strong aging conditions and remarkably retained 96 ± 2% of their initial PCE. Only one device lost 95% of its initial efficiency after the first week. After inspection, we found a small area on the back side of the solar cell not thoroughly coated by the fluoropolymeric layer. The nonhomogeneous deposition of the coating caused a gradual hydrolysis of the underlying perovskite layer. We also dipped the front/back-coated devices into water. After 1 day of immersion, no changes in their photovoltaic performance were observed.

 Incorporation of rubidium cations into perovskite solar cells improves photovoltaic performance Michael Saliba, 1 * † Taisuke Matsui, 1,2 † Konrad Domanski, 1 † Ji-Youn Seo, 1 Amita Ummadisingu, 1 Shaik M. Zakeeruddin, 1 Juan-Pablo Correa-Baena, 3  Wolfgang R. Tress, 1 Antonio Abate, 1 Anders Hagfeldt, 3 Michael Grätzel 1 * All of the cations currently used in perovskite solar cells abide by the tolerance factor for incorporation into the lattice. We show that the small and oxidation-stable rubidium cation (Rb + ) can be embedded into a "cation cascade" to create perovskite materials with excellent material properties. We achieved stabilized efficiencies of up to 21.6% (average value, 20.2%) on small areas (and a stabilized 19.0% on a cell 0.5 square centimeters in area) as well as an electroluminescence of 3.8%. The open-circuit voltage of 1.24 volts at a band gap of 1.63 electron volts leads to a loss in potential of 0.39 volts, versus 0.4 volts for commercial silicon cells. Polymer-coated cells maintained 95% of their initial performance at 85°C for 500 hours under full illumination and maximum power point tracking. ]; a divalent metal, M (Pb 2+ or Sn 2+ ); and an anion, X (Cl -, Br -, or I -). The highestefficiency perovskites are Pb-based with mixed MA/FA cations and Br/I halides (2-4). Recently, Cs was used to explore more complex cation combinations: Cs/MA, Cs/FA, and Cs/MA/FA (5-9). These perovskite formulations exhibit unexpected properties. For example, Cs/FA mixtures suppress halide segregation, enabling band gaps for perovskite/silicon tandems  (10) . The Cs/MA/ FA-based solar cells are more reproducible and thermally stable than MA/FA mixtures  (9) . In general, increasing the perovskite complexity is motivated by the need to improve stability by adding more inorganic elements and increasing the entropy of mixing, which can stabilize ordinarily unstable materials (such as the "yellow," nonphotoactive phase of FAPbI 3 that can be avoided by using small amounts of the otherwise unstable CsPbI 3 ) (6, 7). However, all combinations of Cs, MA, and FA cations were selected because each individually forms a photoactive perovskite "black" phase (11-13). Further progress requires exploration of a wider circle of cations. Unfortunately, most monovalent cations are mismatched to sustain a photoactive APbI 3 perovskite with an appropriate Goldschmidt tolerance factor [t ¼ ðr A þ r I Þ= ffiffi ffi 2 p ðr Pb þ r I Þ , where r is ionic radius] between 0.8 and 1.0  (14, 15) , rendering almost all elemental cations too small for consideration. We illustrate this point in Fig.  1A , which shows tolerance factor calculations for the alkali metals (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) as well as MA and FA (see table  S1  for numeric values and ionic radii). We selected specifically the alkali metals that are oxidation-stable monovalent cations, as these would have a stability advantage over oxidation-prone Pb/Sn mixtures that have distorted material electronic properties  (16) . The tolerance factor shows that only CsPbI 3 , MAPbI 3 , and FAPbI 3 fall into the range of "established perovskites" with a black phase. Li, Na, and K are clearly outside of the range, whereas RbPbI 3 only misses by a small margin. The ionic radii of Cs and Rb are 167 pm and 152 pm, respectively. This small difference still has a large impact, with RbPbI 3 and CsPbI 3 drawing the demarcation line between photoactive black perovskite and photoinactive yellow nonperovskite phases. As shown by heating CsPbI 3 and RbPbI 3 films at different temperatures (Fig.  1B ), both films are yellow at 28°C; upon heating to 380°C, only CsPbI 3 turns black, whereas RbPbI 3 remains yellow. At 460°C, both films start melting irreversibly, without RbPbI 3 ever showing a black phase; this is consistent with the observations of Trots and Myagkota  (17) . Thus, only CsPbI 3 has a black phase, which explains why Rb has so far not been used for PSCs despite its desirable oxidation stability. In this work, we propose embedding Rb + , only slightly smaller than Cs + , into a photoactive perovskite phase using multiple A-cation formulations. We retain FA as the majority cation because of the beneficial, red-shifted band gap. We identify four previously unexplored combinations: RbFA, RbCsFA, RbMAFA, and RbCsMAFA. In  (18)     (18) . We use the nomenclature of RbFA, RbCsFA, RbMAFA, and RbCsMAFA to denote the entire perovskite compounds at the optimized values found in  (18)  (usually achieved with an addition of 5 to 10% Rb). Reasonable device performances were reached with RbFA (14%), RbCsFA (19.3%), RbMAFA (19.2%) [comparable to CsFA (20%)], and CsMAFA (19.2%), as shown in figs. S1 to S3 (measured on a device area of 0.16 cm 2 ). Thus, Rb can stabilize the black phase of FA perovskite and be integrated into PSCs, despite not being suitable as a pure RbPbI 3 compound. Surprisingly, RbCsMAFA (with 5% Rb; fig.  S3 ) resulted in PCEs of 20.6%, with an open-circuit voltage V oc of 1186 mV  (18) . Hence, we focus below on RbCsMAFA to substantiate the impact of the Rb + integration approach for PSCs. We investigated the starting condition of the crystallization process for the RbCsMAFA compound  upon annealing at 100°C, which is needed to fully crystallize the perovskite films. In Fig.  2A , we present the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and photoluminescence (PL) data of the unannealed MAFA and RbCsMAFA films. Whereas MAFA showed several PL peaks with maxima ranging from 670 to 790 nm, the RbCsMAFA film had a narrow peak at 770 nm attributable to perovskite. The insets in Fig.  2A  are fluorescence microscopy maps of the surface of the unannealed films, showing that the MAFA films comprise various emissive species that force the preannealed film to crystallize with inhomogeneous starting conditions. However, the RbCsMAFA films were emissive in a narrow range and began to crystallize from more homogeneous conditions. Thus, the addition of the inorganic cations enforced a crystallization that starts with a photoactive perovskite phase (near the final emission after annealing) instead of a mixture of varying emissions that need to converge toward the final emission (see Fig.  2C ). These results are consistent with the high reproducibility and lack of yellow phase in the RbCsMAFA films. Furthermore, we collected the corresponding x-ray diffraction (XRD) data of the unannealed films (Fig.  2B ) that showed a pronounced perovskite peak for RbCsMAFA as compared to MAFA films. In Fig.  2, C  and D , we show analogous data after annealing, including UV-vis, PL, and XRD data, that reveal a RbCsMAFA band gap of ~1.63 eV (slightly blue-shifted relative to MAFA at ~1.62 eV) containing neither a PbI 2 nor a yellow-phase peak. The low-angle perovskite peaks for MAFA and RbCsMAFA occur at 14.17°and 14.25°, respectively, revealing that Rb indeed modified the crystal lattice. In figs. S5 and S6, we show XRD data of RbMAFA perovskite where we increased the concentration of Rb. We observed, similar to CsMAFA  (9) , that the Pb excess and the yellow-phase impurities of MAFA perovskite disappeared when Rb was added. For Rb 5 MAFA, there was a shift to wider angles for the perovskite peak. Moreover, in figs. S7 and S8, we show a series of RbCsMAFA perovskite with an increased amount of Rb together with a RbPbI 3 reference. We observed that the perovskite peak shifted to wider angles for Rb 5 CsMAFA as well as further suppression of the residual PbI 2 (12.7°) and yellow-phase peak (11.7°) of FA-based perovskite. As more Rb was added, we noted the appearance of a second peak at 13.4°a nd a double peak at 10.1°that coincide with the peaks for the pure yellow-phase RbPbI 3 , indicating phase segregation at higher Rb concentrations. This is in good agreement with previous work where a phase segregation was also observed as more and more Cs was added to FA-based perovskite  (8) . In addition, top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed large crystals in the RbCsMAFA devices (fig.  S9 ), which have been shown to be beneficial for the PV metrics  (19) . Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy measurements (fig.  S10 ) indicated the presence and distribution of Cs and Rb within the perovskite layer. We collected statistical data on RbCsMAFA devices (with 12 CsMAFA and 17 RbCsMAFA devices measured at a scan rate of 10 mV s -1 , without preconditioning such as light soaking or longterm forward voltage biasing; see fig.  S11 ) and observed superior performance relative to CsMAFA. Remarkably, the average V oc increased from 1120 to 1158 mV and the fill factor (FF) increased from 0.75 to 0.78. In Fig.  3A , we show that the bestperforming RbCsMAFA cell reached a stabilized power output of 21.6% with FF of 81% and V oc of 1180 mV. The measured short-circuit current density J sc matched the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) measurement in fig.  S12 . We also achieved a stabilized PCE of 19.0% on a large-area 0.5-cm 2 device (see fig.  S13 ). To correctly determine the value of V oc , we investigated RbCsMAFA devices with the active area being fully illuminated, held at room temperature, and under an inert nitrogen atmosphere. This setup permitted an accurate V oc value without heating or degradation effects (from moisture, for example). In Fig.  3B , for one of our highest-performing devices, we measured an outstanding V oc of 1240 mV, as confirmed by the inset tracking V oc over time. The "loss in potential" (difference between V oc and band gap) is only ~0.39 V, which is one of the lowest recorded for any PV material, implying very small nonradiation recombination losses  (20) . The high V oc is particularly intriguing because this is the major parameter preventing PSCs from reaching their thermodynamic limit (J sc and FF are already approaching their maximal values). Theoretically, in very pure, defect-free materials with only radiative recombination, the loss in potential can be as small as 0.23 V (band gap of 1 eV) to 0.3 V (band gap of 2 eV). In particular, silicon, the main industrial PV material, cannot approach this limit because of its indirect band gap and Auger recombination, exhibiting a loss in potential of ~0.4 V for the most efficient devices  (20) . The nonradiative recombination losses were quantified by measuring the external electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQE EL ), which is > 1% at a driving current that is equal to the shortcircuit current (see Fig.  3C ). This value is in the    S2 . The inset shows the scan rate-independent MPP tracking for 60 s, resulting in a stabilized efficiency of 21.6% at 977 mV and 22.1 mA cm -2 (displayed as triangles in the J-V and MPP scans). (B) J-V curve of the highest-V oc device. The inset shows the V oc over 120 s, resulting in 1240 mV (displayed as the red triangles in the J-V and V oc scans).

The right inset shows a solar cell (device size ~1.4 cm × 2.8 cm) with two active areas. The left area is operated as an LED displaying a clearly visible red emission even under ambient light. At the same time, the right area can be operated as a solar cell or a photodetector. (D) Thermal stability test of a perovskite solar cell. The device was aged for 500 hours at 85°C under continuous full illumination and MPP tracking in a nitrogen atmosphere (red curve, circles). This aging routine exceeds industry norms. During the light soaking at 85°C, the device retained 95% (dashed line) of its initial performance. same order of magnitude and thus consistent with a measured external PL quantum yield of 3.6% for RbCsMAFA (and 2.4% for CsMAFA). Following the approach in  (21) (22) (23) (24) (25)  [see also fig.  S14  and (  18 )], we used the EQE EL and the emission spectrum to predict a V oc value of 1240 mV, confirming independently the value measured from the J-V curve. Furthermore, for higher driving currents, the EQE EL in Fig.  3C reaches 3 .8%, making the solar cell one of the most efficient perovskite LEDs as well, emitting in the near-infrared/red spectral range (Fig.  3C , inset)  (26) (27) (28) . Movie S1 shows a RbCsMAFA device mounted in our custom-made device holder. As we tuned toward maximum emission and back, we observed bright EL in daylight. For comparison, for commercially available Si solar cells, EQE EL ≈ 0.5%  (20) . These values for our PSC devices indicate that all major sources of nonradiative recombination were strongly suppressed and that the material has very low bulk and surface defect density. We also investigated transport behavior by means of intensitymodulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS); the findings suggest that the charge transport within the RbCsMAFA perovskite layer is substantially faster than in CsMAFA, which is already much more defect-free than MAFA  (19)  [see also fig.  S15  and  (18) ]. Despite the high efficiencies and an outstanding EL, this Rb-containing perovskite material must be able to achieve high stability. This task is not trivial given the hygroscopic nature of perovskite films, phase instabilities, and light sensitivity  (29) . Interestingly, the Achilles' heel of PSCs is not necessarily the perovskite itself, but rather the commonly used spiro-OMeTAD hole transporter material that becomes permeable (at elevated temperature) to metal electrode diffusion into the perovskite, causing irreversible degradation  (30, 31) . This effect can be mitigated with buffer layers or by avoiding the use of metal electrodes  (30) (31) (32) . Alternatively, for the combined heat-light stress tests in this work, we found a thin layer of polytriarylamine polymer (PTAA) (see SEM image in fig.  S4B ) to work equally well  (33) . We imposed the above protocols simultaneously and aged devices for 500 hours at 85°C under continuous illumination with full intensity and maximum power point (MPP) tracking in a nitrogen atmosphere. This compounded stress test exceeds industrial standards  (34) . We show the result in Fig.  3D  (red curve). The device started with >17% efficiency at room temperature before the aging protocol was applied (see fig.  S16  for non-normalized values of PCE, FF, J sc , V oc , J MPP , and V MPP ). During the 85°C step (in which V oc is inevitably lowered), the device retained 95% of its initial performance. L ow-cost perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 22.1% (1). The organicinorganic perovskites used for photovoltaics (PV) have an AMX 3 formula that comprises a monovalent cation, A [cesium Cs + , methylammonium (MA) CH 3 NH 3 + , or formamidinium (FA) CH 3 (NH 2 ) 2 +
