Title: Highly transparent all-perovskite luminescent solar concentrator/photovoltaic windows †
Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) play a major role as light suppliers at the boundaries between indoor and outdoor spaces in buildings. The performances of solar panels coupled with LSCs are directly influenced by the photoluminescence (PL) characteristics of fluorophores, among which inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) have shown great potential. A large Stokes shift in these NCs spanning the ultraviolet (UV), visible, and near-infrared regions can be achieved through metal doping, leading to significant improvements in the PL quantum yields and reduced PL reabsorption. However, practical approaches for coupling perovskite LSCs (PeLSCs) with perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are lacking. The design of all-perovskite LSC/photovoltaic (PV) windows is essential to prepare perovskite-based building-integrated PV systems. Thus, Mn-doped CsPbCl 3 NCs were employed as PL-reabsorption-free fluorophores for LSCs. Their significant Stokes shift allowed for efficient PL propagation to the LSC edges. The Mn:CsPbCl 3 /polystyrene composite films used in the LSCs demonstrated excellent optical transparencies and low haze values. When coupled with 16 series-connected high-efficiency PSCs, the PeLSC/PV windows exhibited impressive optical (5.38%) and power conversion (0.43%) efficiencies at a large geometric factor of 25 under 1 sun illumination. Using PeLSC/PV windows as self-powered UV light detectors, an excellent responsivity, specific detectivity, and noise equivalent power were obtained due to strong PL emission from the LSCs, even under weak UV light. An excellent power conversion efficiency was retained (86.3%) after 1000 h of operation due to protection of the solar absorbers from UV light by the long-wavelength PL emission of the LSCs.
Introduction The demand for novel nanostructures in solar energy conversion platforms continues to grow to expand their applications and increase electricity production. Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) have shown great potential and feasibility in emerging optoelectronics and solar energy industries.  [1] [2] [3]  More specically, owing to their exceptional luminescence characteristics with controllable light absorption and emission bands, PeNCs are strong candidates for uorophores in luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs).  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  LSCs distribute photoluminescence (PL) on the edges of transparent substrates and serve as light sources for solar panels. This allows the retention of a building's appearance and enables low-cost electricity production linked to self-powered systems, both indoors and outdoors, ultimately contributing to the efficient design of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs).  9, 10  LSCs incorporating PeNCs (PeLSCs) exhibit excellent performances that are comparable to those of conventional quantum dot (QD)-based LSCs.  11, 12  In particular, the environmental stabilities and PL quantum yields (PLQYs) of inorganic CsPbX 3 NCs (X = Cl, Br, and I) have been signicantly improved compared with those of organic-inorganic hybrid PeNCs.  [13] [14] [15]  In addition, solutionbased methods such as spin coating, slot-die coating, 3D printing, inkjet printing, and electrospinning have been demonstrated to produce large-area homogeneous lightemitting layers on windows, which have demonstrated impressive optical efficiencies >3%.  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20]  However, severe PL reabsorption among adjacent NCs remains an ongoing issue in the development of PeLSCs. Such reabsorption leads to a signicant reduction in the efficiency of photon collection at the edges, mainly because of the wide spectral overlap between light absorption and PL emission from the visible to the near-infrared (NIR) regions. To address this, inorganic and carbon-based QDs can be modied by introducing core-shell structures or using ligand engineering to achieve large Stokes shis.  [21] [22] [23]  The resulting prolonged PL propagation helps retain the optical efficiency of the LSCs, even when the geometric factor (G) increases signicantly. Accordingly, several efforts to suppress PL reabsorption in PeLSCs have proposed the chemical doping of CsPbCl 3 NCs.  14, [24] [25] [26]  Whilst pristine CsPbCl 3 NCs are known to exhibit spectral overlap in their light absorption and PL emission properties between 300 and 400 nm, Mn-and Yb-doped CsPbCl 3 NCs have demonstrated strong dual PL emission at 618 and 985 nm, respectively.  14, 24  Such signicant Stokes shis can improve the optical transparencies and efficiencies of LSCs, thereby enabling the design of PL-reabsorption-free PeLSCs. Despite the above advantages, the majority of studies performed on PeLSCs have continued to employ Si solar cells because their coupling provides simple characterization of the LSC performance. Designing all-perovskite LSC/photovoltaic (PV) windows is therefore necessary to expand the applicability of PeLSCs and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in next-generation BIPV systems. Considering the broad absorption spectrum of perovskite solar absorbers in the visible range, it is possible to efficiently utilize the PL emitted by PeLSCs. Furthermore, PSCs with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) surpassing those of Si solar cells should be able to produce high photovoltages and currents. Thus, we herein report the development of an all-perovskite LSC/PV transparent window, as shown in Fig.  1 . Initially, Mn-doped CsPbCl 3 (Mn:CsPbCl 3 ) NCs are prepared using presynthesized Cs-oleate precursors. The level of Mn doping is increased to evaluate its effect on the PL emission and absorption properties of the system. Following the deposition of nanocomposite lms of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 NCs and polystyrene (PS) on quartz glass windows, the optical transparency, PL distribution, and haze are examined and compared with those of a pure Mn:CsPbCl 3 lm. In addition, 16 n-i-p structured PSCs and Mn:CsPbCl 3 /PS LSCs are integrated, with a top area of 100 cm 2 . The PCEs of series-connected devices are evaluated under various G conditions with 1 sun illumination, and the developed PV window is applied as an ultraviolet (UV) photodetector, whose responsivity, specic detectivity, and noise equivalent power (NEP) are subsequently determined. Additionally, formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr 3 ) NCs are employed in a controlled LSC to compare the effects of the Stokes shi and spectral overlap on device performance.

Tin(II) chloride hydrate (SnCl 2 $xH 2 O, 99.995%) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientic. Methylammonium iodide (MAI, 99.8%), formamidinium iodide (FAI, 99.8%), and formamidinium bromide (FABr, 99.8%) were purchased from GreatCell Solar. 2,2 0 ,7,7 0 -Tetrakis [N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9 0 -spirobiuorene (spiro-OMeTAD) was purchased from Lumtec, while Ecoex 0035 Fast™ was purchased from Smooth-On, Inc. The FAPbIBr 2 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving FIA (172 mg), PbBr 2 (367 mg), and DMSO (78 mg) in DMF (600 mg). The MAPbI 3 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving MAI (159 mg), PbI 2 (461 mg), and DMSO (78 mg) in DMF (600 mg). The solutions were mixed in a xed molar ratio (MAPbI 3 : FAPbIBr 2 = 0.95 : 0.05).  27  The spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving Li-TFSI (5.6 mg), tBP (28 mg), and spiro-OMeTAD (56 mg) in CB (1 mL). 
 Synthesis of the Cs-oleate precursor In a three-neck round-bottom ask, Cs 2 CO 3 (1.25 mmol), OA (1.25 mL), and ODE (20 mL) were degassed under vacuum at room temperature for 30 min, followed by degassing at 50 °C for an additional 30 min. The temperature was then increased to 120 °C under a N 2 atmosphere and maintained for 60 min. 
 Synthesis of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 nanocrystals In a three-neck round-bottom ask, PbCl 2 (1.08 mmol) and the required quantity of MnCl 2 (PbCl 2 : MnCl 2 molar ratios = 1 : 0, 0.75 : 0.25, 0.5 : 0.5, and 0.25 : 0.75) were dissolved in ODE (25 mL), OA (2.5 mL), TOP (4 mL), and OAm (2.5 mL). These Pb and Mn:Pb-oleate mixtures were degassed under vacuum at room temperature for 60 min, followed by degassing at 120 °C for an additional 60 min. Once the precursors were fully dissolved, the temperature was increased to 170 °C under N 2 ow. The Csoleate precursor (2 mL) was swily injected into the solutions and quenched immediately by immersing the ask in an ice bath. The resulting solution was then mixed with methyl acetate (60 mL) and subjected to centrifugation at 7500 rpm for 5 min to remove the excess ODE and any unreacted ligands. The precipitate was dispersed in n-hexane (10 mL), mixed with methyl acetate (20 mL), and subjected to centrifugation once more at 7500 rpm for 5 min to remove any large particles. The supernatant containing the small monodisperse nanocrystals (diameter ∼10 nm) was collected and redispersed in n-hexane or toluene. The nal yield was calculated to be 1.27%, as the nal product of the NCs was approximately 100 mg per batch. 
 Synthesis of FAPbBr 3 nanocrystals Solutions of the FAPbBr 3 nanocrystals were prepared as described previously.  28  More specically, FABr (49.9 mg) and PbBr 2 (73.4 mg) were dissolved in DMF (1 mL). In addition, OA (0.3 mL), 1-butanol (2 mL), and OAm (20 mL) were dissolved in toluene (5 mL). The FAPbBr 3 precursor solution (150 mL) was added swily into the rotating solution (500 rpm), and aer 10 min, the nanocrystal solution was subjected to centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting precipitate was dispersed in toluene (1 mL) and subjected to further centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min. Finally, the oating nanocrystals were collected and re-dispersed in toluene. 
 Chemical bath deposition (CBD) of the SnO 2 electron transport layers Etched glass/F-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates (1.2 × 2.5 cm, Pilkington) were rinsed with 2-propanol and acetone under ultrasonication for 15 min, rinsed with deionized (DI) water, and dried under a N 2 atmosphere. The CBD process was performed according to a previous report.  29  More specically, the precursor solution was prepared by mixing urea (625 mg), HCl (625 mL), TGA (12.5 mL), and SnCl 2 $xH 2 O (137.5 mg) in DI water (50 mL). The substrates were partially masked with PI tape and placed in a glass container. Aer pouring the precursor solution into the glass container, the reaction was allowed to proceed at 90 °C for 90 min. Subsequently, the substrates were rinsed with DI water and 2-propanol under ultrasonication for 5 min and then dried under a N 2 atmosphere prior to further annealing at 180 °C for 1 h. 
 Fabrication of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) The perovskite solutions were spin-coated onto the SnO 2 electron transport layers (ETLs) in two steps at different rotation speeds and time intervals, i.e., 1000 rpm for 5 s and 4000 rpm for 15 s. BA (73 mL) was added dropwise onto the rotating substrate during the remaining 6 s of the second step. The substrates bearing transparent DMSO-perovskite complexes were annealed at 65 °C for 1 min and then at 135 °C for 3 min to ensure complete crystallization of the perovskite. Aer cooling to room temperature, the spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin coated onto the perovskite at 2500 rpm for 20 s. Au contacts (70 nm) were deposited using a thermal evaporator at a constant rate of 0.7 Å s -1 . 
 Fabrication of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3/PS LSC/PSC windows The Mn:CsPbCl 3 solutions were prepared by dispersing the NCs in toluene at a concentration of 10 mg mL -1 . The PS solutions were prepared by dissolving PS in toluene at a concentration of 5 wt%. The two solutions were then mixed in a 1 : 1 volume ratio. The actual mass ratio of NCs to PS was calculated to be approximately 1 : 4.5. The mixed solution was spin-coated onto quartz glass with different top areas (6.25, 25, and 100 cm 2 ) at 450 rpm for 60 s. Prior to interconnecting the PSCs, an EcoFlex 0035™ prepolymer and initiator were mixed in a 1 : 1 weight ratio. Aer the Al wires were placed on the Au contacts of each device, the Ga-In liquid alloy was spread on the junction between the Al wires and Au contacts. To tightly x the junctions, the EcoFlex mixture was added dropwise onto the liquid alloy. Curing was complete aer 5 min. The series-connected PSCs were attached and cured for 5 min aer the EcoFlex mixture was spread on the sides of the LSC. Devices with similar PCEs were selected to avoid a drop in the PCE due to potentially defective cells. 
 Characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the CsPbCl 3 and Mn:CsPbCl 3 nanocrystals were obtained using a JEM-2010 TEM (JEOL). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a scanning XPS microprobe (AXIS SUPRA; Kratos Inc., UK), while X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a D8 Advance XRD instrument (Bruker, USA). To ensure the reliability of the actual doping amount, the values were averaged across ve samples using XPS analysis. The optical transmittance, reection, haze, and absorption of each LSC were measured using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600 PLUS, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with an integrating sphere (MPC-3100, Shimadzu, Japan). The optical haze of the LSC is dened as T diff /T tot × 100%, where T diff and T tot represent the diffuse and total transmissions, respectively. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and uorescence imaging microscopy (FLIM) images were obtained using an XperRAM spectrometer (Nanobase) equipped with an optical lens. The time-resolved PL decay curves were obtained using a picosecond pulsed diode laser (405 nm) and a time-correlated singlephoton counting system (XperRAM, Nanobase). The detection wavelength was xed at 620 nm. The J-V curves and currenttime cycles were obtained using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A 1.6 kW arc xenon lamp in a solar simulator was used as the light source with an effective irradiation area of 20 × 20 cm (YSS-200A). The light intensity was adjusted to AM 1.5G using an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with a KG-1 lter. The active area (0.8 cm 2 ) was dened using metal masks. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were obtained at wavelengths of 300-900 nm using a QuantX 300 spectrophotometer (Oriel). The contact angles of the water droplets were measured using a contact angle analyzer (SmartDrop, Femtobiomed, Inc.). The PL quantum yields (PLQYs) were measured using a PL spectrometer (FluoTime 300). A commercial UV lamp with a power of 265 mW cm -2 was used for measurement of the photodetector performance. Mn:CsPbCl 3 -1; 2.35%, Mn:CsPbCl 3 -2; and 3.83%, Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3), wherein it can be seen that the well-dispersed NCs with an average particle size of 10 nm were cubic in nature. In addition, the inset of Fig.  2D  shows the selected-area electron diffraction image corresponding to the (100) and (110) diffraction rings of CsPbCl 3 . Furthermore, the XRD pattern of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3 lm shows a signicant shi of 0.18°in the main peaks corresponding to the (110), (200), and (211) planes, indicating successful Mn doping in the CsPbCl 3 matrix (Fig.  S1 † ).  30  Fig.  2E -H display the UV-visible absorption and PL spectra of the CsPbCl 3 , Mn:CsPbCl 3 -1, Mn:CsPbCl 3 -2, and Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3 NC solutions, respectively. Their absorption ranges in the UV region remained unchanged regardless of Mn loading, exhibiting a wavelength cutoff at 405 nm. It can be seen that the absorption peak of the NCs consistently appeared at 382 nm, regardless of the Mn loading. However, upon increasing the Mn loading, the PL peak intensity at 402 nm decreased, and a signicant increase was observed between 598 and 620 nm. This dual PL emission at short and long wavelengths arose from variations in the carrier recombination process in Mn:CsPbCl 3 . Since the 4 T 1g position of Mn 2+ is lower than the conduction band minimum of CsPbCl 3 , the energy transfer of the photoexcited electrons becomes more prominent with an increased Mn loading (Fig.  2I ).  14, [24] [25] [26]  Consequently, the PL emission becomes dominated by the 4 T 1g / 6 A 1g transition. It was initially assumed that Mn:CsPbX 3 followed the Dexter energy transfer process, similar to metal-doped II-IV quantum dots. However, recent studies have proposed the presence of Förster resonance energy transfer, as transition absorption spectroscopy analyses revealed that the electron transition rate in Mn:CsPbCl 3 was nearly 100 times slower than that in II-IV quantum dots.  31, 32  The PLQY also increased proportionally with the Mn loading, reaching values of 0.34, 2.69, 21.4, and 40.5% for the CsPbCl 3 , Mn:CsPbCl 3 -1, Mn:CsPbCl 3 -2, and Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3 specimens, respectively (Fig.  2J ). This increase was attributed to the enhanced efficiency of the energy transfer due to Mn doping and was accompanied by a PL red-shi from 598 to 620 nm resulting from reinforced Mn 2+ -Mn 2+ interactions.  24  Fig.  2K  and L present the XPS results for Mn 2p and Pb 4f, respectively. In the case of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3 specimen, the Mn 2p 1/2 and Mn 2p 3/2 peaks appeared at 654.4 and 646.1 eV, respectively; as expected, these peaks were absent in the XPS spectrum of CsPbCl 3 . In addition, the Pb 4f 5/2 and Pb 4f 7/2 peaks shied from 144.1 and 139.3 eV to 144.3 and 139.5 eV, respectively, indicating a change in the interactions between the Pb core and valence electrons due to the inserted Mn 2+ , aligning well with the XRD results for Mn doping. 
 Results and discussion Polymers play a crucial role in the homogeneous dispersion of uorophores in LSCs, with the polymer matrix assisting in the solid-state dispersion of colloidal NCs and suppressing their aggregation during solution spin-coating.  33, 34  Importantly, these effects signicantly enhance the optical characteristics of LSCs. Fig.  3A  presents photographic images of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3 and Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3/PS LSCs. When the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3 LSC was tilted under illumination using a white light-emitting diode (LED), haze was observed in the outer region of the substrate, while the center remained transparent. This was attributed to the generation of a strong centrifugal force during rapid spinning, thereby concentrating the NCs in the outer region and causing an imbalance in the optical transparency.  35, 36  However, the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3/PS LSC was found to exhibit excellent transparency in all areas because the viscous PS matrix maintains the dispersion of NCs. Upon exposure of the same samples to UV light (l = 365 nm), different PL distributions were observed, as presented in Fig.  3A . To quantitatively investigate the homogeneity of the optical characteristics in the LSCs, the spectra were averaged across ve regions, including the center and four corners. The absorption peak intensity of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3/PS LSC was enhanced by 1.19-times compared to that of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3 LSC at 382 nm (Fig.  3B ). The total reectance and haze of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3/PS LSC also signicantly decreased from 8.9 to 7.3% and from 4.7 to 2% at 550 nm, respectively (Fig.  3C ). The plateau observed for the total reectance for the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3/PS LSC indicates that the PS matrix effectively suppressed diffuse reection. The inset of Fig.  3D  illustrates the origins of the diffuse reection and transmission in the LSCs. For the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3 LSC, light scattering is predominant at the surface of the aggregated NCs and diffuse transmission is reinforced at the interface between the glass substrate and the NCs owing to the air gap within the small pores among the aggregated NCs. This leads to a large mismatch in the refractive indices between the NC layers and the glass. However, by eliminating the air gap, the incident light can almost uniformly penetrate the individual NCs dispersed in the PS matrix with minimal reection and diffuse transmission.  36  The resulting reduced deviation in the refractive index between the NC layers and the glass can be described by the following equation:  16, 37, 38   n 2 = (1 -V pore )n NC 2 + V pore n air 2 ( 1 ) where n is the refractive index of the NC layers on the glass, V pore is the volume fraction of the pores in the NC layers, n NC is the refractive index of the pure NC layers (∼2.0), and n air is the refractive index of air. The deviation in the refractive index between the NC layers and the glass decreases as the pore volume fraction decreases upon introduction of the PS matrix. Consequently, the total transmittance of the LSCs increased from 89.1 to 91.6% at 550 nm and was essentially retained at wavelengths up to 800 nm, thereby indicating a reduction in the level of optical haze. Passivation of the NCs with the PS matrix also enhanced the PL characteristics, as can be seen in Fig.  3F , which shows the steady-state PL (SSPL) spectra of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3 and Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3/PS LSCs. More specically, the PL intensity of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3/PS LSC was 1.2 times higher than that of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3 LSC at 620 nm. Additionally, the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3/PS LSC exhibited a prolonged PL lifetime, as observed by time-resolved PL (TRPL) analysis. This can be accounted for by considering that the hydrophobic PS protects the NCs from atmospheric degradation, suppressing rapid PL quenching based on nonradiative and radiative recombination.  16, 39, 40  The average PL lifetimes were therefore found to be 1.523 and 2.447 ms for the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3 and Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3/PS LSCs, respectively, as determined using a biexponential decay function; the corresponding tting parameters are listed in Table  S1 . † Furthermore, the FLIM analysis was used to further investigate the PL distributions in the different regions of the substrate (Fig.  3H  and I ). In the case of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3 LSC, the PL distribution was homogeneous at the center but uneven in the outer regions owing to the aggregated NCs. In contrast, the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3 LSC exhibited an even PL distribution with a strong intensity across all regions, as shown in Fig.  3A . Fig.  4A  shows a schematic diagram of the PSC architecture. To design a high-performance device with a large active area, SnO 2 ETLs were fabricated using CBD. The SnO 2 ETLs, (MAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (FAPbIBr 2 ) 0.05 , spiro-OMeTAD, and Au contact were successively deposited onto anisotropic glass/FTO substrates, as detailed in Fig.  S2  † and in the inset of Fig.  4A . Fig.  4B  presents the current density-voltage (J-V) curves recorded for a single cell. Consequently, an open-circuit voltage (V oc ) of 1.14 V, a short-circuit current density (J sc ) of 23.87 mA cm -2 , and a ll factor (FF) of 0.774 were measured, resulting in an impressive PCE of 21.06% during the backward voltage sweep with a scan rate of 200 ms. For the forward voltage sweep at the same scan rate, the PCE was 20.78%, indicating the presence of suppressed J-V hysteresis. Before integrating the PSCs with the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3/PS LSC in a range of different G values, the J-V curves were recorded for the series-connected cells under 1 sun illumination (Fig.  4C ). It was found that the 4, 8, and 16 connected cells exhibited similar PCEs to the single cell, giving values of 20.88, 20.67, and 20.49%, respectively. The device parameters are listed in Table  S2 . † This PCE retention could be achieved by minimizing contact resistance between the Au contacts. A Ga-In eutectic liquid alloy was employed to connect each Al wire on the Au contact, and then the junctions were tightly xed using EcoFlex 0035 Fast™ as shown in the inset of Fig.  4C . To achieve an optimal device performance in the LSC/ PV window, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the cells should be aligned with the wavelength range of the PL emission from the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3 NCs. The EQE spectrum presented in Fig.  4D  demonstrates the outstanding spectral responses of a single cell across the visible range from 400 to 760 nm, with EQE values exceeding 85% in these wavelengths. The integrated J sc was found to be 22.56 mA cm -2 , exhibiting excellent agreement with the J sc obtained from the J-V curves. Considering the strong PL emission of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3/PS LSC at 620 nm, an efficient conversion of photons to electric current can be expected. The highly transparent Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3/PS LSC, coupled with the 16 connected cells, exhibited strong orange PL at the edges under UV light (l = 365 nm) (Fig.  5A  and B ). In addition, the optical efficiencies under 1 sun illumination were found to be 9.28, 8.4, 7.33, and 5.38% for G values of 1.3, 5, 12.5, and 25, respectively (Fig.  5C ). Notably, the optical efficiency of the FAPbBr 3 /PS LSC dramatically decreased from 10.3 to 0.98% as the G increased from 1.3 to 25, wherein the optical efficiency and the G value were calculated according to the following equations: 15 h opt ¼ I LSC I SC Â G (2) G ¼ A top A side (3) where h opt is the optical efficiency, I LSC is the short-circuit current of the solar cells coupled with the LSC, I SC is the short-circuit current of the solar cells under 1 sun illumination, A top is the top area of the LSC, and A side is the total side areas of the LSC. Despite the higher PLQY obtained for the FAPbBr 3 NCs (58.4%) compared to that of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3 NCs, severe PL reabsorption degraded the optical efficiency because of the lack of a Stokes shi and the wide absorption-emission spectral overlap in the FAPbBr 3 /PS LSC (Fig.  S3 † ). The gradual decrease in the optical efficiency of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3/PS LSC, which was proportional to increasing G values or larger top areas, was attributed to the predominant PL scattering and outward emission from the top surface. In the J-V curves, the PCEs of the devices coupled with the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3/PS LSC were found to be 0.77, 0.69, 0.6, and 0.43% for G values of 1.3, 5, 12.5, and 25, respectively (Fig.  5D ). Notably, a high V oc of 17.93 V was observed in the 16 connected cells with G = 25, suggesting that high voltage transmission can be achieved in a large-scale BIPV system. Given that the optical efficiency of our devices is comparable to the recently reported values (1.6-5.9%) for PeLSCs coupled with Si solar cells at high G values (>10), allperovskite LSC/PV windows are highly promising for use in BIPV systems (Table  S3  †). Moreover, the LSC-PV coupling efficiency (g PCE ) was calculated using the following equation: 41 g PCE ¼ h LSC-PV h PV (4) where h LSC-PV is the PCE of the series-connected PSCs coupled with the PeLSCs and h PV is the PCE of the stand-alone PSCs. The devices coupled with the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3/PS LSC exhibited excellent g PCE retention, decreasing only slightly from 0.037% to 0.021% for G values of 1.3 and 25, respectively. In contrast, the value of the devices coupled with the FAPbBr 3 /PS LSC dropped signicantly from 0.039% to 0.004% for G values of 1.3 and 25, respectively, due to strong PL reabsorption between the NCs. The optical efficiencies and device parameters based on the G values are listed in Table  1 . Moreover, the EQE spectra of the PSCs between wavelengths of 300 and 405 nm corresponded to the absorption range of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3 NCs (Fig.  5E ). The normalized EQE values decreased with an increasing G value, showing a trend similar to that of the reduction in the optical efficiency. However, the normalized EQE at G = 25 still retained 62.4% of the value recorded at G = 1.3, suggesting that PL reabsorption was suppressed due to efficient collection of the propagated photons at the edges of the LSC (Fig.  5F ). Additionally, the hydrophobic PS matrix led to preservation of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3 NCs without any remarkable degradation, and the PL intensity retained 89.5% of its initial value aer 1000 h (Fig.  S4 † ). The inset of Fig.  5F  shows a high contact angle of 96.4°for a water droplet on the LSC, thereby conrming its hydrophobic nature. Because the coupled cells only utilized PL at long wavelengths, the PSCs were protected from UV degradation.  [42] [43] [44]  Accordingly, the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3/PS LSC/PV window exhibited an outstanding stability under continuous 1 sun illumination, with the normalized PCE retaining 86.3% of its initial value at a relative humidity of 10% and a temperature of 25 °C aer 1000 h. Another potential application of the current system is as a highly sensitive and self-powered UV light-detecting window in environmental monitoring, biomedical engineering, and sterilization.  [45] [46] [47]  The current-time cycles of the PSCs coupled with the LSC were measured at a light power of 265 mW cm -2 (l = 365 nm) (Fig.  5G ). Consequently, the on-currents were determined to be 3.64, 6.63, 11.7, and 8.48 mA for G values of 1.3, 5, 12.5, and 25, respectively, while their dark currents were comparable in all cases, i.e., giving values of ∼12 nA. Since the number of devices increased with the value of G, the 16 connected devices produced high total currents at large G values of 12.5 and 25. Furthermore, the higher total current at G = 12.5 compared to that at G = 25 was attributed to the higher PCE at G = 12.5, as shown in Fig.  5D . However, with an increase in G, the photodetector performance decreased in a similar manner to the optical efficiency because the top area of the LSC increased with the value of G. Furthermore, the responsivity and specic detectivity decreased from 2.2 to 0.32 mA W -1 and from 8.87 × 10 10 to 5.16 × 10 10 jones, respectively, as the value of G was increased from 1.3 to 25 (Fig.  5H ). The on/off current ratios were determined to be 3.03 × 10 2 , 5.53 × 10 2 , 9.75 × 10 2 , and 7.07 × 10 2 for G values of 1.3, 5, 12.5, and 25, respectively, as calculated from the total on and dark currents. Moreover, the NEP increased from 2.82 × 10 -11 to 1.94 × 10 -10 W Hz -0.5 as G was increased from 1.3 to 25, suggesting that the device sensitivity to light detection became weaker (Fig.  5I ). The corresponding parameters for the prepared photodetectors are listed in Table  2 , and the calculation details are provided in the ESI. † 
 Conclusions In conclusion, a highly transparent and efficient solar conversion window was designed by integrating Mn:CsPbCl 3 /PS LSCs and PSCs. Introduction of the PS matrix into the LSC lms signicantly enhanced their optical and PL characteristics owing to the homogeneous dispersion and stabilization of the Mn:CsPbCl 3 -3 nanocrystals. The series-connected PSCs coupled with the LSCs exhibited an impressive optical efficiency of 5.38% and a PCE of 0.43% for G = 25, with these values being retained at 56-58% compared to that recorded at G = 1.3. This excellent efficiency retention was enabled by suppressed PL reabsorption in the LSCs, in addition to the well-matched EQE/ PL emission spectra of the PSCs and LSCs. Furthermore, the prepared self-powered UV light-detecting window demonstrated an outstanding photodetector performance, recording a responsivity of 0.32 mA W -1 , a specic detectivity of 5.16 × 10 10 jones, and a NEP of 1.94 × 10 -10 W Hz -0.5 for G = 25. To further enhance the efficiencies of all-perovskite LSC/ photovoltaic windows for practical BIPVs, our future research will focus on engineering PeNCs and tandem PeLSC/PV architecture for efficient photon supply-absorption.  Fig. 1 1 Fig.1Schematic illustrating all-perovskite LSC/PV windows with a high efficiency of photon collection. The nanocomposites of pre-synthesized PeNCs (Mn:CsPbCl 3 and FAPbBr 3 ) and PS are used as light-emitting films for the LSCs. Series-connected PSCs are coupled with the LSCs, efficiently absorbing the PL (l = 620 nm) emitted from the Mn:CsPbCl 3 NCs. A large Stokes shift (Dl = 238 nm) across the UV and visible ranges suppresses PL reabsorption of the adjacent NCs and provides a high optical transparency and efficiency (top scheme). In contrast, FAPbBr 3 /PS LSCs exhibit a dramatic reduction in optical efficiency with an increase in geometric factors, due to predominant PL reabsorption caused by wide spectral overlap between light absorption and PL emission (bottom scheme).
