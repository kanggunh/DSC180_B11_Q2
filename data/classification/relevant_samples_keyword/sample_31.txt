The trans-CyDAI2 treated perovskite films show accelerated formation of PbI2 compared with the control perovskite, which can be attributed to the reaction of 2APbX3+ trans-CyDAX2 △ → trans-CyDAPbX4 + PbX2 + 2AX(g). Combining the formation of PbI2 and the PL study in Supplementary Fig. 15, we could also reasonably deduct that the accelerated formation of PbI2 is highly related to the initial phase separation in trans-CyDAI2 treated perovskite film, which happens simultaneously

Title: Isomeric diammonium passivation for perovskite-organic tandem solar cells

In recent years, perovskite has been widely adopted in series-connected monolithic tandem solar cells (TSCs) to overcome the Shockley-Queisser limit of single-junction solar cells. Perovskite-organic TSCs, comprising a wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cell (pero-SC) as the front cell and a narrow-bandgap organic solar cell (OSC) as the rear cell, have recently drawn attention owing to the good stability and potential high power conversion efficiency (PCE)  [1] [2] [3] [4]  . However, WBG pero-SCs usually exhibit higher voltage losses than regular pero-SCs, which limits the performance of TSCs  5, 6  . One of the main obstacles comes from interfacial recombination at the perovskite-C 60 interface, and it is important to develop effective surface passivation strategies to pursue higher PCE of perovskite-organic TSCs  7  . Here we exploit a new surface passivator cyclohexane 1,4-diammonium diiodide (CyDAI 2 ), which naturally contains two isomeric structures with ammonium groups on the same or opposite sides of the hexane ring (denoted as cis-CyDAI 2 and trans-CyDAI 2 , respectively), and the two isomers demonstrate completely different surface interaction behaviours. The cis-CyDAI 2 passivation treatment reduces the quasi-Fermi-level splitting-open circuit voltage (V oc ) mismatch of the WBG pero-SCs with a bandgap of 1.88 eV and enhanced its V oc to 1.36 V. Combining the cis-CyDAI 2 -treated perovskite and the organic active layer with a narrow bandgap of 1.27 eV, the constructed monolithic perovskiteorganic TSC demonstrates a PCE of 26.4% (certified as 25.7%). Compared with other perovskite-based TSCs, perovskite-organic tandem solar cells (TSCs) have been reported for a long time but their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has lagged behind because of the limitation of infrared absorbing organic photovoltaic materials. No notable progress was made until the recent emergence of A-DA′D-A-type narrow-bandgap (NBG) small-molecule acceptors that broaden the absorption spectrum range up to about 1,000 nm (ref. 8). The interconnecting layer in constructing the perovskiteorganic TSCs has also been greatly improved recently  2, 6  . Importantly, the perovskite-organic TSCs show great potential in enhancing the device stability compared with other types of perovskitebased TSCs  1, 9, 10  . Yet, the PCE of the perovskite-organic TSCs is still limited by the higher voltage loss of the wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) because of the interfacial recombination at the perovskite-C 60 interface. In the p-i-n configuration, an energy offset often exists between the conduction band of the perovskite and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level (E LUMO ) of the electron transport layer material C 60 (ref. 11). For the WBG perovskite, surface-states-induced Fermi-level pinning at the conduction band or a band bending of the electron quasi-Fermi level could become more severe at the perovskite-C 60 interface  12  . Therefore, to further reduce the voltage loss of WBG pero-SCs for their applications in TSCs, we need effective strategies to suppress these losses. Bulky cations, such as cyclic or aromatic diammonium cations, have been widely applied to the surface of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite thin films as the surface passivator of perovskites or the building components of Dion-Jacobson two-dimensional (2D) perovskites  13  . However, isomeric molecular structures might exist in some of these diammonium cations and their passivation effect should be further exploited and studied  14, 15  . The substitution position of functional groups, such as ammonium and fluorine atoms  16, 17  , is found to be important in determining the distribution of electron clouds and intramolecular dipoles  18  , which may cause completely different kinetics in the interactions with the surface of 3D perovskite thin films  19  . Most importantly, cis-trans isomerism offers the advantage of the rigidity of molecular configurations, which effectively sustains the large dipole moment of the passivating agent from the molecular level. Here, we introduce the passivation agent cyclohexane 1,4diammonium diiodide (CyDAI 2 ) on the WBG perovskite active layer, which contains two isomeric structures of cis-CyDAI 2 and trans-CyDAI 2 . After passivation, we observed two completely different interaction behaviours between the isomeric diammonium cations and the perovskite surface. Only, through the effective passivation of cis-CyDAI 2 on the perovskite active layer surface, the V oc of the WBG pero-SC substantially increased to 1.36 V and a notable PCE of 18.3% was achieved for the single-junction WBG pero-SCs. Then, by using the WBG pero-SC as the front cell, paired with the NBG OSC based on PM6:BTPSe-Ph4F:MO-IDIC-2F as the rear cell, the perovskite-organic TSC reached a high PCE of 26.4% (with certified PCE of 25.7%). 
 Passivation mechanism of CyDAI 2 isomers The molecular structures of cis-CyDAI 2 and trans-CyDAI 2 are shown in Fig.  1a . In the CyDA 2+ cations, the orientation of ammonium groups attached to the sp 3 carbon atom in the cyclohexane ring cannot change freely, resulting in two stable and separatable cis and trans isomeric structures. The optimal stereochemical geometries of cis-CyDAI 2 and trans-CyDAI 2 were obtained through theoretical calculations, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  1 . The synthesis procedures of cis-CyDAI 2 and trans-CyDAI 2 are described in the Methods section, and the molecular structures of the two isomer products were carefully confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as shown in Supplementary Figs.  2  and 3 . The dipole moments of cis-CyDAI 2 and trans-CyDAI 2 were calculated to be 3.85 D and 0 D, respectively (Fig.  1a ). The cyclohexane can fully immobilize the ammonium groups and prevent the rotation of functional groups in the isomers, which keeps the pure cis-and trans-diammonium orientation.  
 Article Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry was used to investigate the chemical composition throughout the perovskite film and the signal of C 6 H 9 indicates that the cis-CyDAI 2 or trans-CyDAI 2 mainly located on the perovskite surface after their treatments (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). Aiming to characterize the influence of CyDA 2+ isomers on the surface crystalline properties of perovskite thin films, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were conducted (Fig.  1b ,c and Supplementary Fig.  5 ). The 2D GIWAXS spectra of the perovskite treated with trans-CyDAI 2 shows a strong characteristic diffraction peak at q z = 0.6 Å -1 (Fig.  1b ), which indicates the formation of a horizontally oriented 2D perovskite (with d-spacing of 10.4 Å) and thus a 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure on the surface. However, no peaks regarding 2D perovskite were observed in the cis-CyDAI 2 -treated perovskite films (Fig.  1c ). One-dimensional (1D) scattering profiles extracted from 2D scattering patterns are shown in Supplementary Fig.  6 . To determine the 2D perovskite structure, further X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was included in Supplementary Fig.  7  and Supplementary Table  1 . The difference between the cis-CyDAI 2 -and trans-CyDAI 2 -treated perovskite films was further observed using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fsTA), as the bandgap structure of the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure correlates strongly with the composition of 2D perovskites  20  . In both cases, we observed a strong and dominating ground state bleaching (GSB) peak at about 650 nm immediately after excitation from bulk WBG perovskite absorption (Fig.  1d, e ). In the trans-CyDAI 2 -treated perovskite films, a gradual red shift of the GSB from 630 nm to 650 nm appeared over hundreds of picoseconds when exciting and probing from the perovskite side (Fig.  1d  and Supplementary Fig.  8 ). The red shift indicates an energy transfer to the bulk 3D perovskite from the excited surface Dion-Jacobson 2D perovskite with a wider bandgap  20  . By contrast, in the cis-CyDAI 2 -treated perovskite films, no considerable shift of the GSB appeared. To further explore the effects of the two isomers on the lattice in the perovskites treated by trans-and cis-CyDAI 2 , density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to compute the lattice structure and formation energy of the Dion-Jacobson 2D perovskite. The layered crystal structures of the trans-CyDAI 2 -and cis-CyDAI 2 -treated perovskites are shown in Fig.  1f  and Supplementary Fig.  9  with the view from out-of-plane and in-plane directions. The trans-CyDA 2+ and cis-CyDA 2+ have very similar molecular sizes, but the isomerism results in a more linear ion for trans-CyDA 2+ , whereas non-linear for cis-CyDA 2+ . Therefore, the distance between the [PbI 6 ] 4-layers is 4.39 Å and 4.01 Å for the perovskites treated by trans-and cis-CyDA 2+ ions, respectively, which is consistent with the d-spacing calculated from the XRD diffraction peaks (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). In cis-CyDAI 2 , the steric hindrance of the ammonium groups on the same side of the C6 ring is markedly higher and can cause more severe lattice distortion in the perovskite bulk. The in-plane Pb-I-Pb angles in the cis-CyDAI 2 -treated film substantially varied from 120.78° to 170.54°, causing higher lattice stain, whereas the angles in the trans-CyDAI 2 -treated film varied in a narrower range (Fig.  1f  and Supplementary Table  2 ). Different from the situation in the bulk, a lower stabilized energy is observed for cis-CyDAI 2 , because the dual ammonium groups towards the same orientation would interact strongly with the perovskite with the C6 ring parallelly organized to the surface (Fig.  1g ). As a result, the cis configuration could induce a layer of stable molecular dipole moment on the perovskite surface, which is supported by a lower contact potential difference of the cis-CyDAI 2 -treated perovskite film, than those of the trans-CyDAI 2 -treated perovskite film and the bare perovskite film, from the Kelvin probe force microscopy analysis (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). The larger dipole moment of the cis-CyDAI 2 could reduce the hole concentration at the perovskite interface and fix positive charges, indicated by an upshift of Fermi-level (E F ), which we will address later  21  . Additional DFT simulations of the defect passivation are summarized in Supplementary Figs.  11  and 12  and Supplementary Table  3 ; cis-CyDAI 2 exhibits superior passivation effects on many types of defects than trans-CyDAI 2 , especially on iodine vacancies. Transient photoluminescence spectra and decay dynamics were further examined using an ultra-fast streak camera (Supplementary Fig.  13 ). It was found that the trans-CyDAI 2 -treated perovskite films exhibited unwanted instabilities caused by halide phase separation of the WBG perovskite, whereas almost no phase separation was observed in the cis-CyDAI 2 -treated sample. The stability of the trans-and cis-CyDAI 2 -treated perovskite films was further confirmed by film colour change and time evolution of photoluminescence spectra (Supplementary Figs.  14  and 15 ). Moreover, photoluminescence mapping (Fig.  2a, b ) showed less uniform emission, clear surface reconstruction and considerable amounts of pinholes in the trans-CyDAI 2 -treated film, which might be attributed to phase segregation (Supplementary Fig.  16 ). This was corroborated also by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Supplementary Fig.  17 ) and conductive atomic force microscopy images (Supplementary Fig.  18 ). 
 Optoelectronic analysis of WBG pero-SCs We fabricated single-junction p-i-n structured WBG pero-SCs based on FA 0.7 MA 0.2 Rb 0.1 Pb(I 0.5 Br 0.5 ) 3 (E g of 1.88 eV) with the treatment of the isomeric passivators (detailed fabrication conditions were described in the Methods section and the determination of E g is shown in Supplementary Fig.  19 ). Figure  2c  shows the current density-voltage ( J-V) curves of the devices, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters were listed in Supplementary Table  4 . The cis-CyDAI 2 -treated pero-SCs exhibited a champion PCE of 18.4%, with V oc of 1.36 V, short-circuit current density ( J sc ) of 16.1 mA cm -2 and FF of 83.8% under reverse scan with small hysteresis, and the photovoltaic performance shows narrow distribution (Supplementary Fig.  20 ). Supplementary Fig.  21  shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra with an integrated J sc value of 15.8 mA cm -2 for the cis-CyDAI 2 -treated pero-SCs. As a comparison, the trans-CyDAI 2 -treated pero-SCs showed significantly lower V oc of 1.28 V and FF of 80.3%, followed by the control pero-SCs with V oc of 1.25 V and FF of 74.8%. The PCE of the cis-CyDAI 2 -treated pero-SC is one of the highest reported values among the WBG pero-SCs with E g > 1.85 eV (Fig.  2d  and Supplementary Table  5 ). Transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements showed faster charge extraction and more suppressed charge recombination in the cis-CyDAI 2 -treated pero-SCs (Fig.  2e  and Supplementary Fig.  22 ). Moreover, the higher recombination resistance  22  of the cis-CyDAI 2 -treated pero-SCs was also observed in the impedance spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig.  23 ). To gauge the passivation mechanism and the effect on V oc of the different isomer treatments, photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of the perovskite films in different stacks (that is, neat perovskite, perovskite-C 60 and complete devices) were measured with and without passivation and the corresponding quasi-Fermi-level splittings (QFLS PL s) were extracted (Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Figs. 24 and 25 and Supplementary Table  6 ). The bare perovskite film exhibited a QFLS PL value of 1.40 eV, whereas deposition of the isomers on the bare perovskite surface slightly increases the QFLS PL to 1.41 eV, which indicates a passivation effect of both isomers. Furthermore, space-charge-limited current (SCLC) analysis (Fig.  2f ) showed reduced trap-filled-limit voltage (V TFL ) for the cis-CyDAI 2 -treated perovskite and implied lower trap density, which agrees with the DFT simulations of the defect passivation. Adding a C 60 layer on top of the perovskite without a passivation layer lowers the QFLS to 1.305 eV, indicating severe interfacial recombination between the perovskite and the C 60 layer, which is the main V oc limiting factor in the WBG pero-SCs. Inserting the trans-CyDAI 2 and cis-CyDAI 2 in between the perovskite and C 60 suppresses the interfacial recombination, leading to a QFLS PL of 1.358 eV and 1.360 eV, respectively. Comparing these QFLS PL values with the V oc of the devices shows a significant QFLS PL -V oc mismatch in both the control and trans-CyDAI 2 -treated devices (Fig.  2g ). By contrast, the cis-CyDAI 2 -treated pero-SC exhibits no QFLS PL -V oc mismatch and hence reaches the highest V oc value of 1.36 V, which we will address later. Electroluminescence quantum yields (ELQYs) of the control, trans-CyDAI 2 -treated and cis-CyDAI 2 -treated pero-SCs were measured after the devices had reached a steady state and the corresponding quasi-Fermi-level splittings (QFLS EL s) were obtained and shown in Fig.  2g  (Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Figs. 26 and 27 and Supplementary Table  7 ). Different from the QFLS PL , QFLS EL matches the V oc of the devices, which is generally observed for pero-SCs  23, 24  when the Rau's reciprocity is fulfilled  25  . To investigate the potential FF, pseudo-JV (pJV) characteristics were extracted from light-intensity-dependent QFLS PL (suns-QFLS PL ) on films in different stacks and the light-intensity-dependent V oc and J sc (suns-V oc , J sc ) measurements on the control, trans-CyDAI 2 -treated and cis-CyDAI 2 -treated pero-SCs 26 (Supplementary Figs.  28  and 29  and Supplementary Table  8 ). The pseudo fill factors (pFFs) from the pJV curves are high and relatively similar at values above 87% for different devices. Notably, the control devices exhibit a much lower FF of 75.1% compared with their pFF of 87.3%. This pFF-FF mismatch reduces slightly for the trans-CyDAI 2 -treated device (FF of 80.8% compared with pFF of 87.7%) and vanishes almost completely for the cis-CyDAI 2 -treated pero-SCs (FF of 85.4% compared with pFF of 87.5%) (Fig.  2h, i ). To investigate the possible origin of the QFLS PL -V oc and pFF-FF mismatch and the underlying reason why only cis-CyDAI 2 allows to  1 μs, 8.9 μs and 7.4 μs for the perovskite films with no passivation, passivated by trans-CyDAI 2 and cis-CyDAI 2 , respectively. f, J-V characteristics of electron-only devices for the control and CyDAI 2 -isomers-treated perovskite films by SCLC method. V TFL (trap-filled-limit voltage) is determined to be 0.24 V, 0.19 V and 0.13 V for the perovskite with no passivation, passivated by trans-CyDAI 2 and cis-CyDAI 2 , respectively. g, Summary of the voltage losses by comparing the quasi-Fermi-level splitting calculated from PLQY (QFLS PL ) of films with different structures, quasi-Fermi-level splitting calculated from ELQY (QFLS EL ) of devices and the V oc of the devices.

 Article minimize both, we analysed energy-level misalignment, mobility issues and/or mobile ions, all of which have been previously identified to cause such mismatches in pero-SCs  27  . To quantify mobile ions, we used bias-assisted charge extraction (BACE) measurements  27  on the control and isomers-treated perovskite devices. A moderate mobile ion density of 8.99 × 10 16 cm -3 for the control device is shown, and we find a two times higher mobile ion density in the trans-CyDAI 2 -based device compared with cis-CyDAI 2 , with 1.44 × 10 17 cm -3 and 7.13 × 10 16 cm -3 , respectively (Fig.  3a  and Supplementary Fig.  30 ). The lower mobile ion density in the cis-CyDAI 2 -based device might be because of the fixed positive charges resulted by dipole moment effect, as mentioned above. Moreover, we measured the V oc and FF of the control, trans-CyDAI 2 -treated and cis-CyDAI 2 -treated devices at different scan rate  28  in Fig.  3b  and Supplementary Fig.  31 . The V oc and FF drop at slow scan rates for the control and trans-CyDAI 2 -treated pero-SCs show that mobile ions contribute significantly to the observed QFLS PL -V oc and pFF-FF mismatch. Misaligned transport or interfacial layers, however, can also contribute to the observed QFLS-V oc and pFF-FF mismatch  29  . To show the interfacial energy offsets between the perovskite and C 60 layers, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were conducted to confirm the energy level of perovskites (Fig.  3c  and Supplementary Fig.  32 ). The surface treatment of cis-CyDAI 2 induces an upshift of E F , which makes the perovskite surface considerably more n-doped, in agreement with the Kelvin probe force microscopy analysis (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). The closer location of the E F with respect to the conduction band could reduce the band bending at the interface with C 60 and mitigate the influence from energy-level pinning. To explain problematic low-mobility transport layers, we performed resistive-photovoltage (RPV) measurements  30  and the results are shown in Fig.  3d . The charge mobility (μ m ), which is mainly limited by the organic layer, can be calculated from the transit time (t transit ) using μ m = d 2 /t transit U bi with d being the active layer thickness and U bi the built-in voltage. We yield a similar μ m of the control and isomers-treated pero-SCs, with the U bi values determined from Mott-Schottky measurement (Supplementary Fig.  33 ) and the comparable t transit . Hence, we exclude transport issues for the reason behind the QFLS-V oc and pFF-FF mismatch. With all the results at hand, we, therefore, attribute the higher QFLS-V oc mismatch and the FF drop observed in the trans-CyDAI 2 -based device to the higher mobile ion density from BACE measurements and possible contribution from a less favourable energy alignment between the perovskite and C 60 layer  26  . Therefore, although the cis-CyDAI 2 -treated and trans-CyDAI 2 -treated perovskites reach similar QFLS (with C 60 ), the high mobile ion density of the trans-CyDAI 2 -treated film leads to severe performance loss by screening of the built-in field. The high mobile ion density could also be related to the previously found poor stability of the trans-CyDAI 2 -treated perovskite  31  . 
 Performance of perovskite-organic TSCs To maximize PCE of the perovskite-organic TSCs using optimal bandgap matching as shown in Supplementary Fig.  34 , an A-DA′D-Atype acceptor BTPSe-Ph4F (E g = 1.27 eV) (ref. 32) was chosen for the OSC rear cell to match the 1.88 eV perovskite front cell (Fig.  4a ). BTPSe-Ph4F exhibits a more red-shifted absorption compared with the commonly used Y6 (Supplementary Fig.  35 ). A second small-molecule acceptor MO-IDIC-2F was adopted to form the ternary system of PM6:BTPSe-Ph4F:MO-IDIC-2F to further enhance the V oc and J sc (ref. 33) (Supplementary Table  9 ). The thickness of the organic active layer was optimized to be 120 nm (Supplementary Table  10 ). Thus, combining the cis-CyDAI 2 -treated WBG perovskite and the organic active layer based on PM6:BTPSe-Ph4F:MO-IDIC-2F, monolithic perovskiteorganic TSCs were constructed (Methods and Supplementary Fig.  36 ). The cross-sectional SEM image of the tandem architecture is shown in Fig.  4b , and the contact angles were measured as shown in Supplementary Fig.  37 . The detailed photovoltaic performance data of the WBG pero-SCs and the perovskite-organic TSCs under different fabrication conditions are listed in Supplementary Tables  11 12 13 . Benefitted from the high V oc and FF of the WBG perovskite front cell with the surface passivation by cis-CyDAI 2 , the perovskite-organic TSC reached a high PCE of 26.4% with high V oc of 2.16 V, J sc of 15.4 mA cm -2 and FF of 79.4% with negligible hysteresis ( J-V curves in Fig.  4c ) and exhibited a stabilized PCE of 26.2% (Fig.  4d ). To analyse the current matching behaviour between the front and rear cells in the TSCs, EQE spectra of the sub-cells was measured (Fig.  4e ). The integrated J sc values from the EQE spectrum for the front and rear cells were 15.2 mA cm -2 and 15.2 mA cm -2 , respectively, which shows perfect current matching and agrees well with the J sc values from the J-V measurements. The high J sc of the TSCs is achieved by the red-shifted absorption range of BTPSe-Ph4F compared with Y6 and the well-balanced J sc is mainly attributed to the complementary bandgap of both sub-cells. The PCE of the TSCs was certified as 25.7% under J-V scan (Fig.  4f  and Supplementary Fig.  38 ). We tested the maximum power point (MPP) stability of the encapsulated TSCs under 1 sun illumination, and the devices maintained over 93% of their initial efficiency after about 700 h of continuous illumination in nitrogen (Fig.  4g  and Supplementary Fig.  39   of the perovskite-organic TSCs is substantially better than that of the single-junction pero-SC, and the stability of the single-junction pero-SC treated by cis-CyDAI 2 is much better than that of the device treated by trans-CyDAI 2 , which can be ascribed to the improved interface by cis-CyDAI 2 passivation of the WBG perovskite. In considering the potential photodegradation of organic photovoltaics under high-energy photons  31  , we further investigated the stability of the bulk-heterojunction film under light soaking. As shown in Supplementary Fig.  41 , filtering by the WBG perovskite film could significantly mitigate the ultraviolet light damage on the organic active layers. The results indicate that the stability of organic rear sub-cells may not be the limiting factor of the overall stability of TSCs, which offers important advantages of perovskite-organic TSCs over perovskiteperovskite TSCs  1, 9  .

 Methods 
 Materials 
 Synthesis of trans-CyDAI 2 and cis-CyDAI 2 The trans-cyclohexane-1,4-diamine or cis-cyclohexane-1,4-diamine (1 mmol) and HI (2.2 mmol) were added to ethanol (with excess HI to ensure a complete reaction) and stirred overnight at room temperature. On completion of the reaction, a large amount of diethyl ether was added as a precipitating solvent to obtain trans-CyDAI 2 or cis-CyDAI 2 . The resulting precipitate was washed with diethyl ether and ethyl acetate by centrifugation. The product was then dried for subsequent use. 
 Fabrication of WBG pero-SCs The WBG perovskite in this work was based on the formula of FA 0.70 MA 0.20 Rb 0.10 Pb(I 0.5 Br 0.5 ) 3 . FAI, MAI, RbI, PbI 2 , PbBr 2 and Pb(SCN) 2 were dissolved in DMF:DMSO (4:1, v/v) to prepare a 1.5 mmol ml -1 perovskite precursor solution, with a molar ratio of FAI:MAI:RbI of 0.7:0.2:0.1 and PbI 2 :PbBr 2 :Pb(SCN) 2 of 0.2:0.8:0.04. After stirring for 3 h, the solids were completely dissolved. The solution was then filtered by a 0.22-μm PTFE filter and ready for spin-coating. The p-i-n WBG pero-SC devices were based on the structure of FTO/ Me-4PACz/WBG FA 0.7 MA 0.2 Rb 0.1 Pb(I 0.5 Br 0.5 ) 3 perovskite/C 60 /BCP/Ag. FTO substrates were adopted as the substrate and transparent electrode for the devices. The FTO substrates were cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone and ethanol consecutively, each by sonication for 15 min. The Me-4PACz was dissolved in ethanol with a concentration of 0.5 mg ml -1 . After 20 min of ultrasonic treatment, the solution was transferred to a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Spin-coating of the Me-4PACz ethanol solution was done at 3,000 rpm with an acceleration ramp of 1,000 rpm, followed by annealing at 120 °C for 15 min. After cooling of substrates, spin-coating of the perovskite precursor solution was done at 4,000 rpm for 20 s. EA (200 μl) was dropped onto the perovskite film during the last 10 s of the spin-coating process. The film was then annealed at 100 °C for 20 min to form the black-phase perovskite. Next, spin-coating of trans-CyDAI 2 or cis-CyDAI 2 (at a concentration of 0.3 mg ml -1 in IPA) was done onto the as-formed perovskite at 3,000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. All the above spin-coating processes were conducted in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Finally, under a vacuum of 1 × 10 -6 mbar, 20 nm of C 60 , 6 nm of BCP and 100 nm of Ag were sequentially deposited onto the perovskite film. 
 Fabrication of NBG OSCs The FTO substrate was prepared by the same procedure mentioned above. Spin-coating of the PEDOT:PSS solution was done onto the FTO substrate at 7,000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 150 °C for 20 min. PM6 was adopted as the donor and BTPSe-Ph4F and MO-IDIC-2F as the acceptors and were dissolved in o-xylene solvent with a weight ratio of 1:1:0.2 and a total concentration of 20 mg ml -1 . After heating at 60 °C for 3 h, the solution was subjected to spin-coating onto the substrate at 3,000 rpm. The film was then annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling, spin-coating of 30 μl of a 1 mg ml -1 PDINN methanol solution was performed onto the organic active layer at 3,000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, under the vacuum of 1 × 10 -6 mbar, 100 nm of Ag was deposited onto the film. 
 Fabrication of perovskite-organic TSCs The TSCs were prepared using WBG pero-SC as the front cell and NBG OSC as the rear cell. The monolithic perovskite-organic TSCs were constructed with the device structure of FTO/Me-4PACz/WBG perovskite/ C 60 /SnO x /Au/PEDOT/PM6:BTPSe-Ph4F/PDINN/Ag. The preparation process of the front sub-cell active layer was the same as that for the single-junction pero-SC. C 60 (20 nm) was deposited on the perovskite active layer. SnO x (40 nm) was deposited onto the film surface using the atomic layer deposition technique, followed by the evaporation of 1 nm Au. Subsequently, the process followed the same steps as the preparation of a single-junction OSC. Finally, a 100-nm Ag layer was thermally evaporated under a vacuum of 1 × 10 -6 mbar. 
 Characterization of materials 1 H and  13  C NMR spectroscopies were recorded on Bruker AV 400 in a DMSO-d6 solution at 300 K. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per million (ppm) with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as a benchmark. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were measured using a HORIBA FluoroMax UV-vis spectrophotometer. For the measurement of film absorption, the acceptor and blend films were prepared by spin-coating the corresponding solutions onto quartz plates. 
 Characterization of devices The current density-voltage ( J-V) curves of the pero-SCs were measured by scanning the voltage from 1.4 V to -0.2 V for the reverse scan, and from -0.2 V to 1.4 V for the forward scan. A voltage scan from -0.2 to 1.0 V was applied for the OSCs. The voltage was scanned from 2.4 V to -0.2 V for the reverse scan of the TSCs, and from -0.2 V to 2.4 V for the forward scan of the TSCs. The voltage step in the scan was 20 mV with a delay time of 1 ms, using a Keysight B2901A SourceMeter. The device area was 0.09 cm 2 , determined by a mask. The measurements were performed in a nitrogen-filled glove box (oxygen and water contents were below 10 ppm). An Enli-tech class AAA Solar Simulator (model SS-X180R-3A) with a 450-W xenon lamp was used as the light source. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm -2 using an SRC-2020 reference cell (traceable to NREL). The EQE responses were measured using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3-011 (Enli Technology). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell. For the stability tests, all pero-SCs were encapsulated. The operational stability measurement was performed under an LED adjusted to AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm -2 ) in an ambient atmosphere. 
 Device stability test Stability tests were conducted using a commercial test system (PAS-GV, Enli Technology). A white LED source was used to test the long-term stability of the perovskite-organic TSCs. The test was performed on encapsulated devices maintained at 25 °C. MPP tracking was conducted using an LED solar simulator equivalent to AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm -2 . During MPP tracking, the system measures an I-V curve and simultaneously determines a V max , which is then continuously applied to the device until the next I-V measurement provides new data. This process is repeated to achieve continuous MPP tracking. Moreover, a light intensity detector is used to measure the light intensity in real time. If the light intensity decreases, the output power is adjusted accordingly by the software. The synchronized light intensity data are also used to correct the stability measurements. 
 Charge transport characterization TPC was obtained using the all-in-one characterization platform PAIOS (Fluxim AG). In the TPC measurements, the light intensities were logarithmically set to the increments of 10%, 17.8%, 31.6%, 56.2% and 100% of 1 sun. The settling time was 100 μs, the pulse length was 100 μs, and the follow-up time was 200 μs. 
 XRD measurement XRD patterns were obtained by X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical) with Cu Kα radiation at the scan rate of 2° min -1 . 
 SEM The surface and cross-sectional morphology of the films and devices were investigated using a Hitachi S-4800. For the cross-sectional imaging, the cross-sectional surface of the sample was coated with approximately 1-nm-thick gold using sputtering to enhance conductivity. 
 PLQY measurement A silicon detector with a centre wavelength of 800 nm was used to detect the photoluminescence intensity. The samples were placed inside an integrating sphere (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. A10094) and illuminated with a 520-nm continuous laser (InsaneWare). The intensity of the laser was adjusted to 1 sun equivalent using an Si photodiode as the reference cell. PLQY was calculated as the ratio of the number of photons emitted (N emi ) to the number of photons absorbed (N abs ) by the samples. The numbers of emitted and absorbed photons were determined by performing the following measurements: 1. without the sample in the integrating sphere, with the laser filter for remaining laser correction; 2. with the sample in the integrating sphere, without the laser filter for absorption; 3. without the sample in the integrating sphere, without the laser filter for reference; and 4. with the sample in the integrating sphere, with the laser filter for emission. 
 Electroluminescence and ELQY For electroluminescence measurements, a constant voltage was applied to the device using a Keithley 2400 to achieve the same current density as the short-circuit current density under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm -2 . The emission spectra were recorded using an Andor Solis 803 system with a silicon detector. For the ELQY measurements, a Hamamatsu silicon photodiode 1010B was placed in front of the measured pixel at a distance of less than 0.5 cm. A Keithley 485 Picoammeter was connected to the detector and used to measure the emitted light intensity. A Keithley 2400 SourceMeter was used to apply voltage and record the injected current. ELQY was calculated as the ratio of the photocurrent of the detector to the injected current of the device. 
 Mott-Schottky measurement The sample specifications for the active area and thickness were set to 0.09 cm 2 and 600 nm, respectively. The alternating current (a.c.) amplitude was kept constant at 70 mV, with the frequency scanned from 1 kHz to 100 kHz. The applied direct current voltage was then set in the range of 0-2 V with 35 steps. 
 RPV measurement In RPV, a laser pulse from a diode-pumped, Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (NT242, EKSPLA) with about 5 ns pulse duration at a frequency of 5 Hz is used for photogeneration of the charge carriers. After photogeneration, the charge carriers drift through the device under the influence of the built-in electric field. The resulting transient photocurrent is converted to voltage across a load resistor of 100 MΩ and recorded by an oscilloscope (Agilent DSO9104H). Low laser pulse fluences were used to prevent the screening of the internal field and accumulation of charges within the device. 
 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy Device impedance was measured under varying bias voltages and at an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm -2 . The a.c. amplitude was maintained at 70 mV, with the frequency (ω) ranging from 100 Hz to 10 MHz. 
 DFT calculation The VASP code was used to perform all first-principles calculations. The revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation was used for the exchange-correlation functional. Valence-core interactions were described by projector-augmented-wave pseudopotentials. Plane-wave expansions with kinetic energies up to 600 eV were chosen as the basis set for all calculations. For the 2D perovskite calculations, a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell was constructed, and a 2 × 2 × 2 k-point mesh was used. Both atomic positions and cell dimensions were optimized using a conjugate gradient algorithm until the energy difference between successive steps was less than 0.0001. For the surface calculations, a vacuum layer of 20 Å was added perpendicular to the surface to avoid artificial interactions between periodic images. Surface atomic positions were allowed to relax, whereas other positions were fixed. A 2 × 2 × 1 supercell was constructed, and a 3 × 3 × 1 k-point mesh was used for the calculations. The results were visualized using VESTA (v.3.5.8). The density of states results were analysed using VASPKIT (v.1.4). For small molecules, all calculations were performed using ORCA (v.5.0.4). The geometries were optimized using function of ωB97X-D3 with def2-TZVP basis set. ESP and dipole moments were calculated using ωB97M-V/def2-TZVPD. Visualization was carried out using VMD (v.1.9.4).
