Title: Zwitterion Dual-Modification Strategy for High-Quality NiO x and Perovskite Films for Solar Cells
Nickel oxide (NiO x ) has been limited in use as a hole transport layer for its low conduction, surface defects, and redox reactions with the perovskite layer. To address these issues, the incorporation of zwitterion L-tryptophan (Trp) is proposed at the NiO x /Trp interface. The carboxyl group of Trp effectively passivates the surface positive defects of NiO x , thereby improving its optical and electrical properties. The ammonium group of Trp not only passivates negative defects but modulates the growth of the perovskite layer, resulting in an improved perovskite film quality. Furthermore, the Trp layer acts as a buffer layer, suppressing adverse interfacial reactions between the perovskite and NiO x . Consequently, perovskite solar cells with 1.56 and 1.68 eV absorbers achieve the champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.79% and 20.41%, respectively. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices demonstrate excellent long-term stability, retaining above 80% of the initial PCE value after 1600 h of storage in the air with a humidity of 50-60%.
Introduction As the second generation of solar cells, organic-inorganic metal perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted a lot of research interest by their outstanding photovoltaic properties.  [1] [2] [3] [4]  Since 2009, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has quickly increased from 3.8% to 26.1%, which has leveled with that of crystalline silicon-based solar cells.  [5]  Notably, inverted (p-i-n structure) PSCs have witnessed remarkable progress in terms of PCE, offering advantages such as low-temperature processing, reduced hysteresis, and enhanced long-term stability.  [6] [7] [8]  Besides, p-i-n PSCs can stack with commercialized solar cells to form two-terminal tandem solar cells, such as perovskite/silicon tandems and perovskite/ copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) tandems.  [9] [10]  Owing to the above advantages, p-i-n PSCs present enormous application potential and commercial value. 
 DOI: 10.1002/smll.202400356 Nickel oxide (NiO x ) as p-type semiconductor material, has been widely applied to the hole transport layer (HTL) in p-i-n PSCs because of its ease of synthesis, high optical transparency, superior chemical stability and compatibility with flexible or tandem devices.  [11] [12] [13] [14]  However, the performance of NiO x -based inverted devices hardly matches that of organic regular counterparts due to several crucial issues: i) energy level mismatch and low conductivity of NiO x restrain the charge carrier extraction, leading to certain energy loss.  [15]  ii) abundant surface traps, mainly oxygen vacancies, seriously deteriorate the photoelectric properties of devices.  [16]  iii) thermal expansion and lattice mismatch between NiO x and perovskite could induce tensile strain, leading to lattice distortion and accelerating the degradation of perovskite.  [17]  iv) the redox reaction between Ni ‚â•3+ and perovskite precursors forms a hole extraction barrier, reducing device voltage and influencing device stability.  [18, 19]  To address above issues, a series of passivation agents have been applied to modulate the interface between NiO x and perovskite, thus improving the performance and stability of devices, such as inorganic salts.  [20] [21] [22]  organic small molecules or polymers.  [23] [24] [25] [26] [27]  Xie et al. introduced a small molecule adenine at NiO x /perovskite interface to improve the energy level alignment and moisture stability.  [15]  Lian et al. modified the NiO x layer with different polymers to improve the surface contact and decrease the defect states between NiO x and the perovskite.  [25]  Although these modified molecule layer have solved specific issues, the above interface problems have not been thoroughly optimized, so more effective passivation materials still require to be investigated. Zwitterion is a kind of promising passivator because its double charged groups can not only be anchored on the metal oxide, but also passivate the cationic and anionic vacancy defects. Qin et al. has reported the tin (IV) oxide (SnO 2 ) treated with formamidine sulfonic acid are beneficial to rearrange the stack direction, orientation, and distribution of residual PbI 2 .  [28]  Zou et al. used a thin zwitterion salt to modify titanium oxide (TiO 2 ), passivating oxygen vacancy and iodine vacancy defects, improving the band alignment at the TiO 2 -perovskite interface, and reaching the PCE of 20.67% in CsPbI 3 device.  [29]  Although these zwitterions have been extensively studied at the electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite interface, few of them are used to modify HTL, especially NiO x . The interfacial effect of zwitterion between NiO x and perovskite is still uncertain. 
 www.small-journal.com Herein, a neutral amino acid, L-tryptophan (Trp) is introduced in the interface between NiO x and perovskite as a passivation agent and buffer layer to solve the abovementioned interfacial issues. To be specific, negatively charged carboxyl group (‚îÄCOO -) can passivate oxygen vacancy (V O ) defects on the surface of NiO x , filling iodine ion vacancy (V I ) defects, and the positively charged ammonium group (-NH 3 + ) could passivate various cationic vacancy (V FA , V MA or V Pb ) defects, interacting with under-bonded I -and Br -at the buried interface of perovskite. The introduction of Trp can not only enhance optical and electrical properties of NiO x , but also release interfacial lattice strain and improve the quality of perovskite film. Besides, to prove the bifunctional groups modification, we compare Trp with acidic amino acid Lglutamic acid (Glu) with only ‚îÄCOO -as charged group, and basic amino acid L-arginine (Arg) with only -NH 3 + as charged group. The result shows that Trp has the best synergistic passivation effect, and the corresponding PSCs based on NiO x /Trp achieve the champion PCE of 23.79% and 20.41% for 1.56 and 1.68 eV perovskite respectively. Meanwhile, attributed to the suppression of interfacial redox reaction, PSCs with Trp treatment exhibit superior stability which can maintain 86% and 81% of the initial efficiencies after storing in N 2 and in air the at 25 ¬∞C with RH of 50-60% for 1600 h, respectively. Stability of the devices under high temperature has also been significantly improved. 
 Results and Discussion To provide a rationale for our selection of three specific amino acids based on their acidity or basicity, it is important to understand the classification of amino acids according to their isoelectric point (pI).  [30]  Amino acids can be categorized into neutral amino acids, with a pI value ranging from 5.0 to 6.5, acidic amino acids with a pI value ‚âà3, and basic amino acids with a pI value ranging from 7.58 to 10.8. Interestingly, in solution or crystal form, amino acids exist primarily as zwitterions, wherein each amino acid molecule carries a cationic amino group (-NH 3 + ) capable of releasing protons and an anionic carboxyl group (‚îÄCOO -) capable of accepting protons simultaneously. The charged state of the amino acid molecule depends on its pI and the pH value of the surrounding environment. For instance, in a solution, when the pH value is close to the amino acid's pI value, it will simultaneously carry ‚îÄCOO -and -NH 3 + groups. As the pH begins to exceed the pI value, the amino acid gradually releases protons from the -NH 3 + group, forming -NH 2 . Conversely, when the pH falls below its pI value, the ‚îÄCOO -group accepts protons, leading to ‚îÄCOOH. It has been reported that the ‚îÄCOO -and -NH 3 + groups exhibit stronger binding energy with corresponding defect vacancies compared to ‚îÄCOOH and -NH 2 groups.  [27, 31]  Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the interfacial passivation properties of amino acids with different isoelectric point. Given that deionized water is nearly neutral solvent for amino acids (Figure  S1 , Supporting Information), it can be inferred that neutral amino acids, such as L-tryptophan (pI = 5.89) with double charged functional groups, may exhibit superior passivation effects. Consequently, we conducted a series of characterizations using L-tryptophan as the interfacial passivation material. Unless otherwise noted, the Cs 0.05 (FA 0.95 MA 0.05 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.9 5Br 0.05 ) 3 perovskite was employed in this work. The positively charged (halide vacancy) and negatively charged (cation vacancy) defects at the buried interface of perovskite can be passivated by ‚îÄCOO -and -NH 3 + groups, respectively. For the surface of NiO x , oxygen vacancies, as the major defects, will be able to passivated ‚îÄCOO -too. To investigate the effect of L-tryptophan on the NiO x surface, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed. The XPS peaks of N 1s (Figure  2a  As shown in Figure  2b , the characteristic Ni 2p 3/2 core levels of NiO x are mainly located at binding energy of 853.5 and 855.5 eV for Ni  2+  and Ni 3+ species. Generally, Ni 3+ has a higher charge state than Ni 2+ , which may generate more electron vacancies (defect states). These electron vacancies can act as carrier trapping and transport centers, enhancing the conductivity and charge transport properties of NiO x film.  [32]  From the integral area of each peak in the Ni 2p 3/2 spectra, the ratio of Ni 3+ /Ni 2+ changes from 2.20 to 2.65, suggesting the better conductivity and hole extraction capability of NiO x /Trp. The enhance of conductivity can be proved by the current-voltage (I-V) curves with structure of ITO/NiO x or NiO x /Trp HTL/Au, where the electrical conductivity (ùúé) enhances from 8.77 √ó 10 -4 mS cm -1 to 1.12 √ó 10 -3 mS cm -1 (Figure  2d ). Meanwhile, the highly reactive Ni ùõø+ defects, including Ni 2 O 3 , ùõæ-NiOOH, ùõΩ-NiOOH, and Ni 4+ , which causes reactions with perovskite, has an obvious reduction according to Ni 2p 3/2 spectra, and this will contribute to improve the stability of devices.  [19]  The same trend can be observed in O 1s XPS spectra. The suppression of Ni ùõø+ may be explained by the electron donation of moieties in Trp and contributes the increase in Ni 3+ /Ni 2+ ratio. The relative XPS species composition of NiO x and NiO x /Trp from peak fitting are collected in Table  S1  (Supporting Information). Changes in chemical states can significantly affect the arrangement of interfacial energy levels simultaneously.  [14]  According to the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) of different HTLs (Figure  2e ,f), the introduction of Trp interlayer can be well adjusted to the energy level alignment. The Fermi level (E F ) values of NiO x and NiO x /Trp can be calculated as -4.22 and -4.42 eV, and the energy gap between valence band maximum (VBM) and E F narrows from 1.05 to 0.97 eV, indicating that Trp treatment makes NiO x exhibit more p-type properties with higher hole concentration. Furthermore, the VBM levels of NiO x and NiO x /Trp are -5.27 and -5.39 eV. As shown in Figure  2g , the energy level offset between the VBM of HTL and PVK has been extremely reduced, which suggests that the holes from perovskite can be more effectively extracted and transferred to anode, and the non-radiative charge recombination will be suppressed.  [34, 35]  Therefore, an increase in the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of PSCs can be predicted. In addition, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) were conducted to illustrate the recombination kinetics of perovskite films on NiO x with different HTLs. The perovskite coated on NiO x /Trp exhibited a lower PL intensity (Figure  2h ), which indicates a higher carrier extraction and charge transfer process than the NiO x /perovskite  film.  [15]  The TRPL spectra shows an identical trend as PL spectra. The average carrier lifetime (ùúè ave ) of PVK, NiO x /PVK and NiO x /Trp/PVK are calculated as 5689.16, 4048.67 and 3909.45 ns, respectively (Figure  2i ; Table  S2 , Supporting Information), implying that Trp contributes to faster interfacial hole extraction and revealing the effective passivation of interfacial defects.  [33]  Thus, the employment of Trp can acquire favorable VBM alignment and effective facilitation of hole extraction at NiO x /PVK interface. Figure  S3  (Supporting Information) shows the photographs of glass/ITO/NiO x substrates with and without the Trp treatment. The pristine and Trp-treatment NiO x films look no different to the naked eye, since the concentration of the Trp solution is quite low (1.5 mg mL -1 ) and L-tryptophan molecule has no absorption in the visible region. Then, we measured UV-vis absorption to analyze the optical properties of the glass/ITO/NiO x and glass/ITO/NiO x /Trp substrates, concurrently giving the optical properties of glass/ITO substrates as a comparison (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information). Intriguingly, the optical transparence of NiO x has a slight improvement after Trp treatment above 350 nm wave band. To exclude causes of optical interference, a number of repetitive experiments were carried out. Such optical property has been discovered before and is proven to be owing to efficient passivation of NiO x surface point defects. Specifically speaking, Ni ùõø+ surface states create several mid-gap states, which could generate detrimental absorbance, especially in the wave band above 350 nm.  [17]  Therefore, the improved optical transparence demonstrates the effective passivation of Ni ùõø+ sites on the NiO x surface, which is consistent with the results of XPS spectra. To investigate the impact of L-tryptophan on perovskite film, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements are implemented. It can be seen that the grain size has a significant improvement (Figure  3a, b ), accompanied with fewer grain boundaries (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information), meaning the suppression of non-radiative charge recombination.  [36] [37] [38]  Besides, as can be seen from the XRD images, the characteristic diffraction of perovskite deposited on NiO x /Trp substrate exhibits a higher intensity and the reduced full width of half maxima (FWHM), which suggests the improved crystallinity of perovskite film with Trp treatment (Figure  3c ). Larger grain and higher diffraction embody the improvement of perovskite film, which is partially attributed to the modification of Trp to substrate. In general, the character of the substrate is one of crucial factors affecting the morphology and quality of the subsequent perovskite films. From the top-view SEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Figures  S6  and S7 , Supporting Information), it can be observed that the surface roughness of NiO x with Trp treatment is marginally decreased, suggesting they may tend to fill the NiO x nanoparticles on the surface. In addition, the contact angles evolution was measured as shown in Figure  S8  (Supporting Information). Since the R-group of Trp is hydrophobic, the NiO x /Trp film shows higher hydrophobicity than that of NiO x film. Both changes favor the formation of higher quality perovskite film. It has been reported that the surface tension dragging force from substrates can reduce the grain boundary mobility. If the substrate is non-wetting and smooth, this dragging force is greatly reduced, resulting in higher grain boundary mobility, and allowing larger grains to grow. Meanwhile, the smooth surface of HTL also inhibits the formation of nuclei in small cav-ities, thus enhancing grain boundary mobility.  [39]  More importantly, the -NH 3 + group in Trp acts the key role in the growth of perovskite. According to the literature, the amine-containing surface modifications can also affect the quality of the perovskite film grown on top of the charge transport layer (CTL).  [40] [41] [42] [43]  To further investigate the mechanism of ammonium group in L-tryptophan affecting the growth of perovskite, in situ XRD measurements were carried out (Figure  3d, e ). The perovskite films with or without Trp treatment are characterized with different annealing time (0, 30 s and 1, 3, and 6 min) at 100 ¬∞C to unravel their crystallization process. For NiO x substrate, the (110) characteristic peak at ‚âà14¬∞gradually shifts to the higher angle when the annealing time increased from 0 to 1 min, and then to a lower angle in the following 5 min. This phenomenon can be explained that there is competition between MA + and FA + after commencing thermal annealing and FA + is partially replaced by the smaller MA + consequently. As the annealing time increases, a large amount of MA + is evaporated from the lattice, which causes the formation of harmful cationic vacancies.  [44]  Significantly, there is almost no offset of (110) peak for the NiO x /Trp substrate in annealing, which demonstrates that the employment of Trp effectively stabilize the crystal lattice and thereby reduce internal defects of perovskite. On account of differences in linear thermal expansion coefficients between NiO x and perovskite, interface strains and lattice distortion seem to be inevitable. Such strains can lead to lattice distortion and further change the crystal structure of perovskites, adversely affecting the stability of PSCs.  [33]  To explore the interfacial lattice mismatch and residual strain of perovskite deposited on different substrates, a series of grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) were measured. The depth dependent GIXRD are employed while altering the incidence angle ùúë, and the variation ranges of the 14¬∞peak position that corresponds to the perovskite (110) plane are tracked, where the larger incidence inclination means the deeper diffraction signal. As shown in Figure  3f , with the ùúë increasing, 14¬∞peak position of perovskite deposited on NiO x shifts to lower degree, indicating the enlargement of interplanar crystal spacing along the vertical orientation to HTL. Interestingly, the shift trend to lower degree has been suppressed clearly after Trp treatment (Figure  3g ; Figure  S9 , Supporting Information), which demonstrates the release of residual strain at the buried interface.  [33, 45]  The released strain is probably attributed to the -NH 3 + groups in Trp filling the bottom cationic vacancies and providing growth sites for perovskite crystal. From aforementioned results, it can be concluded that the existence of Trp is conductive to fabricate strain-less lattices of perovskite films and stable NiO x -based devices. To further demonstrate the dual-passivation effect of Trp at NiO x /PVK interface, we performed a series of characterizations taking L-glutamic acid (Glu) and L-arginine (Arg) as comparisons. As acidic or basic amino acids, Glu (pI = 3.22) and Arg (pI = 10.76) only carry one kind of charged groups in neutral solvent DMSO, namely ‚îÄCOO -and -NH 3 + , respectively (Figure  4c, d ). Consequently, it can be predicted that they both interact with only one side of the NiO x /PVK interface. First, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and attenuated total refraction (ATR) FTIR was measured, where different amino acids were deposited on NiO x film or mixed with PbI 2 in DMSO (Figure  4a, b ). Through spectral observation, it can be noticed that the stretching vibration of C‚ïêO and N‚îÄH bonds are both redshifted to the lower wavenumber. The former may be due to conjugated effect, thus enlarging the electron delocalization in C‚ïêO.  [46]  and the latter indicates the hydrogen-bonding interaction between -NH 3 + and halide anions (N‚îÄH/I).  [42]  However, there is only the peak of C‚ïêO showing a redshift in Glu samples, whereas the stretching vibration of N‚îÄH is nearly unchanged. Besides, Arg samples exhibit the opposite phenomenon to Glu, which preliminarily confirms the above conjecture. To make a further exploration of the interaction between the charged groups and per-ovskite layer, we deposited three types of amino acids on the perovskite film, and then conducted XPS measurement to Pb and I elements (Figure  4e, f ). It is worth noting that the XPS spectra show the same trend as the FTIR. More specifically, for the Trp and Glu samples, two main peaks of Pb 4f 7/2 and Pb 4f 5/2 all shift to the lower binding energies, indicating the electron donation from the ‚îÄCOO -forms a stronger coordination bond with undercoordinated Pb 2+ . The similar energy shift can be seen from the peak of I 4f in Trp and Arg modified perovskite films, which means that there are interactions between under-bonded I -and -NH 3 + . From the results presented in FTIR and XPS spectra, it could be inferred that amino acid molecules with a single kind of charged group (Glu, Arg) may exhibit a passivation effect on NiO x or perovskite, while Trp can achieve the superior dual passivation and modification at NiO x /Trp interface, more favorable for the elimination of trap states and the extraction of charge carrier. With the outstanding optoelectronic properties discussed above, 1.56 eV PSCs (Figure  S10 , Supporting Information) with the architecture of ITO/HTLs/Cs 0.05 (FA 0.95 MA 0.05 ) 0.95 -Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 /C 60 /BCP/Ag have been fabricated, in which the HTLs refer to NiO x , NiO x /Trp, NiO x /Glu and NiO x /Arg. It is worth noting that even though DMSO is the solvent for both Trp and perovskite, it can hardly wash away the solidified molecules on the surface of NiO x . Low solubility of Trp in water is one of the reasons, and most Trp molecules have strong interaction with NiO x . XPS measurements are conducted to confirm the effect of solvent treatment (Figure  S11 , Supporting Information). As shown in Figure  5a  and Table  1 , the PSCs based on NiO x /Trp exhibit a negligible hysteresis and the overall superior photovoltaic performance with the champion PCE of 23.79%, short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 25.32 mA cm -2 , open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.14 V, and fill factor (FF) of 82.31% to the bare NiO x -based devices (PCE of 18.2% with J SC of 24.41 mA cm -2 , V OC of 1.05 V, and FF of 76.74%). The J SC values of devices are in conformity with the integrated J SC values (24.70 mA cm -2 for target and 24.10 mA cm -2 for control, respectively) calculated by external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Figure  5b ). From the max power point (MPP) plot, it can be observed that the PSCs with Trp treatment possess higher and more stable steadystate photocurrent and power (Figure  5c ). In addition, more concentrated distribution of photovoltaic parameters can reflect the higher reproducibility of device performance based on NiO x /Trp (Figure  S12 , Supporting Information). The more elaborate photovoltaic performances of devices have been collected in Figure  S13  and Tables  S3  and S4  (Supporting Information). Interestingly, although all the photovoltaic parameters of PSCs modified by Glu and Arg optimized relatively, the improvement of devices based on Glu is mainly on V OC , whereas devices based on Arg on J SC . This phenomenon can be explained by abovementioned conclusion, namely that Glu with ‚îÄCOO -trends to modify NiO x and then modulate its energy level, while Arg with -NH 3 + is prone to improve the quality of perovskite film, thus facilitating charge transfer. Furthermore, we fabricated devices based on Cs 0.05 MA 0.15 FA 0.8 Pb(I 0.75 Br 0.25 ) 3 to prove the optimization effect of Trp. As shown in Figure  S14  (Supporting Information), the PSCs with a bandgap of 1.68 eV (Figure  S15 , Supporting Information) also show an obvious improvement in photovoltaic performances (PCE of 20.41% to previous 18.28%). To explore the defect state density of various HTLs, spacecharge-limit current (SCLC) measurements for hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/NiO x or NiO x /Trp/perovskite/Au were conducted (Figure  5d ). The device with Trp produces a smaller trap-filled limit voltage (V TFL ) of 0.76 V and a lesser trap-state density (N t ) of 7.46 √ó 10 15 cm -3 than the reference NiO x -based one (with V TFL of 0.97 V and N t of 9.73 √ó 10 15 cm -3 ). The suppressed trap-state density can be attributed to the decline of grain boundaries (the main location of traps) for the passivation effect of Trp at the buried interface.  [47] [48]  Light intensity dependent J-V  characterization of different devices was performed where the unit slope of V OC versus log-scaled light intensity deviation from 1 (1 k B T/q) reflects recombination probability (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute thermodynamic temperature and q is the elementary charge).  [37]  As can be seen in Figure  5e . The slop of 1.29 k B T/q for PSC with Trp is closer to 1 than the reference one (1.91 k B T/q), suggesting that the trap assisted recombination has been effectively suppressed. Additionally, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of PSCs with different HTLs are carried out to investigate the transfer resistance in these devices (Figure  5f ). The device with Trp treatment possesses higher R rec , meaning better charge transfer and minimized carrier recombination. According to these results, it could be proved that the L-tryptophan has an excellent dual-passivation effect on the NiO x /Trp interface, which enables performance enhancement of PSCs in multiple aspects. The advancement of V OC is primarily attributed to energy level alignment between the VBM of NiO x and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of perovskite, and the decreased interfacial defects and improved quality of perovskite film could obviously enhance the J SC and FF. Although NiO x itself is highly environmentally stable, the adverse redox reactions between active Ni ùõø+ and perovskite always cause the rapid degradation of PSCs according to the following equation HAPbI 3 + Ni ùõø+ O x ‚Üî Ni (ùõø-1)+ O x H + PbI 2 + A (g) + 1 2 I 2(g) ( 1 ) where HA+ is a protonated A-site cation (CH 3 NH 3 + or MA + , CH 5 N 2 + or FA + ) and A is the deprotonated A-site cation (CH 3 NH 2 , CH 4 N 2 ). Based on results of above measurements, the content of Ni ùõø+ in NiO x film substantially decreases with the modification of Trp, thus the redox reaction should be suppressed. Meanwhile, the L-tryptophan molecules between NiO x and perovskite as a buffer layer avoid direct contact of the two. To investigate whether Trp favors the stability of devices based on NiO x , we annealed the perovskite films deposited on NiO x and NiO x /Trp at 85 ¬∞C in N 2 . As shown in Figure  6a ,b, the perovskite film without Trp treatment exhibits a faster degradation which had been deteriorated significantly at 120 h. XRD patterns also shows the stronger characteristic peak of PbI 2 at 12.7¬∞for perovskite deposited on NiO x , suggesting the accelerated decomposition (Figure  6c, d ). The degradation of devices efficiency at 85 ¬∞C also proves that (Figure  6e ). Meanwhile, the unencapsulated PSCs with Trp treatment also possess excellent long-term stability, which maintain 86% and 81% of the initial efficiencies after storing at 25 ¬∞C in N 2 and in the air with RH of 50-60% for 1600 h respectively, superior to NiO x -based devices (Figure  6f, g ). These results demonstrate that Trp can effectively suppress the redox reaction at NiO x /perovskite interface, and thus improv the device stability significantly. 
 Conclusion In summary, we successfully introduced the zwitterion Trp into the buried interface of NiO x -based PSCs. Profited from the double charged groups in Trp, the negative and positive defects at NiO x /Trp interface are effectively passivated. Moreover, Trp modification endows perovskite film with improved crystallization, released residual strain and suppressed detrimental reaction. Therefore, Therefore, the NiO x /Trp-based PVCs with 1.56 and 1.68 eV absorbers show champion PCE values of 23.01% and 20.41% with negligible hysteresis, respectively. Trp-treatment enables PSCs to possess superior stability, and the unencapsulated devices maintain 86% of the initial efficiencies after storing in N 2 for 1600 h. Stability of the devices under high temperature or high humidity has also been significantly improved. The zwitterion dual-modification strategy provides a simple and effective way to solve the interfacial issues for NiO x -based PSCs. 
 Experimental Section Experimental Procedures can be found in the Supporting Information. Figure 1 1 Figure1exhibits the structure of planar inverted PSC and the dual-passivation mechanism of L-tryptophan (FigureS2, Supporting Information) in the NiO x /perovskite (PVK) interface. The positively charged (halide vacancy) and negatively charged (cation vacancy) defects at the buried interface of perovskite can be passivated by ‚îÄCOO -and -NH 3 + groups, respectively. For the surface of NiO x , oxygen vacancies, as the major defects, will be able to passivated ‚îÄCOO -too. To investigate the effect of L-tryptophan on the NiO x surface, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed. The XPS peaks of N 1s (Figure2a) which is consistent with L-tryptophan molecule can be visibly observed in NiO x /Trp sample, indicating the successful introduction of Trp to the surface on NiO x . The introduction of Trp makes significant difference to Ni and O elements of NiO x . As shown in Figure2b, the characteristic Ni 2p 3/2 core levels of NiO x are mainly located at binding energy of 853.5 and 855.5 eV for Ni2+  and Ni 3+ species. Generally, Ni 3+ has a higher charge state than Ni 2+ , which may generate more electron vacancies (defect states). These electron vacancies can act as carrier trapping and transport centers, enhancing the conductivity and charge transport properties of NiO x film. [32]  From the integral area of each peak in the Ni 2p 3/2 spectra, the ratio of Ni 3+ /Ni 2+ changes from 2.20 to 2.65, suggesting the better conductivity and hole extraction capability of NiO x /Trp. The enhance of conductivity can be proved by the current-voltage (I-V) curves with structure of ITO/NiO x or NiO x /Trp HTL/Au, where the electrical conductivity (ùúé) enhances from 8.77 √ó 10 -4 mS cm -1 to 1.12 √ó 10 -3 mS cm -1 (Figure2d). Meanwhile, the highly reactive Ni ùõø+ defects, including Ni 2 O 3 , ùõæ-NiOOH, ùõΩ-NiOOH, and Ni 4+ , which causes reactions with perovskite, has an obvious reduction according to Ni 2p 3/2 spectra, and this will contribute to improve the stability of devices. [19]  The same trend can be observed in O 1s XPS spectra. The suppression of Ni ùõø+ may be explained by the electron donation of moieties in Trp and contributes the increase in Ni 3+ /Ni 2+ ratio. The relative XPS species composition of NiO x and NiO x /Trp from peak fitting are collected in TableS1(Supporting Information). Changes in chemical states can significantly affect the arrangement of interfacial energy levels simultaneously. [14]  According to the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) of different HTLs (Figure2e,f), the introduction of Trp interlayer can be well adjusted to the energy level alignment. The Fermi level (E F ) values of NiO x and NiO x /Trp can be calculated as -4.22 and -4.42 eV, and the energy gap between valence band maximum (VBM) and E F narrows from 1.05 to 0.97 eV, indicating that Trp treatment makes NiO x exhibit more p-type properties with higher hole concentration. Furthermore, the VBM levels of NiO x and NiO x /Trp are -5.27 and -5.39 eV. As shown in Figure2g, the energy level offset between the VBM of HTL and PVK has been extremely reduced, which suggests that the holes from perovskite can be more effectively extracted and transferred to anode, and the non-radiative charge recombination will be suppressed. [34, 35]  Therefore, an increase in the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of PSCs can be predicted. In addition, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) were conducted to illustrate the recombination kinetics of perovskite films on NiO x with different HTLs. The perovskite coated on NiO x /Trp exhibited a lower PL intensity (Figure2h), which indicates a higher carrier extraction and charge transfer process than the NiO x /perovskite 
 Figure1exhibits the structure of planar inverted PSC and the dual-passivation mechanism of L-tryptophan (FigureS2, Supporting Information) in the NiO x /perovskite (PVK) interface. The positively charged (halide vacancy) and negatively charged (cation vacancy) defects at the buried interface of perovskite can be passivated by ‚îÄCOO -and -NH 3 + groups, respectively. For the surface of NiO x , oxygen vacancies, as the major defects, will be able to passivated ‚îÄCOO -too. To investigate the effect of L-tryptophan on the NiO x surface, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed. The XPS peaks of N 1s (Figure2a) which is consistent with L-tryptophan molecule can be visibly observed in NiO x /Trp sample, indicating the successful introduction of Trp to the surface on NiO x . The introduction of Trp makes significant difference to Ni and O elements of NiO x . As shown in Figure2b, the characteristic Ni 2p 3/2 core levels of NiO x are mainly located at binding energy of 853.5 and 855.5 eV for Ni2+  and Ni 3+ species. Generally, Ni 3+ has a higher charge state than Ni 2+ , which may generate more electron vacancies (defect states). These electron vacancies can act as carrier trapping and transport centers, enhancing the conductivity and charge transport properties of NiO x film. [32]  From the integral area of each peak in the Ni 2p 3/2 spectra, the ratio of Ni 3+ /Ni 2+ changes from 2.20 to 2.65, suggesting the better conductivity and hole extraction capability of NiO x /Trp. The enhance of conductivity can be proved by the current-voltage (I-V) curves with structure of ITO/NiO x or NiO x /Trp HTL/Au, where the electrical conductivity (ùúé) enhances from 8.77 √ó 10 -4 mS cm -1 to 1.12 √ó 10 -3 mS cm -1 (Figure2d). Meanwhile, the highly reactive Ni ùõø+ defects, including Ni 2 O 3 , ùõæ-NiOOH, ùõΩ-NiOOH, and Ni 4+ , which causes reactions with perovskite, has an obvious reduction according to Ni 2p 3/2 spectra, and this will contribute to improve the stability of devices. [19]  The same trend can be observed in O 1s XPS spectra. The suppression of Ni ùõø+ may be explained by the electron donation of moieties in Trp and contributes the increase in Ni 3+ /Ni 2+ ratio. The relative XPS species composition of NiO x and NiO x /Trp from peak fitting are collected in TableS1(Supporting Information). Changes in chemical states can significantly affect the arrangement of interfacial energy levels simultaneously. [14]  According to the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) of different HTLs (Figure2e,f), the introduction of Trp interlayer can be well adjusted to the energy level alignment. The Fermi level (E F ) values of NiO x and NiO x /Trp can be calculated as -4.22 and -4.42 eV, and the energy gap between valence band maximum (VBM) and E F narrows from 1.05 to 0.97 eV, indicating that Trp treatment makes NiO x exhibit more p-type properties with higher hole concentration.

Experimental Section Materials: Chlorobenzene (CB, anhydrous, 99.8%), N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.8%), isopropanol (IPA) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, 99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Formamidinium iodide  
 Preparation of amino acid solution: The Trp, Arg and Glu was dissolved in deionized water at 1.5, 1.5 and 1.0 mg/ml, respectively. Then, the solution was stirred at 60 ‚ÑÉ for 2 h. Device fabrication: ITO glass substrates were sequentially cleaned with detergent, deionized water, ethanol, acetone and isopropanol, by sonication for 30 min respectively. Subsequently, the cleaned substrates were treated with UV ozone for 20 min before used. Afterwards, nano NiO x dispersion (10 mg/ml in water) was spincoated on ITO with 2000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 110‚ÑÉ for 20 min. Then, the asprepared amino acid solution was deposited on the NiO x at 4000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 100 ‚ÑÉ for 10 min. After annealing, the substrates were immediately moved to glove box filled with Ar for the following treatment. The 1.56 eV perovskite film was obtained by a two-step spin-coating process with 2000 rpm for 2 s and 4000 rpm for 38 s. 200 ŒºL mixed antisolvent (chlorobenzene: isopropanol = 9:1, v:v, containing 0.5 mM F-PEAI) was slowly dripped onto the spinning substrate at 7 s before the end of spinning program. Subsequently, the samples were annealed at 100 ¬∞C for 60 min. For the 1.68 eV perovskite, the perovskite precursor was spincoated at 2000 r.p.m. for 5 s and 4000 rpm for 20 s. 100 ¬µl CB was dropped at 5 s before the end, and then the samples were annealed at 100 ¬∞C for 15 min. Ultimately, 20 nm of C 60 , 7 nm of BCP and 100 nm of silver electrode were thermally evaporated using a shadow mask (0.04 cm 2 ). Device characterization: Current-voltage (J-V) curves of PSCs were measured by a Keithley 2400 source meter measurement system with an AM 1.5G filter at an illumination intensity of 100 mW/cm 2 , as calibrated by a reference monocrystalline silicon solar cell (91 150 V Oriel Instruments). The reverse scan range is from 1.5 V to -0.5 V, with 25 mV for each step. The effective area of the devices was confirmed to be 0.04 cm 2 using a non-reflective metal mask. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra was examined in air under short-circuit conditions using SOFN 7-SCSpecIII equipped with a 100 W Xe arc lamp, a filter wheel and a monochromator. 
 Materials characterization: The monochromatic light was chopped at a frequency of 80 Hz and photocurrents were measured using a lock-in amplifier. The setup was calibrated using a certified silicon reference diode of known spectral response. The EIS spectra were measured by PMC-1000 in the range from 100,000 to 0.1 Hz.               ( FAI), Methylammonium chloride (MACl), Methylammonium bromide (MABr), Cesium iodide (CsI) and 4-fluoro-phenethylammonium iodide (F-PEAI) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass and NiO x nanocomposites (NPs) were obtained from Beijing HuaMin New Materials Technology Co., Ltd. bathocuproine (BCP), [60] Fullerene (C 60 ), lead (II) iodide (PbI 2 ) and lead (II) bromide (PbBr 2 ) were purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd. Amino acids (Trp, Glu and Arg) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. All the chemicals were purchased and used directly without any treatment. 
 photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was an Thermo escalab 250Xi with an excitation energy of 21.22 eV. All UPS measurements were conducted with a sample bias of -10 V and a pass energy of 2 eV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured by a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer with CuKŒ± radiation (Œª = 1.5418 √Ö) at room temperature with a 0.02¬∞ step size (2Œ∏) for 0.2 s. Grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and in-situ XRD patterns were measured by Rigaku Smart-Lab XRD. UVozone treatment was employed by BZS250GF-TS UV-ozone cleaner. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurement were accessed through a field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Regulus 8100). UV-vis absorption spectra of ETLs on the glass were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-1900 spectrophotometer over the 300-900 nm wavelength range. For the photoluminescence (PL) test, a
