Title: Efficient Carbon-Based Perovskite Solar Cells Passivated by Alkylammonium Chloride

Introduction Organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered substantial scholarly interest due to their economic viability, straightforward fabrication procedures, exceptional charge carrier mobility, and remarkable light-absorbing capabilities.  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  These attributes have positioned PSCs as an exceptionally promising and prominently studied class of photovoltaic devices within the scientific community. PSCs are typically structured with several key components, including a transparent conductive oxide, an electrontransport layer (ETL), a perovskite (PVK) absorbing layer, a hole-transport layer (HTL), and a metal counter electrode (CE). Among these constituents, the HTL material and the metal CEs represent the primary cost contributors in PVK devices. This cost factor poses a significant challenge to their commercialization. Notably, the hygroscopic nature of the HTL layer and the intrinsic presence of ionic defects within the PVK layer introduce the potential for chemical reactions with the metal CEs, even in inert conditions. This phenomenon can result in the corrosion of the metal CEs and the decomposition of the PVK, thereby substantially compromising the device stability of PSCs.  [6]  To address the dual challenges of cost and device stability, recent years have witnessed substantial research interest and development in the realm of HTL-free carbon-based PSCs (C-PSCs). Carbon electrodes, within this context, offer several Hole-transport layer (HTL)-free carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) have garnered significant attention in the research community due to their cost-effectiveness and high stability. However, the absence of a traditional HTL can lead to substantial nonradiative recombination of charge carriers between the perovskite layer and the carbon electrode, significantly impacting efficiency. Herein, the performance effects of different alkylammonium chlorides, including butylammonium chloride, octylammonium chloride, and dodecylammonium chloride (DACl), on perovskite (FA 0.1 MA 0.9 PbI 3 ) are investigated to produce high-performance HTL-free C-PSCs. Following passivation, the film exhibits a more uniform grain size distribution and fewer grain boundary defects. Furthermore, with an increase in the alkyl chain length, enhanced interactions with the perovskite film result in reduced trap state density and increased carrier lifetime. After DACl passivation, the C-PSC achieves a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 16.56% and a high open-circuit voltage (V oc ) of 1.074 V. The V oc enhancement is primarily attributed to the better energy-level alignment, effectively improving hole transport and electron-blocking capabilities while suppressing nonradiative recombination. Additionally, they demonstrate exceptional hydrophobic characteristics and robust stability in the presence of humidity, making them particularly promising for future practical applications in the field of photovoltaics. distinct advantages. First, they present a cost-effective alternative for large-scale fabrication, mitigating the cost concerns associated with traditional metal electrodes. Additionally, carbon electrodes obviate the need for the intricate thermal evaporation processes required for metal electrodes, instead allowing for straightforward preparation through low-temperature curing (typically at 100 °C). Moreover, carbon electrode materials possess inherent characteristics that are highly conducive to improved device performance. These include hydrophobicity, high conductivity, exceptional stability, and inertness to ion migration, collectively enhancing their suitability for deployment in PSCs. As such, the exploration of C-PSCs represents a promising avenue for addressing both cost and stability considerations in the field.  [7, 8]  Recently, Wang et al. proposed a self-driven prenucleation strategy to realize rapid nucleation in the PVK crystallization in C-PSCs; a PCE over 19% was achieved.  [9]  However, the PCE of most HTL-free C-PSCs is notably lower compared to conventional all-structured devices. This performance disparity primarily stems from the absence of a HTL in HTL-free C-PSCs. This absence results in inadequate contact between the PVK layer and the carbon layer, leading to the presence of inevitable pinholes at their interface. Consequently, a higher proportion of charge carriers undergo nonradiative recombination at the interface, severely impeding hole transport and, subsequently, diminishing overall device efficiency.  [10, 11]  Recent studies increasingly indicate the effectiveness of using a 2D PVK solution as an interface modification layer for treating the surface of 3D PVK. This approach has proven capable of significantly diminishing interfacial defects and suppressing nonradiative recombination processes.  [12]  Passivation strategies for 2D PVK typically involve the selection of one or more long-chain amine salts or large amine molecules. These passivating agents are employed to effectively passivate the surface of 3D PVK materials, thereby facilitating the formation of 2D/3D heterojunctions on the surface of the 3D PVK.  [13]  Layered 2D PVK structures exhibit enhanced environmental stability owing to their robust van der Waals interactions with PbI 6 4À . Furthermore, the inherent hydrophobic nature of long-chain organic ions contributes to the superior moisture stability of PVK films.  [14]  Most investigations into the surface passivation of 2D PVK have predominantly utilized iodides or bromides, such as BAI, OAI, TEAI, and TEABr.  [15] [16] [17] [18]  These compounds readily form stable 2D PVK structures on 3D PVK surfaces. In a prior study conducted by Seok et al., the passivation effect of alkylamine iodides (BAI, OAI, DAI) with varying chain lengths on full-device PVK films was examined. The results indicated a pronounced increase in both electron-blocking capacity and moisture resistance with the extension of the alkyl chain length.  [19]  Mahmud et al. established that chlorides serve as effective surface passivation agents, forming 2D PVK layers on film surface. They employed oleic acid (OA) as the spacer cation to create efficient 2D PVK passivation layers, achieving robust surface passivation. Furthermore, their findings highlighted the diffusion of Cl À anions into the 3D PVK lattice, which effectively passivates halide and/or organic cation lattice vacancies. This comprehensive passivation strategy yielded superior performance compared to OAI and OABr passivation techniques.  [20]  The use of chlorides with varying chain lengths for surface passivation may introduce substantial variations in the properties. Consequently, the inclusion of such long-chain chlorides in HTL-free C-PSCs becomes imperative. This approach aims to address challenges associated with interfacial defects at the C-PCS interface, bulk defects, and to comprehensively investigate the impact of different long-chain chlorides on the performance of HTL-free C-PSCs through a systematic analysis of their effects. This study investigates the impact of different chain length amine chlorides, namely, butylammonium chloride (BACl), octylammonium chloride (OACl), and dodecylammonium chloride (DACl), on the PCE of HTL-free C-PSCs with 3D PVK (FA 0.1 MA 0.9 PbI 3 ) absorbing layer. When PVK films are posttreated with these amine chlorides, the resulting films exhibit more uniform grain size and fewer grain boundary defects compared with the control PVK film. Moreover, with increasing alkyl chain length of the amine chlorides, the trap density is further reduced while the carrier lifetime of the PVK film is further prolonged, which contribute to a monotonically increment in the V oc and fill factor (FF) of the C-PSCs. After DACl posttreatment, the champion HTL-free C-PSCs achieve a PCE of 16.56% and a V oc of 1.074 V. The improvement in V oc and PCE for C-PSCs primarily stems from passivation of PVK films and better energy-level alignment between PVK and carbon electrode when the PVK films are posttreated with the amine chlorides. Additionally, PVK film treated with DACl exhibits outstanding hydrophobicity and moisture stability, significantly inhibiting PVK degradation in high-humidity environments. 
 Results and Discussion During the crystallization and annealing processes of PVK films, the formation of lead and halide vacancies on the surfaces of PVK films tends to occur, which can adversely affect the device efficiency and long-term stability of PSCs. To mitigate these surface defects associated with the lead and halide vacancies, alkylammonium chlorides with different chain lengths are employed to passivate these defects and establish 2D/3D heterojunctions on the PVK surface. The alkylamine cations engage in hydrogen bonding with halide atoms, effectively passivating the defects, while Cl À anions are instrumental in passivating halide vacancy defects, consequently reducing defect recombination centers.  [20, 21]  As shown in Figure  1a , the structure of C-PSCs followed the sequence: ITO/SnO 2 /FA 0.1 MA 0.9 PbI 3 /carbon electrode, where MA and FA denote methylammonium (CH 3 NH 3 ) and formamidinium [HC(NH 2 ) 2 ], respectively. To investigate the impact of different alkylammonium chlorides on performance of C-PSCs, we fabricate C-PSCs with 2D/3D PVK absorbing layers by posttreatment of the 3D PVK films with BACl, OACl, and DACl. The 2D PVK layers are optimized for each chloride by changing their concentrations in the isopropyl alcohol (IPA), as shown in Figure  S1 -S3 (Supporting Information). The detailed photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table  S1  and S2 (Supporting Information). Based on these results, the optimal concentrations were determined to be 1 mg mL À1 for BACl, 2 mg mL À1 for OACl, and 2 mg mL À1 for DACl. Throughout the ensuing discussions, we employed these optimized precursor solution concentrations to fabricate the PVK films and C-PSCs. The passivated devices were denoted as BACl PSC, OACl PSC, and DACl PSC. Photovoltaic parameters for the control PSC and 2D/3D PSCs passivated at the optimal concentrations are depicted in Figure  1b-e . All passivated PSCs demonstrated significantly higher PCE compared to the control PSC, with DACl PSC exhibiting the highest average efficiency. The enhanced efficiency can be attributed to substantial improvements in both the V oc and FF. Furthermore, as the alkyl chain length increased, both V oc and FF showed a consistent upward trend. Additionally, the J sc experienced a slight increase. To investigate changes in the surface morphology of the PVK films, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging was conducted on all PVK films. As illustrated in Figure  S4a-d  (Supporting Information), compared with the control PVK, PVK films passivated with BACl, OACl, and DACl (denote as BACl PVK, OACl PVK, DACl PVK) displayed larger and more uniformly sized grains. The decrease in grain boundaries can be attributed to the presence of Cl À anions.  [22]  These Cl À anions effectively facilitate the growth of PVK crystals, thereby enhancing the quality of PVK films.  [23, 24]  The reduced grain boundaries can further lead to a decreased trap density of the PVK film and are beneficial to improve the stability of the PVK films. The PVK film after DACl passivation exhibits a more uniform and dense morphology, with blurred grain boundaries, which could be one of the contributing factors to the significant improvement in open-circuit voltage (V oc ). The carbon paste is predominantly composed of carbon black and graphite flakes. Based on our earlier investigations,  [25]  a coarse surface of the PVK film enhances the probability that smaller PVK nanocrystals situated between two larger crystals fail to establish effective contact with the graphite flakes. Consequently, the efficient extraction of holes from the PVK film to the carbon electrode is hindered. To further validate the improved morphology of the PVK films achieved through DACl surface treatment, we conducted atomic force microscopy analysis on both the control PVK film and the DACl-treated PVK film, as depicted in Figure  S5  (Supporting Information). Due to nonuniform grain sizes and the presence of more grain boundaries and pinholes, the root mean square (RMS) roughness of the control PVK film is relatively high, measuring at 12 nm. In contrast, the DACl-treated PVK film exhibits a reduced RMS of 8 nm, indicating a smoother surface compared to the control. This decrease in roughness in DACl-passivated PVK films further enhances their suitability for C-PSC devices, ensuring a tighter contact between the PVK layer and the carbon electrode, thereby facilitating efficient holes transfer.  [26]   Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to examine the 2D/3D PVK film. In the FTIR spectrum of PVK film posttreated with OACl in Figure  S6a  (Supporting Information), characteristic peaks resembling those of the control PVK film are generally observed. However, an additional set of four characteristic peaks emerges in the range of approximately 2700-3000 cm À1 in the 2D passivated film, as highlighted in the zoomed-in region in Figure  2a . These peaks correspond to the stretching vibrations of methyl (-CH 3 ) and methylene (-CH 2 -) groups, indicating the presence of a significant quantity of OA cations on the corresponding PVK surface. To reinforce this observation, FTIR spectra of PVK films posttreated with higher OACl concentrations are demonstrated in Figure  S6b  (Supporting Information). With the higher OACl concentration, the characteristic peaks associated with methyl and methylene groups became more pronounced, confirming the successful integration of OACl into the PVK film interface. Additionally, FTIR spectroscopy was performed on BACl PVK and DACl PVK films, as presented in Figure  2b . In the 2700-3000 cm À1 range, these films displayed characteristic peaks similar to those of OACl PVK films. As anticipated, these characteristic peaks became more prominent with the increasing length of the alkyl chain, providing further confirmation of the successful incorporation of BACl and DACl into the PVK film interface. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was employed to assess the crystallographic properties of all PVK films. As shown in Figure  2c , notably, the device passivated with 1 mg mL À1 BACl exhibits a dominant peak at 2θ < 10°, corresponding to a characteristic peak induced by the formation of 2D PVK facilitated by BACl.  [27]  However, in the case of PVK films passivated with 2 mg mL À1 OACl and 2 mg mL À1 DACl, no distinct 2D characteristic peaks were observed at low angles. This absence could be attributed to the formation of an exceedingly thin 2D PVK layer that may not be detectable through conventional XRD. Subsequently, as the concentration was increased to 4 mg mL À1 , PVK films passivated with OACl and DACl displayed inconspicuous characteristic peaks at 8.8°and 11.2°, as illustrated in Figure  2d . These characteristic peaks align with those reported in the literature for 2D PVK, confirming the formation of 2D PVK structures.  [28, 29]  To investigate the interaction mechanisms between alkylammonium chlorides and PVK films, we conducted X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses on all PVK films. As illustrated in Figure  3a , the Pb 4f peaks of the control PVK were located at 143.35 and 138.45 eV. In contrast, all three alkylammonium chloride-passivated films exhibited shifted Pb 4f peaks, moving toward lower binding energies with increasing alkyl chain length. This shift indicates a chemical interaction between the organic ammonium cations and Pb 2þ ions.  [30]  As depicted in Figure  3b , compared to the control PVK film, the passivated films exhibit a shift toward lower binding energy in the I 3d peak. As illustrated in Figure  S7  (Supporting Information), The Cl 2p signals were not detected in the XPS spectra for BACl PVK and OACl PVK films, suggesting that the residue Cl À amount was too low to be detected. This is because Cl À was likely to volatilize during the annealing process. However, DACl PVK film exhibited a distinct Cl 2p peak. The presence of Cl À in the DACl PVK film was further confirmed using energydispersive spectroscopy (EDS), as depicted in Figure  S8  (Supporting Information). Therefore, a substantial amount of Cl À remains in the DACl PVK film after annealing, which could be helpful to enhance the quality of the corresponding PVK films. The UV-vis spectra of PVK films passivated with BACl, OACl, DACl, and the control PVK film prepared on glass substrates are presented in Figure  3c . The results indicate that there is no significant difference in light absorption between the control group and the PVK films treated with long-chain This suggests that the surface 2D coverage layer does not affect the overall light absorption capability of the films. Dark current density measurements were carried out as shown in Figure  3d . Remarkably, the dark current density exhibited a significant decrease in the BACl, OACl, and DACl PSCs compared to the control PSC. This finding suggests that the 2D/3D heterojunction enhances internal defect mitigation, resulting in a substantial reduction in nonradiative recombination. Consequently, fewer electrons and holes are captured and recombine at defect states, thereby promoting efficient charge transfer within the device.  [31]  The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were fitted using a double-exponential decay function described by Equation (1): Y ¼ A 1 exp ðÀt=τ 1 Þ þ A 2 exp ðÀt=τ 2 Þ (1) The fitting results are concisely summarized in Table  S3  (Supporting Information), where, τ 1 and τ 2 represent the decay time constants. Based on the fitting results presented in Figure  4a , the average lifetimes (τ average ) for the control PVK film, BACl, OACl, and DACl PVK films were calculated as 95.14, 121.83, 284.05, and 302.11 ns, respectively.  [32]  The increase in τ average values indicates a reduction in nonradiative recombination in the passivated PVK films. Moreover, as the alkyl chain length increases, the average lifetime becomes longer. To investigate the passivation effects of alkylammonium chloride with different chain lengths, we conducted steady-state PL spectroscopy on PVK films deposited on glass substrates, as depicted in Figure  4b . It is evident that the DACl PVK film exhibits significantly enhanced PL emission intensity, followed by the OACl PVK film, while the control PVK film shows the lowest PL emission intensity. The increased PL intensity indicates a substantial suppression of nonradiative recombination on the surface of the PVK film.  [33]  The defect density of the PVK films was determined using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method under dark conditions as depicted in Figure  4c . The trap density (N trap ) in the PVK films was calculated using Equation (2): where ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε r is relative permittivity, q is the elementary charge, and L is the thickness of the PVK layer. N trap ¼ 2ε 0 ε r V TFL =ðqL 2 Þ (2) For the control PVK sample, N trap was measured to be 1.45 Â 10 16 cm À3 . In contrast, the BACl, OACl, and DACl PVK film exhibited trap densities of 1.28 Â 10 16 , 1.19 Â 10 16 , and 1.11 Â 10 16 cm À3 , respectively. All passivated films displayed reduced defect densities compared to the control sample. Notably, the DACl PVK film exhibits the lowest defect density, suggesting the suppression of nonradiative recombination of charge carriers. This favors an enhanced charge collection efficiency in C-PSCs, leading to more effective charge transport.  [34]  Previous study indicates that surface dipole can adjust the band level of the PVK film.  [23, 35]  The positively charged NH 3 þ functional group in chloroalkylamines can interact with [PbI 6 ] 4À octahedra on the surface of the 3D PVK through hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces, thereby forming surface dipoles. This interaction may result in changes to the band energy levels. Additionally, posttreatment with chloroalkylamines can induce the formation of 2D PVK layers on the surface of the 3D PVK, which has been demonstrated to alter the energy band levels of the PVK film.  [36] [37] [38]  To assess the impact of the passivating agents on the energy levels of the PVK films, we utilized photoelectron spectroscopy in air to analyze the energy levels, as illustrated in Figure  S12  (Supporting Information). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels for the control, BACl, OACl, and DACl PVK film were determined to be 5.86, 5.82, 5.75, and 5.70 eV, respectively. As the length of the alkyl chain increases, the HOMO energy level decreases, with DACl displaying the lowest HOMO energy level. As depicted in Figure  S13  (Supporting Information), we utilized Tauc plots obtained from UV-vis spectroscopy (Figure  4c ) to calculate the optical bandgap energy (E g ) of each PVK film. The control PVK film exhibits an E g value of 1.58 eV, while the E g values for other passivated PVK films remain at 1.59 eV. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of these films were calculated using Equation (3): LUMO ¼ HOMO À E g (3) Subsequently, we constructed energy level diagrams for the our HTL-free C-PSCs, as presented in Figure  5a . It is evident that, in comparison to the control PVK film, the valence band edges of all three passivated films exhibit an upward trend. As the length of the alkyl chain increases, the energy difference between the passivated films and the carbon electrode diminishes. This indicates that the formation of the 2D/3D heterojunction can optimize the band alignment between the PVK film and the carbon electrode, facilitating hole transport and reducing V oc losses. This is likely one of the primary reasons for the higher V oc observed in the DACl PVK films.  [39]  Furthermore, the DACl PVK film, with its conduction band energy offset of 0.17 eV, can also serve as an electron-blocking layer, preventing electrons from undergoing nonradiative recombination at the carbon electrode.  [40]  To delve deeper insight into the internal charge transfer behavior of the devices, we conducted electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements in dark.  [41]  Figure  5b  displays Nyquist plots for the control, BACl, OACl, and DACl PSCs. The data were fitted using the equivalent circuit shown in the inset, where R rec denotes the recombination resistance. In comparison to the control PSC, all three alkylammonium chloride-passivated devices exhibited significantly increased R rec values, with DACl PSCs displaying the highest R rec . This points to a substantial enhancement in charge carrier separation within the device, effectively suppressing charge recombination.  [42]  Figure  5c  illustrates the relationship between V oc and light intensity, which was analyzed to investigate the charge recombination kinetics in HTL-free C-PSCs. The relationship between V oc and light intensity (P light ) is described by the Equation (  4 ):  [43]  V oc ¼ nkTlnðP light Þ=q þ C (4) where n denotes the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, T stands for temperature, q represents the elementary charge, and C is a constant. For devices that are closer to the ideal diode, n = 1, and the deviation of n > 1 indicates a nonradiative recombination that occurs at the defect.  [44]  The n values for the control, BACl, OACl, and DACl PSCs are 1.92, 1.80, 1.73, and 1.67, respectively. A decrease in n signifies effective suppression of trap-assisted nonradiative recombination, which is favorable for enhancing V oc and FF. Notably, DACl PSC exhibits the lowest slope, indicating the successful mitigation of trap-assisted recombination.  [45]  Figure  5d  displays the reverse scan champion J-V curves for the control, BACl, OACl, and DACl PSCs. The photovoltaic parameters for these champion devices are summarized in Table  1 . The control PSC achieves an optimal PCE of 14.43%, featuring J sc of 20.58 mA cm À2 , V oc of 1.001 V, and FF of 69.5%. With BACl treatment, the highest PCE reaches 15.25%, accompanied by J sc of 20.41 mA cm À2 , V oc of 1.043 V, and FF of 71.6%. For the OACl-treated device, an impressive optimal PCE of 15.91% is achieved, alongside J sc of 20.83 mA cm À2 , V oc of 1.048 V, and FF of 72.93%. Notably, the DACl PSC outperforms the rest with the highest PCE of 16.56%. It notably achieves a significantly improved V oc of 1.074 V, a J sc of 20.87 mA cm À2 compared to the control PSC, and a slightly increased FF of 73.92%. J-V tests were further conducted to examine the hysteresis phenomenon in our C-PSCs. Illuminated under AM1.5G 100 mW cm À2 conditions, we analyzed the forward and reverse scan efficiencies of the four devices, as depicted in Figure  S14  (Supporting Information). The reverse scan PCE for the control PSC is 14.43%, while the forward is 12.80%. For the BACl, OACl, and DACl PSCs, the reverse scan PCEs are improved to 15.25%, 15.91%, and 16.56%, with the forward being are 14.81%, 15.09%, and 15.96%. The hysteresis factor (HF) for these devices is diligently computed utilizing Equation (  5 ): HF ¼ jPCE RS À PCE FS j MAXðPCE RS , PCE FS Þ Â 100% (5) where PCE RS and PCE FS are the PCE values in reverse and forward direction, respectively. The differences in PCE between the control film and the films passivated with BACl, OACl, and DACl were 11.30%, 2.89%, 5.15%, and 3.62%, respectively. The mitigation of J-V hysteresis is primarily attributed to the treatment of PVK with alkylammonium chloride, which leads to a reduction in traps and grain boundaries.  [46]  Furthermore, we conducted measurements of the integrated current density based on the external quantum efficiency (EQE) for the control device and those treated with BACl, OACl, and DACl. As depicted in Figure  5e , the slightly improved average J sc values observed in the tested devices correlate with the EQE measurements, indicating that DACl-treated films exhibit enhanced light absorption. Moreover, we assessed the stability of PCE at the maximum power point (MPP) for the control device and the three treated devices, as illustrated in Figure  5f . At a bias voltage of 0.78 V, the stable PCE for the control device was 13.42%. For the BACl PSC, the PCE reached 14.63% at a bias voltage of 0.82 V, while for the OACl PSC, it reached 15.46% at a bias voltage of 0.86 V. Notably, the DACl PSC achieved a stable PCE of 15.80% at a bias voltage of 0.88 V. It is worth mentioning that the treated devices displayed no significant decay in J sc and PCE during 150 s of MPP tracking, further confirming the excellent stability of the 2D/3D structure during MPP operation. It has been proved that surface passivation of PVK films using 14, 16, and 18 alkylamines cation resulted in a modest increase in open-circuit voltage but led to a decrease in short-circuit current, causing an efficiency reduction.  [47]  Their research indicates that excessively long alkylamines may lower photon conversion efficiency, consequently reducing current density. A similar outcome was observed in Li's study, suggesting that excessively long alkyl chain lengths lead to a notable decline in photovoltaic performance. This decline can be attributed to hindrances in carrier transport and extraction at the buried interface.  [48]  To study the possible effect of alkylammonium chlorides with longer carbon chains on PVK performance, we treated the PVK films using hexadecylammonium chloride (HDACl) with varying concentrations: 1, 2, and 3 mg mL À1 . As the HDACl concentration increased, the V oc notably increased, while J sc exhibited a significant decrease. The optimal concentration for HDACl treatment was 2 mg mL À1 . Compared with DACl-passivated C-PSCs, a decrease in both V oc and J sc was clearly observed, which is consistent with previous publication.  [47, 48]  The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Figure  S15 , Table  S4 , and S5 (Supporting Information). Humidity stability poses a significant challenge for highperformance PSCs. To assess humidity stability, encapsulated PVK films were exposed to air at a relative humidity of 40%-60% for 8 days. As shown in Figure  S16  (Supporting Information), both the control and BACl PVK films exhibited yellowish degradation, resulting from the irreversible reaction of water with the PVK and its subsequent decomposition into precursor compounds.  [49]  Conversely, OACl and DACl PVK films maintained their black color without significant degradation. This observation suggests that the moisture resistance of the passivated films increases with the length of the alkyl chain. To evaluate alterations in the hydrophobicity of PVK films subsequent to surface passivation with alkylammonium chlorides of varying alkyl chain lengths, water contact angle measurements were performed. As illustrated in Figure  6a , the contact angles for the control, BACl, OACl, and DACl PVK films were 68.76°, 69.11°, 89.63°, and 91.47°, respectively. Notably, the hydrophobicity of the film remained largely unaltered after treatment with BACl, consistent with the findings from the humidity stability tests conducted in ambient air. However, following treatment with OACl and DACl, a substantial improvement in film hydrophobicity was observed. It is worth highlighting that the DACltreated film exhibited the highest contact angle, signifying an increase in surface hydrophobicity with longer chain lengths in the modifying agent. Finally, the long-term stability of the C-PSCs was investigated by storing them in ambient air conditions (RH: 20%-60%, 20 AE 5 °C). The normalized PCE evolution over time for the control, BACl, OACl, and DACl PSCs is depicted in Figure  6b . The control PSC maintained over 55% of its initial efficiency after 700 h of storage. Furthermore, after passivation with BACl, OACl, and DACl, the stability was significantly enhanced. Following 700 h of storage, the BACl PVK films still retained over 70% of their initial efficiency, while the OACl and DACl PVK films exhibited over 80% of their initial efficiency. This enhancement is attributed to the hydrophobicity of the long carbon chain 2D passivation layer on the surface and effective defect passivation.  
 Conclusions In summary, our study delved into the surface treatment of PVK films using alkylamine compounds with varying chain lengths (BACl, OACl, DACl), successfully leading to the formation of 2D/3D heterostructures. Following passivation, the films displayed more uniform grain sizes and fewer grain boundary defects. Additionally, longer alkylamine chain lengths resulted in enhanced interactions with the PVK film, translating into reduced trap state densities and extended carrier lifetimes. Moreover, longer alkylamine chains were associated with increased V oc . Remarkably, the DACl PSC emerged as the champion, achieving an impressive PCE of 16.56% and a high V oc of 1.074 V. This notable improvement in V oc can be primarily attributed to the superior energy-level alignment observed in films treated with longer carbon chain passivation. This alignment effectively facilitated hole transport, bolstered electron-blocking capabilities, and mitigated nonradiative recombination at the interface between the PVK layer and the carbon electrode while also yielding a more uniform film morphology. When it comes to humidity stability and hydrophobicity, films passivated with DACl and OACl maintained their dark appearance without significant degradation after exposure to 40%-60% relative humidity in ambient air for 8 days. Particularly, DACl exhibited an impressive contact angle of 91.47°, indicating superior hydrophobicity. Furthermore, devices passivated with DACl and OACl, even when subjected to 20%-60% relative humidity in ambient air for 700 h, retained over 80% of their initial efficiency, making them particularly promising for future practical applications in the field of photovoltaics.

To create the FA 0.1 MA 0.9 PbI 3 PVK precursor solution, a mixture containing 25.8 mg of FAI, 214.6 mg of MAI, and 691.5 mg of PbI 2 was dissolved in 1 mL of a mixed solvent composed of DMF and DMSO in a 9:1 volume ratio. Furthermore, separate precursor solutions were prepared for 2D BACl, OACl, and DACl passivation by dissolving 1 mg of BACl, 2 mg of OACl, and 2 mg of DACl, respectively, in 1 mL of IPA. All solution preparations were carried out within a nitrogen-filled glove box. PSC Fabrication: Initially, indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were subjected to a thorough cleaning process involving sequential ultrasonication in ethanol, detergent, deionized water, ethanol, and ethanol for 30 min. Subsequently, the substrates were dried completely in a 60 °C oven. A 15 min UV-ozone treatment was applied to the ITO glass. To form the ETL, a 45 μL SnO 2 solution was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C in air for 30 min. An additional 15 min UV-ozone treatment was carried out after this step. The next phase involved the application of a 45 μL PVK precursor solution onto the SnO 2 ETL. This solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Precisely 6 s after the initiation of spin coating, 220 μL of CB antisolvent was introduced to facilitate rapid solvent extraction. Subsequently, the substrate was placed on a hot plate and annealed at 120 °C in air for 12 min. For surface passivation, a solution of either BACl, OACl, or DACl was spin-coated onto the PVK layer at 5000 rpm for 20 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. The device fabrication was completed by blade coating a carbon paste onto the PVK film and heating it at 100 °C for 20 min on a hot plate. Characterization: The samples underwent a comprehensive suite of characterization techniques. XRD analysis was conducted using a Cu Kα X-Ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Ultima IV). Surface morphology was examined through focused ion beam SEM (FIB-SEM) utilizing the S9000X Xe Plasma FIB-SEM system. Elemental composition and surface types were analyzed using an Ultim EDS detector. FTIR spectroscopy was performed using a Bruker INVENIO-S instrument to obtain the infrared spectra of the samples. Surface XPS spectra of the thin film samples were acquired with an X-Ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Science, K-Alpha). The UV-vis absorption spectra of the films were recorded employing a UV-1800 spectrophotometer, while photoluminescence intensity measurements were conducted using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4600). Carrier lifetimes of the samples were determined utilizing a time-resolved photoluminescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments FLS1000). The HOMO energy level of the PVK films was obtained through photoelectron spectroscopy, employing a spectroscopic photoelectron instrument (Suzhou Leiyun Optoelectronics IPS-4). J-V (current-voltage) tests were conducted under simulated AM1.5G solar illumination (100 mW cm À2 ) using a Keithley 2461 source meter and a solar simulator (Enlitech, SS-X160R). EQE measurements of the samples were performed using an external quantum efficiency measurement system.
