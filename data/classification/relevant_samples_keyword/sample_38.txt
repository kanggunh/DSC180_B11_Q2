Title: Defect passivation with bromine template for efficient perovskite solar cells
Interfacial modification is an effective method to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, defects in SnO 2 itself and interfacial defects with perovskite (PVK) lead to the limited performance of PSCs. In this study, 3, 5-dibromobenzoic acid (3,5-DBBA) material was added at the interface between electron transport layer (ETL)and perovskite absorption layer. It was found that Br in 3,5-DBBA can passivate the oxygen vacancies and uncoordinated Sn 4+ defects in SnO 2 , and optimize the interface contact between ETL and perovskite film, inhibit the non-radiative recombination of charge carriers, and improve the carrier lifetime and extraction yield. Br is also able to interact with the perovskite lattice to passivate Pb 2+ defects and regulate the crystal growth of the perovskite. The open circuit voltage of perovskite solar cells was increased from 1.12 V to 1.16 V, and the power conversion efficiency was increased from 19.19 % to 22.27 %. The bromine templates strategy can also effectively improve the stability of PSCs. It provides a new strategy for realizing high performance perovskite solar cells.
Introduction Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention due to their rapid improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE). From 2009 to 2023, PCE increased from 3.8 % to 26.1 %  [1] . In addition, due to the extraordinary photoelectric properties of perovskites and significant improvement in stability, PSCs have shown great commercial application potential and are considered to be the next generation of solar cell technology  [2, 3] . As known, the n-i-p based PSCs is developed from dye-sensitized solar cells, which can easily realize high-performance devices  [4] . The PSCs structure is usually composed of transparent conductive oxide, dense or mesoporous N-type electron transport layer (ETL), perovskite absorption layer, P-type hole transport layer (HTL), back contact electrode, and sometimes additional interface layer for better performance  [5] . ETL as the main charge transport layers of PSCs, plays an important role in the transportation process of photo-generated carriers  [6] . SnO 2 , as a promising ETL that has received much attention in recent years, is an ideal candidate for efficient and stable PSCs due to its good light transmittance, high electrical conductivity and low temperature preparation  [7, 8] . PSCs with SnO 2 as ETL achieved the best PCE over 25 %  [9] . However, oxygen vacancies and interstitial Sn atoms, among others, are common defects in SnO 2 , which can exist as composite centers at the interface between SnO 2 and perovskite films, leading to charge accumulation and non-radiative recombination of charge carriers and significant PSCs stability  [10] [11] [12] [13] . To date, most of the significant approaches aimed at improving interface defects between perovskites and SnO 2 electron transport layer  [14] . The modifying materials applied to this interface can be mainly categorized into inorganic compounds (KCl  [15] , RbF  [16] , etc.) and organic compounds with specific functional groups (-COOH  [17] , -NH 2  [18] , -SO 3  [19] , etc.). For inorganic compound materials, Zhu et al. used SnO 2 -KCl complexes as ETL, and K + and Cl -at the ETL/PVK interface, which has effectively passivated the ETL/PVK interface defects and increased the interfacial contacts. Meanwhile, K + ions from ETL could diffuse through the perovskite film and passivate the grain boundaries. The PCE was significantly increased from 20.2 % to 22.2 %  [20] . More often than not, researchers also choose organic materials containing special functional groups. Zheng et al. used ammonium formate (HCOONH 4 ), an organic additive containing ammonium groups, to modify the ETL, perovskite layer and its interface as a whole in-situ during the thermal annealing process, which effectively reduce the surface oxygen vacancy of electron transport layer and enhance the electron extraction ability of SnO 2  [21] . Although some materials can effectively passivate interfacial defects, they can also adversely affect the growth of perovskite. Because of this, the modification of buried interface between PVK and SnO 2 plays a crucial role in regulating the crystal growth of perovskite thin films. Deng et al. introduced 4, 4′-diaminodiphenylsulfone hydrogen iodide (DDSI 2 ) at the buried interface as a multifunctional modifier. DDSI 2 slowed the crystal growth rate and relieved lattice stress through strong interaction (coordination and hydrogen bonding) with FAI and PbI 2 , thereby improving the quality of perovskite. The champion efficiency of PSCs was successfully increased to 24.10 %  [22] . Although there are many materials for buried interface modification, however, there are few materials that simultaneously passivate interfacial defects and modulate perovskite growth. In this work, we introduced bromo-containing organic material 3,5-DBBA at the PVK/ETL buried interface to explore its effect on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. We found that Br in the material can interact with the perovskite lattice, passivate the defects and regulate the crystal growth of perovskite. In addition, Br can passivate the Ovacancy and uncoordinated Sn 4+ defects in SnO 2 , optimize the interface contact between perovskite film and ETL, inhibit the non-radiative recombination of carriers, and improve the carrier lifetime and extraction rate. The carboxyl functional group can remove the salinide vacancy and improve the crystallinity of perovskite film. Halide anionic formate (HCOO -) inhibit the anion vacancy defects at grain boundaries and perovskite surfaces and enhance their crystallinity. The performance of all aspects of the device has been significantly improved.

Device fabrication: Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate was cleaned with detergent, deionized water, ethanol, acetone and ethanol by ultrasonic for 15 min, respectively. At the end of ultrasonic cleaning, the ITO substrate was dried using N2 airflow. DI water was used to dilute the stock solution of SnO2 colloid, and the SnO2 colloid was diluted to 2.5 % with deionized water in a 1:5 vol ratio. The colloidal solution was sonicated for 20 min to make it evenly mixed. The ITO substrate was subjected to UV ozone treatment for 15 min. Using a pipette gun, 50 μL diluted SnO2 solution was sucked over the conductive glass substrate, spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and annealed at 150 • C for 30 min to obtain the electron transport layer. Then, 0.0 mg/mL, 2.0 mg/mL, 4.0 mg/mL, 6.0 mg/mL, 8.0 mg/mL concentration of 3,5-DBBA solution were spin-coated on ETL at 5000 rpm for 30 s, and annealing at 100 • C for 5 min. 1.5 mmol of PbI2 was dissolved in 0.9 mL DMF and 0.1 mL DMSO and heated at 70 • C for 4 h. Then 90 mg FAI, 6.4 mg MAI, and mg MACl were dissolved in 1 mL IPA, respectively. After filtration, 45 μL PbI2 solution was taken with a pipetting gun and spin-coated on ETL at 2000 rpm for 30 s. After spin coating, the coating was immediately placed on a heating table and annealed at 70 • C for 10-15 s. After the substrate was cooled to room temperature, 90 μL FAI was taken with a pipetting gun and spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Then the spin-coated substrate was transferred to air with a humidity below 40 % and annealed at 150 • C for 15 min. The configured Spiro-OMeTAD was then spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Oxidation was performed using dry air for 24 h. Finally, Ag with a thickness of 100 nm was deposited by evaporation under a pressure of 6 × 10 -4 Pa. Materials and device characterization: The J-V characteristics of solar cells were obtained using a Keithley B2901A source meter under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm -2 ) and a solar simulator (Enli Tech, SS-F5-3A, Taiwan) in glovebox. The active area of PSCs was 0.105 cm 2 . The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) stability test is continuously tested under the illumination intensity of one sun using the solar cell testing system (PURI2400-E8). The absorption spectra were recorded by UV-Vis absorption spectrometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu). The surface root mean square (RMS) roughness and contact potential difference (CPD) of perovskite films were characterized using a Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM) with tapping mode, specifically the KEYSIGHT Technologies 7500 instrument. Internal crystal structures were obtained by XRD (X Pert PRO MPD). Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements of carrier lifetimes were recorded using a steady-state transient fluorescence spectrometer (FLS980, Edinburgh, UK). UV-Vis spectroscopy was performed using a Shimadzu UV-3600 Plus instrument. 
 Results and discussions 3,5-DBBA is a stable, environmentally friendly and inexpensive material, and more importantly, the Br functional group and -COOH functional group have the potential to regulate perovskite crystallization and blunt ETL interface defects. The molecular structure and electrostatic potential of 3,5-DBBA are shown in Fig.  1a , which shows that the negative charges are mainly concentrated at the -COOH and Br functional groups. This means that the Br functional group can effectively coordinate with Sn 4+ and passivate the oxygen vacancy, and the -COOH functional group acts as a quasi-halide anion to fill the anion vacancy in the perovskite lattice. The effect of 3,5-DBBA on the absorbance of SnO 2 , PbI 2 and perovskite films was investigated using UV-vis test. As shown in Fig.  1b , the SnO 2 films with 3,5-DBBA have lower absorption in the wavelength range of 350~400 nm. This facilitates the reduction of light loss and improves the light absorption of PVK films  [23] . In Fig.  1c , the addition of 3,5-DBBA at a concentration of 6.0 mg/mL significantly enhanced the light absorption of PbI 2 film in the wavelength range of 350~450 nm. This suggests that the perovskite film formed by 3, 5-DBBA may also exhibit higher absorption. Furthermore, the PbI films exhibited a slight increase in visible light absorption around nm, which could be attributed to the UV absorption change resulting from the combination of 3,5-DBBA with PbI 2 at the buried interface. Consequently, an improved light absorption capacity was achieved. Fig.  1d  illustrates the perovskite films prepared using 6.0 mg/mL 3, 5-DBBA, which exhibited a significant increase in light absorbance between 400 nm and 550 nm. This enhancement can be attributed to the promotion of perovskite grain size by 3,5-DBBA, consequently increasing the light scattering ability of the perovskite films and leading to enhanced light absorption. Furthermore, by XPS testing, the film treated with 3,5-DBBA has an additional peak at 70.08 eV compared to the SnO 2 film, which is attributed to Br 3d (Fig.  1e ). This indicates that 3, 5-DBBA is added to the surface of the SnO 2 film. In addition, Fig.  1f  shows that the Sn 3d peak moves about 0.3 eV in the direction of higher binding energy. The results show that when 3, 5-DBBA is introduced into the surface of SnO 2 film, there is a strong interaction between Br and Sn, which also confirms that the bromine template material can effectively passivate the Sn defects of the undercoordination. The effects of 3,5-DBBA on the morphology and surface potential of SnO 2 films were investigated using AFM and KPFM, respectively. Fig.  2a  and b  shows that the surface roughness of the 3,5-DBBA-modified SnO 2 films was drastically reduced from 8.51 nm to 1.47 nm, which resulted in a significantly denser and smoother surface of the SnO 2 films, increasing the contact area of the interface between SnO 2 and perovskite, which could contribute to the subsequent improvement of the growth of perovskite crystals. The KPFM test images in Fig.  2c  and d reveal the distribution of SnO 2 surface potentials. The control group exhibited an obvious low-potential region on the SnO 2 surface, corresponding to a protruding position. This protrusion could cause nonradiative charge carrier complexation and reduce the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In contrast, the surface potential distribution of 3,5-DBBA-modified SnO 2 became more uniform. The potential line distribution at the dashed position also showed that the extreme value of the scanning potential in the control SnO 2 film was about 160 mV, while in the 3,5-DBBA-SnO 2 film, it was only about 90 mV. The introduction of 3,5-DBBA effectively reduced the extreme difference in surface potential, resulting in a more uniform surface potential distribution of the SnO 2 film. This is beneficial for charge carrier transport at the buried interface. Furthermore, the contact potential difference (CPD) on the upper surface of SnO 2 films was tested by KPFM. The average CPDs of -279 mV and -678 mV were calculated from the surface potential maps of the SnO 2 films in Fig.  2c  and d , respectively. The work function of the upper surface of the SnO 2 films was calculated using Equations (  1 ) and (  2 ): CPD = Φ tip -Φ sample e ( 1 ) Φ sample = 5.02 eV + ( CPD HOPG -CPD sample ) (2) where AFM and KPFM tests were performed on the PbI 2 films shown in Figs.  S1a  and S1b . The surface roughness of the films was reduced from 16.5 nm to 13.8 nm after the introduction of 3,5-DBBA.The spin-coated PbI 2 thin film layer on the 3,5-DBBA substrate exhibits smoother surface, which effectively prevents the formation of holes on the perovskite surface produced by the PbI 2 reaction. These holes tend to form defects at the PVK/HTL interface, leading to non-radiative recombination of carriers  [24] . The average CPD was calculated to be -27.5 mV and -mV through Figs.  S1c  and S1d , respectively. The corresponding work function was calculated to be 5.47 eV and 5.95 eV through Equations (  1 ) and (2), respectively. 3,5-DBBA increased the work function of the PbI films, which is consistent with the effect of 3,5-DBBA on SnO 2 . Φ The KPFM was carried out to investigate the effect of 3,5-DBBA introduction on the morphology and surface potential of perovskite films. Fig.  3a  and b  demonstrate that the roughness of perovskite films decreased from 35.8 nm to 33.0 nm after the introduction of 3,5-DBBA. Additionally, the surface of 3,5-DBBA based perovskite films appeared smoother. KPFM maps of perovskite films, as depicted in Fig.  3c  and d , exhibits average CPD of 149 mV and 305 mV, respectively. The corresponding work function was calculated to be 5.29 eV and 5.13 eV using  equations (  1 ) and (2). 3,5-DBBA resulted in the decrease of work function of perovskite films, and the energy band of perovskite film was curved upward, which was more favorable for carrier separation and transport  [25] . Fig.  3e  shows the energy level arrangement of PSCs  [3, 12, 26, 27] . The introduction of 3,5-DBBA causes the energy band bend downward of SnO 2 ETL, reducing the energy barrier for electron transport from perovskite to SnO 2 and enhancing the hole blocking effect of SnO 2  [28] . In conclusion, the introduction of 3,5-DBBA contributes to the improvement of the surface of perovskite as well as the interfacial contact between ETL/PVK, which reduces carrier recombination at the interface and improves carrier transport. XRD tests were performed to explore the effect of 3,5-DBBA additives on the structure and orientation of perovskite crystals. As shown in Fig.  3f , the diffraction peaks of PbI 2 in the perovskite films were suppressed and the diffraction peaks of perovskite (001) crystalline surface were enhanced by the addition of 3, 5-DBBA. The intensity ratio of the diffraction peaks of perovskite (001) and PbI 2 is shown in Fig.  S2 . The perovskite (001) diffraction peak was found to be higher in the target perovskite films, suggesting that 3, 5-DBBA can promote the generation of perovskite (001) crystalline planes and inhibit the PbI 2 residue in the films. The (001) crystalline plane has a higher dielectric constant, which can reduce the exciton binding energy and increase the probability of carrier separation. In addition, (001) has higher carrier mobility and lower density of trapped states than other planar structures  [29] . Perovskite with good crystal structure will be favorable for carrier transport and PSCs performance. To explore the effect of 3, 5-DBBA on the device performance, we designed the device structure of ITO/SnO 2 /3,5-DBBA/perovskite/OAI/ Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag as shown in Fig.  4a . We introduced different concentration gradients (0.0 mg/mL, 2.0 mg/mL, 4.0 mg/mL, 6.0 mg/mL, 8.0 mg/mL) of 3,5-DBBA solution to modify the ETL/PVK interface of perovskite solar cells, and analyzed its effect on the performance of the perovskite cells. The optimal modification concentration was found. Table  1  and Fig.  4b  show that the optimal PCE of standard device is 19.19 %, V OC is 1.12 V, FF is 75.96 %, and J SC is 24.17 mA/cm 2 . The optimal PCE, V OC , J SC and FF of 3,5-DBBA modified PSCs were 22.27 %, 1.16 V, 24.8 mA/cm 2 and 77.31 %, respectively. The V OC , J SC , and FF of the visible modified devices are well improved. The J SC of the modified device is significantly higher than that of the standard device, indicating that the 3,5-DBBA modified device improves the conductivity and electron mobility of the SnO 2 electron transport layer, and improves the electron extraction ability of the SnO 2 ETL/PVK interface. This fully indicates that the modification of 3,5-DBBA is the main reason for the elevation of J SC . Secondly, there is an obvious increasing trend of V OC , indicating that 3,5-DBBA also has a significant effect on the V OC of the device. It is speculated that the main reason is that 3,5-DBBA reduces the non-radiative recombination at the interface between tin dioxide and perovskite and has a passivating effect on the defects on the perovskite surface, reducing the defect density on the upper surface and increasing the carrier lifetime. It can be seen from the results shown in Fig.  4d, e, 4f  and 4g that adding a certain concentration of 3,5-DBBA material is conducive to optimizing the device interface, so as to improve the performance indicators of perovskite devices to a certain extent. To explore the effect of 3,5-DBBA on the hysteresis of the device, we tested the hysteresis of the device by forward and reverse scanning, and the results are shown in Fig.  4c . The PCE and FF indexes of the standard device are low, and the hysteresis phenomenon occurs after the forward and reverse scanning. When the 3,5-DBBA material is introduced, the PCE, J SC , FF of the device are effectively improved, and the hysteresis phenomenon is also improved. It can be seen that the 3,5-DBBA modified SnO 2 can inhibit the ion migration at the interface between perovskite and SnO 2 to improve the device performance. We also calculate the hysteresis index (HI) based on these parameters, calculate equation as follows: HI = PCE Reverse -PCE Forward PCE Reverse (3) according to Formula (3), the hysteresis index of the standard device is 23.4 %, and the hysteresis effect is large. However, after 3,5-DBBA modification, the hysteresis index of PSCs is reduced to 10 %, and the decrease of the hysteresis index indicates that the hysteresis effect of the  device is weakened. The weakening of hysteresis effect indicates that the introduction of 3,5-DBBA contributes to the reduction of defects at the SnO 2 /PVK interface and the crystal structure of the perovskite film is more complete, which helps to inhibit ion migration. This result is well in line with the increase of FF and J SC , and then brings the increase of the photoelectric performance of the solar cell device  [30] . In addition, we conducted EQE test on the device, and the results are shown in Fig.  4h . It can be seen that the EQE of the improved device is higher, and the integrated current density of the improved device is 24.57 mA/cm 2 , which is higher than the 23.29 mA/cm 2 of the control device. To explore the effect of 3,5-DBBA on device stability, we performed maximum power point tracking on the long-term durability of unpackaged devices (Fig.  4i ). The test conditions were one sun, RH 30-40 %, at room temperature. After 4000 s, the 3,5-DBBA modified device maintained about 70 % of the original PCE, and the subsequent PCE remained stably present. In contrast, the original PSCs maintains about 65 % of the original efficiency, while the subsequent PCE is quite unstable. By 3,5-DBBA modification, the ETL/PVK interface defects are passivated, the perovskite crystal quality is improved, and the phase transition is effectively inhibited, thereby improving the stability of the device. The addition of 3,5-DBBA enhances the interfacial contact between SnO 2 and perovskite, and leads to the formation of more (001) planar structure of perovskite, which will affect the separation and transport of charge carriers  [31] . In order to investigate the effect of introducing a 3, 5-DBBA passivation layer on the carrier properties. Carrier transport and complexation of films on different substrates were studied using PL and TRPL. Compared with the PL peak intensity of the original glass-based perovskite film (Fig.  5a ), the PL peak intensity of perovskite film containing the SnO 2 layer showed a significant reduction. This indicates that the charge carriers generated inside the perovskite film during photoexcitation are extracted by SnO 2 , which suppresses the intensity of the PL peak. However, the PL peak intensity obtained by SnO 2 treated with 3,5-DBBA is lower than that of the control SnO 2 , which indicates that SnO 2 treated with 3,5-DBBA has stronger carrier extraction ability and can effectively extract electron carriers from the perovskite film. In addition, as shown in Fig.  5b , the spectra are well fitted by a biexponential decay function with I = A 1 exp(-t/τ 1 ) + A 2 exp(-t/τ 2 ). The fitting parameters are shown in Table  2 , and the average carrier lifetimes of several perovskite films were calculated using equation  (4) .  where A 1 and A 2 are the relative amplitude fractions of each decay component, and τ 1 and τ 2 are the PL lifetime of the fast and slow decay parts. As can be seen from Table  2 , the average carrier lifetime of perovskite films without SnO 2 layers can reach 207.03 ns, which is much higher than that of films with SnO 2 layers. In addition, the average carrier lifetime (89.66 ns) of perovskite films containing 3,5-DBBA is lower than that of perovskite films (97.96 ns) without 3,5-DBBA in the presence of SnO 2 layer. This indicates that 3, 5-DBBA-treated SnO 2 can reduce the carrier lifetime in the perovskite film, allowing the electrons in the perovskite film to be transferred efficiently  [32] . τ = A 1 τ 2 1 + A 2 τ 2 2 A 1 τ 1 + A 2 τ 2 (4) The incident light intensity dependence of the V OC and J SC on PSCs reveals the recombination process of charge carriers in the device. The PSCs with optimal modification concentration (6.0 mg/mL) were tested with light intensity from 0.1 to 1 simulated sun. The effect of charge recombination on PSC generation is explored through the V OC and J SC curves of the device as a function of incident light intensity as shown in Fig.  5c . There is an approximate linear relationship between the J SC of the device and the incident light intensity, as shown in Equation (  5 ): J SC ∝P α ( 5 ) where α is the power exponent. When α = 1, it indicates that the bimolecular recombination inside the device is negligible and the charge is rapidly exported to the external circuit. The fitted α values of the standard device and the device introduced with 3,5-DBBA are 0.99 and 0.99, respectively, obtained from Fig.  S3 . Before and after the introduction of 3,5-DBBA, the α value of the device is close to 1, indicating that the bimolecular recombination in the device is inhibited under the short-circuit condition, and the charge carriers are more effectively output to the external circuit to form a current  [33] . The above results show that the introduction of 3,5-DBBA does not lead to carrier complex losses within PSCs. For the light intensity dependence of V OC , according to the existing formula: V OC = nkT C q -1 ln ( J SC J 0 + 1 ) ( 6 ) where n is the ideal factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, T c is the cell temperature, q is the basic charge, and J 0 is the saturation current density in the dark. It can be seen that the slope of V OC to light intensity is nkT c q -1 . When n=1, the device is mainly composed of bilayer recombination under the condition of open circuit, and the trap-guided recombination can be ignored  [34] . If the value of n is closer to 1, it means that the device has a lower density of defect states  [35] . Fig.  5c  shows that the n value of the modified device decreases. The fitting n value of PSCs modified by 3,5-DBBA is 1.48, which is lower than that of the standard device (1.59), indicating that the introduction of 3,5-DBBA will reduce the trap auxiliary recombination, indicating that the defect of PSCs is effectively regulated  [36] . The mechanism of defect passivation with 3,5-DBBA at ETL/PVK interface was depicted in Fig.  5d . We speculate that it may mainly derived from the two Br functional groups of 3,5-DBBA, which can passivate oxygen vacancies and interact with undercoordinated Sn 4+  [37] . In addition, it contains carboxyl functional groups that can remove the saltator vacancies, and the proposed halide anion formate (HCOO -) inhibits the anionic vacancy defects at grain boundaries and on the perovskite surface  [38] . 
 Conclusion In this work, 3,5-DBBA was proposed to modify the ETL/PVK interface of traditional PSCs, which can effectively improve their photoelectric properties and improve the hysteresis phenomenon. We found that the introduction of 3,5-DBBA could enhance the light transmission of SnO 2 films. It makes the surface potential distribution more uniform and the film more compact, which is beneficial to assist the subsequent growth of PVK grains. The PVK film exhibits more (001), (002) planar structure and lower density of defect states, which improves the quality of the perovskite film. Moreover, the addition of 3,5-DBBA can effectively increase the transport rate of photogenerated carriers, inhibit nonradiative recombination, and improve the device performance. The PCE of champion PSCs was up to 22.27 %, FF, V OC , and J SC were 77.31 %, 1.16V, and 24.8 mA/cm 2 , respectively. The study provides a new choice of modification materials that can be applied to the ETL/PVK interface of perovskite devices using organic materials containing Br templates. tip is the work function of Pt/Cr coated probe tip, Φ sample is the work function of sample surface, and e is the charge of elementary electrons. The CPD was calibrated using highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), and the work function of KPFM probe was calculated and obtained as CPD HOPG (420 mV) and Φ tip (5.02 eV). The work function for the perovskite surface is then obtained by bringing the average CPD into equation (2) . The work function on the upper surface of the unmodified SnO 2 film is 5.72 eV, and the work function on the upper surface of the SnO 2 film modified with 3, 5-DBBA is 6.12 eV. The changes of CPD and work function indicate that the charge accumulation on the upper surface of SnO 2 film changes after the addition of 3, 5-DBBA, the electrons are effectively exported, and the defects are effectively suppressed. Meanwhile, the higher work function on the upper surface also implies that the energy band bending occurs at the interface between SnO 2 and perovskite, which can improve the carrier extraction in the device. The above results indicate that 3, 5-DBBA can optimize the surface electrical properties of SnO 2 thin films and reduce the nonradiative recombination loss of charge carriers at the interface.
