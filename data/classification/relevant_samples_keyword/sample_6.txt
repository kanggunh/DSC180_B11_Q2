Title: Green Material Chlorin e6 Passivation Improves the Efficiency of Perovskite Solar Cells
Perovskite materials have attracted numerous attention due to their excellent photoelectric properties. With a large number of excellent works published in recent decades, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has increased from 3.8% to 26.1% due to their high absorption coefficient, high defect tolerance, tunable band gap, low exciton binding energy, long carrier diffusion length, and high carrier mobility.  [1] [2] [3]  Although the progress is encouraging, the reason that prevents actual efficiency from approaching Shockley Queisser theoretical limit is still a large number of defects that are difficult to avoid at the bulk and surface grain boundaries (GBs) during the annealing preparation process due to the low formation energy and soft lattice character of the perovskite crystals, such as intrinsic point defects, metallic lead clusters, and 2D surface deflection.  [3] [4] [5]  Furthermore, the ionic character of hybrid halide perovskite causes unfavorable carrier recombination and ion migration in perovskite films, resulting in suboptimal device efficiency or stability.  [6, 7]  These defects dominate nonradiative recombination, resulting in overall device performance degradation, reduced open-circuit voltage (V oc ) and fill factor (FF), and severe energy loss.  [8] [9] [10] [11]  Therefore, the research on defect passivation in perovskite thin films remains the main path most researchers pursue.  [12]  To eliminate these unnecessary defects, many researchers have delved into engineering strategies involving dimensionality,  [13, 14]  component,  [14, 15]  GB,  [16]  additive,  [17]  and antisolvent/ solution.  [18]  Among these strategies, the passivation agent strategy can effectively passivate defects on the bulk phase and surface GBs, and optimize the crystallization process.  [19, 20]  In order to improve the efficiency and stability of PSC, researchers conducted in-depth research on organic and inorganic passivation agents with different compositions and molecular structures,  [21]  and divided the passivation agents into four categories: small organic molecules, polymers, organic ammonium salts, and inorganic salts.  [22]  Generally speaking, the most effective passivation agent is a Lewis base group containing isolated electron pairs in the molecular skeleton,  [23, 24]  for example, cyano (C-N),  [25]  carbonyl (C=O),  [26]  phosphate (P=O),  [27]  and sulfoxide (S=O).  [28]  In short, the passivation mechanism is the interaction between the passivation agent (Lewis base) and the positively charged intrinsic site defects (Lewis acid) at the bulk and surface GBs.  [29]  "Learning from plants" is a recently proposed viewpoint, followed by a series of natural molecules such as indigo,  [19]  lycopene,  [30]  capsaicin,  [31]  caffeine,  [32]  theophylline,  [33]  and vitamins,  [34]  used as passivating agents to achieve high performance and
stability. There are many organic small molecules in nature, and many substances are still waiting to be discovered. Inspired by this, we seek a pure, natural, small organic molecule substance as a passivation agent that meets the passivation needs and green spirit. In this work, we seek inspiration from the natural "light utilization system," viridiplantae, and introduce the green, nontoxic organic molecule chlorin e6 (CE-6) into the perovskite layer for the first time to obtain photovoltaic devices with increased efficiency. CE-6 is a chlorophyll degradation product obtained by purification, refining, and modifying natural chlorophyll through modern technology. Its main advantages are low toxicity, easy synthesis, and production.  [35]  The molecular structure of CE-6 has various functional groups, such as the carboxyl group, carbon-carbon double bond, and amino group, which can meet the needs of perovskite passivation defects. When CE-6, which was initially responsible for participating in photosynthesis, was added to the perovskite precursor to join in the crystallization process of the thin film that will be responsible for photoelectric conversion, it exhibited Lewis base characteristics of passivating defects and improving the crystallization quality of the thin film. With its various functional groups, CE-6 can effectively reduce traps on the surface of perovskite, suppress charge recombination at the interface, improve transfer rate and carrier extraction, and ultimately improve efficiency. Compared with the pristine device, the V oc of the champion device increased from 1.09 to 1.12 V, the J sc increased from 22.67 to 23.99 mA cm À2 , the PCE increased from 18.81% to 21.14%, and the FF increased from 75.53% to 78.10%. After 500 h of storage, they still maintained 84% of its initial PCE. In addition, we utilized the CE-6 optimized perovskite layer for the preparation of semitransparent devices. The optimized semitransparent device increased from 11.43% to 13.33% compared to the pristine device PCE, and the average visible light transmittance (AVT) remained at 5.53%.

 Solar Cell Fabrication All experimental procedures of PSC were completed under air conditions that control humidity (about 15% RH), and the main structure of the device mainly consists of the following parts: ITO, electron transport layer (ETL), perovskite active layer, hole transport layer (HTL), and Ag electrode. The schematic diagram of the device structure is shown in Figure  1a . The ITO substrates (20 mm Â 15 mm Â 1.1 mm, 6 Ω cm À2 ) were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment for 15 min in toluene, acetone, deionized water, and isopropanol, respectively, and then stored in isopropanol in reserve. The ITO substrate was dealt with O 2 plasma for 10 min before use. The SnO 2 colloid precursor solution was spin-coated on the ITO substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s, annealed at 120 °C for 10 min, and then cooled to room temperature (about 25 °C). The prepared ITO/SnO 2 substrate was exposed to O 2 -plasma environment for 10 min before use. The perovskite precursor solution of FA 0.85 MA 0.15 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 was prepared by dissolving FAI, MABr, PbI 2 , and PbBr 2 in DMF and DMSO (volume ratio = 3:1), and the concentrations was 172, 22, 507, and 20.74 mg mL À1 , respectively. For comparison, 0.1, 1, and 10 μg mL À1 CE-6 were doped into the perovskite precursor solutions. Then, it was deposited on SnO 2 substrate at 1000 rpm for 10 s, followed by 4000 rpm for 30 s. CB as an antisolvent agent was dropped on the spinning substrate at 30 s. The perovskite films obtained above were placed on a hot plate and annealed at 150 °C for 20 min. After slowly cooling to ambient temperature, spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated and deposited on the perovskite substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and then the device was prepared by evaporation Ag electrode, in which the evaporation rate was 0.5 Å S À1 and the thickness was about 100 nm. For semitransparent devices, the Ag electrode thickness was about 12 nm.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were characterized on Bruker-AXSD8 advance diffractometer and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained by JSM-7900F. The monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of all devices was measured by the Crowntech Q Test Station 1000 CE. UV-vis absorption and transmission spectra were measured using Shimadzu UV-1700 system. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests were characterized on Escalab 250 Xi (American Thermofisher Company). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained by using a HORIBA-iHR550 monochromator. 
 Results and Discussion Although there is a growing body of research on additive strategies for improving PSCs' performance, only some reports have been on using natural ingredients. Considering the link between the photovoltaic effect of solar cells and plant photosynthesis, we have, for the first time, combined the natural chlorophyll component CE-6 with PSCs, hoping that this component can play a similar photosensitive role to its pristine counterpart and improve solar cell performance. Based on this, CE-6 was added as an additive to the perovskite precursor. A one-step spin coating process with an antisolvent was utilized to make perovskite thin films, as shown in Figure  1a . CE-6 can be dissolved in a precursor solution using DMF/DMSO as a solvent. In the one-step preparation process, it remains in the perovskite film and plays a role in adding the counter solvent. The CE-6 optimized thin film was prepared under the same conditions as the reference film, as shown in the Experimental Section, followed by other characterizations. A series of related characterization tests demonstrated that CE-6 can optimize perovskite thin films. XRD (Figure  1b ) is used to obtain crystal information on perovskite thin films. Compared with the pristine perovskite film, the CE-6 optimized film has reduced PbI 2 peak intensity (12.5°), increased perovskite peak intensity (110) (13.9°), (220) (28.1°), and (310) (31.6°), and separately reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) (0.17907°to 0.15857°(110), 0.16987°to 0.16749°(220), 0.19785°to 0.17183°( 310)), which indicates that CE-6 optimized the crystal orientation of the perovskite film, improved the crystal quality, and suppressed the produce of PbI 2 . It is preliminarily proved that CE-6 has the role of passivating perovskite crystals. The SEM surface and section photos (Figure  1c ) (Figure  S2 , Supporting Information) show that the grain size of the optimized CE-6 film is significantly larger than that of the pristine film. The statistical graph of surface SEM particle size analysis shows that the average grain size increases from 279.22 to 309.72 nm. The atomic force microscope (AFM) images (Figure  1d ) also indicate that the film surface is smoother after CE-6 optimization, and the roughness root mean square is reduced from 21.45 to 15.40 nm. The above two surface morphology characterization methods both confirm the results of CE-6 improving the quality of perovskite crystals. Subsequently, several tests were further employed to elucidate the effect of CE-6 on perovskite thin films. XPS (Figure  2a, b ) is used to reflect the change of the binding energy of the inner layer electrons of essential elements in perovskite and to study the influence of the possible interaction between CE-6 and perovskite. We compared the Pb and I elements in the pristine perovskite film with those in the optimized film. As shown in Figure  2a  Pb 4f spectrum, the peak with higher binding energy can be assigned to 4f 5/2 , while the lower peak is 4f 7/2 . For the pristine perovskite film, we attributed the two peaks at 142.96 and 138.09 eV to Pb 2þ ions; for the films treated with CE-6, the two peaks of Pb 2þ ions move to higher 143.04 and 138.17 eV binding energy. The enhanced binding energy of Pb indicates that CE-6 can form a strong force with Pb 2þ in the lead iodide lattice, enhancing the binding energy of Pb 4f. In Figure  2b  I 3d spectrum, the peak with higher binding energy can be assigned to 3d 3/2 , while the lower peak is 3d 5/2 . For the pristine perovskite film, we attributed the two peaks at 630.53 and 619.07 eV to I À ions. For the CE-6-treated films, the two peaks of I À ions move to a lower binding energy of 630.39 and 618.96 eV. The binding energy of Pb 4f-level electrons increases, and the binding energy of I 3 d-level electrons decreases. We attribute this XPS peak shift phenomenon to the chain reaction caused by uncoordinated Pb 2þ cations.  [36, 37]  In halide perovskite films, uncoordinated Pb 2þ ions are quickly reduced to metal Pb 0 when heated or illuminated. The formation of Pb 0 clusters will generate Pb vacancies, which then capture the holes and induce I À ions oxidation to I 0 . After optimization, the influence of Pb vacancy is significantly reduced, and the generation of I 0 is suppressed. Therefore, XPS shows that the binding energy of the I atom is reduced. The above results indicate that CE-6 strongly interacts with the surface of perovskite, effectively reducing the content of deep traps such as Pb 0 and I 0 that are harmful to PSC devices in perovskite.  [38] [39] [40]   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Figure  2c, d ) studies how CE-6 exerts passivation effects. Figure  2c  shows the infrared transmission peaks of pure perovskite, pure CE-6, and perovskite with added CE-6. CE-6 exhibits characteristic stretching vibration peaks of N-H, C-H (-CH 2 ), and C-N bonds at 3439, 2976, and 1028 cm À1 , respectively. Compared with the pristine perovskite and CE-6 optimized perovskite, the appearance of C-H bond (-CH 2 ) peaks at 2976 cm À1 , and the enhancement of N-H and C-N bond peaks at 3439 and 1028 cm À1 can be observed. In addition, all three peaks underwent varying degrees of displacement. The above comparison results prove that CE-6 has been successfully added to perovskite and point out some potential sites where CE-6 may interact with perovskite. For example, the N-H bending vibration of CE-6 optimized perovskite at 3400-3600 cm À1 increases and moves downward, which is considered to be caused by the increase of electron cloud density caused by the formation of hydrogen bond between CE-6 and iodine(N-H…I).  [41, 42]  To further explore other possible passivation effects, we also tested the infrared transmission peak changes of CE-6 after adding PbI 2 . Figure  2d  shows the partial FTIR of pure CE-6 and CE-6-mixed PbI 2 powder, from which it can be observed that CE-6 exhibits a characteristic tensile vibration of the C=C bond at 1609 cm À1 . When PbI 2 is combined with CE-6, the vibration signal of C=C is enhanced and transferred to a higher wavenumber (1629 cm À1 ), indicating the Lewis acidbase interaction between PbI 2 and CE-6. In addition, a C-I bond at 714 cm À1 was observed, indicating that the above effect occurred between the C=C bond and I. The C=C double bond combines with uncoordinated Pb 2þ defects at GBs, reducing shallow and deep traps through the Lewis acid-base effect.  [30]  Transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Figure  S3 , Supporting Information) was measured to demonstrate that the above effect occurred at GBs. From TEM images, it can be observed that the perovskite with added CE6 exhibits a small molecule-perovskite coating structure, which proves that the introduced CE6 is mainly distributed at the GBs of perovskite and interacts with it.  [43]  Based on the characterization results described above, we will plot the hypothesized potential passivation mechanism into a graph (Figure  2e ). Furthermore, research has shown that -COOH groups can diminish nonradiative composite sites by interacting with uncoordinated Pb 2þ ions and I vacancies, as well as inhibit the escape of methyl ammonium cations (MAþ) during manufacturing and annealing procedures, hence avoiding PSC deterioration.  [44]  To verify the actual optimization results of CE-6, Fermi energy level (E f ) and valence band (VB) are compared through UPS (Figure  2f  ) and Tauc diagram (Figure  2g ) to analyze the change of V oc . First, the UV photoelectron spectra of perovskite thin films and CE-6 optimized perovskite thin films were tested, and the E cutoff and E onset values were calculated. The perovskite thin films were 1.37 and 17.22 eV, while the thin films optimized by CE-6 were 1.37 and 17.09 eV. Second, the Tauc plots were tested, and the bandgaps (E g ) were calculated at 1.56 and 1.55 eV, respectively. Based on the above data, a corresponding energy level distribution diagram was drawn (Figure  2h ). Compared with the pristine perovskite membrane, E f and VB decreased by 0.13 and 0.13 eV, respectively. The change in energy bands may be attributed to the interface dipole formed by the CE-6 additive on the surface of perovskite.  [32, 45, 46]  More importantly, the frequency reduction of E f leads to the formation of P-type perovskite films, and deeper valence state bending allows for higher V oc performance.  [46]  Afterward, we prepared a positive PSC device using the above optimization scheme, as shown in Figure  3a . The device structure is ITO/SnO 2 /FA 0.85 MA 0.15 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 (with or without CE-6)/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. To study the effect of CE-6 on photovoltaic performance, different concentrations of CE-6 were mixed into perovskite precursor solution to prepare PSCs, and the optimal current densityvoltage ( J-V ) curves were measured separately (Figure  3b ) (Table  S1 , Supporting Information) to determine the optimal PCE. According to the measurement results, when adding 0.1 and 1 μg mL À1 of CE-6 to the perovskite precursor, PCE gradually increased, but when the concentration further increased to 10 μg mL À1 , PCE decreased. Therefore, the optimal concentration of CE-6 in the precursor solution of perovskite was determined to be 1 μg mL À1 . Comparing the optimal performance of the pristine device and the CE-6 optimized device (Figure  3c ) (Table  S2 , Supporting Information), the highest V oc increased from 1.09 to 1.12 V, the highest J sc increased from 22.67 to 23.99 mA cm À2 , the highest PCE increased from 18.81% to 21.14%, and the highest FF increased from 75.53% to 78.10%. It can be seen that adding 1 μg mL À1 of CE-6 improved V oc , J sc , and FF. In addition, the optimal J-V curve (Figure  3c ) can also observe that the hysteresis effect of CE-6 optimized devices is suppressed, and the hysteresis factor (HI) is reduced from 4.41% to 2.12%. IPCE (Figure  3d ) spectrum is used to evaluate the improvement of J sc . In the visible light range, the IPCE of the optimized device is slightly improved compared to the pristine device, especially between 600 and 750 nm. It is calculated that the pristine device has an integral J sc of 22.20 mA cm À2 , and the target device has an integral J sc of 23.10 mA cm À2 , which is consistent with the increase in J sc obtained in the J-V curve. To verify the reproducibility of the device, we repeated the experimental process multiple times, collecting photovoltaic performance data from 30 sets of pristine and CE-6 optimized devices and statistically plotting PCE distribution histograms (Figure  3e ). The results indicate that the addition of CE-6 has overall good repeatability, with an average PCE of 19.00% for the optimized device, which is higher than the average PCE of 17.00% for the pristine device. Then, the storage stability of the pristine device and the CE-6 optimized device was measured under air atmosphere (Figure  3f  ). The PCE of two devices was measured after being stored under air atmosphere at 25 °C for 500 h. The results showed that the pristine device PCE rapidly decreased, reaching about 70% of the initial PCE, while the optimized device could maintain 84% of the pristine PCE. We used a series of tests to examine the internal property changes to investigate the causes of the improvement in device performance systematically. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Figure  4a ) was tested to investigate interface charge transfer and recombination. The impedance data were fitted as a Nyquist curve using an equivalent circuit model, where the end of the high-frequency and low-frequency regions determined the charge transfer resistance (R ct ) and recombination resistance (R rec ), respectively.  [47]  The fitting results show that the R ct and R rec of the pristine device are 0.87 and 23.20 kΩ, respectively. The optimized device has a smaller R ct value (0.28 kΩ) and a larger R rec value (36.59 kΩ). This meets the expectations of ideal photovoltaic devices and indicates that CE-6 can effectively suppress charge recombination at the perovskite interface, thereby improving carrier extraction efficiency, decreasing the dark current of the device, and enhancing device performance by increasing the V oc of the device.  [34, 48]  The PSC optical dependence performance data were measured, and the relationship between V oc and J sc was plotted based on the results (Figure  4b ). The ideal factor (n id ) of the pristine device and the optimized device was calculated to be 1.96 and 1.30, respectively. Under standard conditions, assuming V oc is less than 1, if direct recombination dominates, the n id of the device is close to 1. Still, if trap-assisted Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination dominates, it is close to 2.  [49, 50]  As a result, the voltage loss in the device may be attributed to SRH recombination in the perovskite bulk, implying that CE-6 inside the perovskite can severely limit the device trap-assisted carrier recombination process. Furthermore, the improved device lower n id reflects a decrease in nonradiative recombination behavior and a decrease in FF loss.  [51]  To quantify the trap density of states and electron mobility in ETL, pure electronic devices with FTO/SnO 2 /PVK (or CE-6 & PVK)/PCB/Ag structure was fabricated and defect density (Nt) was calculated using a space charge limited current (SCLC) technique (Figure  4c ). The V TFL of the pure electronic pristine device and the optimized device are 0.16 and 0.14 V, respectively. The electron trap density is significantly reduced. This trend further confirms that the additive CE-6 can reduce the traps on the surface of perovskite. Steady-state PL (SSPL) spectroscopy (Figure  4d ) and transient PL (TRPL) spectroscopy (Figure  4e ) were performed to evaluate the effect of CE-6 modification on interface charge carrier transport dynamics. In the PL spectrum, the emission peak position shows a blueshift from 781 to 778 nm, which may be attributed to the passivation effect of CE-6 at GBs. PL strength from 3.1 Â 10 4 significantly increased to 5.4 Â 10 4 , indicating that CE-6 reduces nonradiative recombination in perovskite films.  [29]  The PL spectrum shows a slight blueshift in the optimized film, indicating that the addition of CE-6 has a defect passivation effect. In the  TRPL spectrum, compared to the pristine device, the lifetime of the optimized device is calculated through standard fitting models, resulting in faster decay components (τ 1 ) shortened from 8.26 to 5.28 ns, slower attenuation component (τ 2 ) extending from 152.78 to 219.66 ns. Located in the early stage, τ 1 represents charge carrier separation, followed by τ 2 mainly represents bimolecular carrier recombination; therefore, the slower and faster rate of bimolecular recombination in the pristine device indicates more severe nonradiative recombination.  [52]  Transient photovoltage (TPV) (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information) and transient photocurrent (TPC) (Figure  S6 , Supporting Information) measurements were conducted to analyze the characteristics of charge carrier extraction and charge carrier lifetime. From the results of TPV, it can be concluded that the charge recombination lifetime of the pristine device (τ r ) is 111.5 μs, while the optimized device is 118.1 μs. A longer charge recombination lifetime indicates a delay in the charge recombination process. From the results of TPC, it can be concluded that the charge transfer time of the pristine device (τ t ) is 1.27 μs, while the optimized device is 0.72 μs. A shorter charge extraction time benefits charge injection and migration.  [44, 53]  TPV and TPC measurements yielded the same result as PL analysis, namely, that CE-6 can achieve faster carrier transfer and more balanced carrier decay, promote charge carrier collection from perovskite to ETL and HTL, and inhibit charge carrier accumulation and recombination.  [54]  This suggests that CE-6 can better balance the transfer ability of interface charge carriers, increase photovoltaic performance, and minimize hysteresis. To better understand the charge accumulation and extraction in PSC, Mott-Schottky capacitance-voltage (C-V ) measurements were conducted (Figure  4f  ). Based on this, the built-in potential (V bi ) of the pristine device and the optimized device were found to be 0.94 and 0.98 V, respectively, which is consistent with the increasing trend of V oc obtained from the J-V results.  [55]  Finally, because translucency is a distinct advantage of thin film photovoltaic devices such as building-integrated photovoltaic, stacked tandem solar cells, and other components, we also prepared semitransparent PSC (ST-PSC) devices under the same optimization conditions. The only difference between the semitransparent device and the pristine device is that the former uses an ultrathin silver layer (12 nm) instead of the pristine electrode, and its structure is shown in the schematic diagram (Figure  5a ). Comparing the optimal performance of nonoptimized semitransparent devices with CE-6 optimized semitransparent devices (Figure  5b ) (Table  S3 , Supporting Information), the highest V oc increased from 1.04 to 1.06 V, the highest J sc increased from 18.62 to 19.58 mA cm À2 , the highest PCE increased from 11.43% to 13.33%, and the highest FF increased from 58.84% to 68.86%. The performance results of semitransparent devices show a similar trend to that of CE-6 optimized opaque devices. Although the introduction of translucency resulted in a significant loss of light, resulting in a decline in various aspects of device performance, CE-6 optimized devices still maintain significant performance improvement compared to unoptimized devices. The transmission spectrum of the ST-PSC working area was measured to calculate the AVT (Figure  5c ). ST-PSC has a transmittance of over 10% in the visible light range of 650-780 nm, AVT (380-780 nm) of 5.53%, and light utilization efficiency (LUE) of 0.73%. Through physical photo (Figure  5d ), the scenery behind ST-PSC can be clearly seen, which means that ST-PSC can meet the transmittance requirements of the human eye. 
 Conclusion In general, we introduce a device performance optimization method that introduces the green and harmless natural molecule CE-6 into the perovskite layer to play a passivation role. A device with an optimized perovskite layer was prepared by adding CE-6 to the perovskite precursor solution using a room-temperature spin-coating process based on a positive organic-inorganic hybrid PSC. The optimization experiment determined the most suitable concentration of CE-6, which is 1 μg mL À1 in the perovskite precursor solution. Characterization test shows that CE-6 can effectively reduce the traps on the surface of perovskite, suppress charge recombination at the interface, improve carrier transfer rate and carrier extraction efficiency, and finally achieve the result of improving the efficiency by its various functional groups, carboxyl groups, carbon-carbon double bonds, and amino groups. The optimal device achieved a PCE of 21.14% and maintained its initial PCE of 84% after being stored in a room-temperature air environment for 500 h. By combining optimized perovskite films with ultrathin Ag electrodes, ST-PSC was manufactured. CE-6 maintains the same optimization effect in semitransparent devices, with 13.33% PCE, 5.53% AVT, and 0.73% LUE. Our work demonstrates the excellent performance of natural material CE-6 in the PSC perovskite layer and confirms the favorable prospects for optimizing ST-PSC.
