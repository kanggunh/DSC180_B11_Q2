Title: Dopant-free molecular hole transport material that mediates a 20% power conversion efficiency in a perovskite solar cell
Organic molecular hole-transport materials (HTMs) are appealing for the scalable manufacture of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) because they are easier to reproducibly prepare in high purity than polymeric and inorganic HTMs. There is also a need to construct PSCs without dopants and additives to avoid formidable engineering and stability issues. We report here a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.6% with a molecular HTM in an inverted (p-i-n) PSC without any dopants or interlayers. This new benchmark was made possible by the discovery that annealing a spiro-based dopant-free HTM (denoted DFH) containing redox-active triphenyl amine (TPA) units undergoes preferential molecular organization normal to the substrate. This structural order, governed by the strong intermolecular interactions of the DFH dioxane groups, affords high intrinsic hole mobility (1×10 -3 cm 2 •V -1 •s -1 ). Annealing films of DFH also enables the growth of large perovskite grains (up to 2 µm) that minimize charge recombination in the PSC. DFH can also be isolated at a fraction of the cost of any other organic HTM. Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) rely on hole-transport materials (HTMs) to efficiently extract holes from the perovskite layer and minimize charge recombination at the anode. 1-4 A wide range of inorganic metal oxides, 5 organic π-conjugated polymers 6 and organic small molecules 7 have proven to
be effective HTMs in the PSC (Fig.  1 ). Organic small molecules are particularly appealing because they offer acute control of physicochemical properties, and are relatively easy to synthesize, purify, and process.  [7] [8] [9]  Moreover, the hole transport layer of the state-of-the-art PSC is based on organic small molecules. 10 Fig.  1 . Benchmark PCEs for devices containing organic HTMs with and without dopants. DFH can be synthesized at a fraction of the cost of the other HTMs and does not require interlayers (P3HT requires interlayers to reach 20%). The champion PSC device with an inorganic HTM is 20.6% (not listed). A key challenge of molecular HTMs is that they usually require dopants to reach the high conductivities necessary for high device power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).  [10] [11] [12]  Dopants can compromise device performance by accelerating deleterious moisture permeation, ion migration, and interfacial charge recombination during device operation.  [12] [13] [14] [15] [16]  This situation can be addressed in part with barrier layers,  17, 18  but a simpler solution is to design HTMs that do not require dopants. This has prompted the design of dopant-free molecular HTMs consisting of large planar π-stacked  [19] [20] [21] [22]  or π-conjugated donor-acceptor molecules.  [23] [24] [25] [26]  While dopant-free polymeric HTMs have yielded PCEs as high as 22.7% in devices containing additional interlayers, 27 these interlayers complicate the device fabrication process and can reduce the thermal stability of the cell. 10 Molecular HTMs have not previously reached the 20% PCE threshold without the use of dopants.  19, 28, 29  We report herein a new benchmark for dopant-free molecular HTMs by showing that devices containing N 2 ,N 2 ,N  7  ,N  7  -tetra-p-tolylspiro[fluorene-9,2'- [1,3]dioxolane]-2,7-diamine (DFH) as the HTM can yield a PCE of 20.6% (Figs.  1  and 2a ). This breakthrough was realized in an inverted PSC architecture without the assistance of p-dopants or interlayers, and made possible by designing DFH: (i) with an appropriately positioned HOMO energy for efficient charge extraction from the perovskite layer; and (ii) with functional groups that encourage anisotropic molecular ordering of the film to mediate high electronic conductivity and hole mobility normal to the perovskite layer. This layer also accommodates the growth of large crystalline domains for the perovskite layer (Fig.  2B ). Moreover, this rationally designed DFH can be isolated by the reaction of inexpensive reagents followed by a facile purification process that could enable it to be scaled at a cost of <$10/g (Tables  S1  and S2 ). These economics, which cannot be matched by any champion organic HTM (Fig.  1 ), compare favorably to the inexpensive sol-gel chemistry used to make inorganic HTMs.  30, 31  This feature is important because molecular organic HTMs are viewed to be generally easier to scale since they do not suffer from the same batch-to-batch variability as inorganic and polymeric HTMs. 32,33 The structure of DFH features two fluorene-bridged triphenylamine (TPA) moieties linked to a 1,3-dioxolane group through a spiro carbon center (Fig.  1 ). The HTM is formed through a successive Buchwald-Hartwig amination of 2,7-dibromo-9-fluorenone and acid-catalyzed condensation with ethylene glycol. Products from each reaction can be purified by recrystallization rather than column chromatography to yield DFH in 73% overall reaction yield.  8  The design of DFH was inspired by the knowledge that spiro-type HTMs exhibit low redox reorganization energies, high glass transition temperatures (Tg) and good morphological stabilities.  [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39]  The two TPA groups were positioned across the fluorene bridge to mediate strong electronic coupling between the two redox-active units (Fig.  S4 ). This strong electronic coupling leads to a 0.32-V difference between the first and second TPA +. /TPA reduction potentials that raises the HOMO energy to -5.27 eV. This value that maintains a high cell voltage while still accommodating hole extraction from the perovskite with a valence band maximum of -5.4 eV.  40  The high LUMO energy of -2.29 eV maintains a large optical band gap of 2.98 eV to avoid the undesirable absorption of visible light (Fig.  S4 ). A powerful feature of DFH is the propensity for the molecules, upon annealing, to dimerize and preferentially order orthogonal to the substrate, but without additional long-range order in the film. This molecular ordering therefore presents the opportunity to balance the competing need to provide sufficient structural order for charge transport,  [41] [42] [43]  while avoiding the formation of large crystalline domains that introduce cracks or pinholes and impair interfacial electronic contacts.  44, 45  This axial growth of DFH is largely a consequence of the cyclic, polar 1,3-dioxolane group (Fig.  3a ) facilitating strong intermolecular interactions to form tightly bound dimers of DFH. A single-crystal structure determination of DFH confirms these intermolecular C-H⋯O and C-H⋯π interactions between the dioxane groups on neighboring DFH molecules parallel to the b-axis (Fig.  3b  and Fig.  S5-6 ). The strengths of these intermolecular interactions are calculated to be as strong as 110 kJ/mol per pair of DFH (ESI). Amorphous DFH transforms into paracrystalline dimers when DFH is heated above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of ~120 °C (Fig.  3c ). Slow crystallization occurs at higher annealing temperatures below the onset temperature of cold-crystallization ~temperature (Tcc) of 160 °C where heterogeneous nucleation becomes operative. Solid-state NMR spectroscopic experiments were employed to track the chemical environment about the carbon atoms of DFH upon heating. It is evident that heating amorphous DFH to 120 °C causes the ethylene 13 C resonance of the 1,3-dioxane group to sharpen towards a full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) approaching that of the crystalline material (Figs. 3d, S9 and S10), and the sharpening of the peaks corresponding to crystallization occurs at much higher temperatures Powder XRD data recorded upon heating amorphous DFH confirms that crystallization begins to occur at 120 °C, and that higher temperatures yield progressively sharper reflections (Fig.  3e ). We then performed 2θ scans on a 150-nm thin film of DFH using parallel-beam grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) and observed the onset of only a single peak upon annealing to 150 °C, which is assigned to diffraction signal of the (010) crystallographic planes (Fig.  S7 ). This peak at low 2θ points to the preferential ordering of DFH normal to the plane of the substrate and along the direction of dimerization, with the broad baseline indicating a lack of long-range order for the balance of the film. An important outcome of the paracrystalline ordering of DFH molecules is that the redox-active TPA groups are drawn close to each other without the growth of large crystals. We infer that this feature is responsible for the high hole mobilities (µh) of ~1×10 -3 cm 2 •V -1 •s -1 for the amorphous and annealed films of DFH measured normal to the plane of the substrate. These values are comparable to single-crystal Spiro-OMeTAD,  41  and are greater than those of the previous state-of-the-art dopant-free molecular HTM  20  and heavily p-doped thin films of spiro-OMeTAD.  38, 46  The electric conductivity of DFH thin films also doubled upon annealing (Table  S5 ). Another notable observation is that we were able to grow pinholefree perovskite thin-films with large grain sizes (Fig.  S14 , average 0.6 µm 2 ) on layers of DFH annealed at 135 °C, while smaller grains were observed with other DFH layers (Fig.  S15 ). Grazing incidence Xray diffraction (GIXD) of the perovskite layer showed slightly higher tendency of out-plane growth on DFH annealed at 135 °C, compared to as-prepared and 120 °C annealed DFH (Fig.  16 ). It is possible that a low degree of DFH crystallization at 135 °C is crucial for the growth of large perovskite grains whereas its impact on perovskite crystal orientation is relatively small. This combination of high axial µh for DFH and large grain sizes of the light-absorbing layer provides the ideal conditions for high PSC performance. We therefore tested DFH in a planar inverted (pi-n) PSC with an ITO|DFH|perovskite|C60|BCP|Ag configuration (where ITO = indium-doped tin oxide; perovskite = MA0.9FA0.1PbI3-xClx; BCP = bathocuproine). A mixed methylammonium (MA) / formamidinium perovskite was deposited onto spin-coated DFH layers using established methods.  47  Devices containing as-prepared DFH generated PCE values of merely 10%. This output was increased up to 20.6% when the DFH films were annealed at 135°C (Fig.  4a ). This PCE represents the highest value ever reported for a dopant-free molecular HTM, and the highest value for a device with any dopant-free HTM without interlayers. This PCE also compared favorably to the PCEs that we were able to produce in optimized devices containing the champion dopant-free polymeric HTM, poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA; Table  1 , Figure  S11 ). 9 a Our measurements recorded on previously reported HTM at optimized condition. 9 b Data from the previously reported champion device incorporating dopant-free molecular HTM.  20  The PSC efficiency was doubled by annealing amorphous DFH films to temperatures between Tg and Tcc to encourage dimerization and a small degree of crystallization. The best devices we tested were those where DFH was annealed at 135 °C (Fig.  4a ). An annealed DFH film quenched >95% of the baseline photoluminescence of the perovskite, indicating a band alignment that enables effective extraction of holes from the perovskite layer (Fig.  4b ). The temporal resolution of the perovskite photoluminescence shows that 99% of holes are extracted within 20 ns by annealed DFH (Fig.  4c ).   
 Conclusions We have demonstrated that a molecular organic HTM with redox-active TPA groups yields electronic properties conducive to high performance in an inverted PSC without the need for dopants. The ability to produce a PCE >20% with a synthetically accessible HTM and a simple device structure (i.e., no interlayers or barrier layers) offers the opportunity for scalable manufacturing. This record device performance for a dopant-free molecular HTM is a result of the molecular organization of HTM molecules with carefully tailored energy levels, as well as the large grain sizes of the perovskite layer grown on the HTM. This work also shows how thermal annealing of HTMs capable of supramolecular interactions can also affect the quality of the perovskite layers to further drive up device performance. The success with DFH also challenges the accepted dogma that dopant-free HTMs need to exhibit large, planar π-stacking structures or complex donor-acceptor moieties.

 X-ray Crystallography Single crystal X-ray crystallography was performed using a Bruker APEX II area detector diffractometer. Single colourless tablet-shaped crystals of DFH were recrystallized from a mixture of toluene and ethanol by slow diffusion. Suitable crystals were selected and mounted on a mylar loop. Data were measured using MoKα radiation (microfocus sealed X-ray tube, 50 kV, 0.99 mA). The structure was solved with the SHELXT 1 structure solution program using the Intrinsic Phasing solution method and by using Olex2 2 as the graphical interface. The diffraction pattern indexing, unit cell refinement, data reduction, scaling and absorption corrections were performed using SAINT (Bruker, V8.38A, after 2013).

 X-ray Diffraction Powder and thin film X-ray diffraction experiments were performed on a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer using CuKα radiation. A Bragg-Brentano 𝜃-𝜃 geometry was used to probe powder samples annealed at different temperatures. The scanning range was from 5° to 25°, with 0.02° per step. The thin film was characterized using 2θ scans using parallel-beam grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD). The HTM film was spin-coated on a glass substrate, and annealed at 150 o C on a hotplate until formation of visible spherulites on the thin film. The scanning range was from 5° to 60°, with 0.04° per step, the incidence angle was 0.7°.    = d•R -1 •A -1 , where R is the film resistance measured on ITO/HTM/Au, A is the effective area (12 mm 2 ) and, d is the thickness of the HTM thin film. For each condition, two different d each in four devices were measured in order to subtract the contact resistances which are independance to d. (C) Thickness ~ 40 nm. 
 Fluorescence Lifetime Measurement Experiments were carried out using a customized laser system provided by the LASIR facility at the University of British Columbia. Pulsed (10 Hz) 532 nm laser was used to excite (prompt) perovskite samples on various substrates and the emitted photons were probed by a Hamamatsu dynamic range streak camera (C7700). The device architecture is glass/HTM/perovskite/PMMA. 
 Solar Cell Fabrication and Characterization Methylammonium iodide (MAI) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) were synthesized by the reaction of methylamine and formamidine with hydroiodic acid, respectively, as previously reported. ITO coated glass substrates were obtained from Xin Yan Technology Ltd (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm, Rs = 20 Ω/□). PbI2 (99.9985%), C60 (99.5%), bathocuproine (BCP) (98%) and silver (Ag) (99.99%) were purchased from Fisher Scientific, Nano-C, Fisher Scientific, and Kurt J. Lesker, respectively. All materials were used without any further purification. ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by 20 min sonication in each of detergent (extran 300, 2%), deionized water, acetone and isopropanol. After drying in a stream of nitrogen, a 15 min ultraviolet-ozone treatment was carried out immediately prior to the deposition of the hole transport layer (HTL). DFH was dissolved in chlorobenzene (10, 15, or 20 mg/mL) and deposited on the ITO substrate by spin-coating (6000 rpm for 30 s). The films were then annealed at various temperatures for 20 min on a hot-plate in ambient air. PTAA HTLs were deposited by spin coating from a 1.5 mg/mL toluene solution, as reported previously  45  . An MAPbI3 perovskite precursor solution (1.2 M) was prepared by mixing MAI and PbI2 (1:1 molar ratio) in anhydrous mixed solvent (4:1 DMF/DMSO). A solution of FAI and PbCl2 was also prepared at the same concentration using the same solvent mixture. The two solutions were combined in a 9:1 ratio (MA:FA, v/v) to produce the final perovskite precursor solution. Perovskite layers were deposited by dropping the precursor solution onto the substrate, and after spinning at 4000 rpm for 7 s, dropping anhydrous chlorobenzene (120 µL) onto the center of the substrate. The substrate was spun for a further 30 s at 4000 rpm without pause. The transparent yellow films obtained after spin coating were heated at 35 °C for 20 min, after which they became black. The films were further annealed at 85 °C for 10 min. To complete the device stack, C60 (40 nm), BCP (8 nm) and Ag (100 nm) were sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation at a base pressure of 1 × 10 -6 mbar. Current-voltage curves of perovskite solar cells and hole-only devices were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. Devices were measured in the glovebox (H2O < 1 ppm, O2 < 0.1 ppm) using a 450 W Class AAA solar simulator equipped with a AM1.5G filter (Sol3A, Oriel Instruments). Before measuring, a standard silicon reference cell (91150V, Oriel Instruments) was used to set the light intensity to 1 sun. During the measurement, the cell was covered by a non-reflective metal mask with an aperture of 0.0708 cm 2 . Incident photon to current (IPCE) measurements were performed in air using a QE-PV-SI system (Oriel Instruments) consisting of a 300 W Xe arc lamp, monochromator, chopper, lock-in amplifier and certified silicon reference cell, operating at a 30 Hz beam-chopping frequency. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images were acquired on either a FEI Helios NanoLab 650 dual beam SEM at 5 kV and 50 pA or a Hitachi SU8010 microscope at 3 kV and 10 pA using a through-lens detector in secondary electron mode.

Title: Reliability of Small Molecule Organic Photovoltaics with Electron-Filtering Compound Buffer Layers
influencing the lifetime of OPVs is the buffer layer located between the cathode and the photoactive layer. Buffer layers are used to confine excitons within the charge generation region, tune the optical field intensity within the active region, protect the active layer from damage during metal cathode deposition,  [8]  and transport charge to the appropriate electrode.  [9, 10]  Recently, a class of electron-filtering compound buffer layers (EF-CBLs) has been introduced that simultaneously achieve high conductivity and efficient exciton blocking by blending a wide energy gap and electrically insulating exciton blocking molecule with a conductive fullerene.  [3, 8]  These improvements result in high fill factors (FF) and PCE even at light intensities exceeding one sun (1 kW m -2 ).  [8]  The impact of such buffers on device operational lifetime has shown promise,  [11]  but has yet to be explored in conjunction with stable, blended active-layer OPVs. Accelerated aging can provide valuable insights into the processes underlying device degradation.  [12] [13] [14] [15]  The longest-lived OPV cells now take more than a year to degrade to 80% of their initial PCE under one sun illumination, making conventional lifetime testing increasingly impractical.  [16] [17] [18]  In complex OPVs, optimization must occur across a large device architectural and materials space, thereby highlighting the importance of developing accurate methodologies for accelerating and understanding degradation. Exposure to elevated temperature, 
 Electron-filtering compound buffer layers (EF-CBLs) improve charge extraction in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) by blending an electronconducting fullerene with a wide energy gap exciton-blocking molecule. It is found that devices with EF-CBLs with high glass transition temperatures and a low crystallization rate produce highly stable morphologies and devices. The most stable OPVs employ 1:1 2,2′,2″-(1,3,5-benzenetriyl tris-[1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole] TPBi:C 70 buffers that lose <20% of their initial power conversion efficiency of 6.6 ± 0.6% after 2700 h under continuous simulated AM1.5G illumination, and show no significant degradation after 100 days of outdoor aging. When exposed to 100-sun (100 kW m -2 ) concentrated solar illumination for 5 h, their power conversion efficiencies decrease by <8%. Moreover, it is found that the reliability of the devices employing stable EF-CBLs has either reduced or no dependence on operating temperature up to 130 °C compared with BPhen:C 60 devices whose fill factors show thermally activated degradation. The robustness of TPBi:C 70 devices under extreme aging conditions including outdoor exposure, high temperature, and concentrated illumination is promising for the future of OPV as a stable solar cell technology.
Introduction Advances in materials, deposition technologies, and device architectures continue to drive improvements in the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells.  [1] [2] [3] [4]  Due to the large variety of materials and structures explored, a general understanding of the factors leading to high reliability is needed to make a significant impact on their successful, widespread deployment.  [5] [6] [7]  One important component concentrated sunlight, continuous illumination, thermal or light cycling, and exposure to reactive atmospheres have been employed as potential acceleration techniques.  [14, [19] [20] [21]  An effective method should only speed up one of perhaps several mechanisms responsible for degradation, and should not promote new failure modes that are different than those experienced by the device under normal operating conditions. Thermally accelerated aging methods assume that the degradation of a parameter, p, proceeds at a thermally activated rate, k deg (T) k T A E k T ( ) exp deg A B = -       ( 1 ) where A is a constant, E A is the activation energy leading to degradation, k B is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. The rate at each temperature is found by fitting the value of p over time, t, to p t k T t ( ) exp( ( ) ) deg α β = - + (2) where α and β are constants. If more than one mechanism is active, a multiexponential fit similar to Equation (  2 ) can be used to extract additional failure rates. Here, we explore the impact of using various EF-CBLs on the stability of archetype tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP):C 70 planar-mixed heterojunction OPV cells at elevated temperatures and high intensity illumination to accelerate and identify the most active performance failure mechanisms.  [22]  X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements are used to evaluate the changes induced in exciton blocking compounds employed in efficient EF-CBLs. We find that devices with EF-CBLs have longer operational lifetimes than those with a neat bathophenanthroline (BPhen) buffer, which is attributed to the improved morphological stability of the blends. While all devices have relatively stable open-circuit voltages (V OC ) and exhibit a linear decrease in short-circuit current density (J SC ) under continuous illumination, changes in FF are functions of EF-CBL composition and morphological stability. We find that DBP:C 70 -based OPVs with BPhen:C 60 EF-CBLs are the least stable among those studied. These buffer layers experience a thermally activated FF degradation due to morphological changes in BPhen with T G = 61 °C. In contrast, devices employing 2,2′,2″-(1,3,5-benzenetriyl tris-[1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole] (TPBi, T G = 120 °C):C 70 EF-CBLs have stable FFs with little evidence of degradation at temperatures up to 130 °C. Finally, we study the performance of devices employing TPBi:C 70 EF-CBLs both outdoors and under concentrated sunlight. Following a 5 h dose of 100-sun (100 kW m -2 ) illumination, the active layer shows no changes in absorption while losing just 7% in PCE and 2% in external quantum efficiency (EQE). Finally, after >100 d of outdoor operation, no degradation was apparent, suggesting that continuous illumination aging may underestimate OPV lifetime under real-world conditions. This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we report experimental results. In Section 3, we discuss the theory of small molecule crystal growth and relate the thermal properties of various EF-CBLs to their morphological and OPV stability. Analysis of degraded devices following accelerated aging is also discussed in Section 3, and compared with state-of-the-art OPV devices from the literature based on the total energy generated before failure. Conclusions are presented in Section 4. In Section 5 we outline methods used to fabricate and test EF-EBLs and devices. 
 Results X-ray diffraction measurements of 200 nm thick films of 1:1 exciton blocker:fullerene (C 60 or C 70 ) on sapphire were taken both before and after aging for one week under simulated one sun AM1.5G illumination. After aging, a diffraction peak in the 1:1 BPhen:C 60 film appears at an angle, 2θ = 13.7° (Figure  1a ), which is also observed in BPhen powder XRD patterns. The background intensity at 2θ < 10° of the tris [2,4,6-trimethyl-3-(pyridine-3-yl)phenyl]borane (3TPYMB):C 60 film (Figure  1b ) decreased to reveal a broad feature extending from 2θ = 9° to 12°. The 1:1 TPBi:C 70 spectrum was featureless both before and after aging, as were the 3,3′,5,5′-tetra[(m-pyridyl)phen-3-yl]biphenyl (BP4mPy):C 60 and TPBi:C 60 spectra (not shown). The glass transition temperature (T G ) of the wide energy gap exciton blockers BPhen, BP4mPy, 3TPYMB, and TPBi obtained by DSC are 61, 105, 106, and 120 °C, respectively, and are listed in Table  1 . Liquid-solid transitions were observed in BPhen and TPBi at 218 and 274 °C, while BP4mPy and 3TPYMB did not melt under atmospheric pressure. From the DSC melting peaks, we calculate an enthalpy of fusion of 79.9 kJ mol -1 for BPhen, and 46.6 kJ mol -1 for TPBi, indicating that BPhen has a larger intermolecular cohesive binding energy.  [23]  The vaporization temperatures in vacuum (1 × 10 -6 Torr) of the materials follow a similar trend, where TPBi evaporates at 320 °C, BP4mPy at 350 °C, 3TPYMB at 240 °C, and BPhen at 230 °C. Figure  2  shows the FTIR absorption spectra for C 60 , C 70 , DBP, 3TPYMB, BP4mPy, TPBi, and BPhen both before (asgrown) and after aging for 1 week under one sun, AM1.5G simulated solar illumination in N 2 . No changes are observed in the C 70 , DBP, 3TPYMB, BP4mPy, or TPBi spectra. In contrast, peaks at wavenumbers of 1612, 1382, 921, 842, and 809 cm -1 become more pronounced in the BPhen spectrum, while the changes in C 60 are consistent with photo-oligomerization.  [24, 25]  The CO 2 absorption band from 640-700 cm -1 is omitted for clarity. The device structures used in lifetime tests are shown in the inset of Figure  3a . The performance of as-grown devices at t = 0 with the five EF-CBLs are listed in Table  1 . The normalized J SC , FF, V OC , and PCE under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (at ambient temperature 50-60 °C) are plotted in Figure  3  as functions of time for TP60, BPPy60, and 3T60 cells. Figure  4  and Figure  5  show the normalized J SC , FF, V OC , and PCE for BP60 devices between 50 and 80 °C, and for TP70 devices between 55 and 130 °C. A biexponential was used to fit the FF(t) of BP60 with two rates, k fast (T) and k slow (T), as shown in Figure  4b  (solid lines). All data are normalized to the point at which the equilibrium temperature is reached. From Figure  3 , Figure  4 , and Figure  5 , we observe that the J SC of all devices decreases approximately linearly with time (5% to 10% per 1000 h) under continuous, simulated AM 1.5G illumination. In contrast, V OC is stable for BPPy60, TP60, and TP70. A decrease in V OC is observed for 3T60 cells (by 4% after 320 h) and BP60 cells (by 9% at 80 °C and by 2% after 800 h at all other temperatures). A similar trend is observed for FF where TP70, TP60, and BPPy60 cells are stable, while BP60 loses 11% to 23% after 800 h depending on temperature, and 3T60 decreases by 6% over 300 h of operation. The time for PCE to decrease by 20% from its starting value at ambient temperature (known as T 80 )  [14]  is 800 h for BP60, 2700 h for TP70, 2200 h for TP60, 1100 h for 3T60, and 1700 h for BPPy60 (the last three lifetimes are extrapolated). Dark J-V characteristics were measured for all devices both before and after aging under continuous, simulated AM1.5G illumination. Results for BP60 and TP70 cells are shown in Figure  6 . The dark current at <0.8 V in the as-grown BP60 devices was considerably smaller than for the aged devices (Figure  6a ). After 800 h, devices aged at higher temperatures exhibit higher dark currents. To characterize losses due to the dark current increase, we separate the illuminated J-V characteristics obtained under 1 sun into two parts: a shunt current that is linear with voltage (J SH ), and a nonlinear component due to recombination, (J REC ). We extract J SH by linearly extrapolating the current near 0 V, and J REC by taking the difference between the measured current and J SH at the maximum power point. These components are plotted as functions of time and normalized to J SC in Figure  7a, b . In contrast, the most stable devices (TP70) show almost no change after aging (Figure  6b ), and exhibited no systematic dependence on temperature. The J-V characteristics of the TP70 devices aged at intermediate temperatures are omitted for clarity. The degradation rates, k fast (T) and k slow (T), extracted from the biexponential fits to FF(t) are plotted versus 1/k B T at each aging temperature for BP60 (Figure  8 ). Using Equation (  1 ), we find that the two activation energies are equal to within the error of the measurement: 0.56 ± 0.06 eV for k fast (T) and 0.53 ± 0.13 eV for k slow (T).

 EF-CBL Blocker To understand the performance of OPVs in an actual operating environment, four identical TP70 devices were placed outdoors from November 8th, 2015 to February 21st, 2016. The normalized responsivity (which equals the ratio of J SC to the solar irradiance), FF, V OC , and PCE as functions of time are plotted in Figure  9 . Prior to catastrophic package failure resulting from a leak in the epoxy seal at day 104, no discernable degradation was observed. After package failure, the J SC and responsivity degraded rapidly due to oxidation and water ingress, highlighting the importance of robust encapsulation. T G [°C] J SC [mA cm -2 ] FF [%] V OC [V] PCE [%] T 80 [h] BP60 61 Since the degradation rates of some devices were not increased by thermal stress, we exposed the most stable TP70 devices and a 54 nm thick 1:8 DBP:C 70 thin film to 100-sun concentrated sunlight (100 kW m -2 ) for 5 h. Figure  10a  shows the J-V characteristics under one sun illumination both before and after aging. The V OC is stable, while a decrease of 2% in J SC and 5% in FF are observed. No change in the optical absorbance of the DBP:C 70 active layer blend was observed after high intensity exposure (left axis of Figure  10b ). The integrated photocurrent calculated from the EQE (right axis of Figure  10b ) decreases by 2%, which is comparable in magnitude to the decrease in J SC measured at one sun. 
 Discussion Blending organic materials can result in a morphology that is more stable than either of the constituents comprising the mixture.  [26, 27]  The compounds act to stabilize each other by breaking up the interactions between similar molecules, which prevents the formation of aggregates and growth of crystallites. Here, we find that T G of the blocking molecule in the EF-CBL can be predictive of morphological and device stability. Nevertheless, we caution that molecular diffusion and crystallite domain growth can still occur at T < T G .  [28]  Materials with a low enthalpy of fusion, high T G and high melting point produce lower crystallization rates, leading to more stable amorphous states that are required for reliable OPVs.  [28, 29]  In Figure  1a  we find that including C 60 in the EF-CBL mixture significantly impedes, but does not completely eliminate BPhen crystallization, an effect that can induce interfacial charge build up and low resistance shunts through organic heterojunctions (HJs).  [26, 30, 31]  The improved lifetime of blended cathode buffers was also shown for the bathocuproine:C 60 system in planar OPVs.  [11]  As a result of the stabilized morphology, the lifetime of the BP60 EF-CBL devices (T 80 = 800 h) under continuous one sun simulated illumination is two orders of magnitude longer than devices with neat BPhen buffers reported by Song et al.  [30]  TPBi has a significantly higher T G = 120 °C, melting point of 274 °C, and lower enthalpy of fusion of 46.46 kJ mol -1 than BPhen; thus the XRD spectra of aged TPBi blends with either C 60 or C 70 (Figure  1c ) show no evidence of morphological changes. The T G 's of 3TPYMB and BP4mPy are 105 and 106 °C, respectively, but neither material melted at temperatures up to 400 °C, and their XRD patterns did not show evidence of crystallization. Their large size compared to BPhen and increased degrees of intramolecular rotational freedom likely limits their tendency to form crystalline domains.  [32]  No change was observed in the BP4mPy:C 60 XRD spectra after aging, although a broad amorphous feature appeared in the 3TPYMB:C 60 spectra, suggesting that the morphology changed over time. The detailed nanomorphology (i.e., packing density, cluster size, and molecular orientation) within the EF-CBL blends was not revealed in the XRD spectra, although such information may be accessible with the use of more specialized characterization techniques that are beyond the scope of this work.  [33]  The trends in FF and V OC follow those observed in XRD, where TP70 (Figure  5 ), TP60 (Figure  3a ), and BPPy60 (Figure  3b ) are stable under continuous illumination, while BP60 (Figure  4 ) and 3T60 (Figure  3c ) show decreases in these operating parameters. The J SC of all devices decreases approximately linearly under continuous illumination, and has a comparatively weak dependence on EF-CBL composition or aging temperature. The origin of the decrease in J SC was not apparent from the thin film analysis methods employed here. However, the optically generated polaron density in neat films is low compared with the density in the illuminated device since the films lack a junction to dissociate excitons. Therefore, polaron-induced degradation such as exciton annihilation may be underrepresented in the thin film analyses such as in the FTIR spectra. The FTIR spectra in Figure  2  suggest that C 70 , DBP, 3TPYMB, BP4mPy, and TPBi are photochemically stable under illumination in a nonreactive gas atmosphere. The largest changes are observed in C 60 that oligomerizes under illumination, which has been shown to result in a decrease in the exciton diffusion length and broadened optical absorption.  [25]  Here, C 60 is used as an electron conductor in some EF-CBLs, and its effect on lifetime compared with C 70 is a likely the result of increased absorption in the EF-CBL. The discrepancy in J SC degradation rate between the various C 60 EF-CBLs may be due to small changes in charge extraction as the morphologies of the buffers change with aging; an effect that should be largest for buffers with the lowest T G . The relative changes in BPhen peak height are due to crystallization. As noted, the EF-CBL influences charge extraction and exciton recombination, and hence its composition impacts the PCE.  [3, 8]  Previously, Xiao et al. demonstrated that the PCEs of devices with a BPhen:C 60 /BPhen EF-CBL are >25% higher than those with a neat BPhen exciton blocking buffer, primarily resulting from increases in FF.  [8]  Excitons at the acceptor-buffer interface are efficiently blocked due to a large difference in both the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied MO (HOMO) energies between BPhen and the fullerenes, while the high conductivity and the alignment of the C 60 EF-CBL and the C 70 acceptor orbital energies leads to efficient electron extraction. The energy gaps of TPBi, BP4mPy, and 3TPYMB are sufficiently large to block excitons and have stable morphologies compared with BPhen, leading to more stable OPV operation (Table  1 ). After aging the BP60 devices, we observe a temperature dependent increase in dark current (Figure  6a ). Accordingly, the dark current subtracts from the photocurrent, shifting the maximum power point toward the origin, thus reducing both FF and PCE.  [23]  From the biexponential fits to FF(t), two degradation rates are extracted, k fast (T) and k slow (T). We find that J SH /J SC can be fit at each temperature by a single exponential (Equation (  2 )) with the rate k slow (T) from the fit to FF(t), shown in Figure  7a . The effect of J SH on FF is relatively small, accounting for only 1% to 3% of the loss, depending on temperature. Crystallization of BPhen has been shown to penetrate from the metal cathode into the device active region,  [30]  and is likely responsible for J SH in the devices studied here. In contrast, changes in J REC result in a 7% to 13% decrease of FF depending on aging temperature, as shown in Figure  7b . The solid line shows the result of a biexponential fit to J REC /J SC using k slow (T) and k fast (T), where α < 0 in Equation (2). This asymmetric increase in forward-biased dark current is suggestive of an increase in recombination that may result from an increased defect density or decreased electron extraction efficiency at the buffer interface over time.  [34, 35]  The  remaining FF loss in BP60 that is not accounted for by the increased dark current (5% to 9%, depending on aging temperature) results from a reduction in voltage at the maximum power point. As seen in Figure  6b , the dark current of TP70 is stable compared with BP60, and consequently no change in FF is observed. Due to the relative stability of the EF-CBL devices that do not contain BPhen, both J SH and J REC likely result from the same process of BPhen crystallization. Thus, we expect that E A of both k fast (T) and k slow (T) should be equal, and indeed this is the case to within experimental error, as shown in Figure  8 . The performance of a population of four TP70 devices aged under sunlight shows no degradation after >100 d (see Figure  9 ). This is in contrast to the cells with the same TP70 device architecture but aged under continuous simulated illumination, which show a linear decrease in J SC over time (Figure  5a ). The results suggest that the lifetime of the devices under real-world operating conditions may be longer than they appear under simulated conditions. For example, the operational lifetime under real conditions consists of alternating illumination and dark exposure, and may therefore allow for recovery in the dark if the degradation is partially reversible.  [21, 36]  However, this conclusion remains to be proven by additional experiments since the outdoor exposure carried out under open circuit conditions is significantly less (<500 h of one sun equivalent radiation) than the 2500 h maximum power operating point continuous illumination measurement using a solar simulator light source. No change in absorption in the DBP:C 70 active layer film was observed after illumination for 5 h under 100-sun intensity (Figure  10b  left-axis). Under these conditions, the EQE of the TP70 device was slightly reduced between λ = 350 and 600 nm (Figure  10b  right-axis). The 2% loss in J SC obtained from integration of the EQE spectrum after aging is comparable to the 4 ± 2% decrease in J SC observed after a similar dose of photons under continuous simulated illumination (500 h). A 6% decrease in FF is also observed in Figure  10a , resulting from a significant increase in dark current that was not observed during continuous illumination (c.f. Figure  5b ). Exciton-exciton or exciton-polaron annihilation may be responsible for the degradation, as their rates would be approximately four orders of magnitude higher at 100 kW m -2 than 1 kW m -2 .  [37, 38]  Such processes are responsible for the degradation of blue phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes, but have not been similarly reported in OPVs. In practical applications, solar cells must simultaneously achieve high efficiency and long-term reliability. It is useful, therefore, to define a figure of merit that is equal to the   total energy generated by a device prior to falling below an acceptable level of performance. For this we assume that cell failure occurs at T 80 . Then the total energy generated prior to failure is E t P t dt T ∫ = ⋅ PCE( ) ( ) 80 0 inc 80 ( 3 ) where P inc (t) is the solar irradiance as a function of time, t. In Figure  11  we plot E 80 for the previously reported OPVs summarized in Table  2 , including the TP70 devices studied here.  [7, 17, 18, [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47]  Apparently, both lifetime and PCE have improved over the last several years, producing dramatic increases in E 80 from <10 6 J m -2 in 2005 to 5.9 × 10 8 J m -2 in this work. Some polymer and small molecule cells experience a significant decrease in initial efficiency (known as burn in), presumably due to morphological rearrangement following deposition, or chemical instabilities, although that is not observed in several cells investigated here.  [14, 16, 18, 45]  Among devices with E 80 > 10 8 , only two have PCE > 5%, and only three were aged using lamps with AM1.5G UV content. In all cases, the E 80 for organic solar cells still fall >10 times short of those attained by inorganic solar cells where E 80 > 10 10 J m -2 for Si, CdTe, and CuInGaSe 2 devices, with initial PCE = 13.4% to 20.5% and degradation rates <1.2% per year.  [48]   
 Conclusions The operational lifetimes of small-molecular-weight, planar-mixed HJ OPVs with different EF-CBLs were determined using a range of test conditions, and were related to their morphological and photochemical stabilities based on the analysis of XRD, FTIR, and DSC data. Compared to OPVs with neat BPhen cathode buffer layers; BP60, 3T60, TP60, TP70, and BPPy60 EF-CBLs were found be more morphological stable, leading to reduced degradation in their long-term performance characteristics. Exciton blocking molecules with a high T G and a reduced  tendency to crystalize produce the most stable EF-CBLs and longest-lived OPVs. For example, BP60 has the shortest operational lifetime among the EF-CBL devices with a thermally activated loss in FF due to BPhen crystallization that leads to junction shunts and increased recombination. This is in contrast to TP70 devices which were stable at temperatures as high as 130 °C, leading to an operational lifetime of T 80 = 2700 h and E 80 = 5.9 × 10 8 J m -2 after continuous illumination. Under 5 h exposure to concentrated sunlight (100-suns), TP70 devices experienced a 2% loss in J SC , which is comparable to that observed under continuous one sun intensity illumination of the same dose (500 h). However, during aging under sunlight, no performance loss was observed in a population of TP70 devices for >100 d. Our results suggest that the morphological and photochemical stabilities of constituent layers are predictive of long-term device stability, and form a useful basis for the design and selection of OPV materials. The robustness of TP70 devices under extreme aging conditions including outdoor exposure, high temperature, and concentrated illumination is promising for the future of OPVs as a highly stable solar cell technology. 
 Experimental Section The materials Al, MoO 3 , C 60 , C 70 , DBP, BPhen, TPBi, 3TPYMB, and BP4mPy were obtained from commercial sources. The chemical structural formulae for the exciton blocking materials and the electron conducting fullerenes are shown in Figure  1  and Figure  3 . Devices were fabricated on prepatterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates. Prior to use, the substrates were cleaned by sequential sonication in tergitol/deionised (DI) water solution, DI water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, followed by drying with ultrapure N 2 . Substrates were subsequently cleaned with a stream of supercooled CO 2 gas for 1 min, followed by a 10 min exposure to UV-ozone.  [49]  Sapphire windows used for XRD measurements were similarly cleaned, omitting the UV-ozone treatment. The XRD diffraction patterns were obtained by illumination from a rotating anode, Cu Kα source in the Bragg-Brentano configuration. The KBr windows for FTIR measurements were used without cleaning. All layers were deposited by thermal evaporation in high vacuum (<2 × 10 -7 torr) at rates between 0.2 and 1.6 Å s -1 . Layer thicknesses and optical constants were measured using a variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer. Device areas of 11.3 mm 2 were defined by the intersection of the prepatterned ITO anode and a patterned Al cathode deposited through a shadow mask. Aging experiments were conducted without an optical aperture mask that confines illumination within the device active area so as to realistically simulate actual exposure conditions. Following fabrication, devices and thin films for XRD measurements were encapsulated by a cover glass in a glovebox filled with ultrahigh purity N 2 (<1 ppm O 2 and H 2 O) and sealed to the substrate with a UV-curable epoxy bead applied around its periphery. The packages contained a BaO x /SrO x desiccant to remove residual O 2 and H 2 O incorporated during packaging, or from small package leaks. The active layer used for absorbance measurements was deposited on quartz and packaged with a desiccant similar to the OPVs. Substrates containing six OPV cells each were fabricated with the structure: 150 nm ITO/10 nm MoO x /54 nm 1:8 DBP:C 70 /9 nm C 70 /EF-CBL/100 nm Al. The EF-CBL consisted of either 10 nm 1:1 BPhen:C 60 /5 nm BPhen (henceforth called BP60), 10 nm 1:1 3TPYMB:C 60 /5 nm 3TPYMB (3T60), 10 nm 1:1 TPBi:C 70 /3 nm TPBi (TP70), 10 nm 1:1 TPBi:C 60 /3 nm TPBi (TP60), or 10 nm 1:1 BP4mPy:C 60 /3 nm BP4mPy (BPPy60). Temperature dependent lifetime data were collected from devices fabricated in the same batch. All lifetime data shown are from a representative device on each substrate, where the device-to-device lifetime variation is included in the error bars along with the measurement error. Fourier transform infrared spectra (Nicolet 6700) of 100 nm thick organic films on KBr were measured immediately following growth, while a companion film was aged under 1 kW m -2 xenon arc lamp illumination inside a glovebox filled with high purity N 2 for 1 week prior to measurement. The FTIR spectrometer was purged with purified N 2 for >10 min prior to measurement to remove ambient H 2 O and CO 2 , and spectra were corrected for atmospheric interference and to establish Figure  11 . Energy produced prior to a loss of 20% in the power conversion efficiency (E 80 ) versus publication year for the TP70 devices reported here, and previously reported OPV cells with literature references indicated. Device lifetime measured using light sources which include little or no UV light are noted with an asterisk (*). Some cells experience a "burn-in" for the first several hundred hours, during which 20%-40% of the initial PCE is lost, and are noted by a dagger ( †). The E 80 calculated considers T 80 measured from t = 0 for all devices. * N/A = information not available. a signal baseline. Each spectrum from 400 to 4000 cm -1 consisted of averaging 32 scans with a resolution of 4 cm -1 . Differential scanning calorimetry (Perkin Elmer DSC-7) was performed on 0.1-2 mg powder samples contained in a hermetically sealed Al pan. A heat-cool-heat cycle at 10 °C min -1 was performed from 25 °C to the subject material vacuum evaporation temperature to avoid decomposition. Devices were aged under continuous illumination from a class AAA Xe arc lamp solar simulator at an intensity of 1 kW m -2 . Packaged devices were mounted on printed circuit boards and connected to a current-voltage source meter through a relay multiplexer. During aging, each device was connected to a resistor to fix its current and voltage near the maximum power operating point. A resistive heater was placed on a Cu plate beneath each device to independently control temperature which was monitored using an integrated thermocouple. The current density versus voltage (J-V) characteristics were measured twice per hour. One film prepared for XRD analysis was measured immediately following growth, while a separate sample from the same batch was aged in N 2 under simulated solar illumination and then analyzed. Devices for outdoor aging were fabricated and packaged as above, then mounted on a fixed-angle (30°) platform located at Sede Boqer (30°51′ N, 34°46′ E) in the Negev Desert, Israel, where they remained under open-circuit conditions for 120 d. Cell temperature was measured using a thermistor mounted directly on the device substrate, and solar irradiance was monitored with a calibrated Si photodetector. During periods when the solar irradiance was >300 W m -2 , fourth quadrant J-V characteristics were measured twice per hour. High light intensity (100 suns) device aging was also performed outdoors in Sede Boqer. Sunlight was collected, concentrated, and focused into a transmissive, 1 mm diameter quartz-core optical fiber coupled onto the OPV that operated at open circuit.  [50, 51]  Flux uniformity was achieved by placing a multimode, 3 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm quartz block between the cell and the fiber. Intensity was controlled with an iris, and measured using a spectrally blind calibrated pyranometer.  [19]  The temperature of the illuminated area was estimated to be ≈100 °C.  [19, 52]  Experiments were limited to clear-sky periods, 2.5 h around solar noon. The spectrum during this period was nearly invariant, and close to AM1.5G.  [53]   Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

Title: Decoupling the effects of defects on efficiency and stability through phosphonates in stable halide perovskite solar cells
Decoupling the effects of defects on efficiency and stability through phosphonates in stable halide perovskite solar cells. Joule, (2021). 5.
Photovoltaic (PV) energy technologies are crucial to transform our society into a low-carbon economy, enabling the production of electricity from sunlight. Single-junction halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have already achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) above 25 %  1, 2  . Despite their excellent PV performance, operational stability remains the main obstacle for the deployment of this technology. The PCE and operational stability in PSCs are thought to be strongly interrelated through the defect density at the surface, grain boundaries, interfaces and in the bulk of the halide perovskite (HP)  2  . Defects can either boost charge transport (generating extra free charge carriers by doping) or impede it by trapping or scattering the carriers  3  . Defects associated with deep trap states in HP (e.g. undercoordinated halides ions, undercoordinated Pb 2+ ions) promote non-radiative recombination, leading against a high photovoltage, hampering the ultimate device efficiency  4  . Shallow defects, on the contrary, are considered benign in classical inorganic semiconductors and have little contribution to non-radiative recombination, not strongly influencing the efficiency of the device  5  . This high tolerance to shallow defects is what makes the perovskite family known as defect-tolerant  5  . However, the ionic-electronic characteristics of HPs, together with their "soft material" nature, indicates a strong ionic component where charged shallow level traps with low formation energies (e.g. I or MA vacancies), results in unfavourable for the solar cell, causing ion migration, phase segragation and hysteresis  [4] [5] [6]  . This is especially detrimental for the PSC under non-equilibrium conditions, such as high temperature, electrical bias, continuous light irradiation or their combination, where ion migration dictates the long-term stability of operational PSCs  3, [7] [8] [9]  . The introduction of additives (organic or inorganic compounds) into the HP layer is a method that has been effectively applied to passivate defects to increase the efficiency of the solar cell  [10] [11] [12]  . The success of such an approach is not straight forward and depends on multiple factors like HP thin film preparation, nature of precursors, type of additives  [13] [14] [15] [16] [17]  . Although efficient PSCs can be fabricated following this strategy and the stability is enhanced if compared with the control device without additive, the real outcome is not always stable PSC as defined as those able to display less than 10 % degradation after 1000 h of continuous illumination under 1 sun  18  . Thus, in order to attain highly efficient and stable PSCs it is not only important to passivate defects responsible for deep level traps that results in high efficiency, It is also important to ensure ion immobilization through the passivation of defect-induced shallow level traps  5, 6  . The ionic motion is defined by the energy barriers to ionic transport in the HP, where halide ions (I -) and organic cations (MA, FA) are the main mobile ions  7, 14, 19, 20  . Different passivation and grain-growth methods have been developed to decrease the defect density and suppress ionic migration  20  . The binding mode between the additive and the HP plays a critical role in the optoelectronic properties of the device and its long-term stability. Additives with functional groups S=O, P=O or C=O can control the HP crystallization, passivate uncoordinated Pb 2+ defects or both. Hydroxyl (-OH) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups also act as Lewis bases passivating uncoordinated lead defects by forming Pb-O bonds  21  . In particular, the hydrogen bonding energy between organic cations and PbI6  4-  octahedra, as well as Pb-I bonds, weakens under continuous illumination. This effect facilitates the migration of both the organic cations and the halide anions in an HP, which would accelerate its decomposition in the absence of stabilizing additives  20  . The chemical shift trend for an additive varies considerably depending on the functional group participating in the bonding with the HP. In PSCs, the most employed additives encompass functional groups such as -COOH or -NH3 + , while -PO(OH)2 is less employed  22,23 17,24  . The peculiar behaviour of the phosphonic acid derivative has been related to a stronger H-donating character  25  , which also plays an essential role in charge injection. Bonding through the phosphonic acid group has been reported to be more stable than bonding through carboxylic or amine groups, although the charge injection rates can be affected by the tetrahedral phosphorous centre and loss of conjugation  26  . For example, Brown et al. analysed the advantages of both -PO(OH)2 and -COOH anchoring agents in solar cells: -PO(OH)2 was employed to increase the surface binding stability, and carboxylic acids were employed to increase the electron injection efficiency  27  . This indicates that the chemical bonding between the HP and the additive also plays an important role on the regulation of the activation energy of ion migration, which determines the long-term stability of PSCs 9 . However, despite all these research efforts, the understanding of the binding modes in perovskite-additive interactions and the correlation between defect passivation, non-radiative recombination and device efficiency and stability remain poorly understood. In this work, we study the addition of the 3-phosphonopropionic acid (H3pp) organic molecule to an HP absorber and investigate the effect that two different anchoring groups (phosphonate -PO(OH)2 and carboxylate -COOH) have on the performance and stability of PSCs. In order to ensure an accurate comparison between the different characterization methods carried out to materials, thin films and complete devices, all our studies were carried out at room temperature. We fabricate complete solar cells with the configuration FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/HP/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au based on the multication perovskite absorber with the nominal formula Rb0.05Cs0.05MA0.15FA0.75Pb1.05(I0.95Br0.05)3 (RbCsMAFA)  28  with and without the H3pp molecule. The PSCs showed excellent and similar overall optoelectronic performance, leading to PSCs with an open-circuit voltage of Voc ~1.1 V and a PCE of ~21 %. Surprisingly, stability analyses of the PSC with H3pp showed negligible loss of the initial efficiency after 1000 h under 1 sun and maximum power point (MPP) tracking, while the reference device (without H3pp) showed > 20 % loss under the same conditions. To understand the effect of the H3pp molecule on the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite and its stability, we employed contactless high-throughput characterizations, including time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy, photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) measurement and optical-pump THzprobe (OPTP) spectroscopy. First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, supported by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses, demonstrate the presence of two types of hydrogen bonds (H … I and O … H) between the -PO(OH)2 functional group and the perovskite. These strong binding modes occur through shallow point defects (e.g., FA and I vacancies)  29, 30  that block or immobilize ions, resulting in remarkable device stability. This interaction is also benign to the electronic structure of the perovskite and is not related to nonradiative recombination, as opposed to other binding modes that influence electronic interactions and passivate by binding directly to vacancy/defect sites  [31] [32] [33]  . We expect our findings to enable decoupling of the effects of defects on the efficiency and stability to advance on the understanding of shallow and deep defect passivation, non-radiative recombination and PSC performance. 
 Photovoltaic performance Different organic additives sharing the phosphonic, -PO(OH)2, and carboxylic acid, -COOH, functional groups with different structures and chain lengths (Supplementary Fig.  1 ) were initially selected. These two functional groups were chosen due to the known interaction with the HP and the transport layers  26, 27, [34] [35] [36] [37]  . In all cases, the PCEs were below those obtained for the reference RbCsMAFA device (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). The best PV efficiency was observed for H3pp, one of the smallest and simplest molecules in the catalogue we explored. After careful optimization of its concentration within the HP, the 1:500 H3pp:HP ratio resulted in PSCs with the highest PCE, comparable to that of the reference PSCs (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) cross-sectional image of the HP:H3pp PSC is depicted in Fig.  1a . The champion PSC fabricated with H3pp shows PCEs of 21.22 % and 20.45 % in reverse and forward scans, respectively (Fig.  1b  and Supplementary Fig.  3 ), with a stabilized PCE of 21.1 % (inset of Supplementary Fig.  3 ). The Jsc from the IV curves agrees with the integrated Jsc obtained from the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) analysis (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). The optimization of the fabrication process statistically yielded average PCEs of 20.2 ± 0.7 % and 20.6 ± 0.4 % and an average Voc of 1.12 ±0.01 V for the reference and H3pp:HP PSCs, respectively (Fig.  1c  and Fig.  1d ). Both types of PSCs also demonstrate similar values in their other PV parameters (current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and hysteresis index (HI)) (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). To evaluate the recombination in our PSCs, we carried out light intensity-dependent Voc analysis in complete devices. Analyses were carried out in devices with the configuration FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/HP/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, with and without the H3pp additive in the HP layer (Supplementary Fig.  6a ). The diode ideality factor (nid) can be extracted from the relation Voc = Eg + (nidkT/q) ln(I/I0), where Eg is the band gap, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, q is the elementary charge, and I0 is a reference intensity usually at one sun  38  . Ideality factors with nid =1.80 and 1.85 for PSCs with and without the H3pp were observed, suggesting very similar p-n junction quality and trap-assisted recombination in both types of PSCs  39, 40  , in agreement with the similar Voc and efficiency observed. Transient photocurrent (TPC) and open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) analyses also displayed similar carrier transport and recombination properties for the PSCs with and without the H3pp additive, consistent with the similar Jsc and Voc values obtained (Supplementary Fig.  6b-c ). To understand whether the recombination behaviour of the photoexcited carriers unequivocally comes from the perovskite films, TRPL analyses were carried out on HP thin films (deposited on glass) with and without the H3pp molecule. Fig.  1e  shows the TRPL decay of reference and optimized H3pp:HP (1:500 ratio) films measured at a low fluence (509 nm, 50 nJ/cm 2 per pulse, equivalent to ~1 sun). The monoexponential fits to the data result in characteristic lifetimes very similar for both samples of τ ≈ 230 ns  41, 42  . The charge carrier lifetime is strongly related to the defect/trap density of the material under study, especially the nonradiative recombination  42  . The PLQE at 1 sun reached values of 1.90 % and 1.94 % for the HP and HP:H3pp thin films, respectively, demonstrating the good quality of the films and corroborating the similar recombination process in both samples (Supplementary Table  1 ). TRPL measurements at higher light intensities (fluences) equivalent to 1, 5, 10 and 100 suns (Supplementary Fig.  7 ) indicate very similar responses for the samples with and without the H3pp molecule up to 5 suns (Supplementary Fig.  7a-b ). The similar charge carrier lifetimes at low fluences indicate that the addition of the H3pp molecule does not reduce nonradiative recombination in the perovskite films. However, for higher light intensities, i.e., 10 and 100 suns, we observed longer lifetimes, which could indicate a slight reduction in nonradiative recombination for the sample treated with H3pp in comparison to the neat HP films (Supplementary Fig.  7c-d ). The comparable nonradiative recombination observed for the thin films with and without H3pp addition is supported by the comparable PLQEs and estimated quasi-Fermi level splitting values (QFLS, upper limit for Voc) in the perovskite films and PSCs (Supplementary Table  1 -a and b, respectively)  42, 43, 44  . To probe the carrier dynamics on a shorter time scale, we employed OPTP spectroscopy with subpicosecond temporal resolution. In this experiment, we probed light-induced changes in the conductivity -i.e., the photoconductivity -as a function of the pump-probe delay time  45  . We carried out measurements on the structure of silica glass/perovskite for both the reference HP and the HP:H3pp sample (Fig.  1f ). We observed that within a few picoseconds after excitation with the pump pulse (15 μJ/cm 2 , 800 nm), the photoconductivity is positive, indicating the presence of light-induced mobile charges. We observe a second-order recombination process caused by nongeminate electron-hole pair recombination  46  , leading to a reduction in the photoconductivity that is observable within a nanosecond. This process is followed by relaxation on a timescale of many nanoseconds (as probed using TRPL), which manifests as a constant long-term background in the background conductivity in the short OPTP time window (see also Supplementary Fig.  8 ). We also observe that the normalized dynamics are nearly identical for the samples regardless of the presence of the H3pp additive. In summary, our results show very similar values of Voc and PCE (Fig.  1  and Supplementary Fig.  5 ) for the PSCs regardless of the presence of H3pp, which is ascribed to the negligible impact of H3pp on the nonradiative recombination of the HP and devices at low fluences (1 sun). Slight differences in the optoelectronic properties (longer lifetimes) of the H3pp:HP thin film are observed only at higher fluences (Supplementary Fig.  7 8 ); however, these values are not convincing enough to firmly state that the addition of H3pp reduces nonradiative recombination. Given that the nonradiative recombination is closely related to deep level defects that act as recombination centres, we speculate that defects (especially deep defects) are not passivated or that their passivation is negligible in our thin films when the H3pp additive is employed. 
 Device stability and ion immobilization We sought to evaluate any possible effect of H3pp on the operational stability and ion migration of the PSCs (Fig.  2a ). For this purpose, we followed the ISOS protocols recently reported for PSCs under 1 sun continuous illumination for 1000 h in N2 (ISOS-L-1l)  18  . First, we carried out stability analysis on the reference PSCs employing as the absorber the RbCsMAFA (•), without additive (blue) and PSCs with an optimal H3pp:HP ratio of 1:500 (orange) (Fig.  2a ). The PSC with the optimal 1:500 H3pp:HP ratio retained nearly 100 % of the initial PCE, while the stability observed for the reference PSC showed about 28 % performance loss after 1,000 h under the same operational conditions (Fig.  2a ). Interestingly, we replicate the same trends in other perovskite compositions such as Cs0.05MA0.15FA0.80Pb1.05(I0.85Br0.15)3 (CsMAFA) (Fig.  2a , ■, and Supplementary Fig.  9 ). The main difference between PSCs with the two HP is the initial few hours of the stability analyses for the PSC with the CsMAFA, where a decrease in PCE is initially observed and stabilizes with time. This response has been observed before and is attributed to the charge accumulation at the interface with Spiro-OMeTAD  33, 47  . Interesting, our results demonstrate that the addition of H3pp can be extended to different HP absorbers with similar long-term stability results. To further understand the outstanding stability of the PSCs when we apply the H3pp molecule, we performed OPTP, PLQE and TRPL measurements on the perovskite films with and without H3pp on glass over time at high light intensities (Fig.  2b  and c ). The use of a high light intensity has been proposed as a way to accelerate the degradation of PSCs and to predict the solar cell lifetime since high intensity illumination of several suns can tremendously accelerate the degradation of solar cell devices and materials  18  . Fig.  2b  shows the OPTP measurements of the photoconductivity carried out on the reference HP and H3pp:HP thin films under 4 suns for 10 h. Data were taken every 30 min. The results indicate that the sample with the H3pp additive exhibits a more stable and higher photoconductivity after 2 h of light irradiation compared with the reference sample, which shows a slow but steady decrease in the photoconductivity. The THz photoconductivity is proportional to the number of photoexcited electron-hole pairs and to the mobility of these charges. Thus it provides microscopic insights into the fundamental processes (charge creation and charge transport) of the solar cell. The long-term stability of this signal demonstrates that the same number of charges is created and their mobility stays constant. The monitored response of the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) peak intensity under continuous irradiation of 100 suns for ~10 min (500 sec) under a N2 atmosphere (Fig.  2c ) also demonstrates the high stability of the HP with H3pp in comparison with the reference HP, which degrades almost immediately after only a few seconds. To analyse the role of ion migration in the samples, we applied electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and temperature-dependent dark conductivity measurements to PSC samples and HP thin films, respectively. Fig.  2d  shows the frequency-dependent capacitance of the PSCs with and without the H3pp additive obtained from the Nyquist plot of the EIS spectrum. The capacitance in the low frequency range (1-100 Hz) is one order of magnitude lower for the device with the H3pp molecule, indicating an effective reduction in ion migration and charge accumulation at the interfaces  28  . Ion migration activation energy (Ea) analysis was performed on HP samples deposited on glass via temperature-dependent dark conductivity measurements (Fig.  2e ) according to the Nernst-Einstein relation of σ(T) = σ0 /T* exp (-Ea/kT), where T is the temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant, σ0 is a constant, and the activation energy Ea can be extracted from the slope of the ln(σT) ～1/KT relation  48  . The Ea for the HP is 340 meV, while 430 meV is obtained for the sample with the H3pp molecule, indicating effective mitigation of ion migration. In summary, the addition of H3pp has no substantial beneficial effect on the efficiency for PSCs under equilibrium conditions (as-prepared). Notably, it brings remarkable long-term stability to the PSCs analysed under nonequilibrium operational conditions (continuous light irradiation). Analyses of the carrier recombination and photoconductivity under multi-sun illumination support the high stability observed with the use of the H3pp additive not only under 1 sun but also under severe light irradiation up to 100 suns. Our results also demonstrate that the good stability can be extended to different HP absorbers, in this case CsMAFA and RbCsMAFA. PLQE and OPTP analyses at low fluences (~1 sun) rule out any variation in the non-radiative defect concentration. However, analyses at increasing fluences (above 10 suns) result in a small decrease in the deep trap density, which has an enormous impact on the device stability but not on the device performance. Our results also demonstrate that ion immobilization is the mechanism behind the outstanding long-term stability of the PSCs when the H3pp additive is employed. 
 Effect of H3pp on the perovskite thin film: microstructure and binding mode On the basis of the PV results and outstanding PV stability, we aim to understand the effect of the H3pp molecule on the morphology, structure and composition of the HP thin films. Fig.  3a  shows the morphology of the HP thin films with and without the H3pp additive in top-view SEM images. The addition of H3pp did not promote grain growth in the HP thin films since very similar grain dimensions (~280 nm on average) are observed for both samples. This indicates that grain boundaries are not reduced upon the addition of H3pp, in agreement with the similar nonradiative recombination levels in both types of PSCs, as grain boundaries are reported to be the source of defects  32, 49  . Fig.  3b  shows a cross-sectional annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) image of the different layers of the PSC, where the selected area highlighted by a blue rectangle is the absorber HP:H3pp layer with a grain boundary. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) was applied to obtain the chemical composition maps of the HP:H3pp layer. According to the EELS maps, phosphorus (from the -PO(OH)2 of H3pp) is present in the HP bulk and is slightly richer near the grain boundary, demonstrating that H3pp is relatively segregated. As will be discussed later, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) confirm that H3pp is not incorporated into the crystal lattice. The cross-sectional lamella may contain several grains in the electron beam direction, and when the surface of the grains is surrounded by H3pp (at the 3D level), the EELS maps will show phosphorus in the bulk and a slightly rich presence at grain boundaries. The XRD patterns of the RbCsMAFA perovskite thin films without H3pp and at the optimal H3pp:HP 1:500 ratio are shown in Fig.  3c . No new peaks or peak shifts are observed in any of the HP films with different H3pp concentrations (Supplementary Fig.  10 ), indicating that H3pp may not be incorporated into the perovskite crystal lattice. Further solid-state NMR studies confirm that H3pp is not incorporated into the crystal lattice and most likely resides in the grain boundaries and on the surfaces (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). The (-111) crystal plane for the H3pp-doped sample is enhanced in comparison with the reference sample (Fig.  3c ). The impact of the crystal orientation on the PSC performance is currently under debate by the research community  14, 50  , probably due to variations in the precursor composition and fabrication processes. In our case, a negligible influence is observed. Evidence of the interaction between H3pp and the HP is found with FTIR analysis (Fig.  3d ). The peak at 1712 cm -1 corresponds to the antisymmetric C-N stretching (overlapping with the C=O stretching), and the peak at 1470 cm -1 corresponds to the symmetric NH3 + bending. After the introduction of the H3pp molecule into the HP layer, the stretching vibration of -P=O in H3pp shifts from 1268 cm -1 to 1243 cm -1 , whereas that of -C=O remains almost unchanged (1710 cm -1 to 1708 cm -1 ), which indicates a strong interaction of H3pp with the HP through the phosphonate group and a weak interaction through the carboxylate group. To obtain more atomistic information regarding the interaction mode of H3pp with the HP, we further investigated their interaction by using DFT. We chose α-FAPbI3 as a simple perovskite model (FA is the dominant cation in the perovskite applied in this work). We began by computing the binding energy (Ebinding) of the H3pp molecule at FAI -and PbI 2-terminated FAPbI3 surfaces as Ebinding = EH3pp + Esurface-Esurface-H3pp, where Esurface-H3pp, EH3pp and Esurface are the total energies of the H3pp-FAPbI3 system, H3pp molecule and FAPbI3 surface, respectively. We considered a number of possible interaction modes between the two, including the interaction of O-FA, H-I, and O-Pb, where the first and second atomic species come from H3pp and the HP, respectively. All interaction modes are energetically favourable, with sizeable binding energies in the range of 1.6 eV to 3.1 eV (Supplementary Fig.  12  and Supplementary Table  2 ). Notably, H3pp tends to bind much more strongly to the FAI-terminated surfaces than to the PbI2-terminated surfaces, with all configurations having binding energies as high as 2.9 eV to approximately 3.1 eV. Fig.  4a  shows the most favourable configuration (binding energy of 3.13 eV), where H3pp interacts with the HP such that -PO(OH)2 points towards a FAI-terminated perovskite surface and forms a total of three hydrogen bonds of two different types. In the first type of hydrogen bond, the hydrogen atom from -P-OH interacts with I -(H-I), and in the second type, the oxygen atom from -P=O interacts with two hydrogen atoms from one NH2 moiety of FA + (O-H). From a charge density difference analysis (Fig.  4b ), we observe that both types of hydrogen bonds are present due to a significant depletion of electrons from the H atoms to the O and I atoms. Because the involved H atoms come from both H3pp and the HP, significant charge redistribution occurs on both sides, confirming strong interface interactions. Because of the newly created hydrogen bonds with the perovskite, we expect a slight weakening of the P=O bond itself in H3pp. Indeed, the wavenumber of the stretching mode of the -P=O bond, as calculated by DFT, shifts from 1246 cm -1 to 1171 cm -1 (Fig.  4c ), which is a sign of weakening of the bond. Note that we also find another similar strong interaction mode of -PO(OH)2 with the FAI-terminated perovskite surface, a second favourable configuration with a binding energy of 2.99 eV (Supplementary Fig.  12b  and Supplementary Table  2 ), where only two hydrogen bonds (instead of the three in Supplementary Fig.  12a  and Fig.  4a ) are formed. The calculated wavenumber of the stretching mode -P=O for this structure also shifts to a lower wavenumber of 1207 cm -1 . While the wavenumber of the stretching mode of the -P=O bond shift to lower wavenumbers, that of the -C=O stretching mode remains almost unchanged (Fig.  4c ), indicating the absence of a strong interaction with the HP. Our experimental FTIR spectrum shown in Fig.  3d  confirms both trends. Therefore, combining the DFT calculations and FTIR data, we can establish that the dominant mode of interaction between the H3pp molecule and the perovskite is through the formation of two types of hydrogen bonds between the -PO(OH)2 moiety and the FA + cations and I -anions. Having established the dominant interaction modes of H3pp with the HP surface, we continue to study the effect of such interactions by calculating the formation energies of I anion and FA cation vacancies on the surface of the clean perovskite and on a surface that incorporates H3pp. As shown in Fig.  4d , the I and FA vacancy formation energies for a perovskite surface coordinated with H3pp species are increased by 2.03 and 1.20 eV, respectively, compared to the pristine perovskite. The second favourable configuration also gives slightly smaller (compared with the most favourable configuration) but still significantly large defect formation energy differences of 1.99 eV (for I vacancies) and 0.84 eV (for FA vacancies) compared with the pristine HP. The presence of H3pp therefore inhibits the formation of I and FA vacancies at the surface. This result illustrates the mechanism behind ion immobilization and supports the excellent operational stability of the H3ppmodified PSC (Fig.  2a ), where the creation of I and organic cation vacancies is typically believed to be responsible for the migration of ions in the perovskites under operational stress, such as electrical bias and light excitation  51  . In brief, the incorporation of H3pp within the HP layer leads to high nanostructure quality as a thin film absorber but does not translate into large grain sizes of the H3pp:HP thin film. The strong interaction between the HP and H3pp is corroborated by FTIR and NMR analyses. Our combined experiments and DFT analysis point to a strong interaction of the H3pp species with the perovskite surface, particularly via the phosphonate group. Such strong interactions include two types of hydrogen bonds (H-I and O-H). All these interactions potentially prevent the creation and diffusion of several point defects (e.g., FA and I vacancies) at the surfaces and grain boundaries of the perovskite film, enabling ion immobilization and highly stable PSCs under operational conditions. The current understanding of point defects in PSCs indicates that passivation of deep defects (e.g., Pb-I antisite defects)  13  reduces the nonradiative losses and has a direct impact on the device performance (Voc and efficiency)  [3] [4] [5]  . In our work, the PLQE and OPTP results at low fluences (~1 sun) rule out any variation in the non-radiative defect concentration. However, analyses at increasing fluences (above 10 suns) indicate a small decrease in the deep trap density, which has an enormous impact on the device stability but not on the device performance. This result is unexpected because the application of additives in high-quality PSCs usually enhances both the efficiency and stability, and the role of defects in these properties is often linked. In our work, the strong binding modes of H3pp with the phosphonate functional group passivate defects through shallow point defects (e.g., FA and I vacancies)  29, 30  that block or immobilize ions (for example, MA, FA or I). This type of binding mode is benign to the electronic structure of the perovskite and does not relate to nonradiative recombination, as opposed to other binding modes that influence the electronic interaction and passivate by binding directly to vacancy/defect sites  [31] [32] [33]  . We expect that our results will permit to increase the understanding between defect passivation and PSC operational stability: It is not only significant to passivate defects responsible for deep level traps, it is also important to consider defect-induced shallow level traps. Finally, the relation of defect passivation and ion immobilization in these additives is not a simple task. The effect of multiple factors are usually taking part on the stability enhancement process. For example, intrinsic factors such as the concentration, size and structure of the additive (as shown in Supplementary Fig  1 ), as well as extrinsic factors such as high temperature, humidity or electrical bias shoud also be part of future studies. 
 Conclusions In summary, by applying the H3pp molecule to the perovskite precursor solution, we fabricated solar cells with excellent optoelectronic properties (Voc of ~1.1 V and PCE of ~21 %), which are not affected by the H3pp additive. Remarkably, the PSCs display outstanding operational stability, retaining nearly 100 % of the initial PCE after 1000 h under MPP operational conditions and light irradiation. The H3pp additive strongly bonds to the perovskite through the -PO(OH)2 functional group via two types of hydrogen bonds (H … I and O … H), passivating shallow point defects (e.g., FA and I vacancies). Since the passivation does not occur through deep defects (e.g., Pb-I antisite defects), the nonradiative recombination is not mitigated, and the device performance (Voc and efficiency) remains unaffected by the presence of the H3pp additive. Such binding modes facilitate immobilization of halide anions and organic cations, blocking ion migration and improving the device stability. Our findings permit decoupling of the effects of defects on the stability and performance and advance on the understanding of the relation between shallow and deep defect passivation, non-radiative recombination and PSC stability. A further understanding of the nature of the different binding modes of the functional groups of additives in HPs will likely be essential for the development of stable operational PSCs.

Device fabrication. FTO substrates (Nippon Sheet Glass 10 Ω/sq) were etched by Zn powder and 4M HCl, and then were cleaned with Hellmanex®, acetone and ethanol for 15 min, respectively inside an ultrasonic bath, finally were immediately dried with dry air. Compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) solution was prepared with titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate): acetylacetone: ethanol = 0.6: 0.4: 9 (v : v) and then were sprayed onto FTO substrates at 450 °C.Mesoporous TiO2(m-TiO2) paste was prepared with titanium paste: ethanol=1:6 (w:w), and was spin coated to c-TiO2 substrates at 5000 rpm for 20s and then annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. After that, the as-prepared FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 substrates were quickly transferred to a N2 filled glove box for perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD deposition (no post-treatments were conducted for the substrates before deposition). The quadruple cation halide perovskite Rb0.05Cs0.05MA0.15FA0.75Pb1.05(I0.95Br0.05)3 was prepared as follows. Briefly, first 1.5 M stock solution of 1) CsI (DMSO), 2) RbI (DMSO), and 3) PbI2 (DMSO:DMF=1:4) were prepared, respectively. Then 1.5 M 4) (MABr)0.9(PbI2) (DMSO:DMF=1:4), and 5) (FAI)0.9(PbI2) (DMSO:DMF=1:4) were freshly prepared by dissolving MABr or FAI power in solution 3), respectively. After that, the solutions were mixed at a ratio of 4) : 5) : 1) : 2) : 3) = 190 : 950 : 60 : 60 : 60 (v:v) in sequence. The triple cation halide perovskite Cs0.05MA0.15FA0.80Pb1.05(I0.85Br0.15)3 was prepared as follows. Briefly, first 1.5 M stock solution of 1) CsI (DMSO), 2) PbBr2 (DMSO:DMF=1:4) and 3) PbI2 (DMSO:DMF=1:4) were prepared, respectively. Then 1.5 M 4) (MABr)(PbBr2) (DMSO:DMF=1:4) and 5) (FAI)(PbI2) (DMSO:DMF=1:4) were freshly prepared by dissolving MABr or FAI power in solution 2) and solution 3), respectively. After that, the solutions were mixed at a ratio of 4) : 5) : 1) : 3) = 150 : 800 : 50 : 100 (v:v) in sequence. 3-phosphonopropionic acid (H3pp) doped perovskite solutions were prepared by simply dissolving H3pp in the perovskite precursor solution to achieve H3pp: perovskite with various molar ratios (no heat or stirring is needed). The perovskite spin coating process was carried out at 2000 rpm for 10s, and then 6000 rpm for 30s. Initially, 50 μL perovskite solution was dropped on a 1.5*2.5 cm 2 FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 substrate. During the second step of spin coating, 100 μL chlorobenzene was dropped at 15s before ending. The samples were annealed at 100 °C for 1 h on a hot plate for crystallization. Hole transporting layer was prepared by dissolving 0.12 g spiro-OMeTAD in 1130 μL chlorobenzene and then doped with 47.3 μL TBP and 23.5 μL Li-TFSI (1.8 M in acetonitrile). The spin coating was conducted at 4000 rpm for 20s with 50 μL solution. The finished devices were placed inside a dry air box for 12 hours to fully oxidize the spiro-OMeTAD. Finally, 80 nm Au was deposited as the front electrode by thermal evaporation. The evaporation rate was controlled in different stages to limit the damage to the spiro-OMeTAD layer: 0.003 nm/s for 0 -1nm, 0.01 nm/s for 1-10 nm, 0.02 nm/s for 10 -20 nm and 0.06 nm/s for 20 -80 nm. Solar cell characterization. The solar cells IV curves were measured using a 450 W Xenon light source (Oriel) equipped with an arc lamp housing (Newport, Model 66902, 50-500 W). The light intensity was calibrated with a Si photodiode equipped with an infrared cutoff filter (KG3, Schott), and was recorded during each measurement. I-V curves of the cells were obtained by a digital source meter (Keithley 2400). The voltage scan rate was 10 mV/s. The cells were masked to get 0.16 cm 2 active area. Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were made based on a commercial apparatus (Arkeo-Ariadne from Cicci Research) using a 300 W Xenon lamp. All the measurements were conducted in air at room temperature. Solid-state NMR measurements. Starting materials were stored inside a glove box under argon. Perovskite powders were synthesized by grinding the reactants in an electric ball mill (Retsch Ball Mill MM-200 using a grinding jar (10 ml) and a ball (⌀10 mm) for 30 min at 25 Hz. The resulting powders were annealed at 140 °C for 10 minutes to reproduce the thin-film synthetic procedure. The amounts of reagents taken into the synthesis were as follows: α-FAPbI3: 0.172 g formamidinium hydroiodide (1.00 mmol) and 0.461 g PbI2 (1.00 mmol). H3pp-doped α-FAPbI3 (1:25 mol/mol): 0.172 g formamidinium hydroiodide (1.00 mmol), 0.461 g PbI2 (1.00 mmol), and 0.006 g (0.04 mmol) H3pp. 14 N (65.0 MHz) and 31 P (364.4 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance Neo 21.1 T spectrometer equipped with a 3.2 mm low-temperature CPMAS probe.  31  P chemical shifts were referenced to 85% phosphoric acid.  14  N spectra were referenced to solid NH4Cl (0 ppm) at 298 K. Low-temperature 1 H-31 P cross-polarization (CP) experiments used 1 ms optimized contact pulses, 4 s recycle delay, and 63 kHz SPINAL-64 1 H decoupling. Echo-detected  31  P spectra used the following optimized recycle delays: 1 s (α-FAPbI3 doped with H3pp), 300 s (neat H3pp).  14  N spectra were acquired with recycle delays of 0.1 and 0.5 s, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). FTIR was obtained by using TENSOR 27 FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker). Perovskite and H3pp-doped perovskite thin film were prepared following the same process as the devices, and then were scratched off carefully and mixed with KBr for measurements. To increase the signal of FTIR, concentrated H3pp doping was applied (H3pp: perovskite = 1:2.5). 
 Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Focused ion beam (FIB, Zeiss Crossbeam 1560XB) was applied to prepare the lamellae for HRTEM measurements. 2 μm of Pt/carbon layer was deposited on top of the Au (active area) using electron beam evaporation to avoid the damage of the layer during FIB process. The initial cut for trenches was performed at 10 nA, then 2 nA and last polishing at 500 pA and 200 pA to limit the damage. Then the lamellae were lifted out and attached to the TEM grid. Final polishing was conducted in consecutive steps. The initial step was at 30 kV, 50 pA tilted at 57º (perpendicular to the FIB) and the final step was at 5 kV, 10 pA to avoid Ga + contamination as much as possible until the lamellae were transparent in the detector at 3 kV (electron acceleration voltage). The lamelIae are around 50 -100 nm. To limit the possible degradation in air, fast transfer of lamellae in and out of the system was conducted (< 2 min). A grounded bracelet was used to take out the lamellae grid to avoid electrostatic damage. EELS analyses were obtained by using a FEI Tecnai F20 field emission gun microscope operated at 200 kV, which is equipped with a high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) detectorand embedded Quantum Gatan Image Filter. Images have been analyzed by means of GatanDigital Micrograph software. 
 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) . SEM was performed using Quanta 650F with 5 kV accelerating voltage at a working distance of 8 cm. 
 X-ray diffraction (XRD). X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the sample was measured using Empyrean (Panalytical) equipped with a ceramic tube (Cu anode, λ = 1.54060 Å) and a PIXel 1D (Panalytical) detector. XRD data was analyzed using HighScore Plus software. 
 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Capacitance-Frequency measurements of perovskite solar cells were recorded with Paios (Fluxim, electrical measurement all-in-one platform for solar cells). The measurements are under a white LED source with calibrated light intensity close to one sun. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), Photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) and steady-state photoluminescence (PL)., PLQE and PL measurements were conducted by placing the samples in an integrating sphere. The different films were photoexcited by a 532-nm continuous-wave laser. The laser power was set at 60 mW/cm 2 by using a calibrated power meter, and it was monitored over time to ensure reproducible conditions for all the samples. Laser signal, laser signal attenuated by the sample (absorption) and photoluminescence signal were collected by an optical fibre coupled to an Andor iDus Si Detector, with an accumulation time of 30 s for each measurement. The optical response of the integrating sphere, the optical fibre and the detector were calibrated. The protocol followed for measuring and calculating the PLQE is based on reference  52  . For TRPL, a 509 nm pulsed (1 MHz repetition rate) semiconductor laser was used for excitation. The average laser power was set at 60 mW/cm 2 (one sun equivalent intensity, or higher power equivalent to 5, 10 and 100 sun). A hybrid PMA photodiode with time resoloution of 25 ps was used as TCSPC detector. Samples were kept under N2 atmosphere until characterised to prevent them from degradation. Optical pump-THz probe (OPTP) spectroscopy. We perform photo-conductivity measurements of samples using optical pump-THz probe (OPTP) spectroscopy. In the setup, the THz generation is based on the optical rectification process in ZnTe non-linear crystals, using 800 nm pulses with duration of ~ 50 fs. The time-dependent electric field strength of THz pulses (~ 1-2 ps duration) transmitted the sample is detected by a second ZnTe crystal using electro-optic sampling. By fixing the sampling delay time to the peak position of the THz pulse, we monitor the THz absorption change by a third laser pulse with a wavelength of 800 nm. By tuning the time delay between the pump and THz probe, we measure the timedependent THz absorption and therefore, the photo-conductivity of our sample in the time domain. The OPTP setup is kept in an N2 environment to avoid THz absorption in air. Temperature dependent dark conductivity. The conductivity of the perovskite with and without H3pp was measured at different temperatures by applying 2 V bias to glass/perovskite with electrode spacing of 10 μm on the surface, corresponding to an average electrical field of 0.2 V μm -1 . Sample temperature was varied in the close-circle He cryostat and measured by Si-diode from 120 K to 330 K. We firstly cooled the device to 120 K and then stabilized it at 120 K for half an hour. Subsequently the device was heated to an objective temperature with an interval of 20 K and stabilized at the temperature for 10 minutes before the current measurement was performed. To avoid transient current spikes which occurred in the first few seconds after bias, the conductivity was extracted from the device current between 20 and 50 s after the bias was applied  48, [53] [54]  . 
 Light intensity dependent Voc, Transient photocurrent (TPC) and Open circuit voltage decay (OCVD). Light intensity dependent Voc, TPC and OCVD are analyzed at state-of-the-art devices (FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au) using PAIOS (Fluxim, electrical measurement all-in-one platform for solar cells). The measurements are under a white LED source with varied light intensity from 0.3 to 1 sun for light intensity dependent Voc 38 and 1 sun for TPC and OCVD. Stability Analyses. The stability measurements were carried out following ISOS-L protocol for PSCs  18  . The tests were performed under N2 atmosphere in a seald holder, tested under continuous light illumination and maximum power point tracking at room temperature (controlled and monitored to be 25 °C). The light source consisted of an array of white LEDs powered by a constant current. The LED type is LXM3-PW51 with an emission spectrum of 400-750 nm (see Supplementary Fig.  13 ). Equivalent sun intensities were calibrated using a calibrated Si reference diode equipped with a KG-5 filter. Computational methods. Since FA as a cation and I as an anion are the most abundant species in the experimentally studied (R0.05Cs0.05MA0.15FA0.75Pb1.05(I0.95Br0.05)3), the calculations were carried out using FAPbI3 as a model system. The surfaces were modelled using slab models consisting of (2×2) cells in the x and y directions and nine atomic layers of iodine constructed from the bulk structure with a vacuum of 15 Å in the z direction. Structural relaxation of all structures were performed within the framework of DFT, as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP).  55  The Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof functional within the generalized gradient approach was used.  56, 57  During the structure optimization, five bottom atomic layers were fixed and ions of rest layers and H3pp molecule were allowed to relax. An energy cutoff of 500 eV and a k-point of 3× 3 × 1 achieve energy and force convergence of 0.01 meV and 20 meV Å -1 , respectively. Information on chemical bonding analysis and formation energies of I -and FA+ vacancies in the reference, H3pp-containing perovskites is presented in Supplementary Information. 
 Configurations Binding energy (eV) Frequency (cm We calculated the formation energies of FA + and I -at the FAI terminated surface of the H3ppmodified FAPbI3, respectively. As a reference, we also calculate the same formation energies for the pristine FAI terminated FAPbI3. The defect formation energy is given as, ( ) qq i i F VBM i DEF X E X E bulk n q E E V          (0.1) where () q EX is the total energy of the defect system with charge q , () E bulk is the total energy of the pristine system, and n and  are the number and the chemical potentials of the species added to or subtracted from the perfect system in order to form the defect. The last term is the energy associated with the exchange of charges with the electrons' reservoir (the Fermi level of the system F E ), referenced to the valence band maximum ( VBM E ) of the pristine system, followed by a correction for the electrostatic potential shift V  induced by the defect. The last term is assumed to be the same for H3pp-modofied and -unmodified FAPbI3 because similar Quasi Fermi level splitting (QFLS) for the two perovskites is found in photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) observations (Supplementary Table  1 ). We define the relative formation energy as in Ref.  Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.
