Title: Enhancing efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells via evaporated NdF 3 surface passivation
Realizing efficient and stable perovskite photovoltaic devices remains a key challenge for further development in this field. Surface defects, especially those caused by unbound Pb, are often linked to the performance of these devices. This study demonstrates that NdF 3 deposited on the surface of perovskite films effectively passivates unbound lead, thereby improving film quality. The resulting device achieved an power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.88% and exhibited good stability. Even after being stored in air for 1400 h, the device maintained its initial PCE of 87.5%. Additionally, after aging at 120 • C for 400 h in a nitrogen atmosphere, the device still retained 90% of its initial PCE. Furthermore, the device maintains 52% of its initial PCE after 1000 h of continuous light soaking.
Introduction Low-cost perovskite photovoltaic devices have achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency(PCE) of 26.14%  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]  , comparable to crystalline silicon technology. However, the commercialization of photovoltaic technology requires a balance between high PCE and high stability, which is a major bottleneck of current perovskite photovoltaic technology. The defects in perovskite thin films are one of the key factors affecting device performance. On one hand, these defects increase non-radiative recombination, leading to a decrease in device PCE. On the other hand, they also affect the stability of the thin film itself, resulting in poor device stability  [12]  . Defect passivation is indeed crucial for achieving efficient and stable perovskite photovoltaic devices  [13, 14]  . Unbonded lead is a prevalent defect in perovskite films, prompting significant research efforts to address it  [15]  . For example, LiF, a common passivation material, is vapor-deposited onto the surface of perovskite to reduce non-radiative recombination at the interface and enhance the open-circuit voltage of the device  [16] [17] [18] [19]  . Similarly, MgF 2 and CsF are also employed as passivating agents on the surface of perovskite thin films, thereby improving device performance  [20, 21]  . However, it's worth noting that these materials tend to absorb water, which can lead to perovskite film degradation and ultimately affect device stability. In addition, certain rare earth elements have demonstrated potential in enhancing the stability of perovskite materials  [22]  .Their variable valence properties enable them to oxidize Pb, thereby preventing the formation of Pb 0 and enhancing the stability of the thin film. For example, Yan et al. utilized Eu to oxidize Pb 0 , leading to perovskite devices achieving a certified PCE of 20.52% and demonstrating improved stability. Even after heating at 85 • C for 1500 h, the devices retained 89% of their peak PCE  [23]  . Here, we introduce a non-water-soluble NdF 3 material for the surface passivation of perovskite films. NdF 3 effectively reduces the defects caused by unbound Pb in the perovskite film, leading to improved device PCE, reaching 22.88%. Moreover, the stability of the device has been enhanced, maintaining its initial PCE of 90% even after 400 h of thermal aging at 120 • C. 
 Experimental section 
 Perovskite solution preparation Dissolve 1.5 Mol of FAI and 1.5 Mol of PbI 2 in a mixed solution of DMF and DMSO with a volume ratio of 4:1, with a total volume of 1 ml. Dissolve 1.5 Mol of MAI and 1.5 Mol of PbI 2 in a mixed solution of DMF and DMSO with a volume ratio of 4:1, with a total volume of 1 ml. Combine the two solutions in a volume ratio of 9:1.Dissolve 1.5 Mol of CsI in DMSO, and mix the CsI solution with the MA-FA mixed solution at a volume ratio of 3:97. Add 8 mol% of PbI 2 to the precursor to create the precursor composite, and heat on a hot plate at 60 • C to facilitate solute dissolution. Finally, add 30 mol% of MACl powder to the 1 ml precursor solution before spin-coating to aid in film formation. 
 Device fabrication The ITO-coated substrates (2.5 × 2.5 cm 2 ) were ultrasonicated twice in water and detergent for 10 min each. The substrates underwent UVozone treatment for 10 min. PTAA (1.5 mg/mL in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated onto the ITO at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The layer was then annealed at 100 • C for 10 min. The PTAA substrate was spin-coated with 150 μL of Al 2 O 3 (in a volume ratio of 1:50 with IPA) and annealed at • C for 10 min to form the hole transport layer (HTL). Next, 150 μL of the perovskite precursor was spin-coated at 4000 rpm with an acceleration rate of 800 rpm/s for 40 s, and 300 μL of EA was added as an anti-solvent at 30 s. The sample was then annealed at 105 • C for 30 min. The passivation layer was formed by depositing NdF 3 on the perovskite surface by thermal evaporation. This process was carried out at a pressure lower than 2 × 10 -3 Pa, a current of about 135 A, and a rate of 0. Å/s, using a tungsten boat as a vessel. Next, 30 nm of C60 was evaporated, followed by the deposition of 20 nm of SnO 2 using atomic layer deposition (Super ALD Corp. E300). Finally, 150 nm of Ag electrode was evaporated sequentially to complete the device. 
 Results and discussion 
 Perovskite films As shown in Fig.  1a , the presence of NdF 3 has almost no effect on the grain size of perovskite films, which remains around 320 nm. However, the perovskite film with NdF 3 appears to be smoother, suggesting the possibility of a layer of covering. Subsequently, we observed that NdF 3 had no effect on the phase of the perovskite thin film by XRD testing (Fig.  S1 ). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) test results were charge-corrected using the C1s peak set to 284.8 eV. As shown in Fig.  1b , it is clear that the NdF 3 -perovskite exhibit strong characteristic peaks of F (684.77 eV) and Nd (~1005 eV), while the control sample will not have a signal. Additionally, the Pb 4f peak of the perovskite film with NdF 3 shifts towards lower binding energies, as observed in Fig.  1c . After performing a split-peak fitting, the control group exhibited the emergence of a P 0 peak at 142.59 eV and 137.69 eV  [24]  . The presence of metallic lead (Pb) in the 0 oxidation state is considered a significant factor in the degradation of PSCs  [15]  . Eliminating Pb 0 from the surface of the perovskite film is one of the most important tasks of passivation. The peaks of Pb 0 also appeared on the perovskite films with NdF 3 at 141.78 eV and 136.38 eV  [25]  , but characteristic peaks of Pb-F appeared at 144.04 eV and 139.14 eV  [24]  . The calculation results indicate that the percentage of Pb 0 on the surface of the perovskite film decreased from 21.09% to 7.4% after the evaporation of NdF 3 .The residual presence of Pb 0 may result from the utilization of XPS during testing. The decomposition of PbI 2 on the perovskite film surface can occur, leading to the formation of a small amount of Pb 0  [25]  . As shown in Fig.  S2 (a) the peak of I in the perovskite film with NdF 3 shifted towards lower binding energy by 0.2 eV, and this may be attributed to the interaction between Nd and I. These results provide strong evidence of an interaction between NdF 3 and Pb. As shown in Fig.  S2(b) , the C 1s peak in the perovskite film with NdF 3 shifted towards higher binding energy, possibly due to the formation of strong hydrogen bonds between the crystal's large molecules and F -in NdF 3 . The PL spectrum (Fig.  1d ) reveals a notable increase in the peak intensity of the perovskite film with NdF 3 , suggesting effective suppression of non-radiative recombination  [26]  . This indicates that the presence of NdF 3 effectively passivates surface defects in the perovskite film. In summary, the use of NdF 3 passivation resulted in a reduction of traps related to Pb, leading to a decrease in nonradiative recombination. 
 Device performance The device structure of ITO/PTAA/PVK/NdF 3 /C60/ALD/Ag was utilized to investigate the impact of NdF 3 on device performance, as shown in Fig.  2a . The inclusion of NdF 3 has notably enhanced the device performance, particularly in terms of open-circuit voltage. However, excessive NdF 3 can result in a decrease in short-circuit current. It is observed that NdF 3 at a thickness of 0.5 nm strikes a balance and achieves optimal PCE (Fig.  2b ). Typical J-V curves with different NdF thicknesses are shown in Fig.  2c . A significant increase in both opencircuit voltage and fill factor can be observed as the thickness of NdF varies from 0 to 0.3 nm, 0.5 nm, and 0.7 nm. The corresponding opencircuit voltages are 1.04 V, 1.10 V, 1.11 V, and 1.11 V, respectively. Similarly, the fill factors are 80.9%, 84.0%, 84.4%, and 83.7%, respectively. Excessive NdF 3 can lead to a decrease in the short-circuit current of the device. When reaching 0.7 nm NdF 3 , the short-circuit current drops to 23.56, which may be due to the insulating characteristics of NdF 3 itself hindering carrier transport. The EQE test confirmed this observation (Fig.  2d ). When excessive NdF 3 is present, the EQE response decreases, leading to a corresponding decrease in the integrated shortcircuit current. The experiment compared the effects of NdF 3 on the air stability and thermal stability of the device without packaging. As shown in Fig.  3a , when the device is placed in an air environment, devices with NdF 3 exhibited a continuous increase in open-circuit voltage, while their current and fill factor showed a decreasing trend. After holding the device in air for 960 h, the PCE reached its highest value, representing an increase of 2.5% from the initial value. By the time the device had been held for 1200 h, it still maintained 90% of the initial PCE, and at 1400 h, it retained 87.5% of the initial PCE. In contrast, devices without NdF 3 had already decayed to 35.5% of their initial value at 620 h, and by 1400 h, the PCE of these devices was almost undetectable. This suggests that the presence of NdF 3 greatly enhances the air storage stability of the device, likely due to the insoluble nature of NdF 3 in water. As shown in Fig.  3b , the water contact angle measurements showed a larger contact angle (91.4 • ) of the NdF 3 evaporated film compared to the control one (58.6 • ). The increased hydrophobicity of the target film leads to improved humidity stability, effectively shielding the device from external water vapor intrusion. We subjected the devices to thermal aging at a high temperature of 120 • C (Fig.  3c ). Interestingly, the open-circuit voltage of the device was not significantly affected by NdF 3 , but there was a noticeable difference in short-circuit current and fill factor. After 400 h of thermal aging, the PCE of devices with NdF 3 declined to around 90% of its initial value, whereas those without NdF 3 dropped to 57.7%. By 600 h, the difference in short-circuit current and fill factor between devices with and without NdF 3 became even more pronounced. Eventually, devices with NdF 3 decayed to 73.8%, while those without NdF 3 had already dropped to 34.1%. This suggests that NdF 3 also significantly improves the thermal We further compared the effect of NdF 3 on the thermal stability of perovskite thin films through X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig.  3d ). Before thermal aging, the XRD patterns of perovskite thin films without/ with NdF 3 were essentially the same. However, after annealing the thin film, the peak position of lead iodide in the perovskite without NdF 3 was significantly enhanced, indicating the generation of a large amount of lead iodide in the film, which is typically closely related to perovskite film degradation. In contrast, when NdF 3 was present, the appearance and strengthening of lead iodide peaks were significantly suppressed, indicating that NdF 3 effectively inhibited perovskite film degradation. From this, we can infer that the presence of NdF 3 suppresses the thermal annealing of perovskite itself, thereby improving the thermal stability of perovskite devices. We also evaluated the operational stability of the target device under continuous 1 sun illumination. As shown in Fig.  3e , in a 45 • C ambient air, the PCE of the device remained 52% over 1000 h under continuous light illumination. 
 Conclusion In this study, NdF 3 has been demonstrated as an effective method for passivating defects in perovskite thin films. When evaporated onto the surface of perovskite thin films, NdF 3 interacts with unbound Pb, passivates defects, and improves device PCE by up to 22.88%. Additionally, NdF 3 enhances the stability of perovskite thin films, thereby improving device stability as well. These findings provide valuable insights into further enhancing the PCE and stability of perovskite photovoltaic devices.
