Title: Uniform Coverage Functional Layers Enable High-Efficient Flexible Perovskite Solar Modules with an Outstanding Fill Factor
Uniform and pinhole-free functional layers are essential for high-efficient flexible perovskite solar modules (FPSMs). However, the poor wettability of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with carbazole bodies and phosphonic acid binding groups usually leads to porous large-area perovskite films. Herein, a layer of nickel oxide nanoparticles is inserted between sputtered nickel oxide and the SAM to increase the surface energy, and thus simultaneously improving the wettability and nucleation of the perovskite during vacuum-quenching method. Following this strategy, the best flexible perovskite solar cells with an active area of 0.09 cm 2 achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.97% under 1 sun illumination. In addition, FPSMs with the same structure exhibit a high fill factor approach 80% and reach a champion PCE of 19.71% on 58.14 cm 2 active area and a certified PCE of 18.17% on 61.26 cm 2 aperture area, which is the highest recorded PCE to the best knowledge. Furthermore, the optimized interface also enhances the adhesion between holetransport layer and perovskite, and the encapsulated device retains 95% of its initial PCE after 1000 cycles under a 2 cm bending radius.
Introduction Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies for its high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low cost.  [1] [2] [3]  And the low-temperature process makes it suitable for flexible modules on polymer substrates, such as polyethylene glycol terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN).  [4] [5] [6] [7]  Currently, a record PCE of 23.35% has been achieved on PEN/indium tin oxide (ITO) flexible substrates with inverted structure.  [8]  However, the most outstanding PCEs were obtained in relatively small areas (<0.1 cm 2 ) with antisolvent,  [9, 10]  and few works have reported high-efficient flexible perovskite solar modules (FPSMs), with their fill factor (FF < 70%) still lagging behind those of rigid devices (%80%).  [11] [12] [13] [14]  For p-i-n perovskite solar cells (PSCs), uniform coverage hole-transport layers (HTLs) and electron-transport layers (ETLs) can be easily deposited by vacuum processes. For example, fullerene (C 60 ) and 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) are widely used as ETLs by thermal evaporation.  [15, 16]  In terms of HTLs, sputtered nickel oxide (SP-NiO x ) is of particular interest for flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) because of its uniform deposition and room-temperature prepared characteristics.  [17] [18] [19]  Although the PCE of SP-NiO x based p-i-n PSCs has exceeded 20%,  [20]  the performance of SP-NiO x HTLs is still inferior to that of organic HTLs.  [21] [22] [23]  The high nonradiative recombination gathered at the interface between the perovskite and NiO x limits the open-circuit voltage (V oc ) of NiO x -based PSCs.  [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29]  These defects could be minimized by introducing a layer of self-assembled monolayer (SAM) between the perovskite and SP-NiO x .  [30, 31]  Currently, SAMs of carbazole bodies with phosphonic acid binding groups, including [2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (2PACz), [2-(3,6-dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (MeO-2PACz), and [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz), are widely used in high-efficiency inverted PSCs and perovskite/silicon tandem cells.  [32, 33]  These materials exhibit high hole selectivity, fast carrier extraction, and extremely low nonradiative recombination at the interface.  [34]  Sun et al. introduced SP-NiO x as a seed layer to promote the adsorption of the MeO-2PACz and enhanced power conversion efficiency of 19.9% in comparison with 18.4%.  [35]  Phung et al. adopted an intermediate layer of ALD-NiO x between ITO and the MeO-2PACz, the homogeneity, and hence the surface coverage of the SAM improves. Thus, the combination of NiO x and MeO-2PACz results in a narrower distribution of device performance reaching a more than 20% efficient champion device.  [31]  Li et al. used a mixture of two hole-selective molecule-based 2PACz and MeO-2PACz to form a self-assembled monolayer and bridge perovskite with a low-temperature-processed NiO x nanocrystal film, and flexible all-perovskite tandem solar cells obtained a certified efficiency of 24.4%.  [30]  But pinholes can be easily presented during perovskite fabrication because of the poor wettability of SAMs with nonpolar surfaces, especially Me-4PACz.  [36]  In addition, porous perovskite films lead to direct contact between HTLs and ETLs (or positive and negative electrodes), causing severe charge recombination and degradation of the FF. To fabricate uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films, a suitable wettability of the perovskite precursor solution should be enabled on substrates, whether for spin coating or other scalable methods. To improve the wettability of SAMs, Amran et al. introduced 1,6-hexylenediphosphonic acid (6dPA) as a second component to the Me-4PACz precursor solution and achieved a high coverage of perovskite.  [36]  Ahmed et al. deposited SAMs via evaporation and simultaneously enhanced the wettability.  [37]  In other works, SiO 2 nanoparticles were introduced as a wetting agent for p-i-n planar PSCs based on poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA), which enhanced the surface energy of substrates, and pinholes-free perovskite films could be fabricated.  [38, 39]  Furthermore, compared to antisolvent methods, vacuum-quenching is a promising method for the uniform nucleation of large-area perovskite; in short, wet perovskite films at different regions could nucleate almost simultaneously in a vacuum chamber.  [40] [41] [42]  Additionally, few works have reported the uniform annealing of flexible perovskite. Gong et al. improved the annealing process of the perovskite using a layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to attach the flexible substrate on glass substrates and achieved a PCE of 18.35% on an active area of 48.9 cm 2 , which is one of the highest PCE of mini-FPSMs.  [11]  We discovered that the perovskite precursor solution had a much poorer wettability on PEN/ITO coated with SAMs than that of rigid substrates, even on SP-NiO x . For the first time, we introduced NP-NiO x as a wetting agent for FPSCs to improve the wettability of SAMs, and a uniform and pinhole-free perovskite film could be fabricated during spin coating and vacuum-quenching. Notably, NP-NiO x could also suppress gap formation at the HTL/perovskite interface during vacuum-quenching, which both enhanced the charge extraction and interface contact for FPSCs. Furthermore, optically clear adhesive (OCA) was used to adsorb the flexible substrates onto the glass, which ensured uniform annealing of the flexible perovskite. Finally, the champion PCE of 21.97%, 19.71%, and certified PCE of 18.17% could be achieved on an active area of 0.09, 58.14 cm 2 , and an aperture area of 61.26 cm 2 , respectively, which is the highest PCE among FPSMs to our knowledge. Furthermore, the encapsulated device retained 95% of its initial PCE after 1000 cycles under a 2 cm bending radius, which benefited from enhanced interface contact. 
 Results and Discussion In this work, FPSCs with a p-i-n planar structure were fabricated on PEN/ITO, consisting of indium tin oxide (ITO)/NiO x/ SAM/perovskite/phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI)/C 60/ bathocuproine (BCP)/Au. For the deposition of HTLs, 15 nm NiO x was deposited via magnetron sputtering, and a mixed SAM with a concentration of 1 mmol (2PACz/MeO-2PACz molar ratio of 3:1) was prepared via spin coating (Figure  1a  process one). To improve the wettability of the substrates, various concentrations of NP-NiO x (5, 10, and 20 mg mL À1 in deionized water) were inserted between SP-NiO x and the SAMs (Figure  1a  process two), and marked as SP-NP-5, SP-NP-10, and SP-NP-20, respectively. To compare the effect of NP-NiO x on improving the wettability of HTLs, the surface energy, which is an indicator of wettability, was analyzed via contact angle measurements (Figure  S1 , Supporting Information) using a solution of 1.2 M triple-cation mixed perovskite. Results show that the perovskite precursor solution has superior wettability on UVO 3 -treated PEN/ITO (13.9°, Figure  S1a , Supporting Information), and is enhanced to 21.9°after coating with the SAM (Figure  S1b , Supporting Information); however, this deviates significantly from that on glass/ITO (4.1°to 12.4°, Figure  S2a ,b, Supporting Information). The same phenomenon was also observed for PEN/ITO with SP-NiO x , in which the contact angle increased from 11.6°to 22.6°after coating with the SAM (Figure  S1e ,f, Supporting Information). Conversely, the wettability of the perovskite precursor solution on NP-NiO x (6.6°, Figure  S1c , Supporting Information) was significantly better than that on SP-NiO x , and even on SAM-coated substrates, the contact angle was still considerably smaller than those of the two cases mentioned previously (13.7°, Figure  S1d , Supporting Information). This phenomenon is attributed to the variation in the surface roughness caused by NP-NiO x , which is consistent with Young's theory.  [43]  To prevent possible problems between SP-NiO x and the SAM that lead to poor wettability of the perovskite precursor solution, an additional layer of NiO x was sputtered onto the NP-NiO x . Figure  S1j  and S3j, Supporting Information, shows that even when the NP-SP-NiO x was coated with a layer of SAM, the contact angle of perovskite precursor solution is still similar to that of NP-NiO x , confirming that the direct contact of SAM and SP-NiO x does not affect the wettability of HTLs but the introduction of NP-NiO x does. This result suggests that a layer of NP-NiO x can be inserted as a wetting agent between SP-NiO x and the SAM to improve wettability, which is beneficial for the fabrication of uniform and pinhole-free large-area perovskite films. In this work, various concentrations of NP-NiO x wetting agents were doped into HTLs and the contact angles of the perovskite precursor solutions were measured to compare the effects of NP-NiO x on wettability. As shown in Figure  S1f-i , Supporting Information, the results show that as 5 mg mL À1 NP-NiO x was spin-coated on SP-NiO x , the contact angle of the perovskite precursor solution on the SAM was significantly improved and gradually decreased with an increased concentration of NP-NiO x . The same phenomenon can be observed for the substrates coated with Me-4PACz, as shown in Figure  S3 , Supporting Information, which exhibit a more pronounced effect on the improvement in wettability. Furthermore, the surface energy of substrates was estimated by Fowkes method.  [44]  As shown in Figure  S4 , Supporting Information, the contact angle of diiodomethane on various HTLs exhibited the same trend as perovskite precursor solution and the surface energy significantly improved after introducing NP-NiO x (43.29 Â 10 À3 to 45.83 Â 10 À3 J m À2 ). Thus, NP-NiO x improves the surface morphology and increases the surface energy of the substrates with the SAM. To investigate the effect of morphology on the wettability, as shown in Figure  2 , top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the microstructures of several substrates, including PEN/ITO, PEN/ITO/SP-NiO x , and PEN/ITO/ SP-NP-10. Theoretically, SP-NiO x prepared on flexible substrates can completely cover the ITO while maintaining a similar morphology and roughness. As expected, as shown in Figure  2a ,b, PEN/ITO was evenly wrapped by dense SP-NiO x with a uniform size (<10 nm), and the surface morphology is almost indistinguishable from that of ITO. In contrast, obvious changes could be found on the surface of substrates, and the larger grain size of NP-NiO x (20-30 nm) was dispersed on SP-NiO x (Figure  2c ); the visible uncovered areas could be explained by the diluted NP-NiO x concentration (10 mg mL À1 ). In addition, top-view SEM images of the substrates doped with various concentrations of NP-NiO x are shown in Figure  S5 , Supporting Information, where the smooth PEN/ITO/SP-NiO x was gradually covered with increasing concentrations of NP-NiO x . Further, we also compared flexible PEN/ITO with the commonly used rigid glass/FTO and glass/ITO (see Figure  S6a-c , Supporting Information) and observed that the two substrates with transparent conductive oxide (TCO) displayed a surprising difference at the same magnification. The rougher TCO grains on rigid substrates than on flexible substrates may explain why the perovskite precursor solution exhibited considerably different wettability on different substrates. To investigate the differences in the 3D morphology, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to observe the roughness of the HTL with or without NP-NiO x . As shown in Figure  2d ,e, Supporting Information, the roughness of PEN/ITO and PEN/ITO/SP-NiO x has no noticeable difference, with the roughness average (R a ) of samples being 2.03 and 2.1 nm, respectively, conforming to the SEM discussed previously (see Figure  2a, b ). As the concentration of NP-NiO x increases from 5 to 20 mg mL À1 (see Figure  2f ,h), a significant increase in R a appears at 5 mg mL À1 , which then grows gradually until reaching almost the same R a . The contact angle and roughness of the substrates demonstrate that by increasing the concentration of NP-NiO x , the wettability of the perovskite precursor solution and the surface roughness of the substrates can be both enhanced (see Figure  1c  and S7, Supporting Information). The roughness values of the substrates with various HTLs are listed in Table  S1 , Supporting Information; the same trend can be observed among the three groups of samples. In summary, these results confirm that NP-NiO x increases the roughness of the substrate, providing a rough surface for SAMs. According to the Wenzel's equation, the surface energy of hydrophilic substrates will increase as the increase of surface roughness and improve the wettability of solution.  [45, 46]  In addition, the increased gaps between the small particles exhibit a strong capillary force that enables the perovskite precursor solution to spread more easily on the SAM.  [38]  To fabricate small-area FPSCs, the PEN/ITO was cut to a size of 25 Â 16 mm 2 and fixed on a glass substrate using an optically clear adhesive (OCA). Commercial OCA double-sided adhesives have two coatings with different viscosities, similar to a mobile phone tempered film, with the side with the lowest viscosity being suitable for adhering to flexible substrates. The use of the OCA ensures that flexible substrates can be laid flat on glass, thereby promoting a uniform annealing process of the perovskite, and thus, the PEN can be easily torn off from the substrates, as shown in Movie S1, Supporting Information. Each device had six subcells, and the active area of the testing mask was 0.09 cm 2 . A triple-cation perovskite ((CsPbI 3 ) 0.13 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.02 ) was fabricated via vacuum-quenching using the solution method, as shown in Movie S2, Supporting Information. Each top perovskite was passivated using PEAI, and the ETL was deposited by evaporating the C 60 /BCP. Figure  S8 , Supporting Information, shows a statistical boxplot of FPSCs based on various HTLs. Several reference devices exhibit extremely poor performance, as shown in Figure  6f ; the poor wettability of the substrate may have resulted in a low coverage of the perovskite. Although most of the area can be fabricated into the available subcells, this is clearly not suitable for large-area modules. Unlike the reference sample, NP-NiO x -modified devices exhibit excellent coverage, as shown in Figure  6f , making fabricating large-area flexible perovskites easy in future. In addition, the V oc of the cell was slightly improved, which could be attributed to the optimization of the HTL/perovskite interface. Notably, as the concentration of NP-NiO x increases to 20 mg mL À1 , the FF of the device decreases slightly (Figure  S7c , Supporting Information), which may be explained by the enhanced series resistance of the device owing to the increased thickness of the HTLs.  [47]  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the differences in NiO x , and the components of the SP-NiO x , SP-NP-NiO x , and NP-NiO x films were analyzed. Ni 2p is shown in Figure  S9a  and Table  S2 , Supporting Information, with Ni 2þ being found at 854.3, 854.1, and 853.9 eV for the SP-NiO x , SP-NP-NiO x , and NP-NiO x , respectively, corresponding to the standard NiO octahedral configuration. Another peak can be observed at 856, 855.8, and 855.7 eV for the SP-NiO x , SP-NP-NiO x , and NP-NiO x , respectively, corresponding to NiOOH and Ni 2 O 3 .  [48, 49]  As shown in Figure  S8b  and Table  S2 , Supporting Information, the characteristic peak of the hydroxyl group occupies 31.8% and 58% on SP-NiO x and NP-NiO x , respectively, while the characteristic peak of the hydroxyl group on SP-NP-NiO x almost same as SP-NiO x (34%). We speculate that the low coverage of NP-NiO x leads the main signal of the X-ray to be SP-NiO x . As we known, surface hydroxyl groups on metal oxide are key to the chemisorption of SAMs.  [31, 35]  Although there is no significantly enhanced hydroxyl signal was detected on SP-NP-NiO x , the extra hydroxyl of NP-NiO x on SP-NiO x can improve the coverage of SAMs which is beneficial to improve the charge transport. Furthermore, the UPS results in Figure  S10 , Supporting Information, also show that the addition of NP-NiO x has little effect on the work function and energy band of HTL. The champion PCE of the FPSCs appear in SP-NP-10, as shown in Figure  3a , with a maximum PCE of 21.96% (V oc = 1.153 V, FF = 81.83%, and J sc = 23.27 mA cm À2 ) under the reserve scan and 21.08% (V oc = 1.152 V, FF = 78.66%, and J sc = 23.25 mA cm À2 ) under the forward scan on an active area of 0.09 cm 2 . The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) results for the reference and modified devices, as shown in Figure  3b , verify the measured J sc . The integrated J sc deduced from the IPCE measurement reached 22.93 mA cm À2 , similar to that obtained from the J-V analysis. The modified device not only showed a better integrated J sc , but also demonstrated a higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) than the reference device, indicating suppressed nonradiative recombination in the improved HTL/perovskite interface. As shown in Figure  3c , the dark current of the modified device is almost two orders of magnitude lower than that of the reference device, indicating that carrier recombination is suppressed by interface optimization. Steady-state PL and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were obtained to investigate the hole extraction process at the HTL/perovskite interface. Figure  3e  shows the PL spectra of the perovskite (CsPbI 3 ) 0.13 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.02 based on reference or modified HTLs. The perovskite based on the reference HTL exhibits a high PL intensity, which gradually diminishes with the addition of NP-NiO x . The TRPL spectra shown in Figure  3f  are consistent with the steady PL spectra, which indicate that the introduction of NP-NiO x accelerated the hole extraction process from the perovskite to the HTL. Furthermore, the lifetimes of the carriers were calculated by fitting the TRPL curve, and the short lifetime of perovskite based on modified HTLs indicates more efficient hole extraction at the HTL/perovskite interface, thereby enhancing the V oc and FF of FPSCs. The Nyquist plots were fitted through equivalent circuit model in Figure  S11 , Supporting Information, that small area cells with NP can slightly improve the carrier recombination at the interface, while an obvious difference can be seen in large-area modules. As shown in Figure  S12 , Supporting Information, perovskites based on the reference and modified HTLs were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD); prominent characteristic peaks at 14.2°, 20.4°, 28.4°, and 31.9°can be observed in the patterns. Notably, the characteristic perovskite peaks at 28.4°c oincide with the characteristic peaks of PEN. In addition, the increase peak at 14.2°confirms the enhancement of crystallization. Top-view SEM was used to investigate the effect of NP-NiO x on the perovskite layer, and the perovskite was deposited on SAM with or without NP-NiO x . As shown in Figure  S13 -S15, Supporting Information, large amounts of pinholes can be easily found in perovskite without NP-NiO x . On one hand, whether for small area cells and large area modules, NP-NiO x improves the wettability of perovskite on HTLs. Other studies have confirmed that a nonwetting surface suppresses heterogeneous nucleation, thereby resulting in low concentration of nuclei and a larger grain size of the perovskite.  [50] [51] [52]  This will result in more DMSO being trapped at the interface of HTL/perovskite and forming holes during annealing, especially for vacuumquenching.  [53]  Further, perovskite films prepared on nonwetting substrates cannot be filled sufficiently, resulting in large numbers of pinholes, while the introduction of NP-NiO x can alleviate this problem and reduce the nonradiative recombination at defects. On the other hand, from a macroperspective, NP-NiO x improved coverage of perovskite on large-area flexible substrates and prevents the formation of holes. Finally, extra hydroxyl group from NP-NiO x is also beneficial to improve the coverage of SAMs and improve the charge transport at interface. As shown in Figure  S16 , Supporting Information, XRD was used to measure the wet film of perovskite after vacuum-quenching. The prominent characteristic peaks at 14.2°exhibit a stronger signal of αphase perovskite based on modified HTLs, thus confirming more nucleation than that of the reference. Before the fabrication of FPSMs, the uniformity of the largearea FPSCs with or without NP-NiO x was evaluated by dividing a sample with a size of 10 Â 10 cm 2 into 20 smaller 25 Â 16 mm 2 devices (Figure  4a, b ). Each device had six cells, and the PEN/ITO was etched to the same structure as the small-area FPSCs mentioned previously using a 532 nm laser. The 120 cells fabricated with NP-NiO x exhibit highly consistent performance with an average PCE of 20.72% (Figure  4c ), whereas the reference cells exhibit a lower average PCE of 19.1% compared with the modified cells, which is attributed to the decrease in FF (Figure  S17 , Supporting Information). As shown in Figure  4d , large amounts of coffee rings can be observed on the large-area perovskite film without NP-NiO x , which are inhibiting factors for short circuits during the fabrication of FPSMs.  [54]  In addition, Figure  S18 , Supporting Information, shows that the perovskite also has poor coverage at the edges during spin coating, indicating that the uniformity of the two kinds of perovskite has a significant gap, especially in terms of the number of pinholes, which invalidates the cells. Furthermore, the substrate was divided into two areas to investigate the uniformity of the large-area perovskite films at the center and corner (see Figure  S19a , Supporting Information). As shown in Figure  S19b, c , Supporting Information, the absorbance and XRD patterns of the perovskite exhibit a similar trend at the center and corner. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the perovskite based on the reference and modified HTLs are shown in Figure  S20  and S21, Supporting Information, respectively. In Figure  S20 , Supporting Information, the average grain size of the perovskite at the center (454 and 380 nm for the reference and modified devices, respectively) is almost consistent with that at the corner (462 and 377 nm for the reference and modified devices, respectively). The thicknesses of the center and corner perovskites were also uniform, as shown in Figure  S21 , Supporting Information, and several pinholes were discovered at the perovskite/HTL interface with poor contact. In summary, poor wettability leads to a porous perovskite film that exhibits an irregular PCE distribution in the sub-cells. To investigate the photoelectric performance of the large-area FPSMs, a device based on a 10 Â 10 cm 2 PEN/ITO was divided into 15 subcells. The cross-sectional structures of P1, P2, and P3 can be clearly seen in Figure  S22 , Supporting Information; 15 subcells were connected in series. P1, P2, and P3 were etched by a 532 nm laser, and the designated distance between two adjacent P1 was 4.9 mm. As shown in Figure  S22 , Supporting Information, the laser etched areas are referred to as "dead areas", with the width of dead area in our modules being 0.34 mm. The metal electrode was controlled using an evaporation mask, contributing to an 8.5 cm designated length of each sub-cell (the area of each sub-cell was 3.876 cm 2 ), delivering a high geometric fill factor (GFF) of more than 93%. The front and back digital images of the reference and modified FPSMs are shown in Figure  5 . As shown in Figure  5c , the FPSMs with NP-NiO x achieved a champion PCE of 19.71% (I sc = 84.83 mA, V oc = 16.92 V, and FF = 79.82%) under reverse scan and 19.05% (I sc = 84.74 mA, V oc = 16.81 V, and FF = 77.75%) under forward scan on an active area of 58.14 cm 2 . Furthermore, we also obtained a certified PCE of 18.17% (I sc = 89.88 mA, V oc = 17.03 V, and FF = 72.71%) and 17.45% (I sc = 90.81 mA, V oc = 17.07 V, FF = 68.96%) under forward scan for the modified device on the aperture area of 61.26 cm 2 (test mask see Figure  S24 , S32 and S33, Supporting Information), which is the highest record PCE for FPSMs. During maximum power point tracking (MPPT), the certified device maintains a steady-state PCE of 18.33% for 300 s (Figure  S30 , S31, Supporting Information), demonstrating excellent operational stability. However, FPSMs without NP-NiO x achieved a lower champion PCE of 16.85% (I sc = 82.45 mA, V oc = 16.79 V, and FF = 70.77%) under reverse scan, and 14.95% (I sc = 82.31 mA, V oc = 16.50 V, and FF = 64%) under forward scan is obtained on the active area of 58.14 cm 2 , exhibiting obvious hysteresis. A statistical analysis (25 cells) of the photovoltaic parameters for the modules is also shown in Figure  S23 , Table  S3  and S4, Supporting Information, where the average PCE is 15.47% (I sc = 82.11 mA, V oc = 16.44 V, and FF = 66.59%) for the reference devices and 18.34% (I sc = 83.18 mA, V oc = 16.70 V, and FF = 76.73%) for the modified devices. As expected, the NiO x wetting agent played an extremely important role in the fabrication of the FPSMs because it simultaneously improved the interfacial contact and wettability, such that perfectly covered large-area perovskite films could be fabricated on flexible substrates. In contrast, the vacuum-based HTL (SP-NiO x ) and ETL (C 60 /BCP) evenly covered the substrate, which effectively prevented direct contact between the positive and negative electrodes or between the perovskite and electrodes, even though the reference devices with holes could also output power normally. Finally, the average FF of modified devices was considerably higher than that of SP-NiO x -based devices, as expected. For PSCs, a mature encapsulation process not only isolates water vapor away from the solar cells and prevents perovskite degradation due to water but also prevents the leakage of toxic decomposition products such as lead iodide. To date, only a few studies have reported the encapsulation of FPSCs.  [55]  In the present study, the conventional encapsulation structure of flexible CIGS was introduced into the FPSCs encapsulation, and the electrodes were extracted as previously reported.  [56]  Furthermore, see Figure  S25 , Supporting Information, 3 M ultrabarrier solar films were used as a back sheet and a low-temperature cross-linked polyolefin elastomer (POE) was selected as the encapsulant, which could be completely melted at 110 °C and was suitable for FPSCs based on PEN or PET flexible substrates. Three types of samples were chosen to compare the changes in the photovoltaic parameters before and after encapsulation, including the reference and modified devices; the precise data are shown in Table  S5 , Supporting Information. Some characteristics were observed during the encapsulation experiments: the V oc and FF of the freshly encapsulated device were significantly lower than those of the unencapsulated device. In addition, the values of V oc and FF returned to the level before encapsulation or even higher, especially V oc , after standing for a period, which is attributed to the enhanced contact between each functional layer by lamination. A larger module consisting of six mini-modules was encapsulated in parallel. The parallel structure is shown in Figure  S25 , Supporting Information. The encapsulated parallel modules achieved a champion PCE of 17.4% (I sc = 497.11 mA, V oc = 16.66 V, and FF = 73.31%) under reverse scan on the active area of 348.84 cm 2 , as shown in Figure  6a , which is the highest recorded PCE of encapsulated FPSMs over 300 cm 2 (Figure  6c ). Furthermore, Figure  6b  shows the mechanical properties of the encapsulated FPSMs, which were tested via bending experiments, showing that the devices with NP-NiO x maintained 95% of the initial PCE, whereas reference devices only maintained 90% after 1000 cycles under a bending radius of 2 cm (Figure  6e ). The precise data are presented in Table  S6 , Supporting Information. We found that the poor adhesion of the HTL/perovskite leads to a stronger bending resistance of the modified devices than that of the reference devices. A simple experiment was conducted to investigate the differences in the adhesion of HTL/perovskite interfaces. As shown in Movie S3, Supporting Information, the perovskites based on the reference and modified HTLs were pasted together by POE under 110 °C lamination. The results are clearly shown in Figure  6f ; the perovskite without NP-NiO x could be easily stripped from that of the modified perovskite, demonstrating that NP-NiO x enhanced the adhesion between the HTL and perovskite. In addition, see Figure  S26 , Supporting Information, we measured the weight of the FPSMs; the weight of a single 10 Â 10 cm 2 was only 1.7 g. After removing the nonessential area, the weight was reduced to approximately 1.2 g and the power-to-weight ratio increased by more than 900 W kg À1 before encapsulation. The weight of the FPSM after encapsulation was 10 g, which could be further mitigated. We further constructed six large encapsulated modules in a foldable solar power source in parallel, as shown in Figure  S27 , Supporting Information, and an output power approach of 22 W was measured at 58% light intensity (Figure  S28 , Supporting Information). Several encapsulated samples are shown in Figure  S29 , Supporting Information, using which a car and boat could be driven in the sun (Movie S4, Supporting Information). 
 Conclusion In summary, we developed NP-NiO x as a wetting agent for FPSCs to improve the wettability of perovskite precursor solutions on SAMs. The results indicate that NP-NiO x increased the roughness of the substrates and resulted in a decreased contact angle, thereby ensuring uniform coverage of the perovskite without any voids. NP-NiO x reduced pinholes between HTL/perovskite during vacuum-quenching and enhanced the charge extraction and interfacial contact for FPSCs, achieving a champion PCE of 21.97% on an active area of 0.09 cm  2  . In addition, we extended the scale of fabrication, and FPSMs with 15 cells connected in series were prepared on a 10 Â 10 cm 2 PEN/ITO. Benefitting from the pinhole-free perovskite film and vacuum-deposited HTL/ETL, large-area FPSMs achieved PCEs of 19.71% and 18.17% on an active area of 58.14 cm 2 and aperture area of 61.26 cm 2 , respectively, being the highest certified PCE in the aperture area. Furthermore, for the first time, we encapsulated the FPSMs using a traditional method, and the enhanced interfacial contact improved the bending properties of the devices. An assembled FPSM with six mini-modules encapsulated in parallel achieved a PCE of 17.4% on an active area of 348.84 cm 2 , which is the highest recorded PCE for this size. Consequently, our method may provide a new pathway for the commercialization of high-efficient FPSMs.

All chemicals were used without any further purification. Fabrication of FPSCs: In this work, all of PEN/ITO was attached on the glass by OCA and the detail is shown in Movie S1, Supporting Information. Each substrate was etched by 532 nm green laser and washed by ethanol. Before fabrication of HTL, the ITO was treated with UV ozone (UV-O 3 ) for 20 min. The sputtered nickel oxide (SP-NiO x ) with a thickness of 15 nm was sputtered from NiO x target (Plasmaterials, 99.9%) on PEN/ITO substrates with radiofrequency sputtering at room temperature in pure Ar 2 atmosphere. The base pressure was <5 Â 10 À4 Pa and sputtering power was 90 W. For the reference sample, a concentration of 1 mmol SAMs (2PACz/MeO-2PACz molar ratio was 3:1) dissolved in ethanol was spin-coated on SP-NiO x at 4000 rpm for 15 s and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min in a dry atmosphere (10%-20% RH). For the modified sample, a layer of nickel oxide nanoparticle (NP-NiO x ) was introduced as wetting agent between SP-NiO x and SAMs. Different concentration of NP-NiO x (5, 10, 20 mg mL À1 in DI water) was spin-coated on SP-NiO x at 4000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 120 °C for 10 min in the atmosphere. The preparation process of SAMs on SP-NP-NiO x was the same as reference sample. For the fabrication of perovskite, the (CsPbI 3 ) 0.13 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.02 precursor solution was prepared in 1.2 M in the mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (DMF: DMSO = 870:130, volume ratio), and 16 mol% MACl was added additionally to solution. The perovskite layer was prepared by vacuum-quenching through a solution method. The solution was stirred for 2 h and spin-coated onto SAMs layer at 1000 rpm for 5 s (acc. 200 rpm) followed by 4000 rpm for 7 s (acc. 1500 rpm), then wet film was transferred into a small stainless-steel chamber (diameter: 8 cm, height:1 cm) connected to mechanical and roots pump. The valve of the pump was subsequently opened, and the pressure of the chamber was rapidly dropped to 5 Pa. The color of the wet film changed from yellow to brown when it transformed into intermediate-phase perovskite films in 8 s at 22-23 °C, shown in Movie S2, Supporting Information. Afterward, the film was annealed at 120 °C for 20 min. When it cooled down to room temperature, the passivation layer was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 4000 rpm for 30 s using an IPA solution which dissolving 3 mg PEAI 1 mL IPA. Finally, C 60 (20 nm), BCP (5 nm), and Au (80 nm) were thermally evaporated sequentially in a vacuum chamber (<5 Â 10 À4 Pa). Fabrication of FPSMs: For the 10 Â 10 cm 2 FPSMs, the HTL, perovskite, and ETL layers were prepared by the same method as small-area FPSCs. P1 with a line width of 120 μm, P2 with a line width of 100 μm, and P3 with a line width of 120 μm were etched by the 532 nm green laser. In addition, a larger stainless-steel chamber (diameter: 15 cm, height:8 cm) was used for vacuum-quenching in fabrication of large-area perovskite and the wet film of perovskite transformed into intermediate-phase perovskite films in 20 s at 22-23 °C. The width of dead-area was 0.34 mm and modules fabricated on 10 Â 10 cm 2 FPSMs with an active area of 58.14 cm 2 contain 15 series connected cells and a high GFF of 93% was achieved. Encapsulation of FPSMs: Before encapsulation, conductive ribbon was adhered at the positive and negative electrodes of devices. FPSMs were covered double-sidely with 100 μm POE and ultrabarrier solar films were transferred into laminating machine, the vacuuming time was 120 s, and the lamination time was 180 s. The encapsulation procedure lasted for 5 min at 110 °C and the vacuum pressure was kept at 0.01 Pa. Characterization: Contact angle measurements were used an optical contact angle and drop contour analyzer (DataPhysics Instruments GmbH, OCA 200). And Keysight Technologies 7500 (AFM) was used to obtain surface RMS roughness. The component and work function of NiO x were measured by XPS and UPS (Thermo Scientific EscaLab 250Xi). The XRD spectra were obtained using a D/max 2500 PC X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (Rigaku Corporation). The SEM images were obtained by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (S-4800. Hitachi Corporation). UV-vis spectra were obtained by a UV-2600 spectrometer (Shimadzu Corporation). The J-V curves were measured by a Keithley 2400 source and the solar simulator with standard AM1.5 G (Newport Oriel 94043A, USA, AM1.5, 100 mW cm À2 ). The light intensity was calibrated by applying an Si reference cell (PVM 900, 2 Â 2 Si BK7 window, M factor = 0.9398); PL (excitation at 520 nm) and TRPL characteristics were obtained using FLS980 (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation under dark condition.
