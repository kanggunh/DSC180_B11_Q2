Title: Simultaneous realization of bulk and interface regulation based on 2,4-diamino-6,7diisopropylpteridine phosphate for efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells †
Due to strict restrictions on the solubility and solvent choice, it is challenging to achieve an efficient solution-processed cathode interface material for inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a simple and facile solution-processed interface strategy is proposed based on 2,4-diamino-6,7diisopropylpteridine phosphate (DPP) to overcome bulk and interface recombination loss issues in inverted PSCs. The performances of the materials, interfaces, and the devices were systemically investigated. The results show that DPP exists at the fullerene/cathode interface and also diffuses throughout the whole perovskite/fullerene heterojunction, which results in the simultaneous realization of bulk and interface regulation. The interface energy mismatch between the (6,6)-phenyl-C 61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and Ag interface, the defect-assisted recombination energy loss, and the residual stress of the perovskite film are all improved by DPP introduction. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices with DPP is enhanced by 33.49% compared to that of the control devices without DPP. The highest PCE of 20.17% and a hysteresis index of 1.80% were achieved with DPP, which is superior to that of the devices with a conventional bathocuproine (BCP) cathode interface layer. Owing to the DPP introduction, the thermal stability (85 °C in N 2 ) is greatly enhanced and T 80 (the time required for the PCE decay to 80% of its initial value) reaches up to 247 h, while T 80 of the control devices is only 14 h. This work provides an extremely simple and unique strategy to simultaneously realize bulk and interface regulation with only one material for the construction of efficient and stable inverted PSCs.
Introduction The energy crisis and environmental problems are posing a serious threat to human survival.  1  Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the most valuable photovoltaic technology because of their high efficiency and low cost.  2  Usually, PSCs can be divided into regular forward (n-i-p) and inverted (p-i-n) PSCs according to the device conguration.  3  Inverted PSCs have more advantages than regular forward ones, such as their low-temperature processability, high-power density, low hysteresis, and easy fabrication.  4  Inverted PSCs are the most promising device type in the eld of wearable electronics, tandem solar cells, and ultra-lightweight electronic devices.  4  In addition, this type of device has more potential in stability because it can avoid using the hole transport layer, 2,2 ′ ,7,7 ′ -tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9 ′ -spirobiuorene (spiro-MeTAD), which needs hygroscopic dopants, such as lithium bis(uorosulfonyl) imide (LiFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP).  5, 6  Although a breakthrough in efficiency has been made based on the selfassembled monolayers (SAMs),  2, [7] [8] [9]  there are more serious recombination energy losses in inverted PSCs compared to regular forward PSCs,  10, 11  especially for the inverted PSCs based on the all-solution-processed perovskite/fullerene heterojunction.  5, 12  It is inevitable to form a large number of defects at the grain boundaries (GBs) and grain surfaces of polycrystalline perovskite layers because of the fast crystallization rate and complex solvent atmosphere in a low-temperature solution process.  13, 14  These defects act as non-radiative recombination centers and signicantly impact the photogenerated carrier transfer and extraction in the device and thus reduce the device efficiency.  [15] [16] [17]  In order to suppress GBs and surface defects, several strategies have been used, such as the development of single-crystal PSCs,  18  increase of grain size,  19  and passivation strategy.  20, 21  However, single-crystal PSCs cannot be used in large-scale production because their crystal thickness is not easy to control  18  and the device process compatibility is poor.  22  The atmosphere/solvent annealing,  23, 24  crystallization control,  25  and chemical engineering  26  have also been applied to enhance the grain size and crystallinity of the perovskite lm, thus reducing the number of GBs and defects in the perovskite lm. Unfortunately, these strategies still cannot solve the problems of GBs itself. Compared with the above strategies, the defect passivation strategy seems to have more potential because it can passivate perovskite defects by additives or surface modication without complicating the device fabrication process. Since the J. Huang group used fullerene as a passivator to passivate defects of the PSCs for the rst time,  27  there are many materials that have been used as a passivator to do that, such as small organic molecules,  21, 28, 29  polymers,  13  ammonium salt,  30  ionic liquid,  31  insulating material  32, 33  and others. However, many passivation strategies are based on the surface treatment process, where it is still challenging to realize the defects passivation from the top to bottom of the perovskite lm.  34  Furthermore, it is difficult for the defects passivation strategy to be effective for two or more kinds of defects.  34  Thus, there are also bottlenecks in improving device performance when only relying on the simple passivation strategy.  30, 34  Besides the recombination energy loss led by defects, the imperfect interface contact is also the main factor limiting the performance of the inverted PSCs.  11  In the inverted PSCs, fullerene (such as C 60 and [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)) is widely used as ETL because of its excellent electron mobility and suitable energy level.  35  The inverted PSCs based on evaporated C 60 ETL have achieved high performance.  36  However, the performance of the inverted PSCs based on solution-processed PCBM ETL favored by industrialization is still not satisfactory.  21, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45]  The imperfect lm-forming property of PCBM from the low viscosity and easy agglomeration of the PCBM molecule may result in the perovskite lm not being fully covered by PCBM, which leads to the PCBM thin lm not effectively acting as an ETL and barrier layer for ion migration/ element diffusion.  5  Thus, the inverted PSCs show relatively low PCE, 6 obvious electrode corrosion, 3 and quick degradation.  46  In addition, the energy barrier between PCBM and the Ag cathode can lead to carrier accumulation and recombination.  5, 12, 42  In particular, the work function of the Ag electrode will change from 4.3 eV to 5.0 eV aer being oxidized or corroded in air,  47  which makes the interface energy mismatch problem become increasingly serious during device operation. The interface modication strategy is widely used to overcome the problem of the PCBM/Ag interface. Many materials, such as metal oxide, 48 metal (Ca 49 ), bathocuproine (BCP), 21 poly(9,9-bis(3 ′ -(N,Ndimethyl)-N-ethylammonium-propyl-2,7-uorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctyluorene))dibromide (PFN-Br)  39  and others, have been used as an interface modication layer inserted into the interface of PCBM/Ag, and achieved a positive effect on the device performance and stability. It is worth mentioning that the inverted PSCs with excellent performance and stability are almost prepared with the evaporation interface.  6, 28, 36, 50  Due to the strict restrictions on the solubility and solvent system, it is still challenging to achieve an efficient solution-processed interface layer at the PCBM/Ag interface.  41  Moreover, the residual stress may lead to the lattice distortion of the perovskite crystal microstructure, and it is directly relevant to the defects concentration and recombination energy loss.  51  In addition, the residual stress will reduce the active energy of ion migration, and correspondingly accelerates degradation of the perovskite lm.  52  Solving the recombination energy loss and interface regulation with a solution-processed modication layer will be of great signicance to the industrialization of the inverted devices. So far, there are few reports on the dual improvement of device performance and stability through the simultaneous realization of bulk and interface regulation via one material. Herein, a simple and facile solution-processed interface is proposed based on 2,4-diamino-6,7-diisopropylpteridine phosphate (DPP) to overcome the bulk and interface issues of inverted PSCs. The DPP exists at the interface of the fullerene/cathode interface, and also diffuse throughout the whole perovskite/ fullerene heterojunction, which results in the simultaneous realization of interface regulation and passivation by one material layer. Beneting from the interface contact regulation, defects passivation, additional interface electrical eld building, as well as the residual stress release, the performance and stability of the inverted PSCs have greatly improved. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices with DPP is enhanced by 33.49% compared with that of the control devices. Furthermore, the highest PCE of 20.17% and lower hysteresis index (HI) of 1.8% have been achieved with DPP. The stability of the devices has also been greatly enhanced.

The other solvents and materials were all bought from domestic companies without further purication. 
 Device fabrication The patterned ITO substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in the detergent, and then separately in distilled water and IPA for 25 min. They were dried with hot air and treated with UV-ozone for 25 min, and then transferred to a nitrogen glove box. The PTAA solution (4 mg mL -1 in toluene) was deposited upon the ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min as the hole transport layer. Then, perovskite thin lms were prepared by the improved two-step method, according to our previous work.  21  The perovskite seed precursor (1.2 M PbI 2 and 0.2 M MAI dissolved in a mixed solvent of 900 mL DMF and 100 mL DMSO) was rst spin-coated on ITO/PTAA at 6000 rpm for 20 s, and the MAI solution (40 mg mL -1 in IPA) was quickly dropped onto the center of the substrate at 4000 rpm for 40 s. The wet perovskite lms were annealed at 100 °C for 30 min to form MAPbI 3 crystal lms. Aer that, the PCBM solution (20 mg mL -1 in CB) was spin-coated on the top of the MAPbI 3 lm and annealed at 90 °C for 30 min as the electron transport layer (ETL). For the DPP-modied devices, the DPP IPA solutions with different concentrations were spin-coated on PCBM at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and annealed at 90 °C for 10 min. Finally, the strip Ag cathode (∼100 nm) was deposited via thermal evaporation (0.5 Å s -1 ) under a vacuum of 3 × 10 -4 Pa. The active area of the device is 0.04 cm  2  . 
 Materials and devices characterization The rst-principles calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP), according to previous work.  53  The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) characterization of the thin lms was performed using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a UV photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientic, ESCALAB 250xi, USA). The binding energy values for all spectra were calibrated using the C 1s peak (284.8 eV) as a reference. The surface morphology and cross-sectional morphology of the perovskite lms or devices were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) (FEI, Helios Nanolab 600i, USA) and atomic force microscope (AFM) (Bruker, Multimode 8, Germany). The surface potential of the lms was monitored by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) with tapping mode (Bruker, Multimode 8, Germany). The absorption property of the lms was analyzed by an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 365, USA). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were measured using an XRD test instrument (Bruker, D8 Advance, Germany) with a Cu Ka radiation source under 40 kV and 44 mA. The grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) characterization was performed using a ve-axis X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, SmartLab, Japan) at 45 kV and 200 mA, equipped with Cu Ka radiation (l = 1.54050 Å), parallel beam optics, and a secondary graphite monochromator. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected by the FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scientic, Nicolet 6700, USA). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were measured using a uorescence spectrophotometer (PicoQuant, FluoTime300, Germany). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained with the electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, China) at 0.85 V in the dark. The DPP diffusion behavior was detected by time-of-ight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) (ION-TOF, TOF SIMS 5, Germany) with a sputter energy of 1 keV. The J-V curves of PSCs were measured using a source meter under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm -2 with the solar simulator (AAA, Enlitech, SS-F5-3A, Taiwan). The light intensity was calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was tested by a QE test system (Enlitech, QE-R, Taiwan). The transient photocurrents (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) of the PSCs were measured by a photoelectrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium pro, Germany). 
 Results and discussion The DPP molecular and surface potential maps are shown in Fig.  1a . DPP has many positive charge domains and negative charge domains, which can act as Lewis acid-base anchors  54  to passivate the positive and negative charged trap states like the schematic of the interaction between DPP and MAPbI 3 , as shown in Fig.  1a . Meanwhile, the molecular dipole moment is 4.41 Debye, which makes the DPP molecule have the potential to form the interface dipole by arrangement on the perovskite/ fullerene heterojunction layer. The DPP is a small molecule that has relatively high mobility. Thus, DPP may exist upon the surface of the PCBM and it will penetrate PCBM into GBs of the perovskite layer, as shown in the schematic diagram of the inverted device based on the DPP modication in Fig.  1a . Therefore, it is expected to achieve the multiple effects of interface modication, PCBM hole lling, GBs modication, and defect passivation. To demonstrate the above estimation, the ToF-SIMS depth prole of the DPP device is detected and the result is shown in Fig.  1b . The P, Pb, I and I elements distribution also are visualized in Fig.  S1 (ESI † ). The P element of the DPP is enriched on the surface of PCBM and spread throughout PCBM, and also exists in the MAPbI 3 lms from bottom to top. From Fig.  1b  and S1, † it is directly conrmed that DPP is not only in the surface of PCBM, but also in the MAPbI 3 /PCBM planar heterojunction. The reasonable longitudinal distribution of DPP in the device will provide a prerequisite for the multi-function of DPP in the device. The energy level of interface material plays a very important role for the efficiency of the charge interfacial transfer and extraction.  5  The UPS of the DPP lms is excited by ultraviolet light with an energy value of 21.2 eV, and the results are show in Fig.  1c  and d . The Femi level of the UPS spectra is xed at 0 eV, and the work function of the DPP lm is calculated to be -3.22 eV based on the cut-off regions of the UPS (Fig.  1c ). The optical band gap usually can be approximately used as the width of the band gap, so that the energy level structure of DPP can be determined based on the work function and optical band gap of the material. As shown in Fig.  1d , the bandgap of the DPP derived from Tauc equation (ahn = A(hn -E g ) 1/2 ) 55 is about 3.30 eV based on the UV-vis absorption spectrum. Thus, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of DPP can be calculated to be -3.0 eV and -6.3 eV (Fig.  S2 , ESI †), respectively. Thus, the DPP materials show N-type characteristics and a suitable energy level, which means that DPP can act as an efficient ETL. Based on each layer's energy level, the energy level diagram of the inverted PSCs with DPP are given in Fig.  1e . The LUMO of the DPP materials is -3.0 eV, which is much higher than that of PCBM (-4.3 eV). Thus, the DPP insertion between the Ag cathode and PCBM can reduce the work function of the Ag cathode. This results in the favorable Fermi level pining between Ag/DPP and PCBM, and formation of the ohmic contact at the cathode interface according to the "Mark of Zorro" dependence.  56  In addition, the HOMO of DPP (-6.3 eV) is deeper than that of PCBM (-6.0 eV), which leads to DPP having more potential to act as an efficient hole blocking layer, so as to make up for the insufficient hole blocking ability of the PCBM ETL.  57  Thus, the energy level of DPP shows that DPP is a promising ETL material to enhance the interface contact and reduce the nonradiative recombination energy loss at the PCBM/Ag cathode interface. From the ToF-SIMS analysis, DPP can diffuse into the perovskite layer and may react with the perovskite. In order to evaluate the effect of the DPP introduction on the crystal phase and absorption properties of the perovskite lm, UV-vis and XRD analyses were carried out and the results are shown in Fig.  1f  and g , respectively. The UV-vis spectra of the MAPbI 3 / PCBM/DPP lm are the same as that of the MAPbI 3 /PCBM lm. In addition, three main peaks at around 2q = 14°, 29°, and 32°are observed in both kinds of lms, which correspond to the (110), (220), and (310) planes of the cubic perovskite structure,  21  and no other new peaks appear. The UV-vis and XRD results show that the DPP introduction cannot change the absorption and crystal phase of the perovskite lm. The intensity enhancement and full width at half maxima (FWHM) reduction of the (110) XRD peak also show that the crystallinity of the perovskite crystal is improved with DPP introduction.  Furthermore, the crystal becomes more oriented because the intensity ratio of the (  110 ) and (220) planes of the perovskite is increased from 1.47 to 1.58 aer DPP introduction. This change may have resulted from the secondary grain growth via DPP post-treatment, like that for N-benzyloxycarbonyl-D-valine.  21  A better crystallinity and crystal orientation will be benecial toward achieving a more efficient device.  59, 60  The more interesting change is that the (110) XRD peak of the perovskite lm shis from 14.53°to 14.44°aer reacting with DPP, which is visualized in Fig.  1h . That XRD peak shi conrmed that there is a strong interaction between DPP and MAPbI 3 . That reaction was also further studied via XPS. The high-resolution XPS characterization of I 3d, Pb 4f, as well as N 1s was performed (Fig.  2a  and b ). The XPS peaks at binding energies of 618.35, 629.84 eV, 138.47 eV and 143.28 eV correspond to I 3d 5/2 , I 3d 3/2 , Pb 4f 7/2 and Pb 4f 5/2 , respectively.  21  The I 3d 5/2 (618.89 eV) and I 3d 3/2 (630.44 eV) XPS peaks shi to high binding energy aer DPP introduction, while the Pb 4f 7/2 (138.18 eV) and Pb 4f 5/2 (143.05 eV) peaks shi toward lower binding energy. That peak shi means that the electron cloud is more enriched around the Pb atom and the electron cloud around the I atom is pulled away, which may result from the uncoordinated lead and suspended halide dangling bonds being passivated by charge compensation via DPP.  61  In addition, the N 1s peak of the MAPbI 3 lm (401.48 eV) obviously shis toward a lower binding energy of 399.48 eV aer DPP introduction (Fig.  S3a  †), indicating that there is also a strong reactive between DPP with MA + of the perovskite.  61  In view of the fact that most of the DPP molecules exist at the interface between PCBM and Ag, the interactions between DPP and Ag, DPP and PCBM were characterized by XPS and FTIR. To investigate the DPP reaction with Ag, the DPP lm is rst prepared, and the very thin Ag lm is then deposited upon the DPP lm by thermal evaporation for XPS measurement. From Fig.  S3b , † the Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 peaks of the Ag lm appear at 368.85 eV and 374.85 eV, respectively.  62  However, for the DPP/ Ag lm, the Ag 3d 5/2 (367.78 eV) and Ag 3d 3/2 (373.77 eV) peaks shi toward lower binding energy, indicating that the electron cloud accumulates around the Ag atom. This reaction between Ag and DPP may enhance the stability of the Ag lm from oxidation or corrosion, and also benet the charge transfer at the cathode interface. In addition, the FTIR spectra of the PCBM, DPP, and PCBM/DPP are measured to investigate the reaction between DPP and PCBM, and the results are shown in Fig.  2c  and d   respectively, which shi to 1731 cm -1 and 1062 cm -1 aer the DPP introduction. These peak shis conrm the interaction between PCBM and DPP, which may benet the defect passivation for the PCBM lm and enhance the interface contact of PCBM/DPP. The above statements conrm that the DPP interface introduction can form a good cathode interface contact through the interaction between DPP with its upper and lower layers, which will benet the interface charge transfer and extraction. The defects passivation has a signicant impact on the performance of the perovskite lm. Thus, to gain more information about the defect passivation by the reaction between DPP and MAPbI 3 , rst-principles calculations were carried out. According to previous study, there are defects including halide dangling bonds (such as MA + vacancy or I interstitial (I i )) and lead defects (undercoordinated lead (I -vacancy) or Pb interstitial (Pb i )) that have a relatively small formation energy in perovskite lms.  64  To simplify the calculation, we choose the Pb i and I i defects as representatives of the defects to investigate the DPP passivation effect.  64  Fig.  2e  and f  show the differential charge density of the DPP molecule absorbed on the I i and Pb i defects of the MAPbI 3 surface, respectively. The yellow domain and the light blue domain represent the charge enrichment or depletion region, respectively.  65  The differential charge density area is spread into the perovskite crystals regardless of whether the I i or Pb i defects are absorbed by DPP, which shows that there are indeed strong reactions between DPP and MAPbI 3 . In particular, the obvious depletion region is observed around the I i (Fig.  2e ), and the obvious charge enrichment area appears around the Pb i defects (Fig.  2f ). This shows that the negatively charged I i and positively charged Pb i defects can be well passivated by DPP through electrical interaction. The density of states (DOS) is calculated to directly evaluate the dual passivation mechanism of DPP for positive and negative charged traps. The DOS of the two typical defects was obtained with lower forming energy, negatively charged I i , and positively charged Pb i, and the results are shown in Fig.  2g  and h , respectively. The I i defect introduces a bandgap state around in 0-0.8 eV below LUMO, while these trap states are passivated aerward with DPP introduction. Pb i can introduce two deep trap states near the LUMO and HOMO of the perovskite. These bandgap trap states are also eliminated with DPP introduction. The elimination of these two kinds of defects indicates that the negatively charged and positively charged perovskite can be passivated by the corresponding function passivation group of DPP, which may enhance the V oc by expanding the band gap of the perovskite and suppressing the non-radiative recombination energy loss. The formation energy of the trap states was also calculated to conrm the DPP passivation function. The obviously low formation energy of Pb i and I i aer DPP absorption upon MAPbI 3 suggests that DPP can hinder the formation of defects and stabilize the surface structure of perovskite crystals. The formation energy of MA and I vacancy defects has also been calculated to further conrm the passivation of DPP, and the results are shown in Fig.  S4 . † The formation energy of the unmodied perovskite surface MA and I vacancy are 3.76 eV and 1.95 eV, respectively. Aer the perovskite surface was modied by DPP, the formation energies of MA and I vacancy were promoted by twice as much. Thus, the above statements strongly support the point of DPP having a good function of surface defect passivation. In order to study the DPP impact on the micro-morphology of the thin lm, AFM and SEM were carried out. Fig.  3a  and b are the AFM and SEM of the control lms of ITO/PTAA/ MAPbI 3 /PCBM. There are some holes labeled with yellow virtual coil (Fig.  3a ) that are observed, which are attributed to the aggregation of the PCBM molecule for its low viscosity and spherical molecular structure.  66  These PCBM defects may result in a short circuit in the devices and serious recombination energy loss at the MAPbI 3 /PCBM interface or in bulk of PCBM.  5, 66  Fig.  3b  shows the typical micro-morphology of the MAPbI 3 lms. The stone-like perovskite grains are closely arranged upon the ITO/PTAA surface. Fig.  3c  and d  shows the AFM and SEM of the lm of ITO/PTAA/MAPbI 3 /PCBM/DPP. Compared with the AFM characterization of the control lm, the PCBM is fully and uniformly covered by the DPP molecule, and the hole of the PCBM is lled by DPP. This can be attributed to DPP diffusing into PCBM, and thus improving the coverage and quality of the PCBM layer. It also seems that there are very clearly visible GBs in Fig.  3b  for the control lm, while it is less clear with DPP introduction. The lack of clarity with the GBs may be related to the GBs being lled and modied by DPP. To further prove that, the cross-sectional SEM characterization of the devices with the structure of ITO/PTAA/MAPbI 3 /PCBM/Ag (named "control devices") and ITO/PTAA/MAPbI 3 /PCBM/DPP/ Ag (named "DPP device") was conducted. Both devices have a clear layered structure, and the boundaries of the interface can be distinguished (Fig.  3e  and f ). Many small MAPbI 3 crystals and many transverse GBs parallel to the substrate are observed at the control devices (Fig.  3e ). Aer DPP introduction, the number of the GBs is reduced and the GBs cannot be distinguished well, which is consistent with the results observed by the top-view SEM (Fig.  3f ). The cross-sectional SEM shows that a single crystal can penetrate the whole perovskite active layer lm, which may be due to the introduction of DPP to induce the secondary growth of perovskite crystals according to the XRD analysis results (Fig.  1g ). The reduction of the transverse GBs is benecial to the charge transfer, and correspondingly reduced the recombination energy loss.  19  The improvement of the micro-morphology of the cross-section suggests that DPP can penetrate through the PCBM lm into the perovskite lm, and thus lead to the improvement of the GBs, crystallinity, as well as the quality of the PCBM layer. According to the XRD and SEM results, the further growth of the MAPbI 3 crystal is conrmed. This secondary crystal growth may reduce the surface residual stress according to previous work,  67  and the depth-resolved grazing incident XRD (GIXRD) with the 2q sin 2 f method is used here to conrm that the DPP impacts the residual stresses of the perovskite lm.  67  In the 2q sin 2 f method, the q and f terms represent the diffraction and tilting angles, respectively. Among the XRD diffraction of the MAPbI 3 crystal plane, we chose to investigate the (220) plane (2q = 28.4°). From Fig.  3g  and h, the XRD diffraction peak shi of the perovskite lm with DPP is more obvious than the control one without DPP. The linear relationship of the 2f with sin 2 f is shown in Fig.  3i . The positive slopes for both kinds of lms show the perovskite lms subject to the compressive stress, which is similar to the result of the previous work reported by J. Li.  68  The smaller slope corresponds to the smaller residual stress in the lm. Thus, the residual stress of the perovskite lm also can be reduced by the DPP modication, and the perovskite lm with DPP bears a slighter compressive strain. Therefore, DPP has the potential to enhance the PCE and stability of the PSCs via stress release. The effects of DPP on the surface potential of PCBM are investigated using the KPFM method. Fig.  4a  and b  shows the surface potential maps of the ITO/PTAA/MAPbI 3 /PCBM and ITO/PTAA/MAPbI 3 /PCBM/DPP lms, and the corresponding cross-sectional KPFM prole of the lms, along with the white line present in the bottom half of the picture. The average surface potentials are -477 mV and -290 mV for the PCBM and PCBM/DPP lms, respectively, and the vibration of the surface potential has also been reduced. The change of the surface potential of PCBM has reached up to 187 mV before and aer DPP introduction. This surface potential change may be ascribed to the lower work function of the DPP, and it is also attributed to the interface dipole formation because of the relatively higher molecular dipole moment of DPP. The obvious surface potential change will greatly inuence the interface charge transport dynamic process and recombination of the devices.  30  The PL and TRPL spectra were carried out to obtain more information about the DPP impact on the interfacial charge transfer and recombination of the devices. Fig.  4c  is the PL spectra of the quartz/MAPbI 3 , quartz/MAPbI 3 /PCBM and quartz/MAPbI 3 /PCBM/DPP lms. The strong PL quenching is observed aer PCBM capping of the MAPbI 3 lm, which shows that efficient charge transfer between MAPbI 3 and PCBM has occurred. Aer DPP introduction, it is clearly seen that there is more efficient PL quenching that happened and the PL peaks of the MAPbI 3 /PCBM/DPP lm disappeared. Thus, the interface charge transfer of MAPbI 3 /PCBM is signicantly enhanced by DPP modication. Fig.  3d  is the TRPL of the quartz/MAPbI 3 , quartz/MAPbI 3 /PCBM and quartz/MAPbI 3 /PCBM/DPP lms. The PL decay curves can be well tted by the bi-exponential function (eqn (1)),  30  and the tting results are summarized in Table  S1  (ESI †). where A 1 and A 2 are the constant coefficients; and s 1 and s 2 are the lifetimes of the fast and slow decays of PL, respectively. The PL average lifetime (s avg ) of the lm is used to comprehensively describe the fast and slow decays of the lm.  69  The fast decay usually corresponds to the charge transfer between the perovskite and ETL, and the slow decay corresponds to the recombination energy loss in the bulk perovskite lm.  13  The s avg of the perovskite lm is 178.83 ns, while the fast decay is dominant in the PL decay process aer the formation of the MAPbI 3 /PCBM heterojunction. Aer the DPP introduction, the fast decay ratio (A 1 ) is up to 99.74% and the s avg is only 2.38 ns, which is superior to that of the control MAPbI 3 /PCBM heterojunction without DPP introduction (A 1 = 97.50% and s avg = 2.67 ns). The above results conrm that the interface charge transfer and recombination issues all improved with DPP. This enhancement can be ascribed to the improvement of the PCBM coverage and passivation of its defects, leading to higher cathode interface contact and efficient interface charge transfer. Otherwise, the DPP can diffuse into the bulk of the MAPbI 3 lm and passivates its GBs and grain surface defects, which can improve the quality of the perovskite lm as well as electron charge transport, resulting in enhanced charge transfer in the MAPbI 3 / PCBM heterojunction. The charge transfer process in the control and DPP devices was also investigated by transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC). The average photovoltage decay time and photocarrier transit time can be calculated based on the TPV and TPC curves based on eqn (1). The photovoltage decay time in the DPP devices is 0.368 ms, which is longer than that of the control devices (0.023 ms) by one order of magnitude. Meanwhile, the photocarrier transit time of the DPP device (8.43 ms) is shorter than that of the control device of 14.57 ms. The TPV and TPC can reect the dynamic charge transfer and extraction behavior, and supply the recombination energy loss information in the devices.  70  The prolonged lifetime of the photovoltage with reduction lifetime of the photocurrent suggests that with the slower recombination kinetics, there is less energy loss and more efficient charge extraction by the DPP introduction.  62  The electronic coupling between the perovskite and PCBM layers, as well as the defects elimination by DPP, may be the reason for the above improvement. Y ¼ A 1 exp Àt s 1 þ A 2 exp Àt s 2 (1) To directly demonstrate the positive inuence of DPP on the device performance, the inverted PSCs with and without DPP were prepared, and the J-V characteristics of the devices were tested under illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm -2 ). The DPP interlayer can be deposited upon the MAPbI 3 /PCBM heterojunction via solution process, and the thickness of the DPP is controlled via the concentration of the DPP. We rstly optimized the concentration of the DPP. As shown in Table  1 , the best PCE is achieved at the DPP concentration of 0.3 mg mL -1 . Thus, we used this optimal DPP concentration to prepare the device for a more comparative study. The J-V curves of the best control and DPP device are shown in Fig.  4a , and the average of the parameters are summarized in Table  1 . The control devices exhibit the average PCE of 14.63%, with an average open-circuit voltage (V oc ) of 1.091 V, short-circuit current density (J sc ) of 21.08 mA cm -2 and ll factor (FF) of 63.63%. Aer DPP introduction, the performance parameters of the device were comprehensively improved. The average PCE of 19.53% with an average V oc of 1.105 V, J sc of 22.21 and FF of 79.42% are achieved. It is worth noting that the best control device has a PCE of 15.30%, while the J-V curve shows an obvious "S" shape. The S-shaped characteristic of the J-V curve shows that there is a large interface barrier at the interface between PCBM and Ag, which has also been reported by many other groups.  43, 71, 72  The interface barrier will inevitably cause carriers to accumulate at the interface, resulting in serious recombination energy loss and lower J sc and FF values for the device. The exciting thing is that the S-shaped characteristic of the devices disappear with the DPP interlayer introduction, and the best DPP devices show a relatively higher PCE of 20.17% (Fig.  4a , Table  1 ), which is enhanced by 31.83% compared with that of the control one. The FF is also enhanced by 24.82%, which further conrms that the resistance of the interface charge transfer is greatly reduced. It is well known that BCP is widely used in inverted PSCs as ETL. Thus, the inverted PSCs based on the BCP electron transport layer, with the structure of ITO/PTAA/MAPbI 3 /PCBM/BCP/Ag, were prepared for comparison. The typical J-V curves of the BCP device and DPP device are shown in Fig.  S5 , † and the performance parameters are summarized in Table  S2  (ESI †) based on 10 individual devices. The result shows that the J-V characteristics of the DPP devices are superior to that of the BCP devices (Fig.  S5 † ). The BCP devices exhibit an average PCE of 18.40%, with an average V oc of 1.092 V, J sc of 21.66 mA cm -2 and FF of 77.76%, which is similar to previous reports.  73, 74  For the DPP devices, all of the performance parameters have been enhanced with the DPP replacement of BCP (Table  S2  †). Therefore, the performance of the DPP devices has advantages over that of the BCP devices. The EQE spectra of the typical control and DPP devices were also measured (Fig.  5b ). The EQE is enhanced in the full detected band range, and the calculated J sc values are 20.11 mA cm -2 and 19.54 mA cm -2 for the DPP and control devices, respectively, which is consistent with the trend of the increase in J sc . The J sc enhancement may be attributed to the improvement of the light harvest efficiency, the charged transfer, and extraction efficiency. The rst possible reason is that the optical path difference between the incident light and reected light by Ag mirror may be inuenced by the DPP interface, which will change the optical eld regulation of the device, and thus enhance the light harvest efficiency.  75  In addition, DPP serves as an efficient passivator, efficient interface regulator, as well as an efficient residual stress releasing agent, which can promote the efficiency of the carrier transmission and extraction in the device. In order to conrm the performance enhancement by DPP, the stable output PCE (PCE mpp ) and current density (J mpp ) of the devices operate at the maximum power output point (MPP) are measured under continuous illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm -2 ). The PCE mpp and J mpp of the DPP device are ∼20% and 20 mA cm -2 , respectively, which is higher than that of the control device (PCE mpp ∼ 14% and J mpp ∼ 18 mA cm -2 ) (Fig.  5c ). In addition, the control device shows a slow decay operation at MPP for 1800 s, while that decay is not observed in  the DPP devices. The hysteresis effect of the devices will lead to misjudgment of the device performance.  19  Fig.  5d  is the J-V curves of the control and DPP devices based on different scan directions, and the results are summarized in Table  S3  (ESI †). The hysteresis indexes (HI) are also calculated according to eqn (2). 3 HI ¼ PCE À À PCE þ PCE À þ PCE þ (2) Here, PCE + and PCE -are the PCE obtained under the forward and reverse scan directions, respectively. The calculated HI of the control and DPP device are 5% and 1.8%, respectively. The hysteresis is mainly caused by the defects and ion migration in the devices according to previous reports.  72  Thus, the hysteresis improvement can be attributed to the reduction of the residual stress, elimination of the defects, as well as suppression of the ion migration.   76  The devices with the structure of ITO/ MeO-2PACz/Cs 0.15 FA 0.85 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 /PCBM/Ag were also prepared as a reference. The J-V curves of the typical devices are presented in Fig.  S6 , † and the performance parameters are summarized in Table  S4  † based on 10 individual devices. From Fig.  S6 , † there is also an obvious "S" shape in the J-V curves of the control device without DPP, which conrmed that the cathode interface barrier is ubiquitous in the inverted PSCs. The "S" shape of the J-V curves disappears with the DPP introduction (Fig.  S6 † ), and the average PCE of the devices is increased from 13.82% to 20.50%. All of the performance parameters are enhanced with DPP introduction (Table  S4  †). The improvement trend is the same as in the inverted PSCs based on the MAPbI 3 perovskite compositions. Thus, it can be reasonably inferred that this strategy has a certain degree of universality in different perovskite compositions. To further investigate the improvement of the devices, the EIS, space-charge limited current (SCLC), V oc light intensitydependent measurement, as well as Mott-Schottky analysis were carried out. The EIS data are obtained under the dark condition with a bias of 0.85 V, and the results are shown in Fig.  5f . The EIS curves exhibit two arc semicircles, and that can be well tted using the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig.  5f . The tted results are summarized in Table  S5 . † The R s is the series resistance from the wire and electrode; R rec is the recombination resistance of the device; the CPE1 is the interface capacitance; CPE2 is the capacitance of the bulk perovskite lm; and R dr is the dielectric relaxation resistance.  30  From Table  S5 , † the DPP device has a larger R rec of 31 930 U than the control device (28 460 U). Generally, with a larger R rec , there is less recombination energy loss.  30  Thus, the DPP introduction will benet the reduction of the recombination energy loss. The CPE1 is increased from 3.66 × 10 -9 F to 4.33 × 10 -9 F, and the R dr is increased from 1.03 × 10 5 to 1.08 × 10 5 , which may be attributed to the DPP interface dipole formation and introduction of an additional interface capacitance and dielectric relaxation resistance. In addition, the CPE2 of the DPP devices becomes smaller than that of the control device, which may relate to the defect passivation or ion reduction by the DPP passivation function via diffusion into the GBs of the perovskite layer. Thus, the DPP introduction can greatly suppress the recombination energy loss, and enhance the carrier transfer and extraction. Fig.  5g  illustrates the dependence of V oc upon the light intensities for the control and DPP devices. The dependence of V oc on the light intensities is usually used to probe the recombination mechanism of the PSCs.  30, 77  The V oc increases linearly with the increase of light intensity for both kinds of devices. In principle, a slope of K BT /q for the V oc versus light intensity indicates that the dominant recombination is a bimolecular process.  30  A larger slope of the K BT /q indicates that an additional trap-assisted Shockley-Read-Hall recombination has occurred.  30  The slope values of the control devices (1.89 K BT /q) are reduced to 1.80 K BT /q by DPP introduction. Therefore, the DPP can signicantly mitigate the trap-assisted recombination energy loss at the defect-enriched interface or GBs. The trap states density (n t ) dramatically impacts the recombination energy loss of the PSCs.  34  Thus, the n t is calculated based on the SCLC methods presented here.  2  In SCLC, the electron-only devices based on the structure of ITO/SnO 2 / perovskite/PCBM/Al and ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/PCBM/DPP/Al are prepared, and their J-V curves are measured. As shown in Fig.  5h , the J-V curves rst exhibit ohmic behaviors (J f V 1 ), and then enter a sharp rising area named the trap-lled limited area (TFL) (J f V n , n > 3).  78  The n t can be calculated based on the onset voltage of TFL (V TFL ), according to eqn (3). 78 n t ¼ 233 0 V TFL eL 2 (3) where e is the elementary charge; L is the thickness of the perovskite lms; 3 0 is the vacuum dielectric constant; and 3 is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite lm. The V TFL of the devices without and with DPP modication are 0.21 V and 0.16 V, respectively. The calculated n t are 1.1 × 10 15 cm -3 and 0.84 × 10 15 cm -3 for the control and DPP passivated PSCs, respectively. Therefore, the electron trap states are indeed suppressed with DPP existing in the cathode interface, PCBM layer, as well as the perovskite GBs. Furthermore, as shown in Fig.  5i , the curves of C -2 versus voltage for the control and DPP devices obey the Mott-Schottky behavior, and the characteristic is linear at the bias negative to the built-in voltage.  55  Compared to that of the control device (0.828 V), the higher V bi value of the DPP device (0.868 V) may benet driving the charge transfer, and thus reduce the charge accumulation and recombination. Furthermore, the higher V bi is benecial in achieving the higher V oc , which is also the reason for the V oc improvement of the devices.  55  The PCE vibration of the devices was monitored to study the DPP effects on the stability of the devices, and the results are shown in Fig.  6 . For better comparison, linear tting was carried out for the stability curves. From Fig.  6a , the DPP introduction can slow down the degradation rate of the devices in N 2 (25 °C) by 43.72%, and the degradation rate of the devices is reduced from 5.49 × 10 -5 % h -1 to 3.09 × 10 -5 % h -1 . The PCE can retain over 90% aer 3500 h (∼146 days) in N 2 , while the PCE of the control devices only maintains 80% of its initial values aer the same exposure (Fig.  6a ), which shows that the stability of the devices was greatly enhanced with the DPP introduction. The thermal stability is very important to the device's long-term stability because the thermal press is the internal inducement of the device degradation, which cannot be overcome by the encapsulation technologies. Thus, we put the control and DPP devices on the hot plate (85 °C) in the N 2 glove box to test the devices' thermal stability. For the control devices, the decay exhibits typical decay curves of the optoelectronic devices,  79  and the devices show a quick decay. There is a 30% loss in the PCE in the rst 16 hours, and over 60% of PCE is lost in the rst 70 hours (Fig.  6b ). The stability curves cannot be linearly tted during the whole test period. Thus, the two-stage linear tting is carried out for this curve. The control devices show a quick decay with a degradation rate of 8.98 × 10 -3 % h -1 at the st initial short time, and then decay at a more moderate speed (7.76 × 10 -4 % h -1 ). The quick decay may be attributed to the interface decay of the inverted PSCs, which may be caused by the metal electrode corrosion deriving from the halide ion migration and accumulation in the Ag cathode interface. In addition, the elements of each function layer can diffuse to each other, and thus inuence the device performance. It is worth noting that the quick decay process is dramatically slowed down with DPP insertion into the interface between PCBM and Ag, and the linear tting can be carried out for the stability curve in the whole test time range. The degradation rate of the DPP devices is 5.98 × 10 -4 % h -1 , which is smaller than that of the two stages of the control devices. The PCE can maintain about 82% of its initial value aer thermal aging at 85 °C for 240 hours. Thus, the T 80 (the time required for the PCE decay to 80% of its initial value) reaches up to 247 h, while that of the control devices is only 14 h. Even aer 312 hours of thermal annealing, the PCE can maintain 72% of its initial value. The thermal stability enhancement is obvious. Furthermore, the excellent thermal stability shows that DPP can improve the interface contact and suppress the ions or element diffusion in the devices. Meanwhile, the release of residual stress, the improvement of the quality of the perovskite thin lms, and the xation of the crystal structure through DPP may have a positive effect on the thermal stability of the device. 
 Conclusion In summary, a simple and facile solution-processed interface material, DPP, is developed and correspondingly solves the defects-assisted and cathode interfacial recombination energy loss, as well as residual stress issues at the same time with only one material. DPP shows excellent electric property and strong percolation ability, which can easily diffuse throughout the PCBM layer and enter perovskite lms. The interface energy mismatch between the (6,6)-phenyl-C 61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/Ag interface, the defect-assisted recombination energy loss, as well as the residual stress of the thin lm are all improved by DPP existing at the PCBM/Ag interface, as well as in the perovskite/PCBM heterojunction. The PCE is enhanced by 33.49% compared with that of the control devices with this DPP interface material, and the highest PCE of 20.17% with negligible hysteresis has been achieved. Beneting from the quality of perovskite lm enhancement and the ion/element migration elimination with DPP introduction, the stability of the devices has been greatly improved. The PCE of the DPP devices can retain over 90% (25 °C@N 2 for 3500 h), 72% (85 °C@N 2 for 312 h) of their initial values, while the control devices can only maintain about 80% and 21% of their initial values, respectively. This work develops a new efficient cathode interface material for inverted PSCs, and provides a unique facile strategy to realize the bulk and interface regulation at the same time with only one material layer. 58 58
