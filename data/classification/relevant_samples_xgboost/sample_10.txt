Title: Spiro[fluorene-9,9 ′ -xanthene]-based hole shuttle materials for effective defect passivation in perovskite solar cells †
The molecular engineering of the interface modulator between the perovskite and hole transporting material (HTM) is crucial to achieving satisfactory performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, cruciform-shaped dual functional organic materials, denoted as SPX-TPA and SPX-BT, are employed for surface passivation and hole transporting interfacial layers (HTILs) in MAPbI 3 -based PSCs. The rigid three-dimensional conjugated spiro(fluorene-9,9 ′ -xanthene) (SPX) core is identical to spirofluorene (existing in spiro-OMeTAD) except differentiated by one oxygen atom. This core unit can effectively adjust the HOMO level and inhibits intramolecular p-p stacking to extract holes from the adjacent perovskite layer. The small energy gap between SPX-TPA (50 meV) and the perovskite can effectively minimize voltage losses and promotes the hole shuttling process. The hydroxyl (-OH) group in the SPX unit forms hydrogen bonds with undercoordinated iodide (I -) and methyl ammonium (MA + ) ions, suppressing the related defects. Lewis bases (O, N and S) in TPA and BT units can promote the passivation of undercoordinated Pb 2+ and MA + (Lewis acid) via Lewis acid-base interactions (Pb-S/O/N). As a result, the PSCs with SPX-TPA and SPX-BT exhibit significantly improved PCEs of 20.03% and 18.51%, respectively, while the PCE of the control device is 17.77%. The enhanced PV performance of SPX-TPA treated PSCs is ascribed to the well-aligned energy levels, superior hole mobility, and favorable film morphology.
Introduction Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites are promising photoactive materials that exhibit composition-dependent tunable bandgaps (E g ), low exciton binding energy (BE), low-cost solution processing, and long carrier lifetimes.  1, 2  The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has already surpassed 25.7% within the last decade.  3, 4  The low nonradiative recombination and efficient charge extraction at the perovskite and hole transport layer (HTL) interface are key factors in achieving high photovoltaic (PV) performance. The passivation of defects especially at the perovskite/HTL interface by utilizing organic molecules has been considered one of the most effective approaches for reducing inherent interfacial defects arising from undercoordinated Pb 2+ and halide surface defects that adversely affect the efficiency and stability of PSCs.  5  Additionally, recent studies have shown that the hydrophobic behavior of organic passivation layers signicantly improves the long-term stability of PSCs.  [6] [7] [8]  In addition to the perovskite/HTL interface, the buried interface of the electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite also plays a signicant role in obtaining highly stable and efficient PSCs.  9, 10  The well-known perovskite/HTL interface modulators such as phenethylammonium iodide, octylammonium iodide, butylammonium iodide, ethylenediammonium diiodide, etc., have exhibited high PV performances and stability.  3, 11  However, they suffer from poor charge transport properties due to unfavorable energy band alignments with the perovskite/HTL interface.  10, 12, 13  Therefore, a variety of interface modulators, which can exhibit good energy level alignment with the perovskite layer, have been developed.  [14] [15] [16]  Recently, Grätzel et al. reported a bifunctional hole shuttle molecule denoted as CBZ-PAI for improved interface energy level alignment and surface defect passivation in PSCs. The PAI unit can effectively passivate the defects at the perovskite surface, whereas the CBZ consisting of methoxy-substituted triphenylamine enables excellent hole transfer from the perovskite to the HTL (Fig.  1a ).  17  Wang et al. reported indolocarbazole based interface modulators TM5 and TM6 for highly efficient and stable PSCs. The gradient energy level alignment, coordination, and hydrogen bond interactions between the perovskite and interfacial layers signicantly enhanced the charge extraction and PCE (Fig.  1b ).  18  Small molecular organic passivating agents consisting of electron-rich atoms such as nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and sulfur (S)  19, 20  as well as functional groups including amine (-NH 2 ),  6  thiol (-SH),  21  carboxylic acid (-COOH),  22  ether (R-O-R),  23  and ester (-COOR)  24  demonstrate strong interactions with uncoordinated sites (Pb 2+ , I -, MA + , etc.) through Lewis acid-base and hydrogen bonding interactions. Also, the hydroxyl (R-OH) functional unit has been extensively explored as it can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with perovskite, improving the crystal orientation, similar to carboxylic/amine groups.  25, 26  Therefore, a wide variety of organic materials with multifunctional units have been reported to improve the charge transport properties of PSCs.  27, 28  Wang et al. reported a symmetrical acceptor-donor-acceptor (A-D-A) organic molecule IDT-OD, as a versatile defect passivation agent. The S atom in the IDT unit acts as a Lewis base that passivates defects associated with undercoordinated Pb 2+ ions, while the N-H group in the oxindole unit interacts with undercoordinated halides via hydrogen bonding interactions. Consequently, the PSCs with IDT-OD exhibit a remarkable increase in efficiency and stability.  29  Spiro(uorene-9,9 ′ -xanthene) (SPX) based materials have received tremendous attention as next-generation spiro-uorenes due to their cruciform-shaped structure and facile synthesis.  30, 31  They have a similar structure to spirobiuorene (existing in spiro-OMeTAD), where the rigid three-dimensional structure can efficiently inhibit p-p stacking and avoid aggregation between the molecules.  32  Therefore, molecules with a SPX core and multifunctional units can be a good choice for interfacial modulation between the perovskite and HTL interface. In this work, we have designed and synthesized two symmetric surface passivation and hole transporting interfacial layer (HTIL) materials denoted as SPX-TPA and SPX-BT (Fig.  1c ) for MAPbI 3 -based PSCs. The molecular engineering of SPX-TPA and SPX-BT consists of SPX as a central core unit, which is symmetrically substituted with N,N-dimethoxy-triphenylamine (TPA) and benzo[b]thiophene (BT), respectively. The conjugated TPA unit is highly compatible with the spiro-OMeTAD layer and promotes excellent hole transfer from the perovskite into the HTL. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of SPX-TPA and SPX-BT is well adjusted by the conjugated SPX unit. A small valence band edge of SPX-TPA and SPX-BT with the perovskite layer can effectively minimize the voltage losses and promote a faster hole shuttling process. The O, N and S atoms in SPX-TPA and SPX-BT can act as Lewis bases, passivating undercoordinated Pb 2+ and MA + via Lewis acidbase interactions, while the O-H group in the SPX unit interacts with dangling bonds through hydrogen bonding interactions to reduce surface defects. Compared with the reference device (17.77%), PSCs with SPX-TPA and SPX-BT show improved PCEs of 20.03% and 18.51%, respectively. 
 Results and discussion The synthetic routes for SPX-TPA and SPX-BT are depicted in Scheme S1, † and detailed experimental procedures and characterization are shown in the ESI. † Intermediate 1 was synthesized from 2,7-dibromo uorenone and resorcinol using ptoluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) as a catalyst in toluene with a product yield of 84%. Similarly, the target materials SPX-TPA and SPX-BT were synthesized by the Suzuki-coupling reaction between intermediate 1 and N,N-dimethoxy bis(4-methoxy phenyl)aminophenylboronic acid, or benzo(b)thiophene-2boronic acid, respectively. SPX-TPA demonstrated excellent solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform (CHCl 3 ), chlorobenzene (CB) and dichloromethane (DCM) due to the presence of methoxy groups, in contrast to the SPX-BT molecule. The intermediate and target materials were puried using the column chromatography method with 100-200 silica gel mesh size and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and elemental analysis. UV-visible absorption and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to calculate the band gap (E g ), highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of SPX-TPA and SPX-BT and the results are tabulated in Table  S1 . † Fig.  2a  shows absorption spectra in a chloroform solution (1 × 10 -5 M), and the maximum wavelength (l max ) is observed at 383 nm and 363 nm for SPX-TPA and SPX-BT, respectively, due to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between SPX and TPA/BT units. The E g of SPX-TPA and SPX-BT is 2.95 eV and 3.11 eV, respectively, obtained from the absorption onset wavelength (E g = 1240/l onset ). The E g values obtained from the Tauc plots showed close proximity with the earlier calculated values (Fig.  S1a † ). Fig.  S1b  † shows the CV measurement of SPX-TPA and SPX-BT in a DCM solution with a three-electrode system under an inert atmosphere. The rst anodic wave for SPX-TPA and SPX-BT was observed at an onset potential (E ox onset ) of 0.58 eV and 0.54 eV, respectively. The HOMO of SPX-TPA and SPX-BT is -5.38 eV and -5.34 eV, respectively, which are obtained from the equation: E HOMO = -eV [E ox onset + 4.80 -E(Fc/Fc + )] , where E(Fc/Fc + ) is the halfwave potential of ferrocene and ferrocenium. The LUMO for SPX-TPA and SPX-BT is calculated to be -2.43 eV and -2.23 eV, respectively, which are obtained from E LUMO = E HOMO + E g .  31, 33  The energy level comparison of SPX-TPA and SPX-BT with the perovskite and HTL is shown in Fig.  2b . The small valence band offset difference of 50 meV between the perovskite (-5.43 eV) and SPX-TPA (-5.38 eV) provides favorable band alignment to improve the hole transfer into the HTL compared to SPX-BT (-5.34 eV), which has a higher valence band offset difference of 90 meV.  17  The high LUMO values of SPX-TPA and SPX-BT can effectively block the electron transfer towards the HTL. Hence, both SPX-TPA and SPX-BT have the potential to act as efficient interface modulators, improving the hole transport and electron blocking in the PSCs. To understand the ICT process and determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of SPX-TPA and SPX-BT, density functional theory (DFT) analyses were performed aer initially identifying stationary points for the two structures at the same level of theory. The Gaussian 09 package  34  with the B3LYP exchange-correlation functional and a 6-31g(d,p) basis set in the gas phase was used, while imposing a tight-convergence criterion.  35  Fig.  S2a-f  † show the side view, HOMO, and LUMO energy diagrams of SPX-TPA and SPX-BT interface modulators. The HOMOs of both are delocalized over the entire structure excluding the xanthene fragments, while the LUMO of the former is localized on the inner-core of the SPX backbone, excluding the xanthene and terminal TPA sections. This indicates that SPX-TPA will possess better charge-separation properties than SPX-BT, which has its LUMO delocalized in the same manner as its HOMO. Hence, SPX-TPA could give better hole transfer properties owing to the less overlap of the frontier orbitals than that of SPX-BT. The potential distribution in SPX-TPA and SPX-BT was analyzed using electrostatic surface potential (ESP) diagrams. SPX-TPA shows negative potential, and it is also partially delocalized to the benzene rings of the TPA unit (Fig.  2c ). In contrast, SPX-BT exhibits a similar negative potential, which is mainly located on the O atoms of the SPX unit (Fig.  2d ). This difference in charge distribution is expected to be due to the higher electronegativity of the O atom compared to the S atom. The electron rich O and S can effectively coordinate with Pb 2+ ions through Pb-O/S electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the -OH units of SPX can form hydrogen bonds with the methylamine cation (MA + ) and iodide (I -), and reduce surface defects that result from undercoordinated MA + and I -ions, thereby enhancing the PV performance and stability of treated PSCs. The interaction of lead iodide (PbI 2 ) with SPX-TPA and SPX-BT was analyzed by UV-visible absorption, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) studies. UV-visible absorption spectra (Fig.  2e ) show a notable redshi in the absorption band edge upon increasing the concentration of SPX-TPA (10-70 mL) in the PbI 2 solution. This indicates a strong interaction between the Pb and O/N atoms of SPX-TPA. However, SPX-BT has a slight effect on the absorption spectra of PbI 2 due to its low solubility, which limits the Pb-O/S interactions of the SPX-BT molecule (Fig.  2f ). Furthermore, the NMR study revealed that aromatic C-H and -OH protons of SPX-TPA (Fig.  S3a † ) and SPX-BT (Fig.  S3b † ) showed higher chemical shis (ppm) upon PbI 2 addition, conrming the interaction between the Pb and O/N/S atoms of passivating materials.  28  Furthermore, the FTIR spectra of SPX-TPA (Fig.  S4a, b † ) and SPX-BT (Fig.  S4c, d † ) show multiple characteristic peaks, which include O-H, C-O, and C-S stretching vibration peaks located at 3337. 79 cm -1 , 1091.95 cm -1 , and 1089.95 cm -1 , respectively. While mixing with PbI 2 , a signicant red shi in O-H (3251.56 cm -1 ), C-O (1025.89 cm -1 ), and C-S (1088.95 cm -1 ) stretching frequencies was observed. This indicates that SPX-TPA and SPX-BT exhibit strong interaction with PbI 2 via covalent and hydrogen bonding interactions.  10, 36  The effect of SPX-TPA and SPX-BT on the perovskite lm was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. Fig.  S5  † shows the XRD pattern for control perovskite (PVK) and perovskite treated with SPX-TPA (PVK/SPX-TPA) and SPX-BT (PVK/SPX-BT). The crystal structure of control PVK does not change with additional passivating materials, which conrms the formation of MAPbI 3 perovskite. The UVvisible absorption of PVK/SPX-TPA and PVK/SPX-BT is similar to that of the control PVK lm (Fig.  3a ). However, a slight increase in light absorption was observed in the PVK/SPX-TPA lm without any change in its band edge as compared to PVK and PVK/SPX-BT lms, which is possibly due to reduction in the shallow surface defective states.  15, 37  The perovskite layer treated with SPX-TPA and SPX-BT may impact the morphology of the perovskite lm. Fig.  S6a-c    (FESEM) images of the pristine PVK, PVK/SPX-TPA, and PVK/ SPX-BT lms, respectively. The pristine PVK lm shows a nonuniform morphology with visible pinholes, which can inuence the overall stability and performance of PSCs. The PVK/SPX-TPA and PVK/SPX-BT lms appear blurred, indicating that SPX-TPA and SPX-BT are uniformly dispersed on the surface of the perovskite lm, which could conrm the homogeneous passivation effect on the perovskite grain boundaries. The surface roughness of pristine and modied perovskite lms was analyzed by using the atomic force microscope (AFM) images (Fig.  S6d-f † ). The root-mean square (RMS) surface roughness of PVK/SPX-TPA and PVK/SPX-BT modied perovskite lms is 7.42 nm and 10.20 nm, respectively, signicantly lower compared to the control PVK lm of 12.80 nm. These results indicate that the SPX-TPA and SPX-BT layers can make the perovskite lm smoother, leading to improved contact and enhanced hole transfer between the PVK and HTL. To investigate the charge transfer ability of SPX-TPA and SPX-BT HTILs at the interface between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and timeresolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were performed. As shown in Fig.  3b , the PL quenching efficiency is much higher in PVK/SPX-TPA/Spiro and PVK/SPX-BT/Spiro than in the PVK/spiro lm, indicating higher hole transfer properties and reduction of charge recombination. Compared with SPX-BT, SPX-TPA has higher hole transporting properties due to favorable band alignment with the perovskite layer. The perovskite lms passivated with SPX-TPA and SPX-BT exhibited a slight blueshi, which may be due to the reduction of defects and minimization of nonradiative recombination.  22, 38, 39  The charge dissociation and recombination mechanism between the perovskite and HTL was analyzed by TRPL measurements (Fig.  3c  and Table  S2  †). The fast and slow decay components s 1 and s 2 are attributed to photogenerated carrier quenching from the perovskite to the HTL and bimolecular recombination in the perovskite, respectively. The TRPL results are tted through a biexponential equation (s ave = A 1 exp(-t/s 1 ) + A 2 exp(-t/s 2 )).  39  When compared with PVK/Spiro (s 1 = 12.81 ns and s 2 = 47.03 ns) and PVK/SPX-BT/Spiro (s 1 = 4.68 ns and s 2 = 38.23 ns) lms, the PVK/SPX-TPA/Spiro lm exhibits a shorter decay time (s 1 = 3.86 ns and s 2 = 36.13 ns), indicating that SPX-TPA treatment induces faster hole transfer and eliminates the nonradiative recombination channels at the perovskite/HTL interface. To evaluate the passivation effect of SPX-TPA and SPX-BT on the solar cell performance, we fabricated regular n-i-p planar structure PSC devices with the conguration of glass/FTO/SnO 2 / MAPbI 3 /SPX-TPA or SPX-BT/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au and tested them under AM 1.5G 1sun illumination (100 mW cm -2 ). The current density-voltage (J-V) curves of PSCs with different concentrations of SPX-TPA (1, 3, and 5 mg mL -1 in CB) and SPX-BT (1 and 3 mg mL -1 in CB) are shown in Fig.  S7a, b  † and the results are summarized in Table  S3 . † Among the other concentrations, the optimal concentrations of SPX-TPA and SPX-BT are 3 mg mL -1 and 1 mg mL -1 respectively, which show the highest opencircuit voltage (V OC ), short-circuit current density (J SC ), ll factor (FF), and PCE. Fig.  3d  shows the J-V curves of the control PVK, PVK/SPX-TPA and PVK/SPX-BT perovskite lms and the results are summarized in Table  1 . While the control PVK lm exhibited an average PCE of 17.77% with a V OC of 1.05 V, J SC of 24.21 mA cm -2 and FF of 68.26%, with an optimal concentration, PVK/ SPX-TPA exhibits the best PCE of 20.03% with a V OC , J SC , and FF of 1.10 V, 24.72 mA cm -2 , and 73.11%, respectively. The PVK/ SPX-BT lm shows a PCE of 18.51% with a V OC of 1.07 V, J SC 24.42 mA cm -2 and FF of 70.57%. Fig.  S8  and S9 † display the statistical performance data collected based on 28 cells of PVK, PVK/SPX-TPA, and PVK/SPX-BT fabricated under the same conditions, showing good device reproducibility. In addition, the PV performance of SPX-TPA and SPX-BT HTMs was also tested with the device architecture of glass/FTO/SnO 2 /MAPbI 3 / SPX-TPA or SPX-BT/Au. The PSCs using doped SPX-TPA and SPX-BT exhibited PCEs of 12.31% and 9.78%, respectively (Fig.  S10a  and Table S4 † ). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) obtained for PVK, PVK/SPX-TPA, and PVK/SPX-BT is shown in Fig.  3e . All PSC devices show similar and broad spectra ranging from 300 to 800 nm; however PVK/SPX-TPA and PVK/SPX-BT exhibit high EQE values of 85.35% and 84.05% at 643 nm, respectively. The improvement in the PV parameters of PVK/SPX-TPA and PVK/SPX-BT can be attributed to enhanced hole extraction, good charge transport properties and surface defect passivation. Similarly, a signicant enhancement in V OC was found in SPX-TPA treated devices due to the favorable band edges, reduced shunt losses, and suppressed trap-assisted recombination losses at the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD interface. To know the essential parameters behind the improvement in V OC , we examined the relationship between V OC and light intensity (P). Fig.  3f  shows the variation of V OC as a function of P and tted with the equation V OC f b (k B T/q) ln(P), where b is the ideality factor, k B is Boltzmann's constant (1.38 × 10 -23 J K -1 ), and T is room temperature (298 K). A b value of 1 implies no trap assisted recombination, while a value greater than 1 indicates high defect assisted recombination.  40  The reduced b from 1.68 for the control PVK to 1.16 for PVK/SPX-BT and 1.09 for PVK/ SPX-TPA passivated perovskite lms indicates the suppression of trap-assisted carrier recombination, which is consistent with an improved V OC and FF. Fig.  4a  illustrates the relationship between J SC and P tted with the equation J SC f P a , where a is the degree of bimolecular recombination. In comparison to the control PVK value (a = 0.89), the perovskite lms modied with SPX-BT and SPX-TPA exhibited high values of 0.94 and 0.97 respectively. An a value close to 1 indicates that there is negligible space-charge recombination in the solar cell.  28  Furthermore, the leakage current that derives from the charge carrier recombination and leakage path in the PSC device was analyzed using dark current density-voltage (J D -V) studies (Fig.  4b ). Eqn (1) gives the relationship between reverse saturation dark current density (J 0 ) and V OC , while considering R Sh [ R S . 16 V OC ¼ n Â k Â T q ln J SC J 0 ( 1 ) where n is the diode ideality factor, k is Boltzmann's constant (1.38 × 10 -23 J K -1 ), and T is room temperature (298 K). As per eqn (1), solar cells will exhibit high V OC values when the J 0 values are lower. The PVK/SPX-TPA and PVK/SPX-BT cells show a reduced J 0 compared to control PVK that can lead to a higher V OC in the respective cells. To investigate the effect of molecular passivation on the trap density (D trap ) in control and modied perovskite lms, space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements were performed for electron only devices with the conguration of FTO/SnO 2 / MAPbI 3 /PCBM/Au. Fig.  4c  exhibits the J D -V characteristics of control PVK, PVK/SPX-TPA, and PVK/SPX-BT. Three different regions were observed under SCLC measurement conditions, which are consistent with J D f V n , where n changes with the slope.  41, 42  When n = 1, it denotes the ohmic region, while n = 2 and n > 2 determine the trap free and trap limited regions, respectively. The intersection between the ohmic and traplimited regions is known to be trap lled limit voltage (V TFL ) and D trap can be calculated from the following eqn (2). D trap ¼ 2 Â 3 0 Â 3 Â V TFL e Â L 2 (2) where L is the thickness of the perovskite layer, 3 0 is the vacuum permittivity, 3 is the static dielectric constant of perovskite, and e is the elementary charge. The modied PVK/SPX-TPA and PVK/SPX-BT cells show D trap values of 3.72 × 10 15 cm -3 and 5.93 × 10 15 cm -3 respectively, which are three-fold lower than that of the control PVK device with a value of 9.65 × 10 15 cm -3 . These results indicate that SPX-TPA and SPX-BT can effectively suppress the perovskite surface defects and improve the charge transporting properties. The hole mobility (m h ) was calculated by SCLC measurements using hole-only devices with the architecture of glass/ ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK/HTIL/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The m h values were extracted by tting with the Mott-Gurney equation (Fig.  S10b † ). The perovskite treated with SPX-TPA as a HTIL showed a higher m h of 6.36 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 than SPX-BT (6.12 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) and pristine (5.98 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ), suggesting that the incorporation of SPX-TPA and SPX-BT can promote charge transport by reducing the interfacial recombination. Table  1  Photovoltaic properties of control PVK, PVK/SPX-BT, and PVK/SPX-TPA  The interfacial charge extraction kinetics in control and modied PSCs were explored using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). For an applied open circuit potential (OCP), EIS was performed by varying the frequency from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz under dark conditions. Fig.  4d  shows the EIS Nyquist plots of PVK, PVK/SPX-BT, and PVK/SPX-TPA, which reveals two semicircle behavior in the Z ′ -Z ′′ plane. The high frequency semicircle response provides information on hole transport resistance (R ct ) at the PVK/HTL interface (Fig.  S11a † ), whereas the low frequency semicircle corresponds to the recombination resistance (R rec ) between electrons and holes at the SnO 2 /PVK/ Spiro interfaces. The measured data were tted with an equivalent circuit model and the interfacial charge transport parameters are summarized in Table  S5 . † The obtained R ct value for PVK/SPX-BT (4.64 U) and PVK/SPX-TPA (3.91 U) was lower compared to that of control PVK (4.97 U), which reveals that hole transport is very fast in SPX-BT and SPX-TPA treated perovskite lms due to their low-lying HOMO levels. Moreover, R rec is very high for PVK/BT (157.18 U) and PVK/TPA (271.72 U) compared to the control PVK (32.99 U), which indicates that the recombination possibility is signicantly reduced at the perovskite interface aer the SPX-BT and SPX-TPA passivation. Furthermore, the reduced recombination was also inferred from the high chemical capacitance (C m ) of PVK/SPX-BT (6.786 mF) and PVK/SPX-TPA (6.992 mF). Device V OC (V) J SC (mA cm -2 ) FF (%) PCE (%) R S [U cm -2 ] R SH [U cm -2 ] Aer passivation, recombination decreases which tends to increase the charge separation in the PSC and enhances the C m of the device. R s represents the series resistance, which is nearly the same for all the cases contributed by the combination of FTO sheet resistance and the interface resistance. The presence of a two-phase angle shi in the Bode phase plot (Fig.  S11b † ) conrms the existence of two interfacial charge transport phenomena in the device. A faster electron/hole charge extraction lifetime in a device was inferred from the phase angle shi in the high frequency region (typically charge transport on a faster time scale) and the longer electron/hole recombination lifetime in a device was also inferred from the low-frequency phase angle-shi (mass transport). The electron/hole relaxation lifetime (s e ) was calculated from the mid peak frequency (f mid ) of the Bode phase plot using the relation s e = 1/2pf mid . The peak frequency point was shied to a low frequency region in the case of PVK/SPX-BT and PVK/SPX-TPA, which clearly explains the improvement in the charge relaxation lifetime. The longer s e in PVK/SPX-BT (0.12 s) and PVK/SPX-TPA (0.14 s) further conrms that the recombination possibility is signicantly reduced compared to the control PVK device (0.03 s). As long-term stability is an important parameter for commercial viability, we investigated the effect of interface modulators on device stability. Fig.  4e  shows the stability test of PVK, PVK/SPX-TPA, and PVK/SPX-BT nonencapsulated devices over 45 days stored in a dry room (temperature = 23 ± 5 °C and relative humidity [RH] = 25% ± 10%). The PCE of control PVK devices degrades to 51.62% of its initial PCE aer 45 days, whereas the SPX-BT and SPX-TPA passivated devices exhibited enhanced stability maintaining 81.85% and 88.89% of their initial performances, respectively. The operational stability of control PVK, PVK/SPX-TPA, and PVK/SPX-BT devices was examined under continuous 1 sun illumination at an elevated temperature of 55 °C (Fig.  4f ). The control PVK device fully degraded within 80 h, while PVK/SPX-TPA and PVK/SPX-BT showed 48.94% and 41.41% of their initial PV performances, respectively. According to previous reports, the defects at perovskite grains and grain boundaries initialize degradation due to the interaction of perovskite with moisture and oxygen.  43  The interface modulators SPX-BT and SPX-TPA consist of multiple aromatic units and exhibit more hydrophobic behavior than halide perovskites. The improved longterm stability can be attributed to the reduced defects via Lewis acid-base and hydrogen bonding interactions, along with a hydrophobic surface that offers high resistance against moisture degradation as shown by the schematic illustration in Fig.  S12 . † The moisture stability of control PVK, PVK/SPX-TPA and PVK/SPX-BT was analyzed by water contact angle measurements shown in Fig.  S13 . † The control PVK lm exhibited a low contact angle value of 58.56°, while the SPX-BT and SPX-TPA passivated perovskite lms show high values of 75.87°and 78.34°, respectively. The increased contact angle implies that SPX-BT and SPX-TPA can effectively suppress the moisture penetration and improve the overall stability of devices. The undercoordinated units (Pb 2+ and MA + ) in perovskite act as Lewis acids and readily interact with N, S, and O Lewis bases via the Lewis acid-base mechanism. Both SPX-BT and SPX-TPA are heteroatom rich molecules and effectively coordinate with perovskite defects. The schematic representation of the plausible interaction is shown in Fig.  5a . SPX-BT possesses electronrich S and O atoms in BT and SPX units, respectively, promoting coordinate bond formation with MA + and Pb 2+ ions. Likewise, N and O units in SPX-TPA interact with undercoordinated MA + and Pb 2+ ions. Additionally, the -OH group of the SPX unit blocks the halide dangling through hydrogen bonding (O-H/ X -). In addition to better band edge alignment with perovskite, SPX-TPA has a larger number of O and N atoms contributing to its superior surface passivation properties and high PV performance. To investigate SPX-TPA and SPX-BT interactions with the perovskite active layer, we performed Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig.  5b  and c  show the FTIR spectra of control PVK, PVK/SPX-TPA and PVK/SPX-BT treated lms. PVK/SPX-TPA (N-H = 3094.98 cm -1 ) and PVK/SPX-BT (N-H = 3105.99 cm -1 ) lms exhibited a signicant reduction in transmittance and a blue-shi in the N-H peak value compared to control PVK (N-H = 3182.39 cm -1 ), indicating hydrogen bonding and other plausible interactions between PVK and HTILs. The XPS results of the control PVK, PVK/SPX-TPA and PVK/SPX-BT lms are shown in Fig.  5d  and e . The binding energy peaks of Pb 4f 5/2 and Pb 4f 7/2 shi from 143.33 eV and 139.42 eV for the control PVK lm to 141.86 eV and 138.30 eV for PVK/SPX-TPA and 142.52 eV and 139.06 eV for PVK/SPX-BT. Fig.  S14a  and b  † exhibit the binding energy peaks at 630.08 eV and 618. 68 eV for the control PVK lm, which are attributed to I 3d orbitals (I 3d 5/2 and I 3d 3/ 618.18 eV) and PVK/SPX-BT (629.72 eV and 618.54 eV) show a signicantly lower shi in I 3d 5/2 and I 3d 3/2 binding energy values. The N 1s orbital peaks (Fig.  S14c  and d † ) at 401.17 eV in the control PVK lm are shied to lower binding energy values of 399.19 eV and 398.29 eV for PVK/SPX-TPA and PVK/SPX-BT lms, respectively. The O 1s orbital in SPX-TPA showed a noticeable shi in PVK/SPX-TPA (Fig.  S15a † ). Similarly, the S 2p orbitals 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 of SPX-BT exhibited a signicant shi to lower binding energy in the PVK/SPX-BT lm (Fig.  S15b † ). These results indicate that SPX-TPA and SPX-BT can effectively interact with undercoordinated species such as Pb 2+ , MA + , and I -to suppress their relative defects, which lead to enhanced PV performance in treated PSCs. 
 Conclusions In conclusion, we reported a unique strategy to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs by introducing dual functional molecules SPX-TPA and SPX-BT as an interface layer between the perovskite and HTM interface. Dimethoxy-triphenylamine (TPA) and the spiro(uorene-9,9 ′ -xanthene) (SPX) core have a similar structure to spiro-OMeTAD and it enables excellent hole transfer or shuttling from the perovskite into the HTM. The HOMO level is well adjusted by the conjugated three-dimensional SPX unit. A very small gap between the valence band edges of SPX-TPA (50 meV) and the perovskite effectively minimizes the voltage losses and improves the hole shuttling process. The Lewis bases (O, N, and S) of both TPA and BT units can bind with undercoordinated Pb 2+ and MA + ions via Lewis acid-base interactions (Pb-S/O/N), while the hydroxyl (-OH) group of the SPX unit binds through hydrogen bond interactions, to suppress the defects at the perovskite surface and grain boundaries. Based on device characterization and spectral analysis, the nonradiative decay and the ionic migration in PVK/ SPX-TPA and PVK/SPX-BT are effectively suppressed. Simultaneously, the hydrophobic fused ring in both SPX-TPA and SPX-BT increases the moisture stability of the perovskite absorber. As a result, PSCs with SPX-TPA and SPX-BT, as HTILs, exhibit an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.03 and 18.51%, respectively, while the PCE of the control device is 17.77%. This study suggests that conjugated three dimensional molecules with simple functional groups can be a good choice as an interfacial passivating agent in PSCs.

Title: Supporting information Cruciform Shape Hole Shuttle Materials Based on Spiro [Fluorene-9, 9′-Xanthene] for Defect Passivation in Perovskite Solar Cells

Experimental Section 1.1 Materials  Catechol, 2, benzo[b]   amino] phenyl] boronic acid was obtained from commercially available sources. The reaction and purification solvents, reagents and catalysts were purchased from commercial suppliers, which are used without further purification. All the chemical reactions were performed under the nitrogen atmosphere condition. 
 Measurement The target compounds and intermediates were characterized by using 1 H-and 13 C-NMR spectra, which are measured in deuterated chloroform (CDCl 3 ) on a Bruker 500-MHz spectrometer. Tetramethylsilane (TMS) solvent was used as standard and peak multiplicity was reported as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; m, multiplet; dd, doublet of doublet. The column chromatography was performed to purify intermediates and target compounds by using silica gel  (100-200 mesh) . The UV-visible absorption spectra in solution and solid film states were measured on Scinco S-3100 spectrophotometer. The electrochemistry measurements such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were recorded with a CH Instruments with a scan rate of 100 mV/s in dichloromethane (DCM). Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF 6 ) (0.1M) was selected as the supporting electrolyte, with electrode systems such as the reference electrode (Ag/AgCl), the working electrode (carbon-glass), the counter electrode (Pt wire) and ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc + ) as an external reference. 
 Perovskite fabrication process 
 Materials All the compounds were directly used for the fabrication process without any additional modification until mentioned. Lead (II) iodide (PbI 2 , 99.999%), bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI), and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine) cobalt (III) tris (bis (trifluoromethyl sulfonyl) imide) (FK209) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI) Co., Ltd. (Japan). Methylammonium iodide (MAI, 99.99%) was acquired from Dyesol (Australia) and Tin (IV) oxide (SnO 2 ) (15% in H 2 O) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. The organic solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF), acetonitrile (ACN), toluene, isopropanol (IPA), chlorobenzene (CB), 4-tert-butylpyridine ( t BP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N, N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′spirobifluorene) was obtained from Lumtec (Taiwan). The FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) glass substrates were purchased from TEC 8, Pilkington. 
 Fabrication process of MAPbI 3 solar cells The FTO substrates were sequentially cleaned with soap solution, distilled water, ethanol (EtOH), and IPA by sonication for 20 min each. These substrates were cleansed with N 2 gas and dried at 70 °C for 4 h. The FTO substrates were placed under the ultraviolet-ozone (UV-O 3 ) atmosphere for 20 min before electron transport layer (ETL) deposition. The ETL solution was prepared by diluting SnO 2 in 2-proponol and deionized water with volume/volume ratio of 1:3:3 v/v respectively. Then ETL was formed by spin coating the prepared solution at 4000 rpm for 30 s followed by annealing on hot plate at 100 °C and 180 °C for 10 min and 30 min respectively. The 1M MAPbI 3 precursor solution was prepared from PbI 2 and MAI materials and dissolved in 1:4 ratio of DMSO and DMF. The solutions of SPX-TPA (1 mg, 3 mg and 5 mg) and SPX-BT (1 mg and 3 mg) were prepared in 1 mL of chlorobenzene solvent. Next, the perovskite films were prepared by spin coating in two step-programs (1000 rpm for 10 s, 4500 rpm for 40 s) with 500 μL of toluene (antisolvent) dropped on the substrate 10 s before the second step ends and resultant films were annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. After that, various amounts of SPX-TPA and SPX-BT were spin coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s without any post treatment. Next, the spiro-OMeTAD (73 mg/mL in chlorobenzene), with dopants tBP (28 μL), Li-TFSI (28 μL; 530 mg/mL in acetonitrile), and FK209 (18 μL; 300 mg/mL in acetonitrile) was coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, Au (80 nm) electrode was thermally evaporated under high vacuum level using a shadow mask to obtain Glass/FTO/SnO 2 /MAPbI 3 /SPX-TPA or SPX-BT/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au structured PSCs device (active area of 0.22 cm 2 ). 
 Film and device characterizations The UV-visible absorption spectra of perovskite films were measured by using Scinco S-3100 spectrophotometry. The morphologies of thin films were obtained by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-6700F, JEOL). X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were measured using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/Max-2500) with Cu-Kα X-rays. The PV performance of fabricated cells was measured under 1 Sun illumination by a LAB50 solar simulator (McScience) attached with a Keithley 2400 source meter. The incident power of solar simulator was calibrated by a standard mono-Si solar cell (PVM-396, PV Measurements, Inc.) certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement was obtained by using a photo-modulation spectroscopy setup having a monochromatic xenon light source (McScience, K3100 Spectral IPCE Measurement System) and it was calibrated using a Si-photodiode certified from the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was conducted using a ULVAC-PHI Veresprobe II with Monochromatic Al Kα energy source at ultra-high vacuum (10 -             The synthesis of intermediate I have followed the previously reported literature. 1 To a 50 ml round bottom flask was charged with 2, 7-Dibromo-9-fluorenone (500 mg, 1.479 mmol), resorcinol (814.26 mg, 7.395 mmol), p-TsOH (50 mg, 0.295 mmol), and toluene (25 mL). Then reflux the mixture upto12h, and cool to room temperature. After that 100 mL of water was added to the reaction mixture and continued the rection further 0.5 h at room temperature. The yellow color precipitated from the reaction mixture which was isolated by the filtration process. Further, the crude product was dissolved in alcohol (100 mL) and filtrated.
