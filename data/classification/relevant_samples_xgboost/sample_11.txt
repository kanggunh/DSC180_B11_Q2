Title: Scaling Up Perovskite Solar Cell Fabrication: Antisolvent-Controlled Crystallization of Printed Perovskite Semiconductor
Scaling up perovskite solar cells stands as one of the frontiers in advancing this rapidly growing technology. Yet, controlling perovskite thin-film crystallization during and post-printing differs significantly from lab-scale processes that have yielded record device efficiencies. This study investigates antisolvent treatment for slot-die-coated perovskite solar cells using in situ optical spectroscopy and comparing among multiple antisolvents. The antisolvent bath used in slot-die coating affects the perovskite crystallization and film quality differently when comparing to the established spin-coating antisolvent treatment process. A novel dynamic antisolvent method, employing either vortex or laminar flow, is developed. It outperforms steady-bath techniques in generating high-quality, haze-free films. Optimization studies identify critical treatment times. Implementing this novel antisolvent treatment leads to a peak average power conversion efficiency of 15.62% and the highest device efficiency of 18.57%, an excellent performance for slot-die-coated MAPbI 3 devices printed and tested under ambient conditions. The method is validated for an alternative perovskite composition, FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 , and printing technique, blade coating. This research highlights the importance of in situ analysis for enhancing perovskite film quality and introduces scalable approaches for controlling large-area film crystallization kinetics, driven by the demand for efficient and scalable manufacturing processes in the field of perovskite solar cells.
Introduction Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have demonstrated remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) approaching their theoretical limit.  [1, 2]  The high efficiency is often achieved through spin coating of the perovskite semiconductor, but this method is impractical for large-scale manufacturing. To address this limitation, various solution-processing deposition methods, including blade coating,  [3]  screen printing,  [4]  spray coating,  [5]  gravure printing,  [6]  and slot-die coating,  [7]  are being explored. Despite these efforts, replicating the conditions conducive to spin coating is challenging. Consequently, the pursuit of large-scale manufacturing of PSCs necessitates a re-evaluation of the perovskite deposition process to facilitate the integration of this exciting technology. In spin coating, the rate of crystallization of the perovskite semiconductor is key to achieving high performance.  [8]  It is driven by solvent extraction which most often includes three stages: 1) evaporation after deposition of the precursor solution on the substrate; 2) dynamic antisolvent extraction driven by solvent miscibility mismatch and spin rate; and 3) hightemperature annealing for complete solvent evaporation. For the classic system, methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ) in the precursor solvent of dimethylformamide (DMF)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the second step is used to form a Lewis acid-base intermediate adducts between the perovskite and DMSO which are key in facilitating the final conversion to high-quality large-grain perovskite films.  [9]  In practical terms, the dynamic antisolvent step is simply dripping of the antisolvent onto a spinning wet film, during spin coating. This is a rapid process, relying crucially on many parameters, including the revolutions per minute of the spin coater, antisolvent type, its amount, dripping time, dripping time length, dripping height, and antisolvent flow rate. These are extremely difficult to implement in industrial printing techniques.  [8]  Instead, for industrial-scale printing, methods such as air-knife drying,  [13] [14] [15] [16] [17]  preheated stages,  [18] [19] [20] [21]  and vacuum chamber-assisted solvent extraction  [22, 23]  have been used. Often additives and solvent engineering have been the best way to assist film formation;  [7, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28]  e.g., potassium thiocyanate has been reported to boost PCE to 21.8%, although for a very small 0.089 cm 2 illuminated device area.  [25]  Among these methods, antisolvent bathing continues to be a promising approach for posttreatment and when used after slot-die coating it has led to >17% PCEs,  [6, 7, 24]  which is in the top-tier performances for printed devices (Table  S1 , Supporting Information). In the last 5 years, in situ analytical techniques have become a very useful tool to gain understanding of the dynamic perovskite formation process.  [29]  In situ grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering,  [18]  UV-vis,  [30]  grazing incidence X-ray diffraction,  [12]  and photoluminescence (PL)  [31]  techniques have been used to demonstrate the importance of the intermediate phase formation in achieving high-quality film crystals. The unique ability of real-time monitoring from the in situ analysis has greatly enhanced our understanding of the crystallization process for both spin coating and printing methods, resulting in a better and smoother technology transfer, further accelerating the commercialization process for perovskite technologies.  [32, 33]  Here, we built an in situ analysis experiment to investigate the potential of the antisolvent bathing step to become a reliable solvent extraction method for industrial-scale printing. We focus on the slot-die coating technique, ideal for roll-to-roll production and use the classic MAPbI 3 as a proof-of-concept material. Timeresolved and in situ UV-vis transmittance and PL were recorded during the antisolvent bathing and annealing extraction steps. Several antisolvent candidates were investigated and from them diethyl ether (DE) was selected as the most optimal for the DMF-DMSO precursor solvent, similar to spin coating. In addition, the in situ fluorescence and transmission data identified that the duration of the DE treatment is equally crucial in producing high-quality MAPbI 3 films. In the third stage of this study, a novel dynamic antisolvent bath method, suitable for industrial printing, was developed to remove the common complication in production lines of haziness. Based on these three developments of antisolvent bathing, we fabricated devices with the classic structure (ITO/SnO 2 /MAPbI 3 /Spiro-OMeTAD/Gold) with a champion PCE of 18.57%. All experiments were conducted without additives or post-treatment, and most importantly under ambient conditions. This study therefore opens new opportunities for achieving high-quality printed PSCs in ambient conditions, enabling industrial-scale printing of perovskite films with high performance. 
 Results and Discussion 
 Antisolvent Screening Using In Situ Analysis The first step in this work was to select the best antisolvent for slot-die-coated MAPbI 3 perovskite films on 25 Ã‚ 75 mm substrates. The classic MAPbI 3 composition was used as an example material due to its well-understood properties and optimized deposition steps for lab-scale device fabrication. The precursor was 1 M MAPbI 3 dissolved in DMF:DMSO (9:1.1 v:v) without additives. DE, ethyl acetate (EA), toluene (Tol), chlorobenzene (CB), and anisole (Ani) were chosen as the candidate antisolvents based on their contrasting miscibility with the precursor solvent DMF/DMSO and their popularity for spin-coated perovskite films  [8]  and relevant cost per volume (Table  S2 , Supporting Information). For the antisolvent step, slot-die-coated MAPbI 3 were transferred to a customized quartz chamber filled with antisolvent, simulating bathing treatment in an industrialized roll-to-roll process (Diagram S1). In situ transmittance and PL spectroscopy were conducted using optical fibers and achieving minimal optical losses, which allowed the analysis of the evolution of the perovskite crystallization as a function of time and the selection of the best antisolvent and conditions for device fabrication. Figure  1  presents contour plots of the PL evolution during antisolvent treatment. The excitation wavelength was 405 nm, and the measurements were acquired at 1 s intervals for 180 s immediately after placing the slot-die-coated film in the antisolvent bath. The color maps are normalized to one to better compare between the changes in PL evolution between antisolvents. They show that the fastest PL intensity rise was in EA and Ani, 5 and 9 s, respectively, while the slowest PL rise was in DE and Tol. This is also evident from the PL peak intensity evolution, as shown in Figure  1f . Both DE and Tol showed increasing fluorescence up to 180 s but the DE-treated film had 4 times higher final intensity, which indicates the formation of a higher density and better quality crystals under DE antisolvent treatment. During crystallization, perovskite nanocrystals and intermediates are anticipated to exhibit quantum confinement effects. This is evident in Figure  1g  as PL peak shifts to longer wavelengths during the antisolvent treatment.  [34] [35] [36]  The change in the average crystallite size as a function of time was extracted by fitting the PL peak position and plotted in Figure  S1 , Supporting Information.  [33]  The procedure is detailed in the Supporting Information, and it assumes insignificant changes in the nanocrystals/intermediate phases dielectric constant and the effective masses of electrons and holes for the duration of the antisolvent treatment. It is evident from the results that a very different rate of nanocrystal growth is observed between different antisolvents. The DE-treated sample clearly has the slowest growth rate while the EA-treated sample has the fastest growth rate. For EA, large nanocrystals of 6.5 nm are formed almost immediately upon contact with the solvent, whereas for DE, the nanocrystals reach an average size of only up to 5.0 nm by 180 s. The size distribution of the nanocrystals at 180 s was compared between the antisolvents by estimating the PL full width at half maximum (FWHM), as shown in Figure  S2 , Supporting Information. For DE, there is a much larger distribution of crystal sizes than for EA, which correlates with the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Figure  1 . These results indicate that the nucleation and nanocrystal growth rates during the antisolvent bath treatment play an important role in determining the quality of the fully formed perovskite film and that neither too quick nor too long rates are desirable for forming dense slotdie-coated perovskite films. In addition to in situ PL, the heating stage of the perovskite film formation process was probed using transmittance, due to strong quenching of PL upon heating. Figure  2  shows the time evolution of the transmittance of the films at 480 and 750 nm during the antisolvent and annealing stages. These wavelengths were picked to probe the higher bandgap intermediate phases and the fully formed perovskite crystals, respectively. Figure  S3 , Supporting Information, shows the original 2D transmittance plots for all antisolvents for references. The results are consistent with the PL data from Figure  1  and further reveal that DE is the slowest acting solvent during heating. DE requires double the amount of time to fully convert the films into perovskite crystals, but at the end it produces much better-quality films as evident from the SEM images in Figure  1 . The quality of films can also be judged by the transmittance in the NIR spectral range (850-1100 nm), where DE-treated films show the highest transmittance among all samples (Figure  S3 , Supporting Information). This is the spectral region where scattering of light dominates the transmittance signals. It indicates that the films that are most compact and with the smoothest surface are formed with the DE antisolvent treatment. The final films formed with DE had 27% transmittance at 750 nm near optimal for device fabrication. Figure  1  compares the in situ spectroscopy results to the SEM images of the films after thermal annealing at 100 Â°C. These confirm our conclusions that DE antisolvent treatment produces the best quality (pinhole-free) films, albeit with small crystal sizes. This can be linked to the fact that DE is the only antisolvent from the studied here with a poorer miscibility to DMSO, one of the precursor solvents, while all others are miscible with both DMSO and DMF. A study of the miscibility misbalance between the antisolvents and the precursor solvents is presented in Figure  S4 , Supporting Information. Based on that result and previous work we conclude that the first stage of the DE treatment is DMF extraction from the precursor solution,  [8]  slowly forcing the crystallization of intermediate phases of PbI 2 â€¢DMSO and MAIâ€¢PbI 2 â€¢DMSO.  [10, 26, 33]  This allows for the intermediate precursor phases to retard the perovskite crystallization process,  [37]  which is enforced with thermal annealing.  [34]  DMSO's low volatility enables slower crystal growth and the formation of better-quality nanocrystals of MAPbI 3 compared to the other antisolvents. There is also the possibility for introducing a nonstoichiometric intermediate phases xMAIâ€¢PbI 2 â€¢xDMSO (x < 1).  [11]  In all other antisolvents studied here, perovskite crystallization is mostly complete within the antisolvent bath treatment due to their fast extraction of both DMF and DMSO which proves to be detrimental to the final film quality. In conclusion, our results here show that balancing the rate of DMF and DMSO extraction for slot-die-coated films is key to achieving intermediate MAIâ€¢PbI 2 â€¢DMSO phases and controlling the rate of crystal growth. Slowing down these rates by using DE as an antisolvent is beneficial and enables the slot-die coating of pinhole-free perovskite films. This is the antisolvent with the lowest cost, toxicity, and environmental impact (Table  S2 , Supporting Information) from the compared here solvents. 
 Haziness Control for Improved Uniformity of Large-Area Printed Films A hazy film is a common issue during perovskite film deposition. It occurs regularly for spin-coated films due to uneven flow of the antisolvent dispense rate, its amount, the spinning rate, and the difference in miscibility between the antisolvent and the host solvent in the precursor solution.  [8]  For antisolvent bath-treated large-area printed perovskite films, it is also common to see irregular stains forming on the film during the antisolvent bath.  [38]  These are due to undesirably rapid nucleation, which happens irregularly along the films, and it is driven by the extraction of DMF from the deposited precursor solution.  [6, 24]  Similarly, in our experiments, we observed that the hazy stain formation depended on the antisolvent. Even when using DE, which was defined as the best antisolvent for this study, the printed film still possesses random and small areas of undesirable stains of haziness after annealing, despite the SEM images showing a dense pinhole-free film. Here, we consider knowledge acquired from the extensively studied spin-coating fabrication process and link to our printing process. In spin coating, when a stream of antisolvent is dripped onto the central spot of the spinning substrate, an even flow should spread across the whole substrate. Each point with the same distance to the central point should experience the same amount and replenishment rate of the antisolvent. Furthermore, each antisolvent type requires a different dispense rate during the dynamic antisolvent dripping process, which, as we have shown above, is due to the different crystallization rates. For example, DE has been reported to perform better with a slower dispense rate.  [8]  This allows an adequate time for the DMF-DMSO to diffuse across the liquid-liquid interface into the antisolvent. When the dripping process is finished, enough antisolvent should still cover the whole spinning substrate, which fully evaporates after 1-2 s to allow the crystallization of intermediate phases. This intermediate phase formation is essential for producing a uniform and haziness-free film.  [39, 40]  Until now, this dynamic approach has been suitable almost exclusively for small substrate spin-coating fabrication. To enable the scale-up of the dynamic antisolvent process, we introduced a flow treatment of the antisolvent to our larger area slot-die-coated films, aiming to minimize haziness and improve the uniformity of the larger area films. Rather than using a stationary antisolvent bath, the printed films were positioned within a specially designed quartz chamber featuring both an inlet and an outlet to enable the flow of antisolvent (Diagram S1, Supporting Information). This flow was achieved with a small lab-scale peristaltic pump, operating at a flow rate of 1 L min Ã€1 . In situ analysis was used to compare the differences in perovskite formation between the stationary and flow-based approaches. The raw data are included in Figure  S6 , Supporting Information, while Figure  3  compares PL intensity and the 480 nm transmission. From the PL intensity changes, it can be concluded that the formation of intermediate phases and nanocrystals is faster under the flow of antisolvent, as the maximum PL was reached at 60 s. The transmission data reached a plateau at the same time. This is likely due to much faster DFM extraction as compared to the stationary bath. The maximum PL intensity for the flow treatment was 75% higher than that under the stationary antisolvent treatment, which indicates better quality crystals were formed under the antisolvent flow by 60 s. The decrease of PL after 60 s suggests that there exists an optimal time duration of the antisolvent treatment. After annealing, both samples have transmittance of around 27% at 750 nm. The main difference lies in the NIR region where the flow-treated film showed 60-75% transmittance compared to 50-60% for the stationary bathtreated film, indicating a much better film quality and a smoother perovskite-air interface for the flow-treated sample. This is confirmed from the pictures in Figure  3 . Furthermore, we probed the PL FWHM, which showed that at 180 s, the flow process produces more uniform crystal size distribution (59 nm) than the stationary (67 nm). At the same time, the PL peak position at  We considered the limitations of the flow process and identified two: 1) the manual dropping of the substrate at an angle leading to uneven film exposure to DE; and 2) the limitations of our lab-scale peristaltic pump generating pulsation at higher flow rates. A faster and more uniform flow rate is needed to eliminate the haziness. A 3D nylon beaker was printed with a slit to vertically hold the 75 Ã‚ 25 mm substrate against the inner wall. A cross-shaped stirrer bar aiming for a high vortex was used to stir 350 mL of DE, creating a fast and uniform flow across the inner sidewall of the beaker. With the high-speed vortex from this new antisolvent chamber design, we further reduced the haziness as shown in Figure  3  (film called DE Flow). 
 Crystal Quality Control via Timing the Antisolvent Process The in situ PL data in Figure  3  shows that the flow antisolvent treatment reaches a maximum at 60 s and drops afterward. Therefore, investigation was carried out to find the optimal duration for the flow antisolvent process. Using the more optimal for our conditions stirring approach, we tested the antisolvent duration times of 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 s. The quality of the final films was then analyzed with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), results shown in Figure  4a . All films exhibited a major peak at â‰ˆ14.2Â°c orresponding to the (110) plane of the perovskite tetragonal structure, according to the PDF card [PDF 01-084-7607 (International Centre for Diffraction Data [ICDD], 2018)]. The peak at 12.7Â°is assigned to the (001) plane of the PbI 2 hexagonal structure [PDF 00-007-0235 (ICDD, 1957)]. A strong PbI 2 peak can be identified for the 5 s treated film, while the 10 s treated film shows no peak of PbI 2 . The PbI 2 peak again emerges for 20-60 s treated films, although with a smaller intensity than the 5 s sample. This suggests that 10 s treated film consists of the purest MAPbI 3 . We further studied the quality of the films using time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC), which usually indicates the trap state density of films. Figure  4b  shows the PL decays fitted with a double exponential function, and the trend agrees with the XRD results, where the 10 s treated sample had the longest lifetime of 140 AE 29 ns confirming the best crystal quality is for 10 s treatment time. The trend is also visible from the top-view SEM images in Figure  S7 , Supporting Information, in which 10 and 20 s films show the best uniformity. Prolonged treatment after 20 s shows bright spots, usually indicative of PbI 2 formation.  [41]  Based on these results, the highest quality crystals are achieved from a 10 s dynamic DE antisolvent treatment. 
 Device Fabrication The final step in this study was device fabrication, for which we implemented the knowledge acquired from our investigations with different antisolvents, antisolvent flow approach, and the duration of the antisolvent treatment. All devices were fabricated in ambient conditions. The device structure is as follows: ITO (75 Ã‚ 25 mm)/SnO 2 (slot-die-coated)/MAPbI 3 (slot-die-coated)/ Spiro-MeOTAD (spin-coated)/Au (vacuum evaporated). The fabrication procedure implemented DE and vortex flow as in the optimal antisolvent treatment process. Details of the device fabrication are presented in the Experimental Section. Different antisolvent bath duration times were tested, and Figure  5  presents the resulting device parameters. The highest current density ( J SC ) and smallest variation is observed for 10 and 20 s treated films. In terms of open-circuit voltage (V OC ) distributions, the 5 and 10 s treated devices (Figure  5b ) are the ones producing the highest voltage of 1.05 V. From Figure  5c , the forward scan of 5 s treated devices showed a low fill factor (FF). In contrast, the rest showed a similar level of around 70%. Combining these results, Figure  5d  shows the distribution of PCE. 10 s treated devices had the best overall performance for both forward and reverse scans. The PCE of the 20, 40, and 60 s treatments drops gradually with an increasing bathing time, yet it remained in the range of 14-16%. The J-V scans of the champion devices in each category are shown in Figure  S8 , Supporting Information. Comparing forward and reverse scans, it is apparent that the two scan directions yield different PCEs almost exclusively due to deviation of FF. The FF from the reverse scan is usually higher, leading to a hysteresis phenomenon common for PSCs and dependent upon the voltage scan direction/rate/range, voltage conditioning history, and device configuration.  [42]     [8, 11, 43]  Thus, although the miscibility between DE and DMSO is low, prolonged flow washing would still decompose the intermediate phases causing MAI loss, indicating that optimization of the antisolvent treatment time should be an essential step in scale-up activities. The performance was further enhanced with spin-coated SnO 2 compared to slot-die-coated SnO 2 . The device consisted of 60 nm SnO 2 (spin-coated)/ 560 nm MAPbI 3 (slot-die-coated)/ 190 nm Spiro-MeOTAD (spin-coated)/100 nm Au (vacuum evaporated). The highest PCE (reverse scan) is 18.57% with a current density of 23.48 mA cm Ã€2 , and the J-V plot is shown in Figure  S8f , Supporting Information. Notably, all steps in the device fabrication process, except for vacuum evaporation, where the film is placed in the vacuum chamber, were performed in an ambient environment with humidity around 30-50 RH and temperature around 23 Â°C. The device testing was also conducted in an ambient environment (no glove box or clean room use), making this device performance among the best reported to date (Table  S1 , Supporting Information). 
 Validation of Antisolvent Method on Mixed Cation Perovskites The antisolvent treatment method was tested on a different printer technique and an alternative perovskite structure. FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 was printed using blade coating, using similar settings as for printing MAPbI 3 . A gentle air knife blow was required to initiate nucleation of films prior to the antisolvent treatment with DE under vortex flow. The in situ PL data (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information) reveal a similar dynamic of crystallization in the DE bath as for MAPbI 3 , leading to the formation of smooth densely packed films. One batch of printed devices were fabricated, producing the best device pixel of 21.24 mA cm Ã€2 , 1.00 V, FF 0.73, and a PCE of 15.62% (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information). Further printing and device fabrication optimization steps are required for full optimization. Despite this, the results confirm the efficacy of our approach to in situ analysis and dynamic antisolvent treatment producing highquality films within a single optimization step. 
 Conclusion An in situ optical spectroscopy setup was used to investigate the suitability of antisolvent treatment for printing large-area slotdie-coated PSCs. The in situ analysis method proved to be a simple and powerful tool for screening of the most appropriate antisolvent for device fabrication. It is revealed that the rate of perovskite crystallization can be controlled via the antisolvent choice and is linked to the final device performance. DE was found to be the most effective antisolvent for producing highly reflective and pinhole-free perovskite films. The main reason for that is DE's slow solvent extraction rate of the precursor DMF/ DMSO solvent system, driven by DE's poor miscibility with DMSO and likely causing the formation of DMSO-based intermediates and perovskite nanocrystals prior to moving the sample to the hot plate for thermal annealing when the full conversion into MAPbI 3 perovskite was achieved. A novel flow antisolvent treatment method was developed to optimize the haziness and uniformity of the printed films. Two different flow bath methods were tested, and both produced excellent results; the first involved a lateral antisolvent flow and the second involved a vortex flow. Due to the somewhat ineffective peristatic pump used in this work, the vortex flow was found to produce the best quality and haziness-free films. The antisolvent treatment time was also found to be an important parameter for achieving high-quality films. In this work, the most optimal time was 10 s. Based on these results and by implementing the antisolvent flow method with DE for 10 s, high-performance solar cell devices were fabricated. For devices with a slotdie-coated SnO 2 electron transporting layer, 15.62% average PCE was achieved, with the highest device PCE being 17.95%. The PCE was improved to 18.57% for a device with spin-coated SnO 2 . These are the best performing slot-die-coated MAPbI 3 devices fabricated and tested in ambient conditions. As MAPbI 3 was used as an example material in this work, there clearly is further potential to improve performance by using additives or other post-treatment approaches. With this report, we demonstrated the usefulness of in situ analysis to predict and facilitate the printing of high quality perovskite films. We also developed a new method for controlling the crystallization kinetics of the printed perovskite film based on a novel antisolvent flow bathing process, which is scalable and transferable to industrial settings. The method was validated by printing both high-quality MAPbI 3 and FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 devices. It opens new avenues for investigating higher performance perovskite materials, such as FA-based or Cs-based perovskites. 
 Experimental Section Materials: SnO 2 was purchased from Alfa Aesar (44592, 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion), methylammonium iodide was purchased from Greatcell Solar, dimethyl sulfoxide was from Fisher Scientific, and Spiro-MeOTAD was purchased from Ossila. All other materials and solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Device Fabrication: SnO 2 layer: ITO (8 ohm square Ã€1 ) substrates (25 Ã‚ 75 mm) were cleaned in acetone and IPA under ultrasonication for 15 min each, and plasma treated for another 15 min. SnO 2 was mixed with water (HPLC grade) in 1:3 wt%, stirred for 30 min, and filtered using a 0.45 Î¼m PTFE filter before use. The parameter setting for slot-die coating of the SnO 2 layer was: stage travelling speed: 15 mm s Ã€1 , syringe dispense rate: 5 Î¼L s Ã€1 , and stage preheating at 50 Â°C. After the coating, the substrates were annealed on a hot plate set at 150 Â°C for 30 min. For spin-coated SnO 2 , the same solution was used with 3000 RPM for 30 s, followed by the same annealing process. Device Fabrication: Perovskite Layer: 1.1 M perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving MAI and PbI 2 in a DMF:DMSO mixed solvent (a 9:1.1 volume ratio) at 50 Â°C stirring for 1 h. The precursor solution was filtered with a 0.45 Î¼m PTFE filter before use. The parameter setting for slot-die coating was 5 mm s Ã€1 , the dispense rate was 1 Î¼L s Ã€1 , and the stage preheating was 40 Â°C. After printing, the film was transferred into a quartz chamber for in situ analysis or a nylon beaker for device making. The vortex flow, as depicted in Diagram 1, with DE antisolvent was used for device fabrication. After the antisolvent bath, the films were annealed at 100 Â°C for 10 min on a hot plate covered with a glass petri dish. Note that a 1 M precursor was used on pure microscope glass slides for the in situ analysis. For device making, SnO 2 -coated ITO was treated with plasma cleaning for 15 min before perovskite deposition. After thermal annealing, perovskite films were quickly removed and cut into three pieces of 25 Ã‚ 25 mm substrates. Spiro-MeOTAD was dissolved in anhydrous Tol in 60 mg mL Ã€1 concentration with additives of 28.8 Î¼L mL Ã€1 of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 22 Î¼L mL Ã€1 of Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), which comes from a stock of 350 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL anhydrous acetonitrile. The solution was stirred overnight at 60 Â°C and filtered with a 0.22 Î¼m filter before use. This was spin-coated at 3000 RPM for 30 s without further treatment. 100 nm gold was deposited via thermal evaporation. Chemical preparations were conducted in an N 2 -filled glove box, and all other experiments were conducted in ambient conditions with 20 Â°C temperature and 30-40% humidity. Device Fabrication: FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 : The precursor solution was prepared by mixing two separate stock solutions: the first was 1 mL of 1.2 M FAPbI 3 , with 0.3 M MACl as additive, dissolved in DMF:NMP (v:v, 9:1); the second was 1 mL of 1 M CsPbI 3 dissolved in 1 mL pure NMP. Films were coated using blade coating a 50 Î¼L solution on each substrate, using a home-build automated coater. The coating speed and device fabrication procedure are the same as in fabricating MAPbI 3 devices. Characterization: In situ PL was performed using a self-assembled optical holder stage with a Wasatch WP-VISNIR-R-50 spectrometer equipped with Avantes AvaLight-HPLED miniature high power 405 nm LED source. Relevant short-pass and long-pass filters were needed to calibrate the final spectra. For the measurement, the integration time was set to 500 ms and the spectrum automatically recorded at 1 s intervals. In situ transmittance was performed using a self-assembled U-shaped fiber holder for optical alignment. Avantes AvaSpec-ILS2048CL-EVO-RS-UA ultralow light fiber optic UV/vis/NIR spectrometer was used with an AvaLight-DHC compact deuterium-halogen light source. For the measurement, the integration time was set to 50 ms, 20 averages, a 1 s interval between repeat measurements. After the printing, the as-printed film was submerged in the quartz chamber. PL and transmittance were carried out 180 times with 1 s intervals. Afterward, the substrate was placed onto a customized hotplate at 100 Â°C. The hot plate was suspended in the air with a 4 mm diameter through-hole drilled in the middle, the same two optical fibers were moved across the hole, and the transmittance was recorded for 60 with 1 s intervals. For in situ flow analysis, a Kamoer lab WIFI UIP stepper motor peristaltic pump was used to provide the flow. The flow rate was kept at 1 L min Ã€1 . Viton Fluoroelastomer tubing was used to transfer the solvents. In situ data were fitted using self-written algorithms run by Spyder 4.2.5 under Python 3.8. TCSPC was performed using Edinburgh Instruments FLS1000 PL spectrometer. The excitation wavelength was 369.8 nm, and the emission wavelength was 770 nm. The time range was set at 1 Î¼s, the channel range was 1024, and the bandwidth was 20 nm. The data-acquiring time was 10 min. SEM (FEI Inspect F) was used for observing perovskite morphology and device architecture. XRD was performed using a Siemens D5005 diffractometer from 5Â°to 70Â°using Cu KÎ± radiation.

Fitting of PL peak evolution: The perovskite PL exhibits a nanoconfinement effect. The PL peak position, EPL depends on the average crystallite size, d by: E PL (d)=E g +bâˆ•d 2 where Eg is the bulk PL peak position and b is a constant, 3 eVnm 2 . Eg was taken to be 1.59 eV.  1  The equation was used to calculate the average MAPbI3 crystal size evolution during antisolvent treatment (Figure  S1 ), from the in-situ PL peak position data in Figure  1 .    
 Miscibility investigation To understand the differences between antisolvents, we prepared three separate precursors: 1 M Methylammonium Iodide (MAI-DMF-DMSO) in DMF/DMSO (9:1.1 v:v); 1 M MAPbI3 in pure DMF (MAPbI3-DMF) and pure DMSO (MAPbI3-DMSO). We added 60 ÂµL of each precursor into 7 ml of the corresponding antisolvents, simulating the environment when a small quantity of wet precursor is in contact with a more significant amount of antisolvent bath. From the results shown in Figure  S4 , mixing MAPbI3-DMF with DE forms a solution with a light brown colour and light brown and yellow precipitate, indicating a good miscibility of DMF and DE and some but incomplete perovskite crystal formation. MAPbI3-DMSO in DE formed separate liquid layers without any signs of colour changes or precipitation evidencing the immiscibility between DMSO and DE. All other antisolvents tested here were miscible with the two precursor solvents and lead to precipitates. In the case of EA, where little precipitation is seen for MAPI3-DMSO, it was also noted that MAI would diffuse from the precursor MAPI3-DMF-DMSO to EA leading to the loss of organic cations which could be the cause of the observed pinholes in the film in the SEM image of this sample. CB and Ani formed dark-brown to black precipitation in both MAPbI3-DMF and MAPbI3-DMSO indicating perovskite formation in the antisolvent which explains the in situ PL peak position reaching 760 nm at 180 sec. These results confirm that DE mostly extracts DMF from the precursor MAPI3-DMF-DMSO solution during the antisolvent treatment and it explains the observed 720 nm PL peak position after 180 sec with incomplete perovskite formation.
