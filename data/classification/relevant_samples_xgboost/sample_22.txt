Title: Surface reconstruction of La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.8 Ni 0.2 O 3-δ perovskite nanofibers for oxygen evolution reaction
Perovskites have become promising alternatives to precious metal-catalyzed oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report the synthesis of several perovskite nanofibers, specifically La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co x Ni 1-x O 3-δ (LSCN), and investigate their electrocatalytic water oxidation activity in alkaline electrolytes. La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.8 Ni 0.2 O 3-δ (LSCN-0.8) is selected and immersed in an aqueous NaBH 4 solution for 1 h for surface reconstruction. The perovskite nanofibers' electrocatalytic OER activity and stability are rigorously evaluated using a standard three-electrode system. Results reveal that even a slight Co substitution for Ni content within the LSCN perovskite structure has a notable impact on electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, LSCN-0.8 exhibits an overpotential of 363 mV at 20 mA cm -2 in 1 M KOH. However, significant improvement is observed after the surface reconstruction process. The optimized LSCN-0.8 (now called LSCN-2) displays the lowest OER overpotential (320 mV) under the same conditions. Furthermore, the LSCN-2 nanostructure demonstrates exceptional electrode stability, as evidenced by only a slight decrease in electrocatalytic performance during 5000 cycles of linear sweep voltammetry.
Introduction The global energy crisis and escalating environmental pollution have spurred rapid advancement in clean and sustainable hydrogen energy  [1] . In clean renewable energy, hydrogen has high energy density and is environmentally friendly, making it a key replacement for fossil fuels in future energy technologies. Its main source comes from electrochemical water splitting reaction  [2] . Therefore, the paramount focus is enhancing water-splitting efficiency through electrocatalysts. The foremost challenge lies in developing oxygen evolution anode, grappling with the formidable energy barrier for oxygen bond formation  [3] . Presently, anodes rely on precious metal oxides, like IrO 2 and RuO 2 materials, and Pt/C materials, serving as common choices for oxygen evolution reaction (OER)  [4] . However, their scarcity, high cost, and poor versatility hinder their practical implementation and application in water decomposition  [5] . Hence, there is a pressing need for cost-effective anode materials that can outperform precious metal oxide-based catalysts. In the past few decades, some non precious metal materials have been developed as low-cost and high-performance electrocatalysts, such as transition metal oxides  [6, 7] , transition metal phosphides  [8, 9] , layered double hydroxides  [10, 11] , etc. It is worth noting that many electrocatalysts utilize the synergistic effect of bimetallic atoms to promote OER. For example, Yang et al. synthesized feather-like NiCoP loaded on nickel foam by two-step hydrothermal-phosphating method, and the OER was only 203 mV at 10 mA cm -2  [12] . Among transition metal oxides, perovskite oxides have enormous potential as electrocatalysts, not only exhibiting significant activity and stability  [13] , but also possessing the advantage of controllable electronic structure, facilitating the synergistic effect of bimetallic atoms. These perovskite oxides have a chemical formula of ABO 3 , with the A-site predominantly composed of alkaline earth or rare earth metals and the B-site typically occupied by transition metals. Notably, nearly 90 % of elements from the periodic table can bind to A/B or O positions within the perovskite structure, enabling precise tuning of their electronic properties. Furthermore, the oxygen's (δ) non-stoichiometry varies significantly, offering multiple avenues for fine-tuning the electronic structure and improving the charge transfer processes  [14] . This inherent adjustability in the perovskite oxide structure confers distinct advantages of cost-effectiveness, facile synthesis, and controlled electronic structure  [15, 16] . To improve the perovskites' inherent OER performance, perovskite composites with rich components can be developed by replacing or customizing compositions. Recently, Wang et al. designed La 0.6 Sr 0.4- CoO 3 (LSC) and La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3 (LSCF) using LaCoO 3 as a model catalyst and A-site and AB-site doping  [17] . Results indicated that LSCF demonstrated excellent OER activity. In addition, introducing oxygen vacancies on the surface of perovskite oxides has been proven effective in improving OER performance. William Hale et al. reported that increased oxygen vacancies promote the OER and significantly improve electrocatalytic activity  [18] . The OER performance usually depends on intrinsic activity and number of active sites. Adjusting the perovskite oxide morphology can improve their OER performance. Recently, electrospinning has been favored for designing one-dimensional nanofibers, demonstrating excellent mechanical strength, flexibility, unique morphology, high specific surface area, and rich catalytic sites  [19, 20] . In addition, the interconnecting channels within perovskite nanofibers ensure fast mass/electron transfer rates. Perovskite nanofibers form oxygen vacancies due to the nanoscale effect, improving their OER performance. In this study, we applied a series of B-site doped Co perovskite La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co x Ni 1-x O 3-δ (LSCN) for oxygen evolution electrocatalysis under alkaline conditions. A series of one-dimensional perovskite nanofiber electrocatalysts were prepared using electrospinning method, denoted as La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co x Ni 1-x O 3-δ (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8), named LSCN-0.2, LSCN-0.4, LSCN-0.6, and LSCN-0.8, respectively, to investigate the effect of adjusting the cobalt and nickel content at the B site on the OER performance. As the Co content increases, the OER performance of perovskite nanofibers gradually improves. As we have shown, the best LSCN-0.8 catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 363 mV at 20 mA cm -2 in 1 M KOH. To further investigate the improvement of OER performance of perovskite, we synthesized a batch of perovskite nanofibers with oxygen vacancies. Using the soaking method, the LSCN-0.8 sample was first immersed in a reducing solution of NaBH 4 at different concentrations for surface reconstruction, resulting in the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the nanofibers. It is worth noting that due to the nanoscale effect, perovskite nanofiber structures are more likely to form oxygen vacancies  [21] . The samples were named LSCN-1, LSCN-2, and LSCN-3 by soaking them in 1 M L -1 , 2 M L -1 , and 3 M L -1 NaBH 4 solutions for 1 h at 50 • C. As the concentration of NaBH 4 solution increases, the oxygen vacancy content on the surface of nanofibers gradually increases, reaching its peak at 2 M L -1 and then almost no longer increasing. The sample with the best OER performance was LSCN-2, which exhibited an overpotential of 320 mV at 20 mA cm -2 . In addition, in the timed potential test, LSCN-2 showed no significant attenuation of overpotential after 50 h at a current density of 20 mA cm -2 .   S1 ). The solution was stirred for 12 h at room temperature for a uniform mixture. 
 Experimental 
 Preparation of Next, the mixed precursor solution was transferred to a 20 mL syringe for electrospinning. A working voltage of 6 kV was maintained at a 15 cm distance between the needle tip and the collector, with a relative humidity of 20%-30 %. After collecting nanofibers, they were calcined in the air at 650 • C for 2 h at a heating rate of 2 • C min -1 . The resulting products were designated LSCN-0.2, LSCN-0.4, LSCN-0.6, and LSCN-0.8. 
 Surface reconstruction of LSCN-0.8 For surface reconstruction, LSCN-0.8 was immersed in a reducing NaBH 4 solution. Specifically, LSCN-0.8 was introduced to 50 mL NaBH 4 aqueous solutions of varying concentrations (1, 2, 3 M L -1 ) at 50 • C. After 1 h, the sample was carefully removed, ensuring it was free from any residual components, followed by thorough rinsing with deionized water and ethanol. Then, vacuum-dried the sample at 70 • C for 10 h, forming surface-reconstructed LSCN samples. These samples were denoted as LSCN-1, LSCN-2, and LSCN-3. 
 Material characterizations The crystal structures of samples were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a D/max 2600 instrument (Rigaku, Japan). The morphology of samples was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with an SU70 instrument (Hitachi, Japan). The atomic structure of materials was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a Tecnai TF0 instrument (FEI). The surface chemical properties of samples were observed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). 
 Electrochemical testing A mixture of LSCN (15 mg), PVDF, and acetylene black was blended at a mass ratio of 8:1:1. PVDF served as an adhesive, while acetylene black was a conductor facilitating electron transfer within the electrode. A small quantity of N-methylpyrrolidone solution (NMP) was added to achieve a homogeneous blend. Subsequently, the mixture was vigorously mixed for a 2-h sonication process, ensuring thorough uniformity. The modified suspension was then precisely coated onto a 1 × 1 cm -2 carbon paper substrate. The electrode was vacuum dried at 60 • C for 12 h, resulting in an active substance loading mass of approximately 4 mg cm -2 . A standard electrochemical device (VMP-300) employing a threeelectrode system was utilized for electrochemical analysis. All electrochemical measurements were carried out in a 1 M KOH solution. Specifically, a platinum electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode, and a catalyst sample were employed as the counter electrode, reference electrode, and working electrode. All measurements were referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for consistency. Using the formula: E RHE = E SCE +0.059 pH + 0.196 V (pH = 14), Overpotential: ŋ = E RHE -1.23 V. CV (50 cycles). Electrocatalysts were activated at a scanning rate of 50 mV s -1 to ensure reliable cyclic voltammetry curves. Afterward, Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) was performed at a scanning rate of 5 mV s -1 . This evaluation assessed the Tafel slope, typically determined by the components η = b log (j) + a, where η, b, and j represent overpotential, Tafel slope, and current density, respectively. For Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), measurements were performed within a frequency range of 0.01 Hz-100 kHz at 500 mV. CV measurements in the appropriate current region were carried out to determine the Electrochemically Active Surface Area (ECSA). Calculating the double-layer capacitance (C dl ) required CV analysis at specific scanning rates of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mV s -1 . The long-term stability of the electrocatalyst for 50 h was assessed using a chronopotentiometry method (j = 20 mA cm -2 ). Additionally, cyclic testing was conducted at a scanning Y. Niu et al. rate of 100 mV s -1 , comprising 5000 cycles. All potentials were corrected after applying for 95 % iR compensation. 
 Results and discussion XRD patterns display four perovskite oxides, obtained by varying cobalt-nickel ion ratio in La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co x Ni 1-x O 3-δ (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8), respectively (Fig.  1 ). Characteristic peaks corresponding to (100), (110), (  111  SEM images visually represent the morphology of LSCN-0.2, LSCN-0.4, LSCN-0.6, and LSCN-0.8 (Fig.  2 ). All these samples exhibit an elongated and continuous one-dimensional fibrous structure. As shown in Fig.  2d , compared to the other LSCN samples, LSCN-0.8 displays a prominent one-dimensional nanotube-like structure. This specific morphology enhances ion mobility, attributed to a larger surface area and higher number of active sites, resulting in improved electron transfer rates and conductivity  [22] . To analyze the effect of cobalt and nickel content in electrocatalysts on OER performance, various LSCN samples are characterized using a conventional three-electrode system. These prepared samples are then tested for OER performance in 1 M KOH. Fig.  3a  displays the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve of samples. When x = 0.8, the LSCN samples demonstrate significantly enhanced OER activity. Among 4 catalysts, LSCN-0.8 showcases the lowest overpotential (327 mV and 363 mV) at 10 and 20 mA cm -2 current densities, implying that in perovskite electrocatalysts, a cobalt to nickel ion ratio of 4:1 enhances OER activity. Additionally, the corresponding Tafel slope of LSCN-0.8 (149.87 mV dec -1 ) is lower than that of LSCN-0.2 (160.22 mV dec -1 ), LSCN-0.4 (158.61 mV dec -1 ), and LSCN-0.6 (157.61 mV dec -1 ), as shown in Fig.  3b . Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis demonstrates that LSCN-0.8 exhibits lower resistance and charge transfer resistance than the other three electrocatalysts (Fig.  3c ). The double layer capacitance (C dl ) of four LSCN samples is presented in Fig.  3d , and their CV values in the charged potential region are shown in Fig.  S1 . Notably, LSCN-0.8 exhibits a larger C dl (20.16 mF cm -2 ), indicating its greater electrochemical surface area. In addition, in order to further investigate the effect of the ion ratio of Co and Ni on the electrocatalytic OER performance of perovskite, we also conducted experiments on the performance of samples with x = 0.9 and 1.0, and found that LSCN-0.8 still has the lowest overpotential and minimum Tafel slope (Fig.  S2 ). XRD patterns show minimal disparity between LSCN-0.8 and other LSCN samples treated with different NaBH 4 concentrations, displaying similar lattice structures (Fig.  4a ). The characteristic peaks at 2θ values of 23.26   110 ), (  111 ), (  200 ), (  211 ), (220), and (300) planes, respectively. These peaks align with standard peaks of LaNiO 3 (PDF # 34-1181) and SrCoO 3 (PDF # 38-1148), confirming the successful formation of LSCN samples. Among them, there are some weak impurity peaks around 15 • , 35 • , and 45 • , as shown in Fig.  S3 . Moreover, the diffraction peak intensity weakens in LSCN samples, possibly due to NaBH 4 reduction. The samples' composition elements and valence states are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Firstly, the La, Sr, Co, Ni, and O elements' presence in LSCN-0.8 and LSCN-2 is verified (Fig.  4b ), confirming the formation of catalysts. Fig.  4c  compares the Co 2p XPS spectra of LSCN-0.8 and LSCN-2 catalysts. The binding energy at 780 eV (2p 3/2 ) and 795 eV (2p 1/2 ) is attributed to Co 3+ . The main peaks at 781 eV and 797 eV are associated with Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2 of Co 2+ , respectively  [23] . The other two peaks at 786 eV and 803 eV indicate satellite peaks. These findings suggest that some Co 3+ in LSCN are converted to Co 2+ after NaBH 4 reduction treatment, potentially enhancing OER activity  [24] . Nevertheless, minimal valence state changes are observed in La, Sr, and Ni elements in LSCN, as indicated by comparative XPS spectra of La 3d, Sr 3d, and Ni 2p (Fig.  S4 ), for the high-resolution mapping of Ni 2p 3/2 , Ni 2+ and Ni 3+ were found (Fig.  S5 ), but there was no significant change in the relative intensity of Ni 2+ and Ni 3+ after NaBH 4 reduction, signifying the persistence of crystal structure of LSCN post NaBH 4 treatment. Fig.  4d  depicts the O 1s XPS spectra of LSCN-0.8, LSCN-1, LSCN-2, and LSCN-3 samples. LSCN-0.8 shows three oxygen peaks in the O 1s spectrum, while LSCN-1, LSCN-2, and LSCN-3 display four oxygen peaks. Specifically, the 529, 531, 532, and 534 eV peaks correspond to Co-O bonds, hydroxyl substances, oxygen vacancies or defects (O vac ), and surface-adsorbed water molecules  [25] . The absence of a 532 eV peak in LSCN-0.8 suggests the absence of surface oxygen defects. Additionally, the large O vac peak area of the LSCN-2 and LSCN-3 samples indicate the feasibility of samples soaking in NaBH 4 to generate oxygen vacancies on the sample's surface. In addition, we also provided convincing evidence for the changes in oxygen vacancies through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. In Fig.  S6 , the EPR signal of the sample can be observed at g = 2.003. The EPR signal strength indicates that LSCN-2 and LSCN-3 have more O vac than LSCN-1, and the O vac content of LSCN-2 and LSCN-3 is almost the same, but no EPR signal was observed on the surface of LSCN-0.8. Fig.  4d  illustrates that the oxygen vacancy content on the LSCN sample surface initially increases with NaBH 4 concentration reaching its peak at 2 M L -1 concentration. Afterward, as the concentration of NaBH 4 solution continues to increase, the oxygen vacancy content on the sample surface will not increase again. This is because when the concentration of NaBH 4 is too high, the surface structure of the sample is destroyed, resulting in no further increase in oxygen vacancy content  [26] . SEM images depict the morphology of LSCN-0.8, LSCN-1, LSCN-2, and LSCN-3 nanotubes. Compared to LSCN-0.8, perovskite nanotubes, after NaBH 4 reduction, exhibit a rougher surface (Fig.  5a ). Most nanotubes are shorter than before surface reconstruction due to fractures induced by ultrasound, centrifugation, and other experimental conditions. TEM analysis is carried out further to characterize the LSCN-0.8 and LSCN-2 morphology and microstructure. Fig.  6d  and e reveal lowmagnification TEM images of LSCN-2 after surface reconstruction, clearly illustrating a well-defined one-dimensional nanotube-like structure. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images are taken for a more in-depth analysis of the lattice state of LSCN samples. LSCN-0.8 exhibits a lattice spacing of 0.272 nm (Fig.  6c ), while LSCN-2 crystal plane spacing is 0.386 nm (Fig.  6f  that La, Sr, Co, Ni and O were uniformly dispersed over the whole LSCN-0.8 and LSCN-2. (Fig.  S7 ). In addition, to further investigate the factors affecting the performance of perovskite catalysts, we also measured the specific surface area and average pore size of the samples before and after surface reconstruction through nitrogen adsorption-desorption. The specific surface areas of LSCN-0.8 and LSCN-2 are 34.041 m 2 g -1 and 82.168 m 2 g -1 , respectively. Most of the samples fall within the size range of 2 and 100 nm, with an average pore size of 2.252 nm and 3.711 nm, respectively (Fig.  S8 ). After investigating the impact of cobalt and nickel in LSCN samples on perovskite electrocatalysts, LSCN-0.8 samples are selected for subsequent experiments. Fig.  7a  displays LSV curves of LSCN-0.8 after 1h immersion in NaBH 4 solutions (1 M L -1 , 2 M L -1 , and 3 M L -1 ). LSCN samples, namely LSCN-1 (333 mV@20 mA cm -2 ), LSCN-2 (320 mV@20 mA cm -2 ), and LSCN-3 (346 mV@20 mA cm -2 ), after surface reconstruction, exhibited higher overpotentials compared to LSCN-0.8 (363 mV@20 mA cm -2 ). LSCN-2 displays superior OER activity, suggesting electrocatalysts' surface reconstruction can enhance their OER performance. Fig.  7b  depicts the overpotentials of four LSCN samples at 10, 20, and 50 mA cm -2 current densities. LSCN-2 exhibits relatively high overpotentials across all three current densities. The corresponding Tafel  slopes of LSCN-2 (114.16 mV dec -1 ) are notably lower than LSCN-1 (126.73 mV dec -1 ), LSCN-3 (149.11 mV dec -1 ), and LSCN-0.8 (152.32 mV dec -1 ) (Fig.  7c ). EIS is carried out to investigate the reasons behind improved OER performance to investigate all catalysts' charge transfer resistance (R ct ) (Fig.  7d ). LSCN-2 exhibits the lowest R ct among all samples, suggesting that surface reconstruction of oxygen vacancies can accelerate charge transfer. Subsequently, C dl is applied to assess electrocatalysts' active surface area (ESCA). The capacitance current associated with double-layer charging in 1 M KOH electrolyte at different scanning rates is measured by cyclic voltammetry (Fig.  7e  and f ). The slope, represented by C dl , positively correlates with ESCA. LSCN-2 displayed the largest C dl (44.37 mF cm -2 ), signifying a larger ESCA than the other samples. The CV curves of LSCN-1 and LSCN-3 are shown in Fig.  S9 . To evaluate the stability of LSCN electrocatalysts, 5000 consecutive LSV cycles are conducted at a scanning rate of 100 mV s -1 . Only a slight current decrease is observed at the cycle's end (Fig.  7g ), reflecting the excellent stability of LSCN-2. Moreover, the LSCN-2 electrode exhibits exceptional long-term amperometric stability    at 20 mA cm -2 (Fig.  7h ), maintaining its stable performance for 50 h and affirming its favorable electrochemical properties. Fig.  7i  compares the overpotential LSCN-2 with some reported electrodes at 20 mA cm -2 , suggesting that LSCN-2 exhibits superior OER activity and stability  [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Compared with previous reports on the oxygen evolution reaction of perovskites (Table  S2 ), such as SmBa 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 2 O 6-δ , LaMn 0.75 Co 0.25 O 3-δ , etc., the one-dimensional perovskite nanofiber La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.8 Ni 0.2 O 3-δ we have chosen for synthesis not only has the characteristics of easy synthesis and low cost, but also has good catalytic activity and stability. One dimensional perovskite nanofiber La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.8 Ni 0.2 O 3-δ has excellent mechanical strength, flexibility, and high specific surface area, which plays a significant role in regulating the electrocatalytic activity of OER. In addition, the La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.8 Ni 0.2 O 3-δ perovskite catalyst plays a crucial role in enhancing OER activity by introducing abundant oxygen vacancies on the fiber surface through soaking in NaBH 4 solution, further enhancing the OER performance of sample LSCN-0.8, and outperforming many previously reported perovskite electrocatalytic samples in terms of catalytic activity and stability. 
 Conclusion The impact of varying x values in La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co x Ni 1-x O 3-δ (LSCN) perovskite nanostructures on OER performance reveals that LSCN-0.8 displays superior electrocatalytic properties with a higher overpotential of 363 mV at 20 mA cm -2 in alkaline environments. During the surface reconstruction process in NaBH 4 aqueous solution, oxygen vacancies on the LSCN-0.8 surface increase, and Co 3+ ions are reduced to Co 2+ . Compared with LSCN-0.8, LSCN-2 shows significantly enhanced OER activity. Moreover, LSCN-2 demonstrates an overpotential of only 320 mV at 20 mA cm -2 current density in 1 M KOH solution and displays remarkable electrode stability, with only a slight decrease in performance after 5000 LSV cycles. ), (200), (211), (220), and (300) planes appeared at 2θ = 23.26 • , 32.74 • , 40.62 • , 47.18 • , 58.6 • , 68.86 • , and 78.7 • , respectively.
