Title: A modified two-step sequential spin-coating method for perovskite solar cells using CsI containing organic salts in mixed ethanol/methanol solvent
Two-step sequential spin-coating method has been widely used to prepare mixed FA/Cs and FA/MA/Cs perovskite solar cells. However, due to the extremely low solubility of Cs salts in the commonly used isopropanol solvent, which is used to dissolve the organic salts, the Cs salts can only be dissolved into the PbI 2 precursors with mixed DMF/DMSO solvent. Herein, we have proposed a modified two-step sequential spin-coating method to solve the above problem. A mixed solvent consisting of ethanol and methanol is used to dissolve the CsI, FAI, and MACl at the same time. The solubility of CsI in the mixed ethanol/methanol solvent can be tuned by varying the ethanol/methanol ratio. After optimizing the ethanol/methanol ratio, high quality FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 perovskite film with large perovskite crystal, low defect density and long carrier life time can be obtained using our modified two-step sequential spin-coating method, which can result in a perovskite solar cell with champion power conversion efficiencies of 21.17% (cell area 0.1 cm 2 ) and 14.65% (cell area 0.25 cm 2 ) respectively. Our study provides a new method for fabricating mixed FA/Cs perovskite solar cells using CsI containing organic salts solution, which can be further optimized to fabricate highly efficient perovskite solar cells.
Introduction The performances of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are highly dependent upon the quality of the perovskite films. Therefore, various methods, such as one-step anti-solvent method, two-step sequential spin-coating method, and vacuum thermal evaporation, are proposed in the last decade in order to produce high quality perovskite films  [1] [2] [3] . Among them, two-step sequential spin-coating method stands out due to its easier control over the crystallization rate of perovskite film, suitable for large-scale film deposition, and excellent reproducibility  [4, 5] . In the two-step sequential spin-coating method, inorganic lead salts are firstly coated onto the charge transport layer, and organic salts are deposited subsequently, then they react with each other to form the organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite film. Based upon the fabrication protocol, composition engineering of the lead salts and/or the organic salts, solvent engineering, and additive engineering have been widely used to further improve the quality of two-step deposited perovskite films  [5] . Cs cation can effectively enhance the device performance and stability of mixed FA/Cs and FA/MA/Cs PSCs, which have been confirmed by various studies  [6] [7] [8] [9] . In addition, MACl or FACl, which can control the crystallization process and passivate the defects of the perovskite films, can be readily used with Cs cation to synergistically improve the performances and stability of the PSCs  [10] [11] [12] . In one-step anti-solvent method, Cs ion can be easily incorporated into the perovskite films by dissolving Cs salts (CsI, CsBr or CsCl) into the perovskite precursor solutions  [6, [13] [14] [15] . However, in two-step sequential spin-coating method, Cs containing perovskite films have most commonly been fabricated through dissolving Cs salts into the lead salts precursors, due to the high solubility of Cs salts in the commonly used DMF and/or DMSO solvent. For example, H. Zhou et al. proposed a two-step sequential spin-coating method to prepare FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 perovskite film for the first time early in 2017  [16] . The PbI 2 + 10% CsI solution was spin-coated onto SnO 2 substrate, then reacted with FAI + FACl solution to produce high quality FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 film. Later, this method has been widely explored by researchers to fabricate highly efficient Cs containing PSCs  [6, [17] [18] [19] . Due to the extremely low solubility of Cs salts in the isopropanol solvent, the Cs cation is difficult to be incorporated in the perovskite films through dissolving Cs salts into the organic salts solution. This problem has been partially solved by Y. Chen et al.  [20] . In their study, CsI or CsBr (4 mg mL -1 ) and organic salts (50 mg FAI and 10 mg MACl in 1 mL ethanol) were dissolved into ethanol at the same time, the obtained solution was spin-coated onto PbI 2 films, after annealing, high quality FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 or FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3-x Br x perovskite films could be obtained, which resulted in PSCs with efficiencies above 20.28%. However, the solubility of CsI in absolute ethanol is still quite low, and in our experiment, we find that CsI is difficult to be totally dissolved into absolute ethanol with the same concentration of 4 mg mL -1 as the above reference even after a long time stirring or ultra-sonic treatment, which greatly limits the final Cs concentration in the resulting FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 film. Recently, all inorganic CsPbI 3-x Br x perovskite has attracted a lot of research interest due to their intrinsically better thermal stability  [21] [22] [23] . The CsPbI 3-x Br x perovskites can also be fabricated using the two-step sequential spin-coating method, where CsI or CsBr solution in methanol is spin-coated onto the pre-deposited PbI 2 film  [22, 23] . Compared with ethanol, methanol exhibits much higher solubility for CsI and CsBr. Therefore, methanol might be a potential solvent for Cs salts (CsI or CsBr) and organic salts (FAI and MACl) in the two-step sequential deposition method, which can be used to solve the low solubility problem of the Cs salts in the organic salts solution. In this study, we report the mixed ethanol/methanol solvent for dissolving CsI, FAI, and MACl salts in a modified two-step sequential deposition method. Due to the high polarity of the methanol solvent, which might degrade the perovskite film, mixed ethanol/methanol solvent is used in this study. The ratio of ethanol to methanol in the mixed solvent is systematically optimized in order to find a balance between solubility and polarity of the mixed solvent. When the ratio is 3:2, the mixed ethanol/methanol solvent displays a good solubility of the CsI, FAI, and MACl salts, which can result in high quality perovskite films and a champion performance of 21.17% for the corresponding PSCs (cell area 0.1 cm 2 ). 
 Experimental 
 Device fabrication The two-step sequential deposition method from reference are adopted in our study with a minor modification  [20] . In brief, 0.599 g PbI 2 is dissolved into mixed solvent of 1 mL DMF/DMSO (950 μL DMF and 50 μL DMSO). The obtained solution is thoroughly stirred and filtered before use. PbI 2 film is prepared by spin-coating the precursor solution for 30 s at 1500 rpm, then dried for 60 s at 70 • C. Mixed solvent of ethanol/methanol is prepared by mixing absolute ethanol and methanol (HPLC) together with volume ratios of 5:0, 4:1, 3:2, and 2:3 respectively. The obtained solvents and corresponding perovskite films and solar cells fabricated using these solvents are referenced as 5V0, 4V1, 3V2, and 2V3 in the following discussions. Then 4 mg mL -1 CsI is dissolved into the mixed ethanol/methanol solvent via sonication, followed by 50 mg mL -1 FAI and 10 mg mL -1 MACl. For simplicity, the recipe for CsI, FAI, and MACl salts is taken from reference without further optimization  [20] . The obtained CsI, FAI, and MACl solution is spin-coated onto the PbI 2 film dynamically for 30 s at 1700 rpm. Resulting perovskite film is annealed for 15 min at 150 • C in the ambient atmosphere (relative humidity ~25%). The fabrication processes for the SnO 2 film, Spiro-OMeTAD film, and Ag electrode are exactly the same as our previous study, thus are not presented in detail here  [24] . 
 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Ultima IV), UV-vis absorbance spectrum (Lambda 650), and scanning electron microscope (SEM, Regulus 8220) are used to characterize the crystal phase, UV-vis absorbance, and planar morphology of the FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 perovskite films using our modified two-step sequential deposition method. Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photo-luminescence (TRPL) spectra of the FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 perovskite films deposited on glass substrates are measured using FS5 Spectrofluorometer. Current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the PSCs are measured using a Keithley 2450 source meter. The simulated AM 1.5G illumination is provided using XEF-300 solar simulator. If not specified, a metal mask of 0.1 cm 2 is used to define the effective area of our PSCs. Long-term stability is tested by measuring the J-V curves of the un-encapsulated PSCs under the AM 1.5G illumination (XEF-300) in the ambient atmosphere (relative humidity 40%~50%, temperature ~20 • C). After the measurement, the PSCs are kept in dark condition with relative humidity ~10%. Defect density is evaluated using space charge limited current model with an electron only device of FTO/SnO 2 /FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 /PCBM/Ag. The defect density is calculated using n trap = 2ε 0 εV TFL /eL 2 , where ε is relative dielectric constant of FA 1- x Cs x PbI 3 perovskite (ε = 46.9), and L is the thickness of the perovskite film (L = 600 nm). 
 Results and discussions CsI has shown much larger solubility in methanol compared with ethanol  [25, 26] , making it more feasible to prepared perovskite films using two-step sequential spin-coating method via dissolving CsI and organic salts in methanol. However, the high polarity of methanol can easily destroy the perovskite films, as can be seen in supporting information Fig.  S1 . To minimize the negative effects of methanol on the quality of perovskite films, a mixed ethanol and methanol solvent is used in our study. In the first step, the solubility of CsI in mixed ethanol/methanol solvent is studied. The ratios of ethanol/methanol are set to be 5:0 (5V0), 4:1 (4V1), 3:2 (3V2), and 2:3 (2V3) respectively. 4 mg mL -1 CsI is added into the mixed ethanol/methanol solvent, and sonicated for a few hours to ensure the dissolution of CsI as much as possible. As shown in Fig.  S2a , after a long time sonication, some CsI crystals still exist in the 5V0 solution due to the extremely low solubility of CsI in absolute ethanol. When a small amount of methanol is added into the ethanol solvent, the 4V1 solvent exhibits larger solubility of CsI, therefore, the remaining CsI crystals are diminished in Fig.  S2b . When the amount of methanol is further increased, the obtained mixed solvent can completely dissolve the CsI crystals in Figs.  S2c-d . Therefore, mixed ethanol/methanol solvent exhibits excellent solubility of CsI. Perovskite films are prepared via a modified two-step sequential spin-coating method. In our method, CsI is introduced into the FAI/ MACl organic salts solution using mixed ethanol/methanol solvent. Fig.  1a  shows the XRD patterns of the obtained perovskite films. Diffraction peaks at 14.0 • , 19.9 • , 24.4 • , 28.3 • , and 31.7 • can be assigned to FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 perovskite film, indicating the successful formation of perovskite film using our method  [16, 17] . An intensive PbI 2 peak at 12.7 • can also be observed. This phenomenon has also been widely observed in previous reports using two-step sequential spin-coating method due to the difficulty of the complete conversion of the PbI 2 to perovskite film  [18, 27] . Usually, the perovskite film exhibits the largest diffraction peak at ~14.0 • , however, in our study, the intensity of the diffraction peak at 24.4 • is much stronger than that at 14.0 • , indicating our mixed CsI/FAI/MACl solution can change the crystal growth orientation of the perovskite film  [27] . Fig.  1b  shows the enlarged view of the XRD patterns at ~14.0 • . The peak positions of PbI 2 at 12.7 • are nearly constant. However, with increasing methanol ratios in the mixed ethanol/methanol solvents, the peaks at ~14.0 • slightly move toward higher angles, which indicates more Cs + ions are incorporated into the FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 lattice due to the increased solubility of the mixed ethanol/methanol solvents  [15] . Fig.  1c  shows the UV-vis absorbance spectra of the FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 perovskite films. With increasing methanol ratios, the UV-vis absorbance spectra are first increased then slightly decreased. As can be seen, the 3V2 mixed solution can result in perovskite film with the largest UV-vis absorbance spectrum. Tauc plots derived from the UV-vis absorbance spectra are shown in Fig.  1d . Although Cs + ions concentrations are gradually increased in the FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 perovskite films, the corresponding band gaps from Tauc plots are nearly constant (E g = 1.55 eV). In fact, the overall Cs + concentrations in the FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 perovskite films are quite low due to the low CsI concentrations in the mixed ethanol/methanol solvents (≤4 mg mL -1 ), therefore, the resulting bandgaps are nearly the same. Morphologies of the FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 perovskite films are studied using SEM and shown in Fig.  2 . All the perovskite films exhibit compact morphologies which can fully cover the underlying SnO 2 electron transport layers. When the CsI concentrations in the mixed ethanol/ methanol solvents are relatively low (Fig.  2a ), small perovskite crystals are obtained. When CsI concentrations are increased (Fig.  2b-d ), the perovskite films exhibit much larger perovskite crystals. According to references, both addition of CsI in the PbI 2 precursor and in the organic salt solution can result in enlarged perovskite crystals  [16, 20] . Even post-treatment of the perovskite film with CsI solution can contribute to larger perovskite crystals  [28] . Therefore, we attribute the enlarged  perovskite crystals in our FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 films to the higher CsI concentrations in the mixed ethanol/methanol solvents when methanol ratios exceeding 40% in 3V2 and 2V3 mixed solvents. Cross-sectional SEM images of the FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 perovskite films are shown in supporting information Fig.  S3 . The film thicknesses of the perovskite films are estimated to be 600 nm for all the four perovskite films. Using these FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 perovskite films, PSCs with SnO 2 electron transport layer and Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer are fabricated. To ensure the reproducibility of our experiment, 15 devices are fabricated for each kind of PSCs. The open circuit voltage (V oc ), short circuit current density (J sc ), fill factor (FF), and PCE of these PSCs are statistically presented in Fig.  3 . The reference PSCs fabricated using 5V0 mixed solvent exhibit an average V oc of 1.086 V, J sc of 23.71 mA cm -2 , FF of 73.82%, and PCE of 19.00%, which agree quite well with previous report by Y. Chen  [20] . When methanol is added into ethanol, the 4V1 mixed solvent can produce PSCs with slightly increased PCEs, with average V oc , J sc , FF, and PCE of 1.111 V, 23.76 mA cm -2 , 73.32%, and 19.36% respectively. Further increasing the methanol ratio can result in superior performance for the PSCs. As can be seen, the 3V2 mixed solvent can produce PSCs with the highest PCE, exhibiting average V oc , J sc , FF, and PCE of 1.132 V, 24.02 mA cm -2 , 75.08% and 20.41% respectively. However, when too much methanol is used, the 2V3 mixed solvent would result in PCEs with much lower PCEs, exhibiting average V oc , J sc , FF, and PCE of 1.100 V, 23.79 mA cm -2 , 71.05%, and 18.59% respectively. The enhanced PCEs for the 4V1 and 3V2 PSCs compared with reference 5V0 PSCs might originate from the increased perovskite crystal sizes for the perovskite films, which could suppress the density of grain boundaries and corresponding defects located at the grain boundaries. However, when too much methanol is added, the mixed 2V3 solvent might degrade the perovskite film due to its high polarity and produce excessive PbI 2 , which is detrimental to the PCEs of the PSCs. To further demonstrate the advantages of our modified two-step spin-coating method for fabricating PSCs, mixed FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 PSCs are fabricated using PbI 2 +10% CsI precursor solution. Photovoltaic parameters of 10 typical PSCs are summarized in supporting information Table  S1 . The average V oc , J sc , FF, and PCE are 1.114 V, 23.90 mA cm -2 , 76.56%, and 20.39% respectively. It can be seen that PSCs fabricated using our modified two-step spin-coating method exhibit slightly higher PCEs compared with the traditional method. Fig.  4a  shows the best performance J-V curves for the 5V0 and 3V2 PSCs. For reference 5V0 PSCs, the reverse scan and forward scan PCEs are 20.01% (V oc = 1.114 V, J sc = 23.63 mA cm -2 , FF = 76.01%) and 18.77% (V oc = 1.103 V, J sc = 23.39 mA cm -2 , FF = 72.75%) respectively. The hysteresis index (HI) is calculated to be 6.20%  [29] . In contrast, our 3V2 PSC exhibits reverse PCE of 21.17% (V oc = 1.142 V, J sc = 24.12 mA cm -2 , FF = 76.87%) and forward PCE of 20.43% (V oc = 1.127 V, J sc = 24.11 mA cm -2 , FF = 75.20%). The obtained reverse PCE is 5.80% higher than that of reference 5V0 PSC. At the same time, the J-V hysteresis of the 3V2 PSC is also suppressed (HI = 3.50%) compared with reference 5V0 PSC (HI = 6.20%). Furthermore, we also fabricate PSCs with slightly larger effective area of 0.25 cm 2 . Photograph of a typical PSC is presented in the inset of Fig.  S4 . For PSCs with an effective area of 0.25 cm 2 , the obtained PCEs are greatly reduced due to their low FF in Fig.  S4 . However, the 3V2 PSC exhibits a champion PCE of 14.65%, which is much larger than that of 5V0 PSC (PCE = 10.72%). Therefore, PSCs fabricated using our modified two-step sequential deposition method exhibit superior performances. IPCE spectra for the 5V0 and 3V2 PSCs are shown in Fig.  4b . The 3V2 PSC exhibits superior photon-to-electron conversion efficiency in the whole range than 5V0 PSC, thus larger J sc value is expected for 3V2 PSC (integrated J sc 22.30 mA cm -2 ) compared with 5V0 PSC (integrated J sc 21.63 mA cm -2 ), which is only slightly lower than those from J-V measurement. Stability is an important issue for PSCs. Fig.  4c  shows the light soaking stability for our PSCs. The voltage biases corresponding to maximum power points in the reverse J-V curves are applied to the PSCs, then output current densities are measured during light soaking for 300 s. The output current density for 3V2 PSC is nearly constant, while that for 5V0 PSC slightly decays, indicating 3V2 PSC exhibits superior stability upon light soaking. At 250 s, the output current densities are 21.15 mA cm -2 and 22.02 mA cm -2 for the 5V0 and 3V2 PSCs, corresponding PCEs are 19.88% and 21.14% respectively. Fig.  4d  shows the long-term storage stability for our PSCs. After 30 days, the final PCEs of 5V0 and 3V2 PSCs are 87.28% and 98.31% of their initial PCEs. Therefore, 3V2 PSC exhibits superior long-term storage stability compared with reference 5V0 PSC. To probe the origin of superior PCE and stability for our 3V2 PSCs, the carrier recombination, defect density, and carrier life time for the 3V2 PSC and reference 5V0 PSC are further compared. Fig.  5a  shows the variation of V oc with light intensity for our PSCs. The V oc values exhibit a linear dependence upon the natural logarithm of the light intensity  [15] . The ideal factors can be calculated from the V oc vs light intensity curves. Obviously, the 3V2 PSC exhibits much lower ideal factor (n = 1.23) compared with reference 5V0 PSC (n = 1.75), indicating the charge carrier recombination in the 3V2 PSC is much lower than that in 5V0 PSC  [15, 20] . Defect density of the perovskite film is closely related to charge carrier recombination in PSC. In this study, defect densities of the perovskite films are evaluated using the commonly used space charge limited current (SCLC) model  [16, 17, 27] . Electron only devices of FTO/SnO 2 /FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 /PCBM/Ag are fabricated and the dark current-voltage curves of these devices are measured and shown in Fig.  5b . The trap-filled limited voltage (V TFL ) values are estimated to be 0.23 V and 0.12 V respectively for 5V0 and 3V2 perovskite films.  Corresponding defect densities are calculated to be 3.31 × 10 15 cm -3 and 1.73 × 10 15 cm -3 respectively. Clearly, the 3V2 perovskite film has much lower defect density compared with reference 5V0 perovskite film. The lowered defect density for the 3V2 perovskite film is beneficial to suppress the charge recombination rate in the corresponding PSC as discussed in Fig.  5a , thus superior PCE and stability is observed in the 3V2 PSCs. Steady state and time-resolved PL spectra of the perovskite films deposited on the glass substrates are measured and shown in Fig.  5c  and d . The 3V2 perovskite film exhibits much higher PL intensity compared with 5V0 perovskite film, indicating the non-radioactive recombination in the 3V2 perovskite film is much lower than that in the 5V0 perovskite film  [6] . At the same time, the peak position of 3V2 perovskite film (802.6 nm) is slightly blue shifted compared with that of 5V0 perovskite film (804.9 nm), which further confirms that more Cs + ion is incorporated into the 3V2 perovskite lattice. However, their small differences are negligible, therefore, the band gaps from Tauc plots are nearly the same. Carrier life time can be extracted from the time-resolved PL spectra. After fitting the curves using a bi-exponential function, the carrier life times are evaluated to be 145.2 ns and 220.2 ns for 5V0 and 3V2 perovskite films respectively. Clearly, the 3V2 perovskite film exhibits much longer carrier life time compared with reference 5V0 perovskite film, which can benefit the charge carrier separation and transportation in the corresponding perovskite films  [9, 21, 30] . Overall, our modified two-step sequential deposition method can result in more Cs + incorporation into the perovskite lattice and enlarged perovskite crystals, which can result in less defect density, longer carrier life time and suppressed charge carrier recombination. Therefore, the resulting 3V2 PSCs exhibit much superior PCE and stability compared with reference 5V0 PSCs. 
 Conclusions In summary, we have proposed a modified two-step sequential spincoating method to prepared FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 PSCs. The CsI is incorporated into the perovskite crystal lattice via dissolving CsI, FAI and MACl into a mixed solvent of ethanol and methanol. After adjust the ethanol/ methanol ratio, the mixed ethanol/methanol solvent exhibits excellent solubility of the CsI (4 mg mL -1 ), FAI and MACl, which can be used to fabricate high quality perovskite films with enlarged perovskite crystals, lowered defect density, and prolonged carrier life time. As a result, the champion PSCs can demonstrate a reverse PCE of 21.17% (cell area 0.1 cm 2 ) and 14.65% (cell area 0.25 cm 2 ) respectively using an optimized 3V2 ethanol/methanol solvent, which is much larger than the reference PSCs.
