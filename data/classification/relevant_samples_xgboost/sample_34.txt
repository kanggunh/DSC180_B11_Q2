Supplementary Note 1. Interfacial reactions and reactivity of MOs To investigate the degradation mechanism at MO/perovskite interfaces, we select a series of MOs that are commonly used in PSCs, including ZnOx, NiOx, SnOx, TiOx, SiOx, and AlOx. In general, the decomposition routes for the MO/perovskite interfaces can be cataloged into two reactions  1, 2  , as follow. 𝑀 ≥𝑛+ 𝑂 -+ 𝑅 -𝐻 + + 𝐼 -→ 𝑀 𝑛+ 𝑂𝐻 + 1 2 ⁄ 𝐼 2 (𝑔) + 𝑅(𝑔) 𝑀 𝑛+ 𝑂 -+ 𝑅 -𝐻 + → 𝑀 𝑛+ 𝑂𝐻 + +𝑅(𝑔) where 𝑅 -𝐻 + represents organic cations in perovskites (CH3NH2-H + in our case). The schematic diagram of the interfacial reactions is illustrated in Figure  1a . The undercoordinated oxygen species (O 2-) and metal ions (M n+ ) on the MO surface are likely to combine with negative and positive charges, respectively  3  . The basicity of the O 2-can initiate acid-base reactions when interfacing with perovskites generating gaseous ammonium [𝑅(𝑔)] via cation deprotonation (Equation  1 ). The more basicity of the MOs is, the stronger the deprotonation reactions are  4  . The other type of reaction is the redox reaction, where the high valence states (M ≥ n+ ) on the MO surface would induce proton abstraction  1  , as illustrated in equation 2. The reactivity of the MOs depends on the amount of M ≥ n+ sites presenting on the surface of MOs  RZnOx>RNiOx>RSnOx>RTiOx>RSiOx>RAlOx. We first look at the reactivity of the different MOs with perovskites. We deposit methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) films on different MOs and age the samples at 100 °C for 40 h in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. We observe the appearance of lead iodide (PbI2) X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks after aging (Supplementary Fig.  1c ). For the ZnOx sample, we see an obvious PbI2 peak after only 30 mins of aging, indicating a strong interfacial reaction which is in agreement with the previous study  6  . We calculate the peak intensity ratio of the perovskite/PbI2 peak (Supplementary Table  1 ) and plot the peak ratios in Supplementary Fig.  1e  a The reactivity is evaluated from the changes in the integral area of the O-H peak ratios before and after the reaction. deposited on FTO/NiOx (Supplementary Fig.  15 ). Based on these findings, we believe that the increased Ni 3+ /Ni 2+ ratio at high temperatures may be attributed to harmful effects of TMA on NiOx surface. The presence of a high concentration of Ni 3+ defects at the interface may cause carrier recombination, which explains the decreased PLQY and TRPL lifetimes, as well as the reduced devices performance. As a result, we choose to use 25 °C for ALD deposition, and use 2 and 3 cycles, respectively, for the AlOx and SiOx deposition. The device optimization results are presented in Supplementary Figs. 16-17 and Supplementary Tables  4 5 . Supplementary Table  4 . Binding energies and relative composition of nickel oxidation species obtained from peak fitting of the Ni 2p simulation, the total defect density of defect Ⅱ changes from 5×10 16 cm -3 to 5×10 22 cm -3 exponentially, so that the number of fixed charge changes from 1×10 9 cm -2 to 1 ×10 15 cm -2 , which is the result of the total defect density of defect Ⅱ multiplied by the actual thickness of IL (~0.2 nm). The total defect density of the IL/perovskite interface (Nit) changes from 1×10 10 cm -2 to 1×10 13 cm -2 . Other parameters related to simulation are listed in the following two tables (Supplementary Tables  8  and 9 ).  
 Supplementary For the NiOx sample, we focus on the changes in Ni 2+ peaks. SO-H is the integrated peak area of the O-H band, and Stotal is the sum of the integral area of O-H and O-M bands.

 Table 1 . 1 . Higher ratios indicate the higher reactivity of the MOs. The XRD results are in line with the proposed mechanism. For the NiOx sample, the ratio of the Ni 3+ /Ni 2+ peaks decrease from 0.92 to 0.71 upon reaction, indicating that Ni 3+ is partially reduced to Ni 2+ through the redox reaction with MA +9 . For the acid-base reaction type MOs, we focus on the O-H and M-O signals and evaluate the reactivity of the MOs by comparing the changes in the ratio of the O-H peak area to the total peak areas (SO-H/Stotal) before and after the aging (Supplementary Table1). The ZnOx exhibits the highest reactivity amongst the MOs RZnOx>RNiOx>RSnOx>RTiOx>RSiOx>RAlOx, which verifies the proposed mechanism of the interfacial reactions between the MOs and perovskites.In addition, we also find the conducted the stability test on NiOx, NiOx/SiOx, NiOx/AlOx encapsulated devices at 65 o C for 500 h, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 4. It can be clearly observed that the long-term stability of NiOx, NiOx/SiOx, NiOx/AlOx devices conform to the reactivity of MOs and perovskites: RNiOx>RSiOx>RAlOx. The cation size, acid-base property, and strength of MOs and the peak area change in XRD (perovskite/PbI2), FTIR(O-H), and XPS(O-H) after aging. Since the hydroxyl (O-H) groups are one of the major decomposition products for both of the two types of reactions, we characterize the O-H groups via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in Supplementary Fig. 1d. We age MAPbI3 films deposited on different MOs at 100 °C for 76 h in a nitrogen-filled glovebox and compare with the pristine samples. The broad bands near 3485 cm -1 are attributed to the stretching mode of O-H 7, 8   . The ZnOx-MAPbI3 sample displays a large amount of O-H after only 3 hours of aging, suggesting the high reactivity of ZnOx. For other MOs, we observe a much slow rising of the O-H band after aging, and the AlOx exhibit the least O-H changes. We plot the changes in the O-H band area in Supplementary Fig. 1e and summarize the results in Supplementary Table 1 . To further understand the reaction of the MOs with organic cations in perovskites, we spin coat methylammonium iodide (MAI) solutions (20 mg ml -1 in acetonitrile) directly onto the MO substrates and anneal at 100 °C for 15 min. The aprotic solvent acetonitrile was selected to dissolve MAI to exclude the influence of other proton sources during the test. Upon the MAI treatment, obvious chemical reactions occur for the ZnOx, NiOx, SnOx, and TiOx samples, while we do not inspect apparent changes for the SiOx and AlOx samples (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Supplementary Fig. 3 shows X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of these samples. while the AlOx displays the lowest reactivity. Collectively, through the XRD, FTIR, and XPS characterizations, we confirm that the reactivity of the MOs can be sorted as

Title: Inverted perovskite solar cells with over 2,000 h operational stability at 85 °C using fixed charge passivation
High-quality defect passivation at perovskite/charge extraction layer heterojunctions in perovskite solar cells is critical to solar device operation. Here we report a 'physical' passivation method by producing fixed charges with aluminium oxide (negative fixed charges) or silicon oxide (positive fixed charges) interlayers grown by atomic layer deposition at perovskite/ charge extraction layer heterojunctions. Through experimental and modelling approaches, we find that the fixed charge passivation (FCP) modifies carrier concentration distribution near the heterojunctions, which reduces interface recombination and photovoltage losses. The strong acidity of aluminium oxide simultaneously shields perovskites from being deprotonated by the nickel oxide at high temperatures. The optimized FCP device shows an efficiency of 22.5% with over 60 mV improvement in photovoltage in contrast to the control devices. Importantly, the encapsulated FCP devices, operated at the maximum power point, exhibit almost no efficiency loss after ageing under 1-sun illumination at 85 °C for 2,000 h in ambient air.
Solar energy conversion devices based on earth-abundant metal-halide perovskite semiconductors could be a potential game changer in the field of photovoltaics (PVs) due to their soaring power conversion efficiencies and potentially much lower levelized cost of energy than the established PV technologies  [1] [2] [3]  . However, for perovskite PVs to compete as commercial solar products, especially for grid-level electricity production, the efficiency of large-area modules fabricated based on scaling-up manufacturing processes, must increase considerably. In addition, the stability of these modules must be comparable to the leading PV technologies, which typically require a guaranteed lifespan of more than two decades and that the electricity generation is stable throughout the period. Scaling-up perovskite PV module manufacturing widely employs metal oxides (MOs) as charge extraction materials by dint of their high carrier mobility, low production cost, excellent material stability, scalability and reproducibility  4, 5  . However, given the high reactivity of organic cations, MOs may cause the decomposition of perovskites due to the presence of undercoordinated atoms and dangling bonds at MO surfaces  5, 6  . For instance, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) comprising titanium oxide (TiO x ) exhibit good thermal stability but poor ultraviolet (UV) stability due to the generation of oxygen vacancies on the TiO x surface upon UV irradiation, which triggers rapid photocatalysis degradation of perovskites  7  . The strong basicity of zinc oxide (ZnO x ), along with the presence of surface hydroxyl and acetic acid groups, results in a strong abstraction of protons from perovskites  8  . By contrast, tin oxide (SnO x ) is an excellent n-type electron extraction material delivering high device efficiencies. However, interfacial decomposition still occurs in SnO x -based devices at high temperatures  9  , but not as strong Article  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01377-7  nearly 0% decrease in efficiency after 2,000 hours of maximum power point (MPP) tracking under one sun illumination at 85 °C in ambient air. 
 Results and discussion 
 Interfacial reactions and reactivity of MOs We first investigate the interfacial reactions between the MOs and perovskites and give our results in Supplementary Figs.  1 2 3 4 5 and Supplementary Table  1  and present associated discussion in Supplementary Notes 1 and 2. From the MOs explored, we find that the interfacial reaction for the ZnO x , SnO x , TiO x , SiO x and AlO x cases are dominated by acid-base reaction, while the reaction for the NiO x is mainly induced by redox reaction. On the basis of various characterizations, we rank the reactivity (R) of the MOs as: R ZnO x > R NiO x > R SnO x > R TiO x > R SiO x > R AlO x . With the knowledge of the surface reactivity of the MOs, we proceed to integrate these MOs into solar cell devices. Despite the low reactivities of SiO x and AlO x , they cannot extract charges due to their insulating nature  23  . We therefore use them as interlayers to modify the NiO x /perovskite interface in inverted cells. The SiO x and AlO x are fabricated via ALD and the cell structure is fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/NiO x /(SiO x or AlO x )/perovskite/C 60 /bathocuproine (BCP)/Cu. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Supplementary Fig.  6 ) and electron dispersive spectroscopy mapping (Supplementary Fig.  7 ) analysis show that a few cycles of ALD can already form uniform and homogenous AlO x and SiO x layers on NiO x . We first assess if the interlayers have any impacts on the device performance of the fresh cells and then examine their influences on device stability. Figure  1a  shows the current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the high-efficiency devices. Both the SiO x and AlO x modifications show positive impacts on device performance. From the statistics of cell characteristics (Fig.  1b , Supplementary Fig.  8  and Supplementary Table  2 ), we observe that the efficiency gain is attributed to the enhanced open-circuit voltage (V oc ). We also find that the cell performance is highly associated with the ALD cycles and temperatures. We show the optimization of AlO x and SiO x devices in Supplementary Figs. 9-17, Supplementary Tables  3 4 5 6 and Supplementary Note 3. Moreover, the average V oc for the AlO x devices is higher than that for the SiO x devices. Given that both the AlO x and SiO x are simply acting as interfacial reaction blocking interlayers, the holes should be hopping through these ultrathin layers and then extracted by the NiO x layer. It is therefore difficult to explain why the photovoltages are different. To understand the improved photovoltages, we measure X-ray diffraction (XRD; Supplementary Fig.  1c ) and atomic force microscopy (Supplementary Fig.  18a-c ) of the perovskite films deposited on SiO x and AlO x , but we do not inspect any noticeable changes. Photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) measurement results (Fig.  1c ) suggest the AlO x modification mainly reduces the carrier recombination at the NiO x -perovskite interface and has less impact on the C 60 /perovskite interface (Supplementary Fig.  19  and Supplementary Table  7 ). The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the neat perovskite film show a typical monoexponentially decay, indicating trap-mediated non-radiative recombination in the film (Fig.  1d ). With the NiO x , the TRPL spectrum displays a biexponential decay with a fast and a slow component. The fast component can be originated from the charge extraction process and the slow component is more related to defect-induced non-radiative recombination  10  . The dotted lines represent the mono-exponential fitting of a slow component to obtain the PL lifetimes  24  . By stark contrast, the AlO x sample exhibits a much longer lifetime of slow decay (~2.5 μs) in comparison with the SiO x sample (~1.1 μs) suggesting that there is little non-radiative recombination loss at the AlO x interface  16  . However, as we discussed in Supplementary Notes 1 and 2, both SiO x and AlO x show acidity and should be too inert to react with perovskites. It seems that the longer PL lifetimes in the AlO x samples cannot be simply interpreted by the as in ZnO x -based ones. For the p-type MOs, nickel oxide (NiO x ) is widely adopted as a hole extraction material. Boyd et al. revealed that Ni ≥3+ sites on the NiO x surface cause cation deprotonation and iodide oxidation at elevated temperatures  5  . Our recent study showed that NiO x -based inverted PSCs degrade to 0% efficiency after exposing to a total UV dose of 35 kWh m -2 indicating its failure of passing the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61215 and 61646 tests  10  . Collectively, state-of-the-art MOs display varying degrees of reactivity when interfacing with perovskites, which can generate interfacial defects and ultimately lead to deterioration in device efficiency and longevity, especially at elevated temperatures. Generally, the presence of interfacial defects would increase the surface recombination rate, U s , which can be described by the Shockley-Read-Hall formalism  11  , U s = 1 1 σn ps + 1 σp ns v th N it , where n s and p s represent the surface density of electrons or holes, respectively; σ n and σ p are the electron and hole capture cross section, respectively; v th is the thermal velocity of the electron, and N it is the interface defect density. To date, extensive studies have been dedicated to reducing the defects at MO/perovskite interfaces (that is, N it ). For example, assorted organic interlayers, such as Lewis acid-base organic salts  12  , dye molecules  13  and self-assembly monolayers  10, 14, 15  are developed to passivate the interfacial defects. However, these organic interlayers need to be very thin (a few to tens of nanometres) and are typically deposited via spin coating, which unfortunately is not scalable as it would be needed for up-scaling fabrication  16  . In addition, the fabricated cells must guarantee a long service life, which requires the passivation to be stable enough to withstand various stressing factors during the long-term operation  17, 18  . These evolutions necessitate the development of efficient, industrial-production compatible and long-term stable contact interface passivation. In addition to reducing the N it , another approach for passivation would be decreasing the first term in the expression, that is, Because both electrons and holes participate in recombination, the devices would undergo the highest recombination rate when the concentration of electrons and holes at the interface equals the capture cross sections of electrons and holes, that is, p s n s = σ n σ p . In this context, by increasing the ratio of hole/electron at the perovskite/hole extraction layer interfaces and vice verses for the perovskite/electron extraction layer interface, a lower U s can be achieved, so-called 'physical passivation', which is distinct from the 'chemical passivation' enabled by organic molecules as mentioned earlier. Previous studies have demonstrated that physical passivation can be achieved by the insertion of a thin layer of molybdenum oxide or lithium fluoride at the perovskite/electron extraction layer interface, due to the interfacial dipole polarization  19, 20  . Another approach is to induce fixed charges at interfaces, which has been widely adopted in silicon-based solar cells but has yet to be demonstrated in PSCs  21, 22  . In this work, we systematically investigate a series of MOs with a focus on their reactivity with perovskites and demonstrate a method of fixed charge induced passivation in PSCs. We first experimentally demonstrate that the strength of basicity and acidity governs the interfacial reactions between the MOs and perovskites. By depositing a thin layer of aluminium oxide (AlO x ) via atomic layer deposition (ALD) at perovskite/charge extraction layer interfaces, we can suppress the interfacial reactions, owing to the acidity of AlO x . Furthermore, we prove that the AlO x and silicon oxide (SiO x ) can fix negative and positive charges, respectively, at the MO/perovskite interfaces, which alter the distribution of holes and electrons near the interface, thus enabling passivation. The best NiO x -based inverted device using the FCP shows a high efficiency of 22.5%. Importantly, the FCP is highly stable against harsh device ageing conditions. The best encapsulated devices display Article  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01377-7  decrease of N it as is usually observed in the case of interface modifications  24  . Additional processes/mechanisms might be occurring in the AlO x -treated samples. 
 Fixed charge passivation In crystalline silicon-based solar cells, SiO x and AlO x have been well recognized to enable fixed charges at silicon surfaces  22, 25  . We assume that the AlO x and SiO x may have similar fixed charge effects in perovskite solar cells. To validate our hypothesis, we measure capacitancevoltage (C-V) curves (Fig.  2a ) of metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) structured devices  26  . The device architecture is FTO/NiO x /(AlO x or SiO x )/perovskite as shown in Supplementary Fig 20 . Taking the derivatives of the C-V curves, the extreme values stand for the flat band voltage  27, 28  , as shown in Fig.  2b . When negative fixed charges appear at the interface, more holes gather therein, resulting in a band bending at the interface. As a result, we need to apply more bias voltage to the semiconductor side to revert to a flat band and vice versa for positive fixed charges. Supplementary Note 4 describes the characterization of the interface energy band variation using C-V measurements. The average flat band voltages for NiO x , NiO x /SiO x and NiO x /AlO x devices are found to be -0.42 V, -0.59 V and 0.83 V, respectively. The distribution of the flat band voltages is shown in Supplementary Fig. 21. We therefore confirm that the SiO x enables positive fixed charges while the AlO x is capable of fixing negative charges at the interface, consistent with observations in silicon cells  29, 30  . We also calculate the amount of the fixed charges (Q f ) by the following formula  26  : Q f = C in (V MS -V fb ) A × q , where C in is the intrinsic capacitance estimated from the accumulation region of the MOS devices; V MS represents the potential difference between the metal and semiconductor, obtained by the work function (W f ) difference between the FTO (4.6 eV)  26  and the perovskite (Supplementary Fig.  18d -f and Supplementary Table  8 ); V fb is flat band voltage; A is electrode area and q is elementary change. The average Q f is calculated to be -7.43 × 10 11 cm -2 for the AlO x and 9.47 × 10 10 cm -2 for the SiO x . Detailed calculation parameters for the calculations are given in Supplementary Table  7 . Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) is highly sensitive to changes in surface electrostatic potential, which can be easily influenced by fixed charges  31  . We show the mapping of KPFM voltage (V KPFM )  32  of the NiO x , SiO x and AlO x films in Fig.  2c-e , with the atomic force microscopy morphology in Supplementary Fig.  22  and the distribution of V KPFM in Supplementary Fig.  23 . The average V KPFM is -0.027 V for the AlO x sample, which is higher than the -0.143 V for the NiO x sample. In contrast, the SiO x sample shows a lower average V KPFM of -0.198 V. The presence of negative fixed charges on the surface would increase the electrostatic potential, leading to a higher V KPFM 
 33 . The KPFM results further reinforce the presence of fixed charges at the interfaces. The negative fixed charge of AlO x is thought to originate from the presence of aluminium vacancies and oxygen interstitials acting as acceptor-type defects on the surface  34, 35  . The positive fixed charges of SiO x are due to the existence of donor-type oxygen vacancies  29, 36  . We schematically draw the impacts of the fixed charges on the electronic band alignment at the NiO x /perovskite interface in Fig.  2f, g .    https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01377-7   P V K N iO x / P V K N iO x / S iO x / P V K N iO x / A l O x / P V K 5 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Voltage (V) V oc (V) 0. The negative fixed charges induced by AlO x would attract holes while repelling electrons at the interface. The hole and electron concentration at the interface will then deviate from the capture cross section ratio ( p s n s ≠ σ n σ p ), leading to a smaller U s . In contrast, when positive fixed charges appear at the NiO x /perovskite interface, electrons are likely to pile up at the heterojunction leading to unwanted carrier recombination, which should be unfavourable for device operation. In addition, this also explains the increased PLQY and extended TRPL lifetime with AlO x because the negative fixed charges attract holes while concurrently repelling electrons away from the interface  37  . Returning to the improved device performance, we theoretically assess the fundamental limitations of perovskite solar cells with different amounts of N it and Q f (ref. 38). Calculation details are described in Supplementary Note 5 and Supplementary Tables and 10. On the basis of previous literature  [39] [40] [41]  , we choose three plausible N it values for representative case studies (1 × 10 13 cm -2 for a highly defective interface, 3 × 10 12 cm -2 for a medium defective interface and 1 × 10 12 cm -2 for a less defective interface) and study the impacts of Q f on J-V characteristics (Fig.  3a-c ). When Q f decreases from +1 × 10 to -1 × 10 15 cm -2 , we observe improved V oc in all three scenarios, suggesting that surface recombination velocity is effectively reduced with increasing number of negative fixed charges. It is worth noting that different values of N it will lead to different thresholds of Q f . The J-V curves of the devices tend to saturate at a high Q f ~ -1 × 10 13 cm -2 when the interface is highly defective (Fig.  3a ), while saturating at a  NiO x NiO x /SiO x NiO x /AlO x V KPFM = -0.143 V V KPFM = -0.198 V V KPFM = -0.027 V h + e - e - e - e - e - smaller Q f ~ -1 × 10 12 cm -2 in the medium N it scenario (Fig.  3b ) and at the lowest Q f ~ -1 × 10 11 cm -2 for the smallest N it (Fig.  3c ). Furthermore, we plot the variations of power conversion efciency (PCE) of the device with different Q f in these three N it scenarios (Fig.  3d ). The PCE hardly changes at low -Q f (|Q f | < 1 × 10 10 cm -2 ) and gamut +Q f and is largely improved at higher -Q f (|Q f | > 1 × 10 10 cm -2 ). Combining the experimental data (Fig.  2a, b ) and the simulation results, we find that the Q f for SiO x (9.47 × 10 10 cm -2 ) is an order of magnitude lower than the values that can affect the device performance. Therefore, we do not see an efficiency drop in the SiO x -based solar cells (Fig.  1a ). By contrast, the Q f for AlO x (-7.43 × 10 11 cm -2 ) is sufficient to impact the device performance considerably. Because the benefit of a fixed charge for device performance only reflects in relatively high -Q f , we focus our following simulation in this region (|Q f | > 1 × 10 9 cm -2 ). We show the impact of Q f on the electron and hole concentrations in Supplementary Fig.  24  and plot the ratio of hole/electron concentration against positions in devices in Fig.  3e . Clearly, the hole/electron concentration ratio increases mainly in the vicinity of the perovskite/ hole extraction layer interface with increasing number of negative fixed charges. As shown in Supplementary Fig.  25 , the increased hole/ electron ratio leads to an apparent band bending at the interface, where the valence band bends upward closer to p-quasi Fermi level (E fp ), while the distance between the conduction band and n-quasi Fermi level (E fn ) does not change a lot. This is due to the increasing number of holes populating the VB. When the Q f exceeds 10 12 cm -2 , the V oc can be increased up to nearly 200 mV (Supplementary Fig.  26a ) and only subtle changes in the short-circuit current density (J sc ) (Supplementary Fig.  26b ). This is in good agreement with the measured device performance. In Fig.  3f , we present the variation of PCE against N it and Q f . When the N it surpasses 10 12 cm -2 , the device efficiency drops dramatically with increasing N it , due to the defect-induced non-radiative recombination. h + h + h + h + h + SiO x However, when the Q f increases to over 10 12 cm -2 , the PCE quickly climbs up despite the high concentration of interface defects. In summary, the fixed charges at the interface change the carrier concentration near the interface, rendering a lower U s , which contribute to the improved V oc . 
 Long-term stability Having demonstrated the low reactivity and fixed charge ability of AlO x , we systematically optimize our devices and achieve a champion PCE of 22.5% and a steady-state power output of 21.6%, in contrast to the PCE of 19.8% (steady-state power output of 19.0%) for the control device (Fig.  4a, b ). More device characteristics are given in Supplementary Figs. 27-29 and Supplementary Table  11 . The fixed charge passivation is also proven to be effective in wide-bandgap cells (Supplementary Figs. 30-33 and Supplementary Table  12 ), indicating its universality and potential applications in tandem solar cells. We now proceed to age high-efficiency encapsulated devices at MPP under one sun illumination at a high temperature of 85 °C in ambient air (relative humidity ~ 50%), following the test protocols of the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS-L3)  42  . We present the results in Fig.  4c  and Supplementary Fig.  34 . The efficiency of the control device decreases monotonically in the first 500 h and drops drastically afterward. Excitingly, the AlO x devices show almost no efficiency loss after 2,000 h of ageing. We also provide the stability test energy yield of the devices  43  (Supplementary Fig.  35 ) and stability details in Supplementary Table  13 . We compare our result with the thermal stability data reported over the past five years, as shown in Fig.  4d  and Supplementary Table  14 . It can be seen that in the thermal stability test (MPP or not), our devices show excellent thermal stability. To gain in-depth understanding of the degradation process, we employ mass spectrometry to probe the volatile products generated during ageing by monitoring the organic molecules released from the Voltage (V) Q f (cm -2 ) Q f (cm -2 ) Q f (cm -2 ) -1 × 10 13 cm -2 to -1 × 10  N it = 1 × 10 13 cm -2 N it = 1 × 10 13 cm -2 Relatively high defect density N it = 3 × 10 12 cm -2 N it = 3 × 10 12 cm -2 Relatively medium defect density N it = 1 × 10 12 cm -2 N it = 1 × 10 12 cm -2 Relatively low defect density 1 × 10 1 × 1 0 15 1 × 1 0  14  1 × 1 0  13  1 × 1 0  11  1 × 1 0  12  1 × 1 perovskite films deposited on the NiO x and AlO x substrates  [44] [45] [46]     47  . Supplementary Fig.  36  summarizes the peak area of the mass spectrum of the organic products after ageing. The mass spectra unambiguously suggest that the AlO x samples produce fewer volatile products than the NiO x samples due to the largely mitigated redox reaction. This again proves the excellent stability of the AlO x /perovskite interface. Our findings align with recent studies  48, 49  that have shown that achieving high thermal stability in inverted cells can be realized through deliberate modifications of the interface between NiO x and perovskite layers. 0 10 1 × 1 0 9 1E11 1E12 1E13 PC E (% ) N it ( c m -2 ) -Q f ( c m To inspect the impact of AlO x modification on ion migration in devices, we measure double-injection current in the fresh and aged samples (Supplementary Fig.  37 ).

 Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01377-7   which could be attributed to the ionic current caused by the migration of ionic species  50  . After ageing, the control device exhibits apparently increased slow-responded ionic migration. In contrast, the increase of the ionic current in AlO x device is largely suppressed, implying less ion migration. This reduced ion migration could be attributed to various factors, including mitigation of defects at the NiO x /perovskite interface and the effects of fixed charges. We acknowledge that the Coulomb field generated by fixed charges can potentially influence charged species, particularly in the case of perovskite materials with significant ion migration. Perovskite materials contain defect ions with both positive and negative charges, and the impact of fixed charges in AlO x on these charged species can vary. At present, it is challenging to determine the precise effect of fixed charges on other charged species. Furthermore, we confirm that the fixed charge effect does not change apparently after ageing (Supplementary Figs.  38  and 39 ), which is reasonable because the fixed charges are the intrinsic property of AlO x and should not change drastically over time. After carefully analysing the results, we find that even though we detected a small number of decomposition products in the mass spectra and observe a slight increase in the double-injection current after ageing, there was no obvious decrease in efficiency despite stressing at a high temperature of 85 °C. We assume that during ageing, the external stressing factors, such as light, electric biasing and high temperatures, would still cause decompositions at the NiO x /perovskite interface, but the decomposition rate is reduced due to the 'chemical isolation' provided by AlO x . Generally, recombination through defects is a process where electrons recombine with holes through defect levels in the bandgap. We postulate that even if there are some defect states generated during long-term ageing, the electron density near the perovskite/ AlO x interface would be low due to the negative fixed charges induced by AlO x , which repulse electrons from the interface. As a result, the chance of hole-electron recombination at the generated defects would be largely reduced and we therefore observe a nearly 0% efficiency loss even under harsh ageing conditions (85 °C MPP tracking in the air). 
 Conclusions In conclusion, we demonstrate a scalable, thermally stable passivation method utilizing AlO x for efficient and long-term stable MO-based solar cells. On the one hand, due to the strong acidity of AlO x , the chemical reactions between NiO x and perovskite can be largely mitigated. On the other hand, owing to its negative fixed charge property, insertion of AlO x at the NiO x /perovskite interface can effectively alter the carrier proportion at the interface away from the capture cross section and reduce recombination losses. As a result, the AlO x -treated device shows improved efficiency and superior stability with almost no efficiency loss after MPP tracking under one sun illumination at 85 °C for 2,000 h. Our work represents another breakthrough towards efficient and stable perovskite-based PV technology, and the atomic layer deposition that is used for the passivation layer fabrications can be directly transferred to industrial manufacturing.

 MOs preparation The NiO x films were prepared via a sol-gel method as described in the previous work  48  . We weighed 32.11 mg Ni(acac) 2 in ambient air (≤50% relative humidity(RH)) and add 1 ml of anhydrous ethanol to the N 2 glovebox. Then, the solution was transferred to ambient air (≤50% RH) to add 17 μl of HCl. The solution was stirred overnight under dark conditions in ambient air. Before use, the solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter. The solution was spin coated on FTO substrates at 4,000 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. The entire deposition process was carried out in a dry box (≤30% RH). Then, the samples were transferred to a 180 °C preheating hotplate in ambient air (≤50% RH) for 10 min, followed by heating at 400 °C for 45 minutes. After annealing, the NiO x samples were transferred to the N 2 glovebox until they reached room temperature. The NiO x nanoparticles were synthesized based on a previously reported method  51  . NiO x nanoparticles (20 mg ml -1 ) were dissolved in deionized water, stirred overnight, then filtered with 0.22 μm PTFE filter. The solution was spin coated on substrates at 2,000 rpm for 60 s. The films were then annealed at 150 °C for 20 min in air. The AlO x films were deposited within the ALD system (MNT Micro and Nanotech). The precursor and substrate temperatures were set to 25 °C. Argon (20 standard cubic centimetre per minute (sccm)) was used as the carrier gas. Water and trimethylaluminium (TMA) were used as the oxygen and aluminium sources, respectively. Pulse and purge times were 20 ms and 50 s, respectively, for TMA and 20 ms and 55 s, respectively, for H 2 O. The total deposition cycle is two cycles, corresponding to 0.2-0.5-nm-thick films. The SiO x films were deposited at 25 °C by the same ALD system as well. Argon (20 sccm) was used as carrier gas. Ozone and tris(dimethylamino)silane were used as the oxygen and silicon sources for SiO x , respectively. Pulse and purge times are 200 ms and 20 s, respectively, for tris(dimethylamino) silane and 5,000 ms and 20 s, respectively, for ozone. The intervals between the deposition tris(dimethylamino)silane and ozone were 5 s. We deposit three cycles of SiO x , corresponding to 0.2-0.5 nm-thick films. The TiO x films were prepared by the following sol-gel method. We dissolved 350 μl titanium isopropoxide and 35 μl HCl (2 M) in 500 μl ethanol. The mixed solution was then dripped into 500 μl ethanol very slowly while stirring. The solution was further stirred overnight at room temperature. The solution was spin coated at 2,000 rpm for 60 s in air, dried at 150 °C for 10 min and then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min in air. The ZnO x nanoparticle solution was prepared following the previous work  52  . The solutions were spin coated at 500 rpm for 10 s and then 2,000 r.p.m for 40 s in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The films were dried at 180 °C for 10 min. We repeated the process four times to obtain the final ZnO x films. The SnO x nanoparticle solution is diluted twice with deionized water and stirred overnight. To obtain SnO x films, we spin the nanoparticle solution at 500 rpm for 5 s; 2,000 rpm for the 60 s and then dried at 150 °C for 20 min in air. We repeated this process two times to achieve the final SnO x film. 
 Perovskite films and solar cell fabrication The Cs 0.05 FA 0.79 MA 0.16 PbI 3 perovskite precursor solution were prepared by dissolving the 622.36 mg PbI 2 , 34.33 mg MAI, 17.53 mg CsI and 183.40 mg FAI in 1 ml mixed solvent (4:1 v:v) of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), respectively. The precursor solutions were stirred overnight at room temperature in a nitrogen-filled glovebox and filtered with a 0.45 μm PTFE filter before use. FTO substrates (7 Ω per square) were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with detergent, deionized water and ethanol for 10 minutes each. Before film deposition, the FTO substrates were treated with ultraviolet ozone for 15 min. The perovskite solutions were then spun on substrates at 1,000 rpm for 10 s and 4,000 rpm for 40 s. Chlorobenzene (150 μl) was added dropwise onto the substrate 5 s before the end. The substrates were then placed on a pre-heated hotplate and annealed at 100 °C for 1 h. Finally, C 60 (25 nm), BCP (3 nm) and copper electrode (100 nm) were deposited sequentially using thermal evaporation under Article  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01377-7  a high vacuum (≤8 × 10 -5 Pa). The chamber temperature was controlled under 25 °C during the whole evaporation process. We use this perovskite composition for characterization and long-term stability studies. For the optimized devices in Fig.  4a , we use Cs 0.05 FA 0.9 MA 0.05 PbI 3 perovskites as the photoactive layers, and the precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving the 622.36 mg PbI 2 , 10.73 mg MAI, 17.53 mg CsI and 208.94 mg FAI in a 1 ml mixed solvent (4:1 v:v) of DMF and DMSO, respectively. The deposition procedures for the perovskite and the subsequent layers are the same as before. For the preparation of wide-bandgap perovskite devices, we adopt the NiO x nanoparticles to fabricate the hole transporting layer. The 1 M FA 0.8 Cs 0.2 Pb(I 1-0.35 Br 0.35 ) 3 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.8 mmol FAI, 0.2 mmol CsI, 0.475 mmol PbI 2 and 0.525 mmol PbBr 2 in 1 ml mixed solvent (3:1 v:v) of DMF and DMSO. Then 6.46 mg (2 mol% relative to Pb) Pb(SCN) 2 was added into the solution. The perovskite precursor solution was stirred for 12 hours before using. The solution was spin coated at 500 rpm for 2 s and 4,000 rpm for 60 s with 700 μl diethyl ether dripped slowly at the 25 s in the second spinning step. The substrates were then placed on a pre-heated hotplate and annealed at 60 °C for 5 min, 100 °C for 10 min. The GABr solution (2 mg ml -1 ), dissolved in isopropanol, was spin coated on the surface of perovskite and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. Finally, C 60 (20 nm), BCP (7 nm) and silver electrode (100 nm) were deposited sequentially using thermal evaporation under a high vacuum (≤8 × 10 -5 Pa). The chamber temperature was controlled under 25 °C during the whole evaporation process. 
 Device characterizations X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi instrument with a monochromatic Mg K Alpha (1.254 keV) X-ray source, and the samples were measured under an ultrahigh vacuum. The binding energies were calibrated using the C (1 s) carbon peak (284.8 eV). All the high-resolution spectra were obtained under constant analyser energy mode with a pass energy of 30 eV and step size of 0.05 eV. XRD patterns were carried out by a Rigaku Smart lab 3 kW XRD (Rigaku Ltd.) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm). The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy spectra of Supplementary Fig.  1d  were characterized by using Thermo Fisher Nicolet iS10. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy spectra of Supplementary Fig.  5  was obtained by using Bruker Invenio-R spectrometer with attenuated total reflection mode with mercury-cadmium-telluride detector cooled by liquid nitrogen. The TRPL spectra were recorded with a time-correlated single-photon counter (PicoQuant GmbH, TimeHarp 260), excited with a picosecond diode laser (640 nm, LDH-P-C-640B) at a repetition rate of 125 kHz. The laser excitation fluence is 3.2 nJ cm -2 . The raw data and the background signal of TRPL are given in Supplementary Fig. 40. The external quantum efficiency spectra were measured using a Zolix-SCS600 system, calibrated by a calibrated crystalline Si reference cell. The operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry system (Shanghai LingLu Instrument) contained a PrismaPlus quadrupole mass spectrometer from Pfeiffer Vacuum and custom-build Swagelok cells. C-V measurements were applied by an LCR meter (TH2838, Tonghui). The frequency used in testing was 1 MHz and the scan range from -1.5 V to 0.5 V for NiO x and NiO x /SiO x samples and -0.5 V to 1.5 V for the NiO x /AlO x sample. The scan rate was 25 mV s -1 . Double-injection current measurement: the devices were biased with a modulated forward bias voltage of 1 V, which was generated with an arbitrary function generator (Agilent, 33612 A). The repetition rate used in test was 50 Hz. Then the current transients were recorded with a digital oscilloscope (Rigol, DS4054). The type of KPFM is SPM9700HT, which is an atomic force microscopy based measuring the contact potential difference between sample surface and tip to get the work function. The J-V curves were measured by a 2400 Series Source Meter (Keithley Instruments) in the air under simulated AM 1.5 G sunlight at 100 mW cm -2 irradiation. The light source is a AAA-class Xenon lamp solar simulator (WACOM; WXS-100S-5), and the intensity was calibrated using a Fraunhofer ISE-calibrated silicon reference cell with KG1 filter. The mismatch factor was calculated to be less than 1% and applied to calibrate the AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm -2 equivalent irradiance. The active area of the solar cells is 0.07 cm 2 , defined by an opaque aperture mask. The J-V curves were measured at a scan rate of 200 mV s -1 (with no preconditioning) in ambient air (~25 °C and relative humidity ~50%). For stabilized output measurements at the MPP, devices were measured at the MPP voltage, (determined from J-V sweeps in reverse scans) and the current output was tracked over time in ambient air. 
 Simulation Simulations of PSCs were conducted using the heterojunction solar cell simulator SCAPS-1D, version 3.3.10. 
 Long-term stability tests The perovskite devices were encapsulated with ultraviolet adhesive (LT-U001, Lumtec) and a glass coverslip as a barrier layer in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Before encapsulation, we blew the devices with a nitrogen gun to remove contamination and stored them in a nitrogen-filled glovebox overnight to remove any residual moisture. The encapsulation procedure of the solar cell devices are shown in Supplementary Fig.  41 . For long-term ageing tests, we use a UV-containing large-area light-emitting diode array as the light source (spectrum given in Supplementary Fig.  42 ). We did not have direct control over the humidity but monitored the laboratory humidity, which remained at around 50% relative humidity during ageing. For the MPP tracking, as the V MPP may change over time, we have applied perturb-and-observe algorithms that carry out a periodic perturbation of the operating voltage maximizing the total power output of the device.
