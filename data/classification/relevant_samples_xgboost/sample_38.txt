Title: Effect of the Hammett substituent constant of para-substituted benzoic acid on the perovskite/ SnO 2 interface passivation in perovskite solar cells †
It is critical to design bifunctional passivation molecules to simultaneously passivate the charge transport layer and perovskite layer at the charge transport layer/perovskite interface in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this study, we investigate the effect of para-substituted benzoic acid with different Hammett constants (σ) on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Two passivation molecules 4-aminomethylbenzoic acid (4-AMBA) and 4-sulfamoylbenzoic acid (4-SABA) are used to passivate the SnO 2 surface with carboxylic acid and the perovskite with para-substituent electron-donating -CH 2 NH 2 (σ = ca. -0.02) and electronwithdrawing -SO 2 NH 2 (σ = ca. +0.60). Compared with non-passivated PSC, the passivation improves the power conversion efficiency (PCE) mainly due to the increased open-circuit voltage (V OC ) and fill factor (FF), where the -SO 2 NH 2 substituent is better in improving the photovoltaic performance than the -CH 2 NH 2 one. The trap density is more reduced and the charge extraction ability is more improved by 4-SABA than by 4-AMBA, which indicates that the weak electron-withdrawing nature of a para-substituent such as -SO 2 NH 2 is better for the passivation of the bottom perovskite than a weak electron-donating -CH 2 NH 2 substituent. Consequently, the passivation with 4-SABA enhances the PCE from 22.27% to 23.64%, along with improved long-term stability. This work highlights for the first time the role of the Hammett constant in the surface passivation of PSCs.
Introduction Since the first report on solid-state PSCs demonstrating a PCE of 9.7% and 500 h stability in 2012,  1  the highest certified PCE of 26.1% has been reported.  [2] [3] [4]  The common strategy to achieve such a high PCE involves a perovskite layer formed from a mixture of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) and a methylammonium chloride (MACl) additive,  5, 6  combined with a SnO 2 electron transport layer (ETL) in the n-i-p structure.  7  The amorphous-like SnO 2 has been used for an ETL due to the high optical transmittance and a low-temperature process.  8  Among the reported methods to make a thin SnO 2 film on the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate,  [9] [10] [11] [12]  chemical bath deposition (CBD)  7  and atomic layer deposition (ALD)  13  methods can produce a conformal coating of SnO 2 on high-haze TCO. Nevertheless, it is hard to avoid the surface defects of the SnO 2 film where the oxygen vacancy and surface hydroxyl groups (-OH) could lead to a non-radiative interfacial recombination loss.  14  To solve this problem, molecules with anchoring groups such as carboxyl, siloxane and phosphate groups have been employed to passivate oxygen vacancies.  15, 16  When selecting the passivation materials, functional groups at the opposite position of the anchoring group should be simultaneously taken into consideration for passivating the bottom perovskite layer contacting SnO 2 . Thus, bifunctional molecules are required at the perovskite/SnO 2 interface to improve the PCE and stability of PSCs.  17, 18  Some of the materials for improving the interface have been reported, including silane derivatives to tune the interfacial work function of the weak adhesion homojunction,  18, 19  and phosphate derivatives to regulate the perovskite strain.  20  For the anchoring group on the SnO 2 surface, carboxylic acid or hydroxyl-based molecules were extensively investigated, such as acetic acid,  21  fullerene derivatives,  22  (2-carboxyethyl) dimethyl sulfonium chloride,  23  3-dimethylamino propionic acid hydrochloride  23  and the biological polymer heparin potassium.  24  However, less attention has been paid to the functional group for passivating the bottom buried perovskite layer in the carboxylic acid-based molecules. In our previous work, electron-withdrawing cyanide (-CN) and chloride (-Cl) end groups in silane molecules were used to tune the weak adhesion buried interface.  18  The use of an electron-withdrawing group contradicts with the methods using an electrondonating group for additive engineering and surface defect passivation on top of the perovskite layer.  25  Benzoic acid derivatives are good candidates for passivating SnO 2 due to anchoring the carboxylic acid group with delocalized pi-electrons. It is well known that the electron-donating or withdrawing power of a substituent bonded to the para position of benzoic acid can be quantitively estimated using the Hammett substituent constant (σ).  26  Thus, the degree of electron-donating or accepting power of the para-substituent in benzoic acid can be designed using the Hammett constants. In addition, acid dissociation can be influenced by σ, which might affect the chemical interaction between SnO 2 and the para-substituted benzoic acid. In this report, we have investigated the effect of σ of the para-substituent in benzoic acid on the passivation of the SnO 2 surface and the bottom (buried) perovskite layer. Recently, new σs for meta-and para-substituted benzoic acid derivatives were reported using machine learning based on quantum chemical atomic charge methods,  27  where the para-CH 2 NH 2 substituent was calculated to be σ = -0.02, indicating a weak electron-donating nature, and the para-SO 2 NH 2 was estimated to be σ = +0.59, implying an electron-withdrawing property. Thus, we selected two passivation materials of 4-aminomethylbenzoic acid (4-AMBA) and 4-sulfamoylbenzoic acid (4-SABA) with negative and positive σ. 4-SABA was found to be superior to 4-AMBA in terms of the photovoltaic performance and optoelectronic properties. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), space-charge-limited current (SCLC), scanning electron microscope (SEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and photoluminescence (PL) studies were performed to understand the change in the photovoltaic performance depending on the substituent's σ. 
 Results and discussion The 4-AMBA and 4-SABA treatments are performed by spincoating on the SnO 2 layer in the n-i-p structure with a FAPbI 3dominated perovskite layer (Fig.  1(a) ), where the molecular structures of 4-AMBA and 4-SABA are also depicted. Fig.  1(b-e ) shows the statistical photovoltaic parameters of PSCs without (control) and with treatment. The average open-circuit voltage (V OC ) and fill factor (FF) of the device treated with 4-SABA are enhanced from 1.146 V to 1.165 V and from 0.763 to 0.807, respectively. This improvement is more pronounced than the V OC of 1.158 V and FF of 0.795 observed with the 4-AMBA treatment. Although the short-circuit current density ( J SC ) is slightly enhanced by the surface modification, the degree of increment is marginal compared with changes in V OC and FF, which is due to little change in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) in Fig.  S1 . † As a result, the average PCE is increased from 21.32% to 22.42% for 4-AMBA, and to 23.05% for 4-SABA. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table  1 . The best PCE of 23.64% is observed for 4-SABA using a highly transparent fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), which is higher than the PCE of 22.27% obtained from the control device. Since 4-AMBA and 4-SABA both commonly have carboxylic acid, the difference in the degree of enhancement in V OC and FF indicates that the para-substituent in benzoic acid plays a critical role in the passivation at the perovskite/SnO 2 interface.  18  Although the previous Hammett constant calculation resulted in the electron-donating nature of -CH 2 NH 2 in 4-AMBA and withdrawing property of -SO 2 NH 2 in 4-SABA, we further investigated the electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution. Fig.  2 (a) presents the ESP maps of 4-AMBA and 4-SABA. In the molecular structures, δ -and δ + indicate the electron-rich (more negative or less positive) and electrondeficient (more positive or less negative) regions, respectively. The electron density profile of the benzene ring seems to be slightly different depending on the substituent, where the δ - characteristic is plausibly increased in 4-AMBA due to electrondonating -CH 2 NH 2 , whereas it is reduced in 4-SABA due to the electron-withdrawing -SO 2 NH 2 . This is consistent with the reported σ value. In addition, more δ -is formed in carboxylic acid in 4-AMBA due to the inductive effect of the electrondonating -CH 2 NH 2 , compared with 4-SABA. On the -SO 2 NH 2 functional group, the δ -characteristic is enhanced to some extent due to the electron-withdrawing nature of -SO 2 NH 2 . Steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy (SSPL) measurements further elucidate the role of the passivators in the perovskite film (Fig.  S2 † ). Although the PL intensity of the 4-AMBA modified film increased, the 4-SABA modified film shows a relatively higher PL intensity compared to the control film. This indicates that 4-SABA substantially suppresses the non-radiative recombination of perovskite. To gain deeper  insights into the interaction between the passivators and perovskite, a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement was performed with the electron-only device of FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite/PCBM/Au to investigate the defect density. Fig.  2(b-d ) shows that three regions are identified depending on the bias voltage: Ohmic region, trap-filled limited region and Child region. In this study, the trap-filled limited voltage (V TFL ) can be calculated from the intersection point between the trapfilled limited region and Child region.  [28] [29] [30]  The trap density (n t ) can be calculated using the formula V TFL = qn t L 2 /2ε 0 ε, where q, L, ε 0 and ε are the electric charge (1.602 × 10 -19 C), the perovskite layer thickness (708 nm from the cross-sectional SEM images in Fig.  S3  †), the vacuum permittivity (8.8542 × 10 -14 F cm -1 ), and the dielectric constant of perovskite, respectively. The detailed parameters are summarized in Table  S1 . † The dielectric constant was calculated using the geometric capacitance at 10 608 Hz obtained from the capacitance-frequency plots (Fig.  S4 † ).  31, 32  The trap density is determined to be 3.48 × 10 16 cm -3 , 1.09 × 10 16 cm -3 and 1.03 × 10 16 cm -3 for the bare SnO 2 , 4-AMBA-treated SnO 2 and 4-SABAtreated SnO 2 , respectively, which can explain the basis for the V OC improvement. This also indicates that the surface treatment of SnO 2 and difference in the electron-donating (-withdrawing) characteristics of the para-substituent can substantially affect the bulk perovskite trap density. To further eluci-date these findings, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) measurement and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were performed. Fig.  S5(a)  † shows that the absorbance of the perovskite film is slightly increased after 4-AMBA and 4-SABA treatment. However, this cannot critically affect the device current. Fig.  S5(b ) † shows the increase in the XRD intensity of the (100) peak after 4-AMBA and 4-SABA treatment, indicating better crystallinity due to the underlying reduction of defects in the bottom perovskite layer.  32  The top-view SEM images of the perovskite film surface show that the grain size is slightly increased from 773 nm for the control to 874 nm for 4-AMBA and to 1018 nm for 4-SABA (Fig.  2(e-g ) and Fig.  S6 † ). It is difficult to modify the surface roughness of the SnO 2 films by the treatment, as confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig.  S7 † ), which indicates that a thin layer of the molecules might be conformally formed (see also surface SEM image in Fig.  S8 † ). To understand the chemical interaction between the passivation molecules and SnO 2 , Sn 3d X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured before and after modification. Fig.  3(a)  shows that the binding energies (BEs) of Sn 3d 5/2 (486.80 eV) and Sn 3d 3/2 (495.25 eV) are shifted to lower binding energies of 486.40 eV and 494.85 eV, respectively, after treatment, confirming the interaction between SnO 2 and the passivation materials.  33, 34  The degree of shift in BE is almost similar between 4-AMBA and 4-SABA, which indicates that the anchoring of carboxylic acid onto the SnO 2 surface occurs to the extent for both 4-AMBA and 4-SABA. Charge extraction from the perovskite to SnO 2 is improved by the surface passivation, as confirmed by SSPL and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. The SSPL data in Fig.  3 (b) reveal that there is more effective quenching for SnO 2 / 4-SABA than for bare SnO 2 and SnO 2 /4-AMBA. The PL decay from the TRPL data in Fig.  3(c ) becomes faster going from the bare SnO 2 to the separate 4-AMBA and 4-SABA treatments, which indicates that the charge extraction becomes faster after modification. The TRPL data were fitted using a biexponential decay equation, I(t ) = I 0 + A 1 exp(-(tt 0 )/τ 1 ) + A 2 exp(-(tt 0 )/ τ 2 ), where the fast decay component (τ 1 ) is attributed to the quenching of charge carriers at the interface, and the slow decay component (τ 2 ) is attributed to the radiative recombination of free charge carriers in the bulk.  [34] [35] [36]  The average life time (τ avg ) was also estimated using τ avg = (A 1 τ 1 2 + A 2 τ 2 2 )/(A 1 τ 1 + A 2 τ 2 ) . The fitting parameters are listed in Table  S2 . † The τ 1 and τ 2 for the bare SnO 2 are estimated to be 153.12 ns and 515.74 ns, respectively. The τ 1 and τ 2 values decreased to 106.10 ns and 464.70 ns after modification with 4-AMBA, and further decreased to 51.31 ns and 343.34 ns after the 4-SABA treatment, respectively. Since the surface modification might change the band position of SnO 2 , ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was measured with bare SnO 2 and the modified SnO 2 . Fig.  S9  † shows the UPS data along with the Tauc plots, where the valence band energy (E VB ) is estimated by using the equations E VB = E F -E F,edge (E F : Fermi level, E F,edge : Fermi edge binding energy) and E F = 21.22 -E cut-off (cut-off binding energy). The conduction band energy (E CB ) is then estimated by E CB = E VB + E g .  37  The optical bandgap (E g ) is obtained from the Tauc plot. The data are listed in Table  S3 . † The E VB of SnO 2 is upshifted from -9.79 eV to -9.67 eV, and to -9.52 eV after surface modification with 4-AMBA and 4-SABA, respectively. E CB is consecutively upshifted from -5.78 eV to -5.68 eV, and to -5.53 eV because E g is almost unchanged. The change in E CB can partly explain the tendency of the V OC changes.  38, 39  Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured to further understand the charge transfer and recombination process under device operation. Fig.  3(d  of 0.8 V under 1 Sun illumination of the full devices, which is analyzed using an equivalent circuit comprising the series resistance (R s ), charge transfer resistance (R ct ) and constant phase element (CPE). All fitted data are listed in Table  S4 . † R s is decreased from 16.02 Ω to 12.61 Ω and 5.92 Ω, and R ct is decreased from 88.11 Ω to 49.63 Ω and 36.84 Ω, respectively, after surface modification with 4-AMBA and 4-SABA, which validates that 4-SABA effectively suppresses the carrier recombination at the SnO 2 /perovskite interface.  40, 41  Furthermore, the transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC), measured under the open-circuit and short-circuit conditions, respectively, exhibit a similar trend (Fig.  S10 †) , where the decay time of TPV (obtained from fitting the data with a biexponential decay function) is prolonged from 0.640 ms to 0.958 ms upon the surface modification with 4-SABA. This indicates the reduced charge recombination at both the SnO 2 / perovskite interface and within the bulk perovskite.  41, 42  The decay time of TPC is decreased from 3.514 μs to 1.896 μs, which suggests an increase in the total non-equilibrium charges. This is primarily attributed to the reduced charge recombination at the SnO 2 /perovskite interface and in the bulk perovskite, leading to faster charge extraction at the electron transport layer.  43  Finally, the stability was investigated. Fig.  4 (a) compares the storage stability of the unencapsulated PSCs before and after modification of SnO 2 with 4-SABA. The 4-SABA treated SnO 2 device maintains 81% of its initial PCE after 800 h, while the control device exhibits a lower maintenance of 63% of the initial PCE. The steady-state power output (SPO) measured for 40 min by maximum power point tracking shows a higher SPO (95% of the initial PCE at a bias voltage of 0.859 V) for the 4-SABA treated SnO 2 than for the untreated bare SnO 2 (87% of the initial PCE at a bias voltage of 0.885 V) (Fig.  S11 † ). Furthermore, we studied the stability of the perovskite films under 1 Sun illumination at 60 °C. Fig.  4 (b) and (c) shows that the perovskite film deposited on the 4-SABA treated SnO 2 maintains 60% of its initial PL intensity after 240 h, while the PL intensity is significantly decreased to 10% of the initial PL intensity for the perovskite film formed on the bare SnO 2 . This indicates that 4-SABA is highly beneficial for protecting the phase degradation of the perovskite film. 
 Conclusions In conclusion, we studied the effect of the Hammett substituent constant of the passivation materials of para-substituted benzoic acid on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. We compared two different substituents, the electron-donating -CH 2 NH 2 substituent with a negative Hammett constant and the electron-withdrawing -SO 2 NH 2 substituent with a positive Hammett constant. Those materials were used for passivating the SnO 2 layer. Although 4-AMBA with the -CH 2 NH 2 substituent was found to be able to improve the photovoltaic performance, 4-SABA with the -SO 2 NH 2 substituent was found to be superior to 4-AMBA in improving the photovoltaic perform-ance. The electron-withdrawing substituent is thus beneficial to not only improving the photovoltaic performance, but also maintaining the alpha-phase FAPbI 3 . From the current work, we propose herein for the first time that controlling the Hammett para-substituent constant of the benzoic acid derivatives plays an important role in perovskite photovoltaics. 
 Experimental section 
 Synthesis of materials Formamidinium iodide (FAI) powder was synthesized by reacting 26 mL of HI (57 wt% in H 2 O, Sigma-Aldrich) and 15 g of formamidinium acetate (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) in an ice bath for 1 h with stirring. The precipitates were collected by using a rotary evaporator at 65 °C for 2 h. The collected FAI powder was purified by dissolving in ethanol and then adding diethyl ether (99%, SAMCHUN) until their color became white, which was dried in a vacuum chamber for over 2 days. Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) black powder was synthesized by mixing 1.6 M as-synthesized FAI and PbI 2 (99.99%, TCI) in g-butyrolactone (GBL, 99.5%, SAMCHUN) and heating at 110 °C for 2 h, followed by 130 °C for 2 h under stirring at 150 rpm. The black powder was washed with acetonitrile (ACN, 99.9%, SAMCHUN) and diethyl ether several times until no residual product was found, which was followed by drying at 150 °C for 30 min. 
 Device fabrication Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (Asahi, 12-13 Ω sq -1 ) for the device, and FTO (Pilkington, 6-8 Ω sq -1 ) for the samples were cleaned by detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone, and IPA consecutively for 10 min. The SnO 2 layer was deposited using the chemical bath deposition (CBD) reaction. UV-ozone (UVO) treatment was performed on the cleaned FTO substrates for 30 min before the CBD reaction. The coating solution for CBD was prepared by mixing 825 mg of SnCl 2 •2H 2 O (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), 3750 mg of urea (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), 3.75 mL of HCl (37 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich), 75 μL of thioglycolic acid (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 300 mL of DI water. The cleaned FTO was dipped in CBD solution at 90 °C for 4 h. After the CBD reaction, the SnO 2 -coated FTO substrate was washed with DI water and isopropanol for 10 min with sonication, which was heated at 170 °C for 1 h. The post-treatment solution was prepared by mixing 0.76 mg 4-AMBA in 5 mL DI water and 5.03 mg 4-SABA in 5 mL ethanol. A 175-μL volume of the stock solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm and 30 s, which was annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. The perovskite precursor was prepared by dissolving 717.8 mg of the synthesized FAPbI 3 black powder, 24. 4-MeO PEAI was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 3000 rpm 20 s, which was annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. The hole transporting layer (HTL) of spiro-MeOTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N, N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene) was formed on the post-treated perovskite film by spin-coating the 45 μL solution at 3000 rpm for 20 s. The spiro-MeOTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 90 mg of spiro-MeOTAD (99%, Sigma Aldrich), 39.5 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine (98%, Sigma Aldrich), and 23 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide (Li-TFSI, Sigma Aldrich) solution (520 mg Li-TSFI in 1 mL of ACN (99.8%, Sigma Aldrich)) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene (99.8%, Sigma Aldrich). Finally, the 80 nm-thick Au electrode was deposited by using the thermal evaporation method. 
 Characterization The current density-voltage ( J-V) was measured under one Sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm -2 ) using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A class AAA) equipped with a 450 W Xenon lamp (Newport 6280 NS) and source meter (Keithley 2400). The 1 Sun illumination was adjusted with the NIST-calibrated Si reference cell with KG-5 filter. An aperture mask with an active area of 0.125 cm 2 was used. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using an EQE system (PV measurement Inc.) with a 75 W Xenon lamp chopped by a monochromator. XRD data were obtained using a Rigaku Smart Lab diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (l = 1.5406 Å) at a scan rate of 4°m in -1 and step size of 0.02°. The absorbance spectra were obtained by the UV-Vis spectrometer (Lambda 45, PerkinElmer). Steady-state photoluminescence (SSPL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured using a FLS1000 (Edinburgh Inst.). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data were collected under 1 Sun illumination using an Autolab 302B from a frequency range of 10 -1 to 10 6 Hz, and fitted using the Z-view software. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with an ESCALAB250 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by using a monochromatized Al source (hν = 1486.6 eV). The binding energy was calibrated with respect to the C 1s peak of 284.6 eV. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was conducted by using an ESCALAB 250 instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific) with He I (21.22 eV). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained using JSM-7600F (JSM-IT800, JEOL). The molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) was calculated using the Avogadro program. ESP maps were obtained to present the electrostatic charges, where the electron-rich and electron-poor parts were depicted as red and blue colors, respectively, using the jmol program.
