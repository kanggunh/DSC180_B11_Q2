 Devices Fabrication ITO conductive substrates were sonic-cleaned by detergent (Decon 90) for 1 hour, and sequentially sonic-cleaned by deionized water, acetone, and ethanol absolute for 15 min, respectively. Then, the ITO substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 20 min before use. NiO x nanoparticles were dispersed in deionized water at a concentration of 15 mg/mL to form NiO x ink. The as-prepared NiO x ink was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s, then annealed at 150 °C for 20 min in ambient air. Then, BTF14 in CB was spin-coated onto the substrate at 5000 rpm for 30 s and was subsequently annealed at 100 ℃ for 5 min. precursor to optimize the crystallization.

Title: Boosting Efficiency and Stability of NiO x -Based Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells Through D-A Type Semiconductor Interface Modulation
NiO x is one of the promising inorganic hole transporting materials in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), however, its device efficiency and stability are still limited by the energy level mismatch, low intrinsic conductivity, high interface defect density, and complex active species. Herein, the use of an imide-based donor-acceptor type semiconductor (BTF14) as the interlayer between perovskite and NiO x is proposed, which facilitates the hole extraction and transfer, reduces the defect density at interface and in perovskite film bulk, and further reduces the concentration of Ni >3+ species to stabilize the heterointerface. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of inverted PSCs can be significantly boosted from 22.11% of NiO x to 24.20% of NiO x /BTF14. Moreover, NiO x /BTF14 based devices also exhibit negligible hysteresis and excellent long-term stability, with over 77% of their initial efficiency remaining after continuous operation at 60 °C for 1000 h under 1 sun illumination.
Introduction Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been widely accepted as a new generation of photovoltaic DOI: 10.1002/adfm.202315157 technology.  [1] [2] [3] [4]  Among various device architectures, inverted planar (p-i-n) architecture has attracted increased interests due to its low-temperature processability, negligible hysteresis, and suitability for tandem and flexible PSC manufacturing.  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]  Excitingly, the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted PSCs has recently exceeded 25%,  [10, 11]  making them have more commercial potential. Nevertheless, almost all the state-of-the-art PSCs are based on organic hole transporting materials (HTMs), such as polybis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA) and phosphonic acid based selfassembled monolayers (SAMs), which inevitably suffer from scalability and stability issues.  [12]  In this context, ongoing efforts have been devoted on the counterpart inorganic HTMs for inverted PSCs, among that NiO x is the most widely used due to its merits of facile synthesis, easy processing, high optical transparency, and exceptional chemical stability.  [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]  Although NiO x -based inverted PSCs have made encouraging results in recent years, the derived PCEs still lag behind those from high-performance organic HTMs, attributed to the energy level mismatch, low intrinsic conductivity, and high interface defect density of NiO x .  [19, 20]  Additionally, the presence of a variety of high-oxidative-state Ni species (Ni >3+ ) of NiO x layer make its chemical properties at the surface too complicated, often causing the degradation of perovskites.  [21] [22] [23] [24]  To resolve these challenges, surface passivation is confirmed as an efficient and reproducible approach.  [25, 26]  For instance, McGehee et al. introduced an excess of A-site cation salts as the surface agents to prevent the formation of PbI 2-x Br x layer caused by Ni >3+ , which can effectively reduce the voltage loss and further improve the long-term thermal stability.  [21]  Recently, Li et al. demonstrated that introduction of a hybrid interfacial layer, consisting of SAM and conjugated poly(arylamine), can simultaneously improve the energy level alignment, charge extraction and chemical stability of NiO x interface, leading to an impressive PCE of 24.5%.  [27]  Donor-acceptor (D-A) type organic semiconductors are commonly employed as charge transporting layers for PSCs because of their structural diversity, favorable D-A intermolecular stacking, regulated energy levels, and high charge transport ability.  [28, 29]  They have also been used as efficient interfacial materials to facilitate the energy level alignment and charge transport at the interface.  [30, 31]  Moreover, the intrinsic intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) feature of D-A skeleton could enable effective interactions with the complex redox species at the NiO x surface, thereby eliminating the harmful effects.  [32]  What's more, it has been well demonstrated that the buried interface in inverted PSCs plays a critical role in controlling the quality of perovskite film to determine the device performance, requiring suitable interfacial interactions with perovskites.  [33, 34]  In this regard, it is highly desirable for developing D-A type semiconductors with multiple functions as the interfacial materials, meaning that they should not only improve the interface contact and charge transport, suppress undesired interfacial reactions, but also optimize the buried surface and facilitate the growth of perovskites. Imide is a widely used electron-withdrawing building block for the construction of D-A semiconductors.  [35]  From a structural perspective, imide is also expected as an ideal building block for developing new interface materials for NiO x -based PSCs, because 1) the imide-based semiconductors generally have good electrochemical stability; 2) the carbonyl groups could provide bonding sites for both of NiO x and perovskites.  [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41]  Herein, we successfully design and synthesize a new D-A type semiconductor (BTF14) based on a fluoranthene imide unit, which can serve as a multifunctional interfacial material toward highperformance NiO x -based inverted PSCs (Figure  1a ). The incorporation of BTF14 improves the charge transfer, enhances the perovskite film quality, and reduces the defect density at the interface, leading to a remarkable PCE of 24.20% with negligible hysteresis. Moreover, BTF14 can effectively reduce the concentration of harmful Ni >3+ species on the surface of NiO x , and shows strong interfacial interactions with both NiO x and the perovskite layer, thereby improving the device operational stability; and over 77% of its initial efficiency was remained after 1000 h of continuous operation at 60 °C. 
 Results and Discussion Fluoranthene is a typical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with ease of functionalization, high planarity, and excellent electrochemical stability.  [42, 28]  We previously designed and synthesized a novel acceptor unit, i.e., 2,3-fluoranthene imide, and used it to develop a series of new p-type semiconductors.  [43]  We then assumed    4 ) to afford BTF14. The molecular structures were well confirmed by NMR and high-resolution mass analysis. Figure  1b  shows the density functional theory (DFT) simulated electrostatic surface potential of BTF14, indicating a highly planar molecular configuration and an efficient ICT between the triphenylamine unit to the imide unit. Moreover, the highly electron deficient C═O group in the imide unit is suggested to coordinate with Ni and Pb cations to cure their surface defects. BTF14 exhibits good thermal stability, and its decomposition temperature (T d , Figure  S1 , Supporting Information) and glass transition temperature (T g , Figure  S2 , Supporting Information) were determined as 430 and 86 °C, respectively. The absorption spectra of BTF14 are shown in Figure  1c , in which the shortwavelength and long-wavelength peaks are ascribed to the localized 𝜋-𝜋 * and ICT absorption, respectively. From solution to film state, there is a clear redshift of 18 nm observed for both absorption bands, an indicative of the formation of a weak J-type aggregation as a result of the D-A interactions. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that despite absorbing visible light, BTF14 hardly affects the absorption of the NiO x film when as the interlayer due to its very thin film thickness, and thus both of NiO x and NiO x /BTF14 films exhibit an optical gap of 3.28 eV (Figure  S3 , Supporting Information), indicating high optical transparency. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of BTF14 were determined to be -5.15 and -3.15 eV, respectively, based on cyclic voltammetry (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information). Furthermore, it also exhibits a high electrochemical stability by preserving its peak shape after undergoing 25 redox cycles (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information), due to the presence of fluoranthene imide core. We also performed DFT calculations to gain insight into the energy levels of BTF14, showing the HOMO mainly delocalizes over the conjugated backbone, while the LUMO only localizes on the fluoranthene imide unit (Figure  S6 , Supporting Information). Such electronic features would likely facilitate an efficient hole transport. We further studied the work function variation of NiO x by ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy, and found that the HOMO level of ITO/NiO x can be effectively reduced from -5.23 to -5.35 eV after introducing BTF14 layer (Figure  1d ). The energy level alignment of the NiO x and NiO x /BTF14 relative to the valence band maximum (E VBM ) of perovskite is shown in Figure  1e , and it is easily concluded that BTF14 interlayer enables more suitable energy level matching with perovskites. In order to investigate the interactions between BTF14 and perovskite, as well as between BTF14 and NiO x , we conducted fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis. Upon mixing with PbI 2 , the characteristic wavenumber of the -C═C─ group in BTF14 shifts from 1592 to 1598 cm -1 (Figure  1f ), possibly due to the strong coordination between BTF14 and PbI 2 that affects the electron cloud density. Furthermore, in the mixed powders of BTF14 and NiO x , the characteristic absorption of C═O group (1700 cm -1 ) splits into two peaks at 1702 and 1689 cm -1 , indicating the strong interaction between NiO x and C═O group of BTF14. We then used DFT calculations to study the interaction of BTF14 with the perovskite surfaces of FAPbI 3 with PbI 2 and formamidinium iodide (FAI) terminations according to the literature.  [44]  As shown in Figure  1g , BTF14 forms strong chemical bonds with the PbI 2 -terminated surface through multiple Pb─O interactions with the O atoms in the methoxy and carbonyl groups of BTF14, resulting in a high binding energy of 9.13 eV. These bonds thus can effectively passivate the surface defects of perovskites and further lay the molecules almost flat on the surface, facilitating efficient charge extraction and transfer. The electron density in D-A structure is more concentrated on the electron-withdrawing groups due to the strong electronic pushpull effect, which enables strong interactions with perovskites. Moreover, BTF14 also interacts with the FAI-terminated surface through weak van der Waals forces with a distance of 4.6 Å and a binding energy of 2.21 eV (Figure  S7 , Supporting Information). Next, we constructed a BTF14 molecule on an O-terminated NiO x [100] surface to illustrate the surface modulation mechanism,  [45, 46]  as shown in Figure  1h  and Figure  S8  (Supporting Information). The adsorption energy is calculated by E adsorption = E NiO+BTF14 -E NiO -E BTF14 , wherein E NiO+BTF14 , E NiO , and E BTF14 are the total energies of the molecule-surface system,  [47]  the isolated [100] NiO surface, and the free BTF14 molecule, respectively. After geometry optimization, the distance between the BTF14 conjugated plane and the outermost O plane of NiO x is calculated as 3.8 Å, while the adsorption energy is 1.16 eV, indicating BTF14 has a strong adsorption ability on the NiO x surface. Furthermore, we computed the charge density difference (𝜌 (BTF14+NiO) -𝜌 (BTF14) -𝜌 (NiO) ) of this system. As shown in Figure  1i , the charge density of the BTF14 molecule decreases clearly, while that of the NiO x layer increases, suggesting an efficient charge transfer process occurring between them , which could be due to the imide-based D-A structure design. To quantify the charge transfer at the interface, we performed a Bader charge analysis on this system and found that 0.29 e is transferred from the NiO x layer to BTF14 molecule. Overall, our first principle calculations demonstrate that BTF14 can strongly bind with NiO x layer to induce redox modification of NiO x surface. We further characterized the interactions between the perovskite and BTF14 using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), with the spectra of the Pb 4f and I 3d core levels shown in Figure  2a ,b, respectively. The main peaks of Pb 4f and I 3d both shift to the higher binding energies for the BTF14/perovskite film, suggesting BTF14 can strengthen the binding of both anions and cations on the perovskite surface to achieve efficient defect passivation. By fabricating hole-only device with a structure of ITO/NiO x /PVK/spiro-MeOTAD/Au, the trap-filled limit voltages (V TFL ) were measured based on the space charge limited current (SCLC) method, which are 0.46 and 0.31 V for NiO x and NiO x /BTF14 based devices, respectively. The trap densities (Nt) of NiO x and NiO x /BTF14-based devices were calculated as ≈1.30 × 10 16 and ≈9.37 × 10 15 cm -3 , respectively, and thus manifest that BTF14 modification can effectively reduce perovskite defects (Figure  2c ). We also measured the hole mobilities of NiO x and NiO x /BTF14 films by the SCLC method, showing that BTF14 modification can improve the hole mobility from 1.09 × 10 -4 to 1.89 × 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 s -1 (Figure  2d ). This significant improvement can be attributed to the effective charge transfer process throughout the D-A structure, which can strengthen the intermolecular interactions. The hole transfer dynamics at the perovskite/HTM interfaces were investigated by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Figure  2e ). Compared with the control sample, the perovskite film on NiO x shows a decreased PL intensity, while a more significant decrease is observed for the perovskite film grown on NiO x /BTF14, indicating an enhanced hole transfer efficiency.  [48, 49]  Moreover, the time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra shown in Figure  2f  were collected with an excitation wavelength of 520 nm, showing a gradually reduced carrier lifetime of perovskites, from 1034.1 ns for the ITO substrate to 592.3 ns for the ITO/NiO x substrate, and to 430.6 ns for the ITO/NiO x /BTF14 substrate, respectively (Table  S1 , Supporting Information). These results thus strongly indicate that BTF14 modification can promote the hole extraction/transport from the perovskite to the NiO x , attributed to the more matched energy levels and enhanced hole mobility.  [50, 51]  The effect of the substrate wettability on the perovskite crystallization was checked by performing contact angle measurements. As shown in Figure  2g , the water contact angle is clearly increased from 59.8°for the NiO x substrate to 77.3°for the NiO x /BTF14 substrate, due to the hydrophobic nature of BTF14. Such difference in wettability would affect the nucleation and the growth process of perovskite.  [52]  Figure  2h ,i show that the perovskite film grown on the NiO x substrate is smaller than that grown on the NiO x /BTF14 substrate, with the average grain sizes of 200 and 235 nm (Figure  S10 , Supporting Information), respectively. Moreover, the X-ray diffractometer (XRD) results (Figure  S11 , Supporting Information) and the cross-sectional images (Figure  S12 , Supporting Information) further suggest that BTF14 modification can slightly enhance the crystallinity and thickness of perovskites. In addition to inducing a more hydrophobic surface, the strong interactions between BTF14 and perovskites should be also responsible for the enhanced perovskite film quality.  [53] [54] [55]  Inverted PSCs were fabricated based on a p-i-n device configuration of ITO/HTL/perovskite/C 60 /bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag (Figure  3a ). The concentration for BTF14 interlayer processing was optimized as shown in Figure  S13  (Supporting Information), showing 2.0 mg mL -1 was the best one. Figure  3b  shows the J-V curves of the devices measured under standard AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm -2 ) in an N 2 -filled glove box. The devices with BTF14 modification achieved a remarkable PCE of 24.20% with an open circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.17 V, a short-circuit current (J SC ) of 24.85 mA cm -2 and a fill factor (FF) of 83.09%, which are significantly higher than those of the reference devices based on NiO x (PCE of 22.11% with a V OC of 1.11 V, a J SC of 24.42 mA cm -2 and an FF of 81.34%). Note that 24.20% is one of the highest PCEs of NiO x -based devices (Table  S2 , Supporting Information). Furthermore, compared to NiO x -based device (Figure  S14 , Supporting Information), the BTF14-modified champion device also showed a negligible hysteresis (Figure  3c ), with a low hysteresis index (HI) of only 0.013, somewhat attributed to the facilitated charge extraction and reduced non-radiative recombination. The calculated J SC value (24.47 mA cm -2 ) from the EQE spectrum of the BTF14-modified champion device is in good agreement with that obtained from the J-V measurements (Figure  3d ), confirming the reliability of device performance. To further examine the photostability and reliability of the devices under continuous illumination, we have recorded the steady power output (SPO) of the BTF14-modified champion device under a constant voltage bias close to the maximum power tracking point at full sun illumination for 600 s. As shown in Figure  3e , the device exhibits a stable photocurrent of 23.49 mA cm -2 and a SPO of 23.96% at 1.02 V bias voltage, which matches well with the J-V characteristics. Moreover, we have compared the statistical distributions of PCEs and detailed device parameters for 22 individual devices (Figure  3f ), demonstrating better reliability and repeatability of the PSCs with BTF14 modification. Moreover, it is also evident that the improvements in V OC and FF are responsible for the PCE enhancement for BTF14 modification (Figure  3g ; Figure  S15 , Supporting Information). To investigate the origin of improved V OC and FF of BTF14modified PSCs, we studied the non-radiative recombination process at the buried interface. Figure  3h  shows that V OC varies linearly with the logarithm of I. The deviation between the slope and kT q -1 (where k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature, and elemental charge, respectively) positively correlates with the Shockley─Read─Hall recombination, indicating that BTF14 can lead to apparently suppressed trap-assisted recombination, as reflected by the smaller slope. Figure  3i  further shows the capacitance-potential curves of control and BTF14-modified PSCs, with the built-in potentials (V bi s) evaluated as 0.96 and 1.09 V, respectively, through Mott─Schottky analysis. The enlarged V bi will not only accelerate the dissociation of photogenerated charge carriers but also promote the construction of an extended depletion region, thereby powerfully suppressing the electron-hole recombination.  [56]  These results thus well explain the increased V OC and FF of BTF14-modified PSCs. As mentioned above, one of the appealing features for NiO x HTL is the derived PSCs generally show good long-term stability. Indeed, as shown in Figure  4a , the efficiency of our fabricated NiO x -based encapsulated PSC only shows 14% decrement after 1000 h under 1 sun illumination in N 2 at room temperature. Encouragingly, with BTF14 modification, the encapsulated device stability of resulting PSCs can retain over 92% of its efficiency at the same condition. We further tested the long-term thermal stability of the encapsulated PSCs. For BTF14-based encapsulated devices, over 77% of their initial efficiency can be remained after continuous operation in N 2 at 60 °C for 1000 h under 1 sun illumination, showing a T 80 over 800 h at 60 °C, while the reference device only has a T 80 of ≈330 h (Figure  4b ). These results suggest that BTF14 modification significantly improves the operational and thermal stability of the derived PSCs, which outperforms most of efficient and stable NiO x -based devices reported so far (Table  S3 , Supporting Information). To study the mechanism behind enhanced stability of BTF14 modified devices, we performed XPS measurements to investigate the electronic state of the NiO x surface with and without BTF14 modification. The XPS spectra of the Ni 2p3/2 core levels and the contents of Ni species are shown in Figure  4c, d . The characteristic peaks of NiO x are mainly located at 854.8 and 856.8 eV for Ni 2+ and Ni 3+ species, respectively. After BTF14 modification, the peaks of both Ni 2+ and Ni 3+ shift to higher binding energies by 0.2 eV, further indicating a strong interaction between NiO x and BTF14 due to the high electron affinity of the C═O group in BTF14 (Figure  1b ). The Ni >3+ surface species of NiO x have been shown to be detrimental for the stability of the buried interface (Figure  4e ).  [19, 22, 30]  Here as shown in Figure  4d , it can be observed that the concentration of Ni >3+ decreases, while the concentration of Ni 3+ increases in ITO/NiO x /BTF14 film. Such positive changes in the NiO x surface could be attributed to the strong interactions between the perovskite and NiO x as a result of the imide-based D-A structure design. The presence of BTF14 interlayer can not only physically isolate harmful species but also reduce the concentration of Ni >3+ (Figure  4f ), thereby effectively enhancing the stability of the buried interface. Moreover, it is worth noting that the increased Ni 3+ concentration also well explains the enhanced hole transport results shown in Figure  2d . 
 Conclusion In summary, we present BTF14, a D-A type semiconductor based on 2,3-fluoranthene imide building block, as a promising interface modifier to improve the performance of NiO xbased inverted PSCs. The BTF14-modified NiO x HTL can significantly boost the FF and V OC of PSCs, thereby delivering an impressive PCE of 24.20% with negligible hysteresis, much higher than that of NiO x -based control devices (22.11%). We show that BTF14 can optimize the energy level alignment, promote the growth and crystallinity of perovskites, and provide effective defect passivation at the buried interface, leading to efficient hole extraction/transfer, and suppressed carrier recombination. Moreover, BTF14 can reduce the concentration of harm-ful Ni >3+ species and further stabilize the NiO x /perovskite interface by forming strong interactions with both layers, thereby considerably improving the device stability with a T 80 over 800 h at 60 °C under 1 sun illumination. These results demonstrate that modifying the surface of NiO x layer is crucial for enhancing the efficiency and stability of PSCs, and imide-based D-A Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1. a) Schematic illustration of D-A type semiconductor interlayer between NiO x and perovskite layer in inverted PSC. b) Molecular structure and electrostatic surface potential map of BTF14. c) UV-vis absorption spectra of BTF14, NiO x , and NiO x /BTF14. d) UPS spectra around the secondary electron cutoff and in the valence band region. e) Energy level alignment of ITO, NiO x , NiO x /BTF14, and perovskite. f) FT-IR spectra of BTF14 powders before and after adding PbI 2 or NiO x . g) DFT-simulated covalent bonding for BTF14 bound on the FAPbI 3 surface with PbI 2 termination. h) The relaxed model of an BTF14 molecule absorbed on the NiO x [100] surface.

 that 2 , 3 - 23 imide fluoranthene could be also a promising building block to construct interlayer materials for NiO x -based PSCs. In this context, we designed and synthesized a new D-A type semiconductor (BTF14, Figure 1b) using 2,3-fluoranthene imide as the acceptor unit and triphenylamine as the donor unit, respectively. The synthetic route of BTF14 is shown in Scheme 1. First, dibromo-functionalized fluoranthene imide (3) was synthesized via a facile one-pot Diels─Alder reaction, which then underwent a Heck coupling reaction with 3-methoxy-N-(3-methoxyphenyl)-N-(4-vinylphenyl)aniline (
