Title: Supporting Information CsPb 2 Br 5 Plates/Quasi-2D Perovskite Heterojunction for Efficient Sky-blue Light-Emitting Diodes

Tests and Characterization The crystal structures of perovskite films were characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, D8 Focus) using Cu Kα (λ = 0.15406 nm) as the excitation source. The diffraction patterns were measured within a 2θ range of 5° to 45° 2θ at a rate of 5° min -1 . To evaluate the photophysical characteristics, transient photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were conducted using an F900 time-resolved fluorescence spectrometer, while steady-state fluorescence spectra were acquired via an F-4600 spectrometer. The absorption spectra were measured through UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2450). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of perovskite films were acquired by employing Czech TESCAN MIRA LMS. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were captured using S-image from Seiko Group. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were carried out on the samples with the Thermo Scientific K-Alpha XPS System. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of P5M5A5-Cr-Na films were acquired with an FEI Tecnai G2 F30 microscope produced by FEI(America). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed using a P Thermo ESCALAB XI+ system, employing a He I source (21.22 eV) under an applied negative bias of 5.0 V. The current density-luminance-voltage (J-L-V) characteristics, electroluminescence (EL) spectra, and the space charge limited current (SCLC) characteristics were examined utilizing the lqe-425 LED optical measuring system. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) is calculated by the following formula: (1) Here, η A is the current efficiency, I(λ) is the intensity of EL spectrum signal; V(λ) corresponds to the 1924 CIE standard visual efficiency function.

Title: CsPb 2 Br 5 Plates/Quasi-2D Perovskite Heterojunction for Efficient Sky-Blue Light-Emitting Diodes
Perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have gained significant attention owing to their remarkable tunability and color stability, and substantial progress has been made with green and red PeLEDs. However, the advancement of blue PeLEDs still lags far behind their red and green counterparts. In this study, we report efficient sky-blue PeLEDs utilizing an in situ fabricated CsPb 2 Br 5 plates/quasi-2D perovskite heterojunction using chelating molecules to modulate the crystallization process of perovskites. The wide bandgap of CsPb 2 Br 5 facilitated the formation of a type-I band alignment at the heterojunction, allowing efficient carrier transfer from CsPb 2 Br 5 to CsPbBr 3 . This heterojunction leads to a noteworthy enhancement of device efficiency. The PeLEDs exhibit a maximum brightness of 2311 cd m -2 , accompanied by a maximum external quantum efficiency of 12.86% at 487 nm. Our tailored design of CsPb 2 Br 5 /perovskite heterojunction thin films offers a promising avenue for advancing PeLED performance. This work contributes valuable insights into the burgeoning field of perovskite electroluminescence, paving the way for further optimization of PeLED technologies.
INTRODUCTION In recent years, metal halide perovskite materials have emerged as a promising class of materials for optoelectronic applications, owing to their remarkable properties such as high charge carrier mobility, excellent photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), tunable bandgaps, narrow emission line widths, and cost-effective fabrication processes. Notably, advancements in device engineering and materials science have led to the rapid evolution of perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Currently, green and red PeLEDs have achieved external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 20%,  1, 2  approaching their theoretical limits and competing with traditional organic and quantum dot light-emitting devices. However, the development of blue PeLEDs has encountered challenges, particularly in achieving comparable brightness, efficiency, and stability, which hinders their widespread application in full-color displays and lighting systems.  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  To address these challenges, quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskites have emerged as a promising approach. Their unique quantum well structures, combined with the insertion of hydrophobic layers, grant them superior structural and environmental stability compared to three-dimensional perovskite components.  9, 10  During operation, charge carriers rapidly transfer from small n-phase quantum wells to large n-phase quantum wells within picoseconds through interband tunneling over the large-cation barrier, releasing photons with lower energies and thus enhancing radiative efficiencies.  11  Therefore, optimizing the performance of quasi-2D blue PeLEDs requires precise control of the perovskite phase distribution and energy landscape. However, the disordered crystallization process of perovskites often leads to high-defect-density films, impeding efficient energy transfer and elevating nonradiative recombination rates.  [12] [13] [14] [15]  Addressing this, various strategies, including the introduction of alkali ions and the use of ligands with suitable steric hindrance, have been explored to enhance the distribution of different n-value phases within quasi-2D perovskites.  [14] [15] [16] [17]  Due to the competition between large organic cations and alkali ions, small n-phases are effectively suppressed, facilitating smoother energy transfer. This suppression weakens the nonradiative recombination caused by small n-phases, thereby boosting the PLQYs. The steric hindrance of ligands is one of the reasons for the distortion of [PbX 6 ] 4-structures, leading to changes in the perovskite dimensions.  [18] [19] [20]  Introducing ligands with appropriate steric hindrance into quasi-2D perovskite thin films can regulate the size of perovskite crystals to alter the distribution of different nphases. Furthermore, the utilization of chelating molecules is another method to meticulously modulate the crystallization process of the perovskite. For instance, the interaction between chelating molecules and perovskite components can further regulate the nucleation and growth processes of quasi-2D perovskites.  [21] [22] [23] [24]  As a result, the formation of small n-phases is suppressed, and the phase distribution becomes more concentrated, which enhances radiative recombination within the perovskite thin film.  [25] [26] [27]  Furthermore, exploiting heterojunction structures plays a crucial role in enhancing the blue PeLED performance. Among these, CsPb 2 Br 5 , an indirect bandgap semiconductor with a wide bandgap greater than 3.0 eV, has gained significant attention.  [28] [29] [30] [31]  In its tetragonal crystal structure, doublecapped trigonal prisms of [PbBr 8 ] 6-are face-connected to form layers perpendicular to the c-axis, sandwiched between layers composed of Cs + cations.  29  Although it does not exhibit intrinsic fluorescence, CsPb 2 Br 5 functions as an ideal protective layer when combined with smaller bandgap perovskite structures like CsPbBr 3 , forming a type-I heterojunction. This heterojunction reduces trap density and exciton diffusion length, thus enhancing the exciton lifetime by suppressing nonradiative energy transfer to the trap sites.  32  Additionally, CsPb 2 Br 5 nanoplates also boost ionic conductivity by lowering the barriers for electronic and ionic transport, thus enhancing device longevity.  33, 34  DFT calculations and femtosecond transient absorption tests also confirmed that heterojunctions like CsPb2Br 5 /perovskite theoretically enhance the perovskite's photoluminescence performance.  33  Several methods were developed to construct the CsPb 2 Br 5 /perovskite heterojunction, such as anion exchange, stepwise deposition, vacuum deposition, and thermal injection.  [35] [36] [37] [38] [39]  However, precisely controlling the perovskite crystallization process and utilizing the transformation of the intermediate phase to obtain the CsPb 2 Br 5 /CsPbBr 3 heterojunction remains challenging. In this study, we introduced an innovative method for fabricating efficient blue PeLEDs using in situ formed CsPb 2 Br 5 plates/quasi-2D perovskite heterojunctions. By introducing 18-crown-6 into the precursor solution to bind with Pb 2+ , a dynamic supramolecular coordination structure is created. This delayed the nucleation process of perovskites and the growth of low-dimensional perovskite structures at room temperature. Subsequently, through annealing, a large number of Pb 2+ ions were released at high temperatures, causing the free [PbBr 6 ] 4-in the solution to transform into PbBr 8 -capped triangular prisms and form the CsPb 2 Br 5 structure. In order to promote the concentration of free [PbBr 6 ] 4-in the solution for secondary step growth, α-phenethylamine hydrobromide (MBABr) with appropriate steric hindrance was used to increase the lattice distortion, thus retarding the crystallization of quasi-2D phase perovskites. The PL lifetimes of the supramolecular assembled heterojunctions were notably longer compared to other perovskite systems, indicative of a reduced rate of nonradiative recombination. We successfully fabricated efficient blue PeLEDs with CsPb 2 Br 5 /perovskite microscale heterojunctions as the emitting layer. The device's maximum EQE reaches as high as 12.86% at an emission wavelength of 487 nm. 
 EXPERIMENTAL SECTION 2.1. Material Preparation. PEABr (>99.5%), MBABr (≥99.5%), CsBr (>99.9%), PbBr 2 (>99.99%), and TPBi (>99%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. LiF (99%), β-alanine (>99%), 18-crown-6 (>99%), and NaBr (>99+%) were purchased from Innochem. DMSO (99.9+%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. The precursor solutions of the perovskite were prepared by dissolving the materials in DMSO. The molar ratio of precursors is controlled according to Table  S1 , among which the concentration of PbBr 2 is controlled to be 0.05 mmol/L. All the above solutions were continuously stirred at 90 °C for 6 h until the materials were completely dissolved. 2.2. Device Fabrication. The ITO substrate was ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol consecutively, and then UVO treated for 15 min. NiO x (0.1 M) solution was prepared by adding nickel acetate and ethanolamine to an ethanol solution in a 1:1 ratio and stirring at 60 °C for 4 h. Then, the NiO x solution was spin-coated onto ITO at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 300 °C for 1 h. The overlapped PVK layer was deposited from its chlorobenzene solution (2 mg/mL) at 4000 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. The perovskite films were prepared by spin-coating the precursor solution at 4000 rpm for 40 s, which was then annealed at 75 °C for 10 min. TPBi (40 nm), LiF (1.4 nm), and Al (100 nm) layers were sequentially deposited under a high vacuum of 1 × 10 -4 Pa. The luminance area of the LED light-emitting area is 4 mm 2 . The single carrier device: for the hole-only device, the ITO substrate was ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol consecutively, and then UVO treated for 15 min. Then, a PEDOT:PSS solution was spin-coated onto ITO at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 150 °C for 15 min in the air. The perovskite film was spin-coated in the glove box with the same parameters as those for LED preparation. Molybdenum trioxide (MoO 3 , 8 nm) and Au (100 nm) were then evaporated on the surface. For electron-only devices, ZnMgO was spin coated onto ITO at 1000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 150 °C for 15 min in the air. The perovskite film was spin-coated in the glove box with the same parameters as for LED preparation. TPBi (40 nm), LiF (1.4 nm), and Al (100 nm) were vacuum evaporated on the surface. 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 Experiments and Characterization of Perovskite Films. Introducing large organic spacer cations to prepare quasi-2D perovskites with multiple quantum well structures is an effective strategy for obtaining blue light emission. However, the phase distribution in quasi-2D perovskite films is rather broad, especially due to the formation of a large number of small n-phase components, n = 1 and 2, which hinders effective energy transfer between perovskite phases, leading to poor electroluminescence performance.  40  Furthermore, the crystallization and film formation of perovskites inevitably introduce some defect states, increasing the probability of nonradiative recombination, which further limits the enhancement of device performance. Phenylethylammonium bromide (PEABr) is a commonly used organic cation due to its relatively high triplet energy level, allowing the effective capture of triplet excitons, thereby maintaining the perovskite's PLQYs.  41  Here, we used PEA + as the organic cation to prepare a quasi-2D perovskite (P10) as the control material. The molar ratio of precursors and preparation conditions of the P10 film are detailed in Table  S1 . From the absorption spectra in Figure  S1a , P10 shows obvious absorption peaks at 400, 430, and 460 nm, which correspond to different phases with n = 1, 2, and 3 in the quasi-2D perovskite, respectively. The prominent absorption peaks at 400 and 430 nm indicate the presence of excessive small n (n = 1 and 2) phases. Insufficient content of the n = 3 phase leads to an unreasonable energy landscape and destroys the structure of the energy funneling in the multiphase perovskite film. Therefore, excitons formed within the n = 1 phase cannot smoothly transfer to larger n-phases for radiative recombination, leading to severe nonradiative recombination.  [12] [13] [14] [15] 42  The weak shoulder peak located at ∼465 nm (Figure  S1b ) in the PL spectrum of P10 confirms the inadequate exciton transfer. In order to improve the luminescence efficiency, it is essential to reduce the proportion of small n-phases to establish a more reasonable energy landscape. By introducing sterically hindered ligands, such as MBABr, severe octahedral distortion caused by the MBA + on [PbX 6 ] 4-causes instability of the layered perovskite phase, leading to an increase in the bulk perovskite phase.  5  Here, we introduced different concentrations of MBABr into P10 precursor solutions to inhibit the formation of small n-phases. According to the UV-vis absorption spectra in Figure  S1a , the absorption peak corresponding to n = 1 and 2 phases gradually decreased with the increase of the MBABr ratio, indicating the suppression of small n-phases. Simultaneously, large n-phases and bulk phases increased and finally became the main component of the multiphase film. The change in phase proportions impacts the optical characteristics of the perovskite film. As shown in Figure  S1b , the shoulder peak in the short wavelength region diminishes with MBA addition. Additionally, a redshift in the PL spectra also confirms the increase in the proportion of large n-phases. Considering the evenly distributed n = 2 and n = 3 phases and its outstanding PL properties, perovskite P5M5 with a PEA:MBA ratio of 1:1 is selected as the basis for further investigation. Nevertheless, the PL peak of P5M5 is located at approximately 500 nm. To further adjust the PL wavelength for blue light emission and increase its PL intensity, it is necessary to more precisely control the phase distribution and defect density. Here, we introduced β-Ala to passivate the defects and modulate the perovskite growth to realize blue light emission (P5M5A5). The UV-vis absorption spectra and PL spectra of the perovskite films are shown in Figure  1 . It is noteworthy that the introduction of β-Ala successfully blueshifted the PL spectrum by 30 nm, from 505 to 475 nm, thereby tuning the fluorescence emission into the blue lightemitting domain. Additionally, the absorption spectrum exhibited a pronounced blue shift at the absorption edge, indicating that the addition of β-Ala effectively tuned the emission peak toward blue light emission and optimized the phase distribution.  15  However, the PL intensity is not significantly enhanced. Crown ethers are known for their ability to form stable complexes with metal ions. In the case of halide lead perovskites, crown ether can bind with Pb 2+ ions to form a supramolecular structure due to high reaction enthalpy.  43  This will slow the perovskite nucleation and form fewer nucleation centers. In addition, the transformation of the supramolecular intermediate also slows down and controls the rate during perovskite crystal formation, leading to more uniform and potentially higher quality crystals (we conducted experiments with other types of ligands, as shown in Figures  S3  and S4 ). Here, we chose 18-crown-6 ether (18Cr6) to modulate the crystallization of P5M5A5. However, 18Cr6 not only chelates with Pb 2+ ions to form supramolecular structures but also tends to bind with other cations in the precursor solution, such as Cs + , PEA + , and MBA + . This will disrupt the π-π stacking of PEA + and MBA + ammonium groups, leading to a reduction in small n-phases within the perovskite film and an increase in the 3D phase.  23, 43, 44  In order to further fine-tune the growth of perovskites and achieve the targeted structure, an equimolar amount of NaBr was introduced into the 18Cr6 solution to modulate the release of Pb  2+  . It has been reported in the literature that 18Cr6 can form a supramolecular structure with both Na + and Pb 2+ , exhibiting binding energies of -2.745 and -2.795 eV, respectively. This suggests that the introduced Na + could compete with Pb 2+ by interacting with 18Cr6, thereby disrupting the interaction of 18Cr6 with other cations (e.g., PEA + and MBA + ), and ultimately inhibiting the formation of the bulk perovskite phase.  24, 43  Upon annealing, Na + will replace Pb 2+ in the supramolecular intermediate, and Pb 2+ could be released for perovskite formation.  43  The addition of Cr-Na led to a substantial increase in PL intensity without  significantly shifting of the peak position (Figures  S2b  and 1b ). We measured the PLQYs of the three films, and the results are shown in Figure  S2c . The PLQYs values of the three films were determined to be 27.3%, 35.4%, and 46.2%, respectively, indicating that the defects in the perovskite were effectively passivated with the addition of the passivators. These observations are consistent with the steady-state fluorescence spectra shown in Figure  S2d . Furthermore, the radiative rate constant (k r ) and the nonradiative rate constant (k nr ) are calculated followed by these equations  45, 46  : k k 1 avg r nr = + (1) k k k PLQYs r r nr = + (2) The calculated data are summarized in Table  S2 . It reveals that, in the blue perovskite films, as the CsPb 2 Br 5 content increases, k r decreases, and the radiative lifetime increases. This indicates that the introduction of the indirect bandgap semiconductor can prolong the radiative lifetime, which is consistent with previous research findings.  47  Additionally, due to the effective passivation achieved by the additive, k nr of the film is significantly reduced, leading to an augmented proportion of radiative recombination. The morphology of perovskite films is characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements. Figure  2  shows the evolution of the morphology of the perovskite film with the sequential addition of β-Ala and Cr-Na. The P5M5 film is compact and uniform, and the average roughness is only 2.43 nm. The addition of β-Ala results in the emergence of discrete block-like islands. The average roughness of the P5M5A5 perovskite film increased to 5.87 nm. Upon further addition of Cr-Na, discrete square-shaped nanosheet structures were observed in the AFM images and the average roughness reached 6.42 nm. The SEM images align with the AFM findings, affirming the variance in film morphology and demonstrating the formation of well-separated square nanosheets, as shown in Figure  2d-f . Three differently sized nanosheets were then selected from the P5M5A5-Cr-Na film, and their longitudinal dimensions were measured by AFM, showing that the thickness of the nanosheets was around 15 nm (Figure  3a ). Furthermore, we prepared P5M5A5-Cr-Na films on ITO substrates and conducted interface transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cross-sectional energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), with the results shown in Figures  S6  and S7 . From Figure  S6 , we observed a bulk structure with a thickness of approximately 15 nm, which is consistent with the results characterized by AFM. This demonstrates that the nanosheet thickness is uniform on a larger scale. Combined with subsequent morphological characterization, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results, we believe that the increase in the PL intensity is attributed to the generation of the new structure of CsPb 2 Br 5 and the formation of the CsPb 2 Br 5 /CsPbBr 3 heterojunction. XRD results are shown in Figure  1c . All prepared samples exhibited distinct diffraction peaks, indicating their high crystallinity. The peaks located at 15.2°and 30.7°corresponded to CsPbBr 3 (PDF#18-0364). Through comparison with the PDF#25-0211 card, the peaks at 11.67°, 27.77°, and 30.35°were identified as (002), (114), and (221) crystal faces of CsPb 2 Br 5 .  48  By the addition of β-Ala and Cr-Na to P5M5, the intensity of the diffraction peaks corresponding to CsPb 2 Br 5 gradually increased, indicating an increase in the CsPb 2 Br 5 phase within the perovskite film. This result confirmed the formation of both CsPbBr 3 and CsPb 2 Br 5 phases in the samples and is consistent with the increased nanosheet-like structures observed in AFM. To further confirm the presence of both CsPb 2 Br 5 and CsPbBr 3 phases in the film, we performed high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) measurements on P5M5A5-Cr-Na, as shown in Figure  3b . The diffraction pattern of HR-TEM is shown in Figure  S8 . The particles show clear lattice fringes, which confirm their high crystallinity feature. The lattice spacings of 0.338 and 0.380 nm correspond to the (111) plane for CsPbBr 3 and the (210) plane for CsPb 2 Br 5 , respectively, proving that the two components coexist in direct contact, forming a CsPb 2 Br 5 /CsPbBr 3 heterojunction. Photoluminescence decay tests were conducted on the P5M5A5 and P5M5A5-Cr-Na films (Figure  3c ). The average exciton lifetimes for the two films were 3.672 and 7.351 ns, respectively. This is mainly due to the wide bandgap structure of CsPb 2 Br 5 , where an I-type band structure can be formed at the CsPbBr 3 /CsPb 2 Br 5 heterojunction. Carriers from CsPb 2 Br 5 can transfer to CsPbBr 3 , prolonging the photogenerated carrier lifetime of CsPbBr 3 and increasing its PLQYs.  33  Compared to the fluorescence lifetimes of P5M5A5 and P5M5A5-Cr-Na, P5M5 had a longer fluorescence lifetime due to its higher content of 3D perovskites.  49, 50  We conducted XPS tests on the three prepared perovskite films, as shown in Figure  3e ,f. The Pb 4f 7/2 and Pb 4f 5/2 peaks progressively shifted to lower binding energies, starting from 143.23 and 138.38 eV, respectively. This shift is due to the carboxyl groups of ligand β-Ala and the -Oin Cr-Na, which are recognized as electron donors that coordinate with Pb 2+ and reduce its oxidation state.  51  Consequently, this interaction elevates the electron density around Pb 2+ , causing a shift in the Pb 4f 7/2 and Pb 4f 5/2 peaks toward lower binding energies upon ligand addition.  52  This observation confirms the binding of β-Ala and Cr-Na ligands to the perovskite. Furthermore, the positions of the Br 3d 3/2 and 3d 5/2 peaks, as described in Figure  3f , also shifted toward lower binding energies upon the addition of ligands.  15, 53, 54  Particularly, this phenomenon is associated with the formation of CsPb 2 Br 5 .  37, 38  Effective passivation coupled with precise regulation of the perovskite growth process effectively reduces the density of defective states within the film. The defect density of the films was characterized by a space charge limited current (SCLC) test, as illustrated in Figures  3d  and S9 . Hole-only and electron-only devices were prepared with the structures of ITO/NiO x /PVK/perovskite/MoO 3 /Au and ITO/ZnMgO/ perovskite/TPBi/LiF/Al, respectively. In comparison to P5M5 and P5M5A5, P5M5A5-Cr-Na exhibits the lowest trap-filled limit voltage (V TFL ) values for both holes and electrons, indicating the effective suppression of defect formation in the P5M5A5-Cr-Na film. Such suppression contributes significantly to the film's exceptional PL properties, marking it as a superior candidate for optoelectronic applications. To explore the transfer mechanism of photogenerated carriers within the heterojunction film, we performed transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy on the P5M5A5-Cr-Na sample, and the results are presented in Figure  S10 . The TA spectra display three distinct ground-state bleaching peaks at 422, 453, and 473 nm. Notably, the ground-state bleaching peak at 422 nm (highlighted by the pink box in the figure) corresponds to CsPb 2 Br 5 , confirming its presence in the perovskite film. Based on the TA test, we postulate that photogenerated carriers are initially formed in CsPb 2 Br 5 and n = 3 quasi-2D perovskite phases, as evidenced by the prominent ground-state bleaching peaks observed at 2 ps in the TA spectrum. However, as the decay time increases, the ground-state bleaching peaks corresponding to CsPb 2 Br 5 and n = 3 quasi-2D perovskite gradually diminish, accompanied by an increase in the groundstate bleaching peaks linked to the n ≥ 4 phase. This trend suggests a transfer of photogenerated carriers from the CsPb 2 Br 5 and n = 3 phases toward the lower-order perovskites. This carrier migration behavior is crucial to the film's optoelectronic properties and performance. 3.2. The Mechanism of In Situ CsPb 2 Br 5 Fabrication. In the precursor solution for in situ preparation of the CsPb 2 Br 5 /quasi-2D perovskite heterojunction, three additives, MBA + , β-Ala, and Cr-Na, were introduced. To elucidate the mechanism behind this process, we subjected the P5M5A5-Cr-Na sample to annealing at 80 °C for various durations and performed XRD testing on these films. The evolution of the XRD pattern is shown in Figure  S11 . The peaks denoted by ac correspond to the diffraction peaks of NaBr, CsBr, and PbBr 2 , respectively. As time progressed, NaBr, CsBr, and PbBr 2 were gradually consumed and transformed into the perovskite and CsPb 2 Br 5 . Notably, at the 300 s mark, we observed that  the NaBr peak had nearly vanished, whereas the PbBr 2 diffraction peak persisted. This potentially suggests a process wherein 18Cr6 releases Pb 2+ to bind with Na + . By the 600 s mark, all the diffraction peaks corresponding to NaBr, CsBr, and PbBr 2 had disappeared, leaving solely the diffraction peaks of CsPb 2 Br 5 and CsPbBr 3 , indicating that the perovskite had undergone complete annealing. We investigated the roles played by MBA + , β-Ala, and Cr-Na in the formation of the CsPb 2 Br 5 /quasi-2D perovskite heterojunction. To assess the effect of MBA + , XRD tests were conducted on films with varying MBA + contents: P10A5-Cr-Na and P7M3A5-Cr-Na, as shown in Figure  S12 . The relative peak intensity of the CsPb 2 Br 5 diffraction peak in P7M3A5-Cr-Na is higher than that in the P10A5-Cr-Na film. This indicates that the addition of MBA + favors the formation of CsPb 2 Br 5 . Through studies on the solution system, it was found that during the growth process, the [PbBr 6 ] 4-octahedral structure is initially formed. When β-Ala and Cr-Na are present in the solution, they bind to a portion of Pb 2+ . This binding prevents these Pb 2+ ions from interacting with Br -and Cs + to form [PbBr 6 ] 4-and quasi-2D perovskite structures. Consequently, a significant amount of Pb 2+ remains in the precursor, leading to regions where Pb 2+ concentrations exceed those of Cs + . In conditions with abundant Pb 2+ , the [PbBr 6 ] 4-octahedra may undergo rupture, facilitating the incorporation of Pb 2+ and Br - ions into the octahedral structure, forming [PbBr 8 ] 6- polyhedra composed of triangular prisms and two lateral vertex angles. Subsequently, the [PbBr 8 ] 6-polyhedra share corner Br atoms, giving rise to a square-phase [Pb 2 Br 5 ] -layer. This layer further combines with Cs + to create the crystal structure of CsPb 2 Br 5 . The introduction of MBA + ions into the precursor solution leads to significant lattice distortion in the perovskite due to the larger spatial effect of MBA + ions compared to PEA + ions, which containing MBA + significantly increases.  5, 18  This allows [PbBr 6 ] -to break off and free itself into the precursor solution. Upon annealing, the growth of the perovskite consumes Pb 2+ , and Pb 2+ previously bound to β-Ala and Cr-Na is gradually released. The liberated [PbBr 6 ] 4-and Pb 2+ react to generate [PbBr 8 ] 6-, which then combines with Cs + , collectively forming the CsPb 2 Br 5 structure.  33, 36  This entire process is schematically illustrated in Figure  4 . 3.3. Device Performance of CsPb 2 Br 5 /Quasi-2D Blue PeLEDs. The preparation of the CsPb 2 Br 5 /quasi-2D perovskite heterojunction through an in situ one-step process is schematically depicted in Figure  5a . To ensure efficient hole injection, we employed NiO x /PVK as a step-like hole transport layer. The device structure of the CsPb 2 Br 5 /quasi-2D heterojunction PeLED is the ITO/NiO x /PVK/perovskite heterojunction/TPBi/LiF/Al, as illustrated in Figure  5b . The UPS test results and the corresponding energy level diagrams of the device are shown in Figures  S13  and S14 , respectively. In the P5M5A5-Cr-Na device, the CsPb 2 Br 5 /quasi-2D perovskite hybrid film exhibits a reduced defect density. The presence of a type-I heterojunction facilitates a smoother energy transfer between phases within the quasi-2D perovskite, thereby enhancing the exciton lifetime by suppressing nonradiative energy transfer to the trap sites. Additionally, the wide bandgap of CsPb 2 Br 5 in the type-I heterojunction also effectively reduces the leakage current in the device. As a result, the P5M5A5-Cr-Na device achieves comparable brightness at a lower current density, leading to a significantly higher current efficiency. Analysis of hole-only and electron-only devices reveals that as the CsPb 2 Br 5 content increases, both electron and hole mobility decrease, explaining the significant decrease in current density observed in the P5M5A5-Cr-Na device.  55  Given the substantial use of organic small molecules (β-Ala and 18-crown-6) during heterojunction film preparation, and based on prior literature, we postulate that the gaps surrounding the nanosheets are likely occupied by these organic molecules.  56, 57  The organic spacer hinders carrier transfer, leading to variations in current density. Furthermore, CsPb 2 Br 5 is categorized as a p-type semiconductor,  58  implying that electron transfer in CsPb 2 Br 5 is relatively challenging, thus hindering electron migration. This finding aligns with the results obtained from the SCLC test. Additionally, the CsPb 2 Br 5 /quasi-2D perovskite heterojunction nanosheets formed within the thin film have the capability to extract wide-angle light trapped in the waveguide modes, thereby further enhancing the EQE.  56  Both the P5M5A5 and P5M5A5-Cr-Na devices emit sky-blue light with a spectra peak around 487 nm (Figure  5e ). The CIE color coordinate diagrams for both devices are shown in Figure  S15 . Both devices show excellent EL spectral stability under different biases, as demonstrated in Figure  S16 . The P5M5A5 device achieves a maximum EQE of only 2.83%. However, the P5M5A5-Cr-Na device exhibits a significant 3.59-fold increase in the EQE, reaching 12.86%, as shown in Figure  5d . The statistical EQE values of 16 P5M5A5-Cr-Na devices are shown in Figure  5f , highlighting the good repeatability of the type-I heterojunction. This innovative strategy also effectively improves the operating half-lifetime of the device from 10.7 to 14.2 min (Figure  5g ). 
 CONCLUSION In summary, we have made significant advances in the performance of blue PeLEDs by strategically employing CsPb 2 Br 5 plates/quasi-2D perovskite heterojunctions. Our approach leverages chelating molecules to meticulously modulate the crystallization process of the perovskite, resulting in the in situ formation of CsPb 2 Br 5 /quasi-2D perovskite heterojunctions. The wide bandgap of CsPb 2 Br 5 facilitated the formation of a type-I band alignment at the heterojunction interface, allowing efficient charge transfer from CsPb 2 Br 5 to CsPbBr 3 . This unique architecture not only extended the carrier lifetime but also increased the PLQYs in CsPbBr 3 . Through a comprehensive experimental protocol, we have demonstrated a remarkable improvement in the EQE of blue PeLEDs, achieving a peak EQE of 12.86% at an emission wavelength of 487 nm, approximately 3.59 times higher than that of the P5M5A5 device. Our work not only provides a novel strategy for enhancing the efficiency of blue PeLEDs but also offers valuable insights into the intricate interplay between material design, crystallization kinetics, and device performance. By utilizing the soft crystalline properties of perovskites and the tunability offered by additives, we have paved the way for future optimization of PeLEDs, specifically targeting the challenging blue emission range.
