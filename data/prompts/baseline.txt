"You are a scientific assistant and your task is to extract certain information from text, particularly 
in the context of perovskite solar cells. Your task is to identify and extract details about passivating molecules and associated performance data mentioned in the text.

Your task is to extract relevant scientific data from the provided text about perovskite solar cells.
    Follow these guidelines:

    1. **If passivating molecules are mentioned:**
    - If there is more than one passivating molecule tested, only return data for the champion passivator.
    - Include stability test data for the champion passivating molecule. There may be multiple stability tests for a single molecule.

    2. **If no passivating molecules are mentioned:**
    - Provide a JSON object with any other relevant data explicitly mentioned in the text.

    **JSON Structure:**
    - DO NOT change the names of any of the property names. It is imperative that these are exactly as they as stated in the schema below.
    - Ensure the output adheres to the following structure and is parseable as valid JSON:

    {{
        "perovskite_composition": null, // (string).
        "electron_transport_layer": null, // (string).
        "pin_nip_structure": null, // (values: "PIN" or "NIP").
        "hole_transport_layer": null, // (string).
        "passivating_molecule": null, // (string).
        "control_pce": null, // (numeric).
        "control_voc": null, // (numeric).
        "treated_pce": null, // (numeric).
        "treated_voc": null // (numeric).
        "test_1": {{ // Use unique keys for each test (e.g., test_1, test_2, etc.).
            "test_name": null, // (string)
            "temperature": null, // (numeric).
            "time": null, // (string or numeric).
            "humidity": null, // (string or numeric).
            "efficiency_cont": null, // (numeric).
            "efficiency_tret": null, // (numeric).
        }}
    }}

    Now extract from the following text:
