Title: Study on enhancing water stability and efficiency of inverted perovskite solar cells with guanidine iodide
Non-radiative recombination of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) will increase as a result of the numerous crystallographic defects that the solution-grown perovskite films will cause, particularly at the grain boundary and film surface. As a result, it negatively influences the performance of the device. Consequently, lowering perovskite film defects is a useful strategy for raising the efficiency of PSCs. This study reports a grain regeneration and passivation approach that can decrease the recombination loss of the perovskite layer/charge transfer layer interface and the grain border. Guanidine iodide (GAI) treatment of perovskite films is the means by which this objective is accomplished. Unlike most methods that use GAI to post-treatment the perovskite layer or add GAI into the perovskite precursor solution, this work uses GAI for pre-treatment before spin coating the perovskite layer. It can effectively passivate surface defects and increase the grain size of perovskite films by controlling the crystallization process. The water stability of devices was enhanced, the short-circuit current (J sc ), filling factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs were markedly improved, and nonradiative recombination was successfully reduced. The best efficiency of PSCs was 20.56% after the additional GAI treatment was applied to the perovskite layer, an 11.9% increase over the efficiency of the control device without GAI treatment. This method has the advantage of being simple and straightforward, providing a feasible pathway for the low-cost preparation and commercialization of PSCs.
The overuse of fossil fuels in modern society has led to a severe threat to the sustainable development of human society by exacerbating environmental issues like the greenhouse effect  1, 2  . The utilization of renewable clean energy is considered one of the many effective solutions to addressing this crisis  [3] [4] [5]  . Solar energy is a clean and renewable energy source that holds a significant position in the field of renewable clean energy  6  . A number of solar cell designs have been developed in an effort to completely utilize solar energy  [7] [8] [9]  , and improving the PCE of solar cells is a key factor to fully utilize solar energy and reduce the cost of photovoltaic power generation  10, 11  . In recent years, as the dominant technology for photovoltaic power generation, the efficiency of silicon solar cells has reached a record high of 26.81%  12  . However, the technology required to improve the PCE of silicon cells is becoming more and more complex, and the cost has increased sharply, and its efficiency is basically close to their Shockley Quayser (S-Q) efficiency limit of ≈ 27%, the potential for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of silicon-based solar cells is extremely limited  13  . Therefore, developing high-performance, lowcost, and stable photovoltaic materials and device technologies is a core issue in solar cell research. PSCs have been regarded as a potential photovoltaic technology since the first report because of their advantages, which include a high PCE, low material cost, and an easy preparation method  14  . PSCs currently have an efficiency of 26.9%, which can rival that of silicon-based solar cells  15  . Importantly, PSCs are far from reaching their theoretical efficiency limit. However, its susceptibility to moisture and oxygen-related instability  16, 17  , as well as issues such as non-radiative recombination losses at grain boundaries and surfaces within the perovskite film, contribute to lower open-circuit voltages (V oc ) in PSCs, severely impacting their performance. Researchers have employed a number of strategies to regulate in an attempt to modify this predicament, and they have made some headway  [18] [19] [20] [21] [22]  . Khenkin et al. employed glue-based "LAB" packaging, which significantly increased the durability of the PSCs, they did this by bonding a thin glass cover on top of the cell using a UV-curable acrylate adhesive  18  . In order to effectively suppress non-radiative recombination loss, Zheng et al. prepared a 2D/3D perovskite film by dropping a PEAI alcohol solution on a 3D perovskite film prepared by a one-step method. This resulted in the replacement of MA + by PEA + at the 3D perovskite film, raising the V OC to 1.14 V and the corresponding PCE to 23.04%  19  . By reacting n-butylamine (BA) with the 3D perovskite surface, Huang et al. created a 2D/3D stacked structure that improved the thermal stability of the device, decreased the trap density, prolonged the carrier lifetime, and greatly increased PCE from 17.28 to 19.56%  20  . Furthermore, self-assembled monolayers, or SAMs, are frequently employed to effectively passivate interface defects and enhance the performance of PSC  21, 22  . In order to enhance the performance of PSCs through surface passivation, the massive organic ligand guanidine (Gua + ) is frequently utilized to generate two-dimensional (2D) perovskite on the top film surface  [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30]  . It is challenging to precisely build a 2D layer at the buried bottom interface by pre-introducing large organic cations on the substrate because they dissolve rapidly in the precursor solution. Therefore, large organic ligands are often introduced into PSCs structures as additives or surface passivators in precursor solutions. Yadav et al. demonstrated the integration of Gua + ions in the electron transport layer and perovskite absorption layer by studying the impact of Gua + on the V oc of PSCs based on (Gua) x (MA) 1-x PbI 3 . At the contact, an area of aggregation for both electrons and ions forms, which greatly increases the V oc  23  . Gua + prevents undesirable lattice distortion and suppresses halogen vacancy defects more effectively than benzene ammonium (PA + ) and phenylethyl ammonium (PEA + ), according to research conducted by Tan et al. using DFT investigations. It is anticipated that guanidinium tetrafluoroborate (GuaBF 4 ), when added, will inhibit the development of halogen vacancy defects with negligible effect on the perovskite lattice. Comparing the additive-using devices to the control devices, the average V oc and FF were significantly improved  25  . The viability of a perovskite layer based on triple cations was demonstrated by Zhang et al. combined MA + , FA + , and Gua + triple cations with perovskite and shaped it into a 3D structure using a two-step deposition process. Gua + was added, and this helped the device performance even better by passivating defects and suppressing non-radiative recombination. The PCE of the device was 21.3%, and stability was also improved  27  . GuaBr and n-OABr were used by Mozaffari et al. to introduce guanidine and n-octyl ammonium cations. Better than the single-cation passivation layer, the doublecation passivation layer increased the V oc of PSC to 1.21 V and its PCE to 23.13%  30  . In this work, we developed passivation and controlling the crystallization process technique for perovskite film grains, which can effectively improve device performance by reducing recombination losses at the interfaces between the charge transport layer and the perovskite grain. When GAI is used as an additive to precursor solutions, it may alter the crystal structure of perovskite. Whereas in this work GAI is mainly used to modify and optimize the surface of perovskite thin films and reduce the defect density. The results demonstrate that the GAI addition can control the crystallization process of perovskite grains and lower the density of defect states, smoothing out the grain borders and improving the smoothness of perovskite film. The passivation approach ultimately led to an improvement in the efficiency and moisture stability of PSCs. We achieved the champion device for wide bandgap PSCs with a PCE of 20.56% (V OC = 1.15 V, J sc = 22.61 mA cm -2 , and FF = 79.1%). 
 Experiment Every material utilized in this experiment was bought and used exactly as it was received. The structure of the PSCs conceived and manufactured in this study is depicted in Fig.  1 . A mask featuring a 0.05 cm 2 aperture area was employed. After cleaning the ITO substrate for 15 min with detergent, deionized water, ethanol, and isopropanol, it was dried for 8 h at 70 °C in a drying oven. Prior to applying each functional layer to the ITO substrate, the substrate was cleaned for ten minutes using UV ozone treatment. Solution A is the mixture of PbBr 2 (551.4 mg) and MABr (153.2 mg) dissolved in 1 ml of mixed solvent (N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF): dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) = 4:1). Solution B is the mixture of FAI (247.4 mg) and PbI 2 (695 mg) dissolved in 1 ml of DMF:DMSO = 4: 1). Solution C is the result of dissolving CsI in DMSO at a concentration of 400 mg/ mL. After being fully dissolved in nitrogen for eight hours, three different types of solutions A, B, and C were combined in various ratios to create the precursor solution. FA 0.83 Cs 0.05 MA 0.12 PbI 2.64 Br 0.36 (E g =1.65 eV) is the chemical formula. After spin-coating 200 µL of PTAA solution onto the substrate for 30 s at 5000 rpm, the material was annealed for 20 min at 120 °C. Following the substrate cooling to room temperature, 200 µL of GAI solution was spin-coated onto it for 20 s at 5000 rpm, and it was subsequently annealed for 10 min at 100 °C. 130 µL of the perovskite precursor solution was put onto the GAI membrane once it had cooled to room temperature. Apply spin coating at a low speed of 2000 rpm for 5 s, followed by a high speed of 4000 rpm for 25 s. 240 µL of EA is swiftly dropped on the film as an antisolvent in the final 10 s, and it is annealed at 100 °C for 20 min. 250 µL of PCBM was put onto the perovskite film and spin-coated on the substrate for 25 s at 4000 rpm after allowing it to cool to room temperature. Ultimately, a 110 nm-thick silver film was created as the cathode by vacuum thermal evaporation at a rate of 5 Å.s -1 . Figure  1  illustrates the device production flow chart. Using a Keithley 2400, the current density-voltage (J-V) properties of PSC were measured. With the use of a silicon solar cell (Newport 91, 150 V), the light intensity was measured. There is no preprocessing involved in this task, and the scanning speed is fixed at 0.15 volts per second. Using the silicon solar cell as a reference, the spectral response was calculated using the external quantum efficiency (EQE) system of the appropriate spectral measurement instrument (Enlitech QE-R). 
 Results and discussion In this work, we prepared a perovskite film with a composition of FA 0.83 Cs 0.05 MA 0.12 PbI 2.64 Br 0.36 using a onestep antisolvent-assisted deposition approach. Guanidine iodide (GAI) was then used to process the perovskite film PSCs (Fig.  1 ). For the treatment of GAI, a concentration of 5 mg ml -1 is ideal. The statistical performance of the control device and the ideal concentration treatment device are displayed in Table  1 ; Fig.  2 , respectively. Each device was produced in 20 pieces, and each one performance was assessed. The optimal parameters were determined to be a subset of the parameters of the highest-performing device, the average of the parameters across all devices was then determined. While the average V OC remained essentially the same, the devices employing the GAI additive demonstrated notable improvements in average J sc and FF as compared to the control device (Table  1 ). Figure  2a  and d  show the primary photovoltaic characteristics of the cells following treatment with varying doses. After passivation, the cells displayed gains in every photovoltaic parameter. The average J sc increased from 20.22 mA cm -2 of the control device to 22.28 mA cm -2 of the treated device, and the average V OC increased from 1.12 V of the control device to 1.14 V of the treated device, as we observed. In addition, the average FF of the treated device is much higher than that of the control device, coming in at 78.23% as opposed to 77.20%. With a 13.3% rise, the average PCE of GAI devices (19.79%) is much larger than that of control devices (17.47%). The J-V characterization and the J sc value that was taken from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve are highly compatible (Fig.  3a, b ). The extraction and conduction of holes on the surface of the perovskite film are greatly improved following passivation by GAI and control of the film crystallization process, enhancing the EQE and J sc of the cell. The champion device (Fig.  3c ; Table  2 ) shows very little hysteresis in comparison to the control device, indicating that GAI is a useful tool for passivating the perovskite layer. We use the following algorithm to determine the PSC lag index  31, 32  HI(%) = ((P CEreverse -P CEf orward)/P CEreverse) × 100 Where the reverse and forward scans respective power conversion efficiencies are P CEreverse and P CEf orward. Based on the J-V results, the HI of the control device is calculated to be 5.3%. The HI of the device after GAI treatment is 3.3%, indicating that the PSC after GAI treatment has better performance. X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests were performed on control and GAI-treated perovskite films to determine their crystallinity, as shown in Fig.  3d    [25] [26] [27] [28]  . GAI treatment improved the crystallinity of the perovskite layer by increasing the peak intensity of the (100) crystallographic plane (2θ = 14.3°)  27  . Typically, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is employed to calculate the grain size of perovskite films  28  . The GAI-treated film has a much lower FWHM value (0.16º) for the (100) peak compared to the control film (0.21º). This suggests improved crystallinity and grain size, implying reduced non-radiative recombination and a longer carrier lifetime. The photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of the perovskite film before and after GAI treatment were measured using the ITO/GAI/perovskite configuration, as shown in Fig.  4a  and b , to validate the effect of GAI on reducing defects in perovskite films. For PL measurements, both the control film and the GAI-treated perovskite film exhibited a PL peak at 773 nm. The latter had greater PL intensity, suggesting that, following GAI treatment, non-radiative recombination was diminished as a result of the decreased trap density of the sample (Fig.  4a )  27, 28  . In order to fit the decay process using a double exponential function and investigate the carrier lifetime of perovskite films, TRPL measurements were carried out: 33   f (t) = A1 • exp( -t τ 1 ) + A2 • exp( -t τ 2 ) + B ( 2 ) where A1, A2, τ 1, τ 2 and B are the decay amplitude, decay lifetime and baseline offset respectively. The short lifetime τ 1 is the decay component related to the charge capture process, while the long lifetime τ 2 is related to the de-capture process or carrier recombination process. The average decay lifetime is calculated according to τ = (A1τ 2 1 + A2τ 2 2 )/(A1τ 1 + A2τ 2). With double exponential fitting, the results demonstrate that the carrier lifetime in the GAI-treated perovskite film (1.13 µs) is longer than that in the control film (0.69 µs, Fig.  4b ). This demonstrates that GAI suppresses carrier recombination and accelerates charge transfer between the perovskite and hole transport layers (HTL), both of these are advantageous to the hole extraction process, so better device performance can be expected. For GAI devices, the decrease in non-radiative recombination leads to an increase in V OC . The function V OC = εkBT In(I)/q + C 33 , where kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the basic charge, and C is the fitting constant, can be used to characterize the connection between V OC and incident light intensity (I). When the device is turned off, the current density of the cell is 0, and all photogenerated carriers are recombined. If only bimolecular recombination occurs, the slope of the open circuit voltage V OC of the cell device and the logarithm of the light intensity should beKBT /q. In fact,  the carrier recombination process is also mixed with other recombination processes dominated by first-order recombination  33  . Based on the above theory, when the logarithmic slope of V OC and light intensity is closer to KBT /q, we can consider it to be first-order recombination, that is, the less defects-assisted recombination  [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38]  . The GAI device is nearer the unity ideal factor than the control device, according to the light intensity-dependent V OC analysis displayed in Fig.  5a  (1.29 V for GAI and 1.35 V for control). The defects state density of films is frequently determined using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) technique. In order to do this, we created a single-carrier device employing the ITO/PEDOT: PSS/GAI/perovskite/PTAA/Ag structure. Figure  5b  displays the J-V curves of the device. The following relationship can be used to compute the defects state density (n t )  34, 35  , V T F L = entL 2 /2εε0 (3) where V T F L represents the voltage applied at the inflection point, which is called the trap filling limit voltage, e is the electron element charge, ε is the vacuum dielectric constant, ε0 is the relative dielectric constant of perovskite, and L is the perovskite film thickness. The test calculated that the hole defects state density was 1.61 × 10 16 cm -3 before and 1.40 × 10 16 cm -3 after GAI modification. The defects state density is significantly reduced after GAI treatment, that is, the passivated device shows fewer trapped states than the control device. This work demonstrates the efficiency of our surface passivation technique by demonstrating that GAI enhances the deposition of low defects state density perovskite films, can effectively inhibit trap-assisted recombination, and facilitates quicker charge transfer between perovskite and hole transport layers  30, 34  . When the GAI processing device and control device are in the dark, Fig.  5c  illustrates the relationship between their leakage current and voltage. According to the data, current leakage based on GAI cells is reduced because the current density of the GAI processing device is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the control device. This finding is consistent with the rise in V OC and FF. Reduced dark current density allows light-induced photocurrent to be effectively collected instead of internally recombined, which enhances the performance of solar cells  25, 27  . The control device and the GAI-modified device were placed under a standard light intensity and connected to an electrochemical workstation to test their electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Fig.  5d ). The inset is the equivalent circuit diagram, and Table  3  provides the fitting results. The symbols R S , R rec and C rec represent series resistance, composite resistance and capacitance respectively  36, 37  . The R S values of the device before and after GAI treatment are 52.6 Ω and 27.3 Ω respectively. Furthermore, the figure shows that the device with GAI treatment has a greater radius in its AC impedance spectrum than the device without GAI, which is indicative of a larger R rec value. The R rec (352.4 Ω) of treated device is higher than the R rec (141.2 Ω) of untreated device, suggesting that GAI-based devices have larger R rec and less charge recombination. The passivation of the perovskite layer by Gua + cations is thought to be the cause of the suppression of charge recombination. This process improves interfacial contact on the film surface and lowers carrier recombination by raising the open-circuit voltage  27, 36, 37  . In order to investigate the impact of the GAI additive on the film, we measured the SEM image of perovskite film, as indicated in Fig.  6 . The findings demonstrate a considerable improvement in the grain size of the GAItreated perovskite film (292 nm) (Fig.  6b, d ) over that of the control film (221 nm) (Fig.  6a, c ). When GAI is included, the crystal units expand, which is why the average grain size is bigger  26  . Guanidine ions lengthen the crystallization period of perovskite film and aid in the formation of a more stable interphase. On the one hand, perovskite crystals have a tendency to expand into larger particles, and the longer crystallization period of guanidine ions decreases the number of initial crystal nuclei, which is advantageous to boosting the crystal growth rate. However, guanidine ions are progressively forced into the grain borders and enriched during the annealing process, which significantly raises the interface energy of perovskite crystals. These high interfaces act as a driving factor for the behavior of large-sized particles devouring small-sized particles in an effort to lower the free energy of the system  26, 27  . These factors make the film surface flatter and smoother, which can effectively reduce grain boundaries, improve carrier transport capabilities, and reduce interface recombination. To verify the ability of Gua + to prolong the crystallization time of perovskite films, XRD spectra of the control film and the GAI-treated film were analyzed with varying annealing times, as shown in Fig.  7 . The XRD peaks of the control film stabilized by 3 min of annealing, whereas the intensity of XRD peaks in the GAI-treated film remains elevated even after 5 min of annealing  30, 37, 39  . These observations indicate a slight delay in the crystallization process of perovskite films upon the introduction of the GAI additive, leading to the formation of pinhole-free and large-grained perovskite films. These favorable characteristics contribute significantly to the enhanced performance of PSCs. This study contrasts with Dong et al.,  39  as it specifically investigates the impact of Gua + on perovskite films under annealing conditions, demonstrating their role in prolonging crystallization time. The contact angle (CA) of the perovskite layer was measured in order to investigate its moisture stability following GAI treatment, as illustrated in Fig.  8 . Experiments reveal that the perovskite film treated with GAI Table  3 . Nyquist curve fitting results of perovskite devices before and after GAI treatment. (CA = 66.3°) has a greater contact angle and is more hydrophobic than the GAI-free control sample (CA = 58.8°), suggesting that the GAI-doped film has superior moisture stability  [24] [25] [26]  . Additionally, we recorded the efficiency of unencapsulated devices stored in an ambient environment (temperature: 25-30 °C, humidity: 30-40% RH) for 14 days and in a high-humidity environment (65% RH) for 10 days, as shown in Fig.  8c  and d  27, 39  . After GAI treatment, the devices retained 81% of their initial PCE after 14 days in the ambient environment and 62% of their initial PCE after 10 days in the high-humidity environment. In contrast, the control devices maintained only 60% of their initial PCE in the ambient environment and just 37% in the high-humidity environment. This demonstrates that devices treated with GAI exhibit better resistance to oxygen and humidity stability. Furthermore, as illustrated in Fig.  9 , we examined the shape of the perovskite layer both before and after GAI treatment using atomic force microscopy (AFM) technology. The surface roughness of the GAI-treated perovskite film (5.08 nm) was less than that of the control sample (7.64 nm), according to AFM results that were consistent with the SEM pictures. By improving contact with the transport layer, the smooth surface of perovskite layer inhibits nonradiative recombination and facilitates charge extraction at the interface  26  . According to this data, there is better charge transfer and less recombination at the interface between the GAI-based perovskite layer and the HTL than there was in the reference sample  23, 26, 30  . 
 Conclusions In conclusion, we present a passivation technique for grains that lowers recombination losses in perovskites at the interface between the HTL and grain boundaries at the same time. The perovskite film is processed using GAI in this procedure. Perovskite grain crystallization processes are induced by GAI, which also facilitates Gua + penetration into the HTL/perovskite bottom contact. This technique can greatly improve the performance of device by lowering the non-radiative recombination losses at the interface and body. J sc and PCE improve by 9.2% and 11.9%, respectively, to achieve 22.61 mA cm -2 and 20.56%, respectively. The FF and V OC of PSCs both rose. With the help of our study, nonradiative recombination within the perovskite absorber body and interfacial nonradiative recombination in the perovskite/HTL can be reduced simultaneously. This research has the potential to increase cell stability, offer a practical process for producing straightforward and effective PSCs, and hasten the commercialization of perovskite solar technology.
