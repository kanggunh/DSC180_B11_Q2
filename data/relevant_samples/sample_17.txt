Title: Mechanical Compression-Enabled Carbon-Based Perovskite Solar Cells with Enhanced Efficiency and Stability
Carbon electrode-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) without hole transport layer (HTL) have been emerging as a promising low-cost photovoltaic technology with excellent stability for commercialization. However, the loose physical contact between the carbon electrode and perovskite layer, as well as the relatively poor conductivity of the carbon film, contributes mainly to the large gap in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) between C-PSCs and the metal (Ag, Au, etc.,) electrode-based counterparts. To this end, a simple but effective mechanical compression strategy for efficient C-PSCs is developed. The mechanical compression densifies the porous carbon electrode for high film conductivity and also provides intimate contact between carbon and perovskite layers for fast charge extraction. Consequently, the resulting HTL-free C-PSCs using MAPbI 3 (MA = methylammonium) absorber yield a PCE of 15.29%, corresponding to a 27.6% improvement compared to the counterpart without mechanical pressing treatment. Moreover, the compacted carbon film also serves as an enhanced barrier against the intrusion of water and oxygen, and the unencapsulated device retains 88.9% of its initial PCE after 1000 h of aging in ambient conditions with 35 AE 2% humidity. This work paves a simple and effective way toward efficient and stable C-PSC.
Introduction After rapid development in the past decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.14%,  [1, 2]  catching up with the PCE record of the state-of-the-art crystalline silicon solar cells.  [3, 4]  However, the long-term stability of PSCs remains a major limitation that hinders the practical application of PSCs.  [5] [6] [7]  So far, highly efficient PSCs commonly employ metallic Ag or Au electrodes.  [8, 9]  The metal atoms can diffuse into the perovskite layer and cause the decomposition of the perovskite absorber, which is detrimental to the stability of the solar cells.  [10] [11] [12]  Meanwhile, the deposition of noble Ag or Au electrodes involves vacuum evaporation, which is cumbersome and costly. Carbon-based PSCs (C-PSCs), which employ a carbon layer as the top electrode, have emerged as a promising alternative to avoid the drawbacks of metal electrodebased devices.  [13] [14] [15]  The deposition of carbon electrodes can be realized through a scalable and fast printing method, which avoids tedious vacuum evaporation and significantly reduces the manufacturing cost. In addition, C-PSCs can work effectively in the absence of a hole transport layer (HTL). Removing the expensive organic HTL (commonly Spiro-OMeTAD or poly[bis(4phenyl)(2,4,6-triMethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA)) can further simplify the manufacturing process, reduce the production cost, and enhance the stability of C-PSCs.  [16] [17] [18]  Most importantly, the hydrophobic nature of the carbon film can effectively block moisture intrusion and thus lead to excellent environmental stability of the devices. In 2020, Han et al. reported the successful qualification of printable C-PSCs by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC61215:2016), with an operational tracking time of 9,000 h.  [19]  This was the first time PSCs have passed the international photovoltaic standard. Although the C-PSCs have demonstrated exciting stability, their PCE still lags far behind their metal electrode-based counterparts.  [20] [21] [22]  The commercially available conductive carbon pastes commonly used for C-PSCs compose of black carbon (BC) nanoparticles with tens of nanometers in diameter and micrometer-sized flaky graphite. Printing of these carbon paste onto the rough perovskite surface inevitably results in a porous film with loose contact at the carbon/perovskite interface and poor film conductivity, consequently leading to inferior charge extraction and transport within the C-PSCs.  [22] [23] [24]  Several strategies have been commonly exploited to enhance interfacial contacts: 1) preparation of an ultraeven and dense perovskite film with low roughness, which facilitates the physical contact between perovskite film and with carbon layer;  [20]  2) precisely designing the components of carbon electrodes to enhance interfacial contact; and  [25]  3) inserting a third layer, such as small nanoparticles of metal oxide semiconductors and carbon quantum dots/nanotubes, into the carbon/perovskite interfaces can improve interfacial contact and thus facilitate rapid charge extraction.  [26] [27] [28] [29] [30]  For example, Wang et al. bridged the perovskite and carbon layers by carbon nanotubes, and the resulting C-PSCs gained a PCE improvement from 13.86% to 15.73%.  [31]  Moreover, doping the carbon electrode with smallmolecule semiconductors such as copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) can also lead to an enhanced built-in electric field and fast charge transfer at the perovskite/carbon interface.  [32]  So far, most reported works have focused only on tailoring the carbon/perovskite interface. Studies that simultaneously address contact and conductivity issues are rare but highly desired. In this study, we developed a simple mechanical compression approach to simultaneously improve the conductivity of the carbon electrode and form an intimate perovskite/carbon interface contact for HTL-free planar C-PSCs. By exerting mechanical pressure, the carbon film becomes tightly integrated with the perovskite layer, benefiting enhanced photogenerated hole extraction. The carbon electrode also becomes denser with improved electrical conductivity for fast charge transport within the devices. The obtained C-PSCs achieved a significant PCE improvement from 11.98% to 15.29%. Additionally, the practical stability of unencapsulated devices was superior to that of the control solar cells. The excellent stability can be attributed to the dense carbon electrode that provides better resistance to block the invasion of moisture. 
 Results and Discussions In this study, the typical MAPbI 3 perovskite prepared by the traditional one-step spin-coating method was used as the absorber. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and atomic force microscopy (AFM) profiles shown in Figure  S1  depict a typical surface morphology of the MAPbI 3 perovskite film, with uneven grain size distribution and rough surface [with a root mean square (RMS) roughness up to 30.9 nm] that is similar to the reported work.  [33]  On the other hand, as revealed by the SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure  S2 ), the commercial carbon paste consists of 20-30 nm CB nanoparticles and micrometer-sized graphite flakes, in which the flaky graphite is added to enhance the conductivity of the carbon films. In these cases, printing of carbon paste onto the rough perovskite surface inevitably results in loose interface contact, as schematically illustrated in Figure  1a . Moreover, there are many micropores with sizes of tens to hundreds of nanometers in the printed carbon film, and the electrical contacts between BC particles and graphite flakes are also poor (Figure  S2a ), leading to inferior film conductivity. To this end, mechanical compression is exploited to simultaneously enhance both the interfacial interaction at the perovskite/carbon interface and electrical contacts within the carbon film by applying 0.2-0.5 MPa pressure onto the complete devices with an architecture of glass/ITO/SnO 2 /MAPbI 3 /carbon, as schematically represented in Figure  1a . The cross-sectional SEM image shown in Figure  1b  depicts clearly that lots of holes and cracks exist at the interface between the untreated perovskite and carbon layers, which will severely obstruct the interfacial charge transfer and downgrade the performance of the resultant devices. In sharp contrast, these holes and cracks disappear after 0.5 MPa of mechanical pressure is applied to the devices, and a seamless interface contact is thus formed (Figure  1c ). 3D profiler analysis demonstrates that the thickness of the carbon films reduces from ≈7.7 to ≈5.3 μm after pressuring (Figure  S3 ), indicating a compressed carbon layer is formed. The top-view SEM images displayed in Figure  1d ,e reveal that most of the micropores in the carbon film are compacted, and 2D AFM images also witness an R q decrease from 63.0 to 59.1 nm (Figure  1f ,g) after the mechanical compression. Meanwhile, the interaction between BC nanoparticles and graphite flakes becomes tighter (Figure  S4 ). Generally, a denser carbon film and close contact between BC nanoparticles and graphite flakes will contribute to higher film conductivity. The current-voltage (I-V ) measurements were carried out to assess the conductivity of various carbon films along both the longitudinal and transverse directions, with device structures schematically shown as insets in Figure  2a, b . The obtained I-V curves depicted in Figure  2  demonstrate larger slopes for compressed films, indicating higher conductivity of the carbon films after mechanical compression. The conductivity (σ) along the longitudinal direction is calculated to be 2.25 Â 10 2 and 3.11 Â 10 2 S cm À1 for the control and the compressed (0.5 MPa) carbon films, respectively, according to the formula of σ ¼ d=ðA Â RÞ, where d and A are the thickness and area of the tested carbon films, and R is the film resistance calculated according to the I-V curves.  [34]  Similarly, σ values along the transverse direction are 2.66 Â 10 2 and 4.65 Â 10 2 S cm À1 for the control and the compressed (0.5 MPa) carbon films. The results confirm that mechanical compression can lead to the high electrical conductivity of carbon electrodes, which is conducive to fast carrier transport and efficient charge collection for C-PSCs. To investigate the effects of mechanical compression on the photovoltaic performance of the C-PSCs, HTL-free solar cells with an architecture of ITO/SnO 2 /MAPbI 3 /carbon were fabricated for tests. The pressure applied on the devices is 0, 0.2, and 0.5 MPa, respectively. The recorded photocurrent densityvoltage ( J-V ) curves are shown in Figure  3a  and Figure  S5 , with detailed photovoltaic parameters listed in Table  S1 . The control C-PSC without mechanical compression yields a moderate PCE of 11.98% at the reverse scanning, with a photocurrent density ( J sc ) of 20.32 mA cm À2 , a photovoltage (V oc ) of 0.95 V, and a fill factor of 0.616. As expected, a remarkably improved PCE of 15.29% is achieved when the device is subjected to 0.5 MPa mechanical compression. The J sc , V oc , and fill factor (FF) of the solar cell are 23.22 mA cm À2 , 0.97 V, and 0.676, respectively. Note that further increase of the treating pressure will destroy the devices, owing to the fragile nature of the glass substrates. A comparison of the photovoltaic parameter reveals clearly that the PCE enhancement of pressure-treated devices is primarily attributed to the pronounced increment in FF by 9.8% and J sc by 14.3%. As depicted in Figure  3b , the 0.5 MPa pressure-treated C-PSC exhibits a more pronounced external quantum efficiency (EQE), with an integrated J sc of 23.08 mA cm À2 , which is higher than that of its counterpart (20.22 mA cm À2 ) and is in line with the J-V results. The formation of intimate interface contacts and higher film conductivity enhance the charge collection efficiency by promoting interfacial charge transfer and carrier transport within the devices, which is responsible for the FF and J sc improvements. The improved interfacial charge transfer and transport is also evidenced by the relieved J-V hysteresis from 38.5% to 29.2% (Figure  S5  and Table  S1 ) due to the relieved charge accumulation at the perovskite/carbon interface. The statistical distributions of the photovoltaic parameters of 24 individual solar cells illustrated in Figure  3c -f demonstrate an outstanding reproducibility of the devices prepared by the proposed mechanical compression approach. To deeply understand the factors for the photovoltaic performance improvement caused by mechanical compression, charge transport behaviors of various perovskite/carbon films were first estimated by steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy (ssPL) and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy (trPL) measurements. The ssPL spectra clearly revealed a remarkable fluorescence quench for the pressure-treated films (Figure  4a ). This observation suggests significantly accelerated photogenerated hole extraction at the perovskite/carbon interface,  [35]  owing to the formation of intimate interfacial contact by mechanical compression. Similarly, trPL results depicted in Figure  4b  claim a much shorter average carrier lifetime τ ave of 68.42 ns for the 0.5 MPa pressure-treated films than that of 431.70 ns for the pristine counterpart, which indicates that the photogenerated holes can be transferred into the pressed carbon electrode more effectively and consequently leads to enhanced solar cell performance.  [36]  The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements were conducted on the hole-only device with ITO/NiO x /perovskite/ carbon structure to investigate trap-defect density within the C-PSCs. The trap state density (N t ) was estimated according to the following equation N t ¼ 2ε r ε 0 v TFL qL 2 (1) where V TFL is the initial voltage of the trap-filling region, L is the thickness of the perovskite film, q is the element charge (1.6 Â 10 À19 C), and ε 0 and ε r are vacuum permittivity )  and relative dielectric constant of perovskite, respectively (ε 0 = 8.854 Â 10 À12 F m À1 , ε r = 62.23 F m À1 ).  [37]  As shown in Figure  4c , the V TFL decreased from 1.01 V for the control device to 0.86 V for the 0.5 MPa pressure-treated device. The N t of the control and pressure-treated devices were 2.78 Â 10 16 and 2.36 Â 10 16 cm À3 , respectively. Compared with the SCLC results of the hole-only device using organic HTL (spiro-OMEAT, etc.) and metal electrode, the obtained N t values in this work are relatively higher, similar to the reported works of HTL-free C-PSCs.  [38, 39]  This may arise from the use of a carbon film as both HTL and conductive electrode for the SCLC tests since the carbon film itself is commonly full of trap states. The SCLC results revealed that mechanical compression can also reduce the defect densities, due to the improved interaction between the carbon and perovskite layers, and the function groups (such as -OH, -COOH, etc.) on carbon materials can passivate the trap defects of perovskite films. Voltage (V) (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) The transient photovoltage tests were conducted on the complete solar cells to further study the carrier transport and charge recombination behaviors of C-PSCs.  [40]  The charge recombination lifetime of the device is prolonged from 25.26 to 39.37 μs after mechanical compression at 0.5 MPa (Figure  S6 ), suggesting that the trapping state-induced charge recombination is effectively suppressed in the pressure-treated devices. The inhibited charge recombination also contributes partially to the FF and V oc improvements. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were conducted on the complete solar cells to investigate the charge transport and recombination resistances of the devices, with a bias of 0.7 V. The collected Nyquist plots are fit according to the equivalent circuit model inserted in Figure  4d  to obtain the concerned electrochemical parameters, consisting of series resistance (R s ), transport resistance (R ct ) related to the charge transport within the solar cells, and the recombination resistance (R rec ) associated with the charge recombination occurred both in the perovskite layer and at each interface.  [41]  As listed in Table  S2 , the R s value is remarkably decreased from 2.17 Ω for the pristine device to 0.64 Ω for the 0.5 MPa mechanically compressed ones due to the formation of closer perovskite/carbon contact and denser carbon electrode with higher conductivity. A smaller R s will contribute to higher FF values of the C-PSCs, keeping in line with the J-V results mentioned above. Similarly, the R ct of the pressure-treated C-PSCs also decreases from 2.21 to 0.54 Ω, indicating the fast charge transport within the device. Moreover, the pressure-treated solar cell possesses a much larger R rec value of 57.64 Ω than its counterpart (23.9 Ω). A larger R rec value is conducive to restraining charge recombination rate and leads to the higher V oc and FF values of the C-PSCs.  As an emerging photovoltaic technology, the stability of PSCs is crucial for industrial applications.  [42, 43]  The stability of the obtained C-PSCs was first assessed under continuous irradiation (100 mW cm À2 ). For this test, J-V curves were cyclically recorded within 1000 s. The obtained photovoltaic parameters of J sc , V oc , FF, and PCE as the function of time are illustrated in Figure  5a-d . The results demonstrate clearly that the PCE of the control C-PSCs suffers a sharp decline from 10.9% to 8.8%, predominantly due to the significant drops in V oc and FF values. These performance declines may result from the deteriorated perovskite/carbon contact due to the thermal stress that occurred under continuous illumination. In sharp contrast, the device with 0.5 MPa of mechanical compression treatment retains 96.9% of its initial efficiency after 1000 s recycling tests. The long-term stability of the devices was further studied by daily collecting the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells stored in either a nitrogen-filled glove box or in a humiditycontrolled (35 AE 2%) glove box. The C-PSC subjected to 0.5 MPa of mechanical compression retains 87.3% of its initial PCE after 1000 h storage in N 2 atmosphere, whereas, this value is 71.7% for the control device (Figure  S7 ), indicating the improved intrinsic stability of the pressured solar cells. It is also observed from Figure  5e  that the target device retains 88.9% of its initial PCE after 1000 h storage in the ambient atmosphere with controlled humidity, while the solar cell without mechanical compression loses 33.9% of its initial efficiency. It is clear from the digital photos of C-PSC (Figure  S8 ) that more yellow dots of PbI 2 precipitation can be observed from the back of the pristine device than from the pressure-treated solar cell. A comparison of the intrinsic and practical stabilities demonstrates the great ability of the pressed carbon layer to protect the solar cells from moisture. Photos depicted in Figure  5f ,g show a water contact angle increment from 72.2°to 80.7°due to the formation of a denser carbon layer by mechanical compression. According to Wenzel's equation, the decreased surface roughness contributes to the increased water contact angle on the hydrophilic carbon surface.  [44]  The improved hydrophobicity of the pressure-treated carbon electrode blocks the moisture invasion more effectively, thus contributing to the excellent practical stability of the resulting C-PSCs. 
 Conclusion In summary, we have developed a simple and effective mechanical compression approach to improve the photovoltaic performance and stability of C-PSCs simultaneously. The mechanical pressure treatment can result in an intimate perovskite/carbon interface and a denser carbon layer, which improve interfacial charge extraction and carrier transport within the carbon electrode. The promoted charge collection efficiency boosts the PCE from 11.98% to 15.29%. The unencapsulated devices also demonstrate improved practical stability and maintain 88.9% of their initial PCE after 1000 h of storage in the air atmosphere with a relative humidity of 35 AE 2%. This work paves a promising strategy to fabricate efficient and stable C-PSCs, and a more pronounced efficiency improvement can be anticipated if the pressure applied could be increased. 
 Experimental Section Materials: Indium-doped tin oxide glass (ITO/glass, 7-9 Ω/sq), PbI 2 (99.99%), methylammonium iodide (MAI, 99.5%), and formamidinium iodide (FAI, 99.9%) were obtained from Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd. N, N dimethylformamide (DMF, >99.8%), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, >99.9%), and chlorobenzene (>99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Carbon paste was obtained from Shanghai MaterWin New Materials Co., Ltd. SnO 2 colloid (15% in H 2 O) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. All reagents were used without further purification. Devices Fabrication: ITO/glass substrates were ultrasonically washed in a detergent solution, deionized water, acetone, isopropanol, and deionized water in sequence for 20 min at room temperature and then dried with N 2 airflow. All substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 20 min to enhance wettability before use. SnO 2 colloidal dispersion was diluted by deionized water (1:2 v v À1 ). The SnO 2 colloid was spin coated on ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s and heated at 180 °C in the air for 20 min. A perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 1.8 M MAI and PbI 2 in a mixture solvent of DMF and DMSO (DMF:DMSO = 9:1 in volume). Before use, the perovskite precursor solution was filtered through a TPFE filter (0.22 μm). The perovskite films were deposited by the one-step spin-coating method at a speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s, and 70 μL of chlorobenzene antisolvent was dripped onto the films at the 15th second. Then, the wet films were annealed at 130 °C for 10 min in air (≈30% relative humidity). The carbon electrode was prepared by the screen-printing process, and the wet film was annealed at 120 °C for 20 min to complete the fabrication of PSCs. For mechanical compression-treated devices, the completed devices were mechanically pressed with 0.2 or 0.5 MPa pressure provided by a powder compressing machine (YP-9 T Tianjin Jinfulun Technology Co., Ltd). Characterizations: The surface morphologies of various films were characterized by a field-emission SEM (Merlin), TEM (JEM 1400 Plus), a 3D surface profile meter (RTEC UP Dual Model), and AFM (Multimode 8, Bruker). The EIS was obtained using an electrochemical workstation (CHI604E) in the dark, with a frequency of 10 5 -10 À2 Hz and a bias of 0.7 V. The water contact angle was tested using an OCA40 Micro instrument. The PL and trPL were measured by the FLS1000 Photoluminescence Spectrometer. Photocurrentvoltage ( J-V ) curves were collected by a Keithley 2400 source meter, under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 W cm À2 ) provided by a solar simulator (Newport, 300 W). The light intensity was calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell. The active area of each solar cell was masked to be 0.04 cm 2 . The EQE spectra were tested via the EQE system (QE-R).
