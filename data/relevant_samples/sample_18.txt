 Introduction The computer and consumer electronics industries were successfully founded thanks to modern materials science  [1] . It all began with the creation of an extremely pure silicon material, now known as electronic-grade silicon, which is produced by removing impurities like boron, phosphorous, and carbon. To make integrated circuits, silicon must have about 0.1 part per trillion of these components  [2] . Materials and equipment innovations will drive future electronics advancements  [3] . For instance, technological developments in electronic materials and innovative device design are necessary to improve microprocessor speed, solar cell efficiency, and data storage capacity  [4] . This field focuses on the foundation of emerging materials, including the operation and construction of semiconductor devices, including transistors, diodes, LEDs, solar cells, and sensors  [5] . Emerging materials are a subset of a research area concerned with conceiving, creating, and comprehending innovative materials with groundbreaking characteristics  [6] . The challenge and intrigue of tailoring material qualities to specific applications have always been enormous  [7] . In the present world, electronic devices such as smartphones, wearable sensors, intelligent implants, and smart cities all require new materials with enhanced functionality  [8] . With a significant impact on many facets of our lives, developing technology has enormous promise. Low-energy electronics and photonics, advanced composites, materials for manufacturing and energy, and 2D materials are only a few uses for these materials  [9] . In the past several years, layered materials have been extensively researched due to the discovery of graphene  [10] . Thousands of distinct compounds that exhibit various behaviors make up layered materials  [11] . These media types offer a complete toolkit for demonstrating electronic components like transistors, capacitors, and resistors  [12] . 
 Discovery of Emerging Nanomaterials The prefix "nano" refers to a Greek prefix that means "dwarf" or "extremely diminutive" and represents one-millionth of a meter (10 À9 m). We must distinguish between nanotechnology and nanoscience. Nanotechnology, which uses nanoscience in realworld applications like electronics, is the branch of technology that studies structures and molecules on nanometer scales between 1 and 100 nm  [13]  (Fig.  1 .1). As we have reviewed different articles, nanotechnology is one of the fascinating modern technologies  [7] . Translating nanoscience theory into real-world applications requires monitoring, measuring, controlling, assembling, and creating materials at the nanoscale  [14] . As "a science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale (1 to 100 nm), where unique phenomena enable novel applications in a wide range of fields, from chemistry, physics, and biology to medicine, engineering, and electronics"  [14] , nanotechnology is defined as "a science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale." This definition states that there are two requirements for nanotechnology. First, there is the scale issue. Nanotechnology uses structures by manipulating their size and shape at the nanoscale  [15] . The second issue is novelty: because of the nanoscale, nanotechnology must handle small items in a way that uses specific attributes  [16] . Nanotechnology is the study of how to observe, quantify, control, assemble, and building materials at the nanoscale. Nanotechnology studies how to observe, quantify, power, complete, and build materials at the nanoscale. Physics, materials science, and biology come together to form nanoscience when manipulating materials at the atomic and molecular levels  [15] . Two methods for synthesizing nanostructures that describe the many options are top down and bottom up. 
 C-Based Nanomaterials: Graphite, Graphene, and CNT Research on carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs) for biological applications has drawn much attention due to their unique chemical and physical properties, including thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties  [17] . Due to their inherent characteristics, CBNs, such as carbon nanotubes (CNT), graphene oxide (GO), and graphene quantum dots (GQDs), have been extensively explored in biomedical applications. This paper  [18]  overviews the most recent studies on CBN   [13]  with permission development for various biological purposes, including drug transport, cancer therapy, and biosensing  [18] . Carbon-based nanoparticles (CBNs) are gaining popularity as nanomaterials in the fields of science and technology. Amorphous carbon, graphite, and diamonds are a few examples of well-known allotropes of carbon. Other newly identified allotropes of carbon include auspicious carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene oxide (GO), graphene quantum dots (GQDs), and fullerene  [19] . As a result, the value of carbon materials has recently increased  [18, 20] . For example, each member of the carbon family has unique features that have been widely applied in various biological applications, including biosensing, drug administration, tissue engineering, imaging, diagnostics, and cancer treatment  [21] . As we have examined multiple studies  [18, 20] , graphene is considered the most desirable compound among the various carbon allotropes because of its unique inherent properties  [18, 20] . The most promising next-generation energy conversion technologies are metal-air batteries and fuel cells because of their high energy densities and low carbon emissions  [22] . Unfortunately, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) had slow kinetics, which meant that driving them required a substantial amount of overpotential  [18, 23] . To lessen dependency on precious metals and enhance electrocatalytic performance, advanced electrocatalysts with well-defined nanostructures and appropriate compositions based on earthabundant materials must be created  [23, 24] . When carbon materials are functionalized with transition-metal-based inorganic nanoparticles (NPs), electrocatalyst performance is considerably improved (such as metal, metal oxides, sulfides, nitrides, and carbides)  [9] . Due to its exceptional conductivity and excellent structural attributes, the concept of a 3D structure formed of graphene-CNTs is essential not only to electrocatalysts but also to Li-S batteries, Na-ion batteries, supercapacitors, etc.  [22] . CNTs were categorized as hollow cylinders made of graphitic sheets (MWCNT) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN)  [25] . Due to their remarkable mechanical, electrical, and structural diversity, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) offer better strength, flexibility, and electrical conductivity toward a variety of living entities, which is helpful for sensing, medical diagnostics, and treating various ailments  [17, 18, 26] . Although there are many different carbon allotropes, graphene is considered the most appealing material because of its unique intrinsic properties  [19] . Graphene may be helpful for biological applications since it has several outstanding properties  [10, 19] . The possibility of simple functionalization results in the enrichment of functional groups on its surface, making it more straightforward to explicitly and judiciously identify differences  [27] . Because of its sensible response toward various fluorescent dyes, pharmaceuticals, and other biomaterials, it is also widely used for in vivo imaging, cancer detection, and therapy  [11, 28] . 
 Biomedical Applications of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) CNTs are a new generation of nanoprobes due to their remarkable structural, mechanical, electrical, and optical qualities  [18] . Due to their high aspect ratio, high conductivity, excellent chemical stability and sensitivity, rapid electron transfer rate, and other characteristics, they are remarkably well suited for biosensing  [29] . The immobilization of biomolecules on their surface, which improves identification and the signal transduction process, is the fundamental component of CNT-based biosensors. These biosensors are mainly divided into electrochemical and electronic CNT-based biosensors and optical biosensors based on their target identification and transduction processes. CNTs are suitable for merging electrochemical and electronic biosensors because they have a reputation as promising materials for enhancing electron transport  [18, 20, 30] . Another recently created and intriguing biomaterial from the carbon family is GQDs, which is described as a zerodimensional graphene sheet with a lateral dimension of less than 100 nm and composed of one to several layers. The GQDs perform better in biocompatibility and photo-bleaching resistance than other fluorescent dyes or semiconductor quantum dots. GQDs are intelligent nanomaterials for various biomedical applications, such as imaging, targeted drug administration, biomolecule sensing, cancer therapy, etc. These applications are made possible by the high surface area and easily accessible p electrons of graphene, which are also present in GQDs (Fig.  1 .2). Because of their natural form, CNTs have gained the most attention among the numerous carbon allotropes as a highly effective means of delivering different medicinal molecules into living cells  [26] . CNTs can easily cross biochemical membranes without suffering any damage  [17] . Medications are loaded into a CNT's hollow interior to achieve the best possible isolation of the treatment from the physiological milieu. The difference between medicine release in the tumor cell microenvironment has been attempted to overcome using external stimuli, such as temperature, an electric field, light, or a combination of these. Carbon nanotubes are widely used in biological applications due to their adaptability and allure as transporters of chemotherapeutic proteins, genes, and anticancer medications  [18] . Due to their inherent mechanical, optical, electrochemical, and electrical characteristics, CBNs have been widely exploited in various disciplines  [18] . Additionally, CBNs have garnered much interest in biomedical engineering over the past 10 years due to their flexible surface properties, size, and form. Finally, we suggest further research be done on the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of CBNs because they still possess specific detrimental characteristics. 
 Metamaterials Any material designed to have a quality that isn't present in naturally existing materials is a metamaterial  [31] . Alternately, rather than the qualities of the basic materials, metamaterials' qualities are derived from their newly constructed structures. Because of their specific configuration, geometry, size, orientation, and arrangement, they possess intelligent characteristics that enable them to manipulate electromagnetic waves by blocking, absorbing, amplifying, or bending waves to get benefits that are not possible with conventional materials  [32] . The materials are frequently arranged in repeating patterns on more minor scales than the wavelengths of the phenomena they influence  [33] . The prefix meta, which derives from the Greek word for "beyond" (meta), indicates that the material has features that are not visible to us in the natural world. Metamaterials are a novel class of functional materials with novel microand nanoscale patterns or structures that enable them to interact with light and other forms of energy in ways rarely observed in nature. These artificially made composite materials derive their characteristics from internal micro-and nanostructures rather than the chemical composition inherent in natural materials. As a result, metamaterial structures enable the development of skills and qualities that are usually not viable to attain using conventional techniques for producing chemicals or discovering new materials. Identical components of ordinary materials like metals or nonconductive resources are frequently used to build metamaterials. Imagine a Rubik's cube made out of countless tiny, no-thicker-than-a-hair-thick parts. The fundamental idea behind metamaterial design is to create materials with the necessary properties and capabilities by using artificially created structural units. These structural components, which make up the artificial "atoms" and "molecules" that make up the metamaterial, can have their form and size adjusted, have the lattice constant and interatomic interaction artificially modified, and can have "defects" fabricated and positioned in specific places. By arranging these nanoscale unit cells into a particular design or shape, it is possible to modify the refractive index of the metamaterial to positive, close to zero, or negative values. However, some metamaterials can exhibit negative refraction, which results in the radiation entering the structure being bent backward. The intriguing metamaterial functions sometimes need many stacks of material layers, which causes substantial losses and poses many difficulties for nanofabrication. Numerous metamaterials are made up of intricate metallic wires and other structures that require advanced fabrication techniques and are challenging to put together. The peculiar optical effects do not always imply the employment of the volumetric (3D) metamaterials. Two-dimensional (2D) structures, referred to as "metasurfaces," can also be used to control the light (or flat optics). Metasurfaces are thin films made up of distinct components that were initially created to get around problems that metamaterials faced (Fig.  1 .3). Metasurfaces' functional theory is based on the diffraction phenomena. It is possible to think of every flat periodic array as a diffraction lattice that divides the incident light into a few beams  [34] . The incidence angle, wavelength, and lattice period are geometrical factors that affect the number and direction of the rays. The distribution of incident light energy among the rays is, in turn, determined by the structure of the subwavelength unit cell. If all but one of the diffraction rays are suppressed in the case of a negative refractive index, then all incident light will point in the desired direction. Most currently produced metasurfaces are passive, meaning they cannot be tweaked after production  [20] . Active metasurfaces, in contrast, enable dynamic adjustment of their optical properties in response to external stimuli. They might be helpful for applications like depth sensing, holographic displays, and free-space visual communications. Metamaterials can accurately control the course of light through a material. As a result, historically significant optical systems can be reduced to small form factors. New optical systems can be created by tailoring metamaterials to support unique features that are now inaccessible to optical hardware. For example, you would anticipate gold to be glossy and yellowish. However, altering the gold's surface with nanoscale features alters how light interacts with the gold and affects how we perceive it. By using these nanostructures, gold is transformed from a regular substance into a metamaterial.  
 Perovskite Materials Environmentally and energy-efficient hydrogen production is a significant obstacle in developing hydrogen-based technology  [35] . However, current techniques heavily rely on fossil fuels because they are more economical, making it challenging to be totally independent of carbon-based technologies  [35] . Since electrochemical hydrogen production has successfully produced high pure hydrogen gas, it is crucial. Similarly, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) approach is particularly alluring since it uses solar energy to produce extraordinarily active and stable water splitting  [9] . Recent research has shown that hybrid perovskite single crystals outperform perovskite polycrystalline thin films in optoelectronic properties, particularly the unusually long carrier diffusion length resulting from grain boundary removal  [36] . The successful use of hybrid halide perovskites in extremely effective photovoltaics over the past 10 years has led to their treatment as the emergent semiconductor material today  [9] . Due to their ability to tune optical bandgaps from the violet to near infrared as well as their higher absorption coefficients and potential for long-range electron and hole transport, lead (Pb)-based HOIP has attracted a lot of interest in the last 10 years for applications in high-performance optoelectronics and efficient photovoltaics  [9, 36] . It is also well known that perovskites have many functions, including dielectric, ferroelectric magnetoresistive, thermoelectric, electro-optic, semiconducting, conducting, and superconducting  [35, 36] . It has been demonstrated that perovskite, a highthroughput, low-cost material, can transform solar energy into electricity  [35] . We go through perovskite materials' excellent optical and electrical properties, which frequently determine PEC's success based technology. We also examine the material limit of perovskite in a hydrogen generation environment, i.e., PEC reactions continually deteriorate the electrode-electrolyte interface. Sustainable hydrogen production in terms of energy consumption and environmental impact is a significant obstacle in developing hydrogen-based technology. These materials are gaining interest for their potential usage in optoelectronic devices due to their outstanding magnetic, ferroelectric, electrical, and optical characteristics  [35] . The structure of these perovskite materials has lately been extensively studied using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which numerous research groups are actively using to investigate these distinctive features. Perovskite materials also have long carrier lifetimes and low recombination probabilities. As a result, research on metal-organic halide perovskites has been one of the fascinating areas  [35, 36] . These materials are used in various applications, including light-emitting diodes, solar cells, lasers, and photodetectors  [9] . In the past 50 years, the photovoltaic effect-based solar cells that offer the benefits of decentralization and sustainability have drawn much attention  [36] . Currently, planar heterojunction solar cells have replaced the more conventional dye-sensitized solar cells in the architecture of perovskite solar cells. Perovskite's performance in solar cells has recently gained much attention and research  [35] . However, inorganic thin-film solar cell production calls for high procedures using a vacuum and high temperatures. For instance, ABX 3 perovskite structure serves as the fundamental perovskite unit, as shown in Fig.  1 .4. The A (e.g., A Cs, CH 3 NH 3 and NH 2 CH NH 2 ) cations are situated in the bigger 12-fold coordinated hales between the octahedron in this straightforward structure, which consists of a 3D network cornersharing BX 6 octahedron  [35] . Because of the stereochemically active pairings of A cations in many perovskite systems, the structures of inorganic perovskite compounds are susceptible to distortion due to cation displacements, which result in the beneficial qualities of ferroelectricity and antiferroelectricity  [36] . The mass manufacture of solar cells with high efficiency and at relatively low temperatures would be made possible by perovskite technology, which would result in a significant cost decrease due to the technology's ability to fabricate devices quickly through a straightforward deposition procedure. Additionally, flexible substrates could be employed, making it simpler to handle, transport, install, and integrate these novel solar cells into buildings  [9] . 
 Insulators and High-K Materials For the past 50 years, the economics of the semiconductor business is based on Moore's law principle, which states that as semiconductor manufacturing technology advances, the minimum manufacturing cost per device drops. The number of devices per square unit area generally doubles every 2 years to achieve Moore's law  [37] [38] [39] . Compared to silicon dioxide, a high dielectric constant (kappa) substance is high dielectric. High dielectric materials are employed in producing semiconductors, typically in place of a silicon dioxide gate dielectric or another device's dielectric layer  [40] . One of the many methods created to enable more incredible shrinking of microelectronic components, also known as extending Moore's Law, is the use of high-gate dielectrics  [41] [42] [43] . Since typical gate oxide presents problems as device features are shrunk down, it is critical to develop novel gate dielectric materials with characteristics similar to SiO2 and compatible with current complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology  [6, 44] . The tunnel current and leakage current both considerably rise as silicon dioxide's thickness decreases to less than 1.5 nm and the leakage current There is evidence for the BX 6 corner-sharing octahedra  [35]  exceeds 1 A/cm 2 . As a result, materials with superior electrical properties are required, such as dielectric constants more significant than 30, interface state densities lower than 1 1011/cm 2 -eV, tunneling currents below 10 mA/cm 2 , and negligible hysteresis  [45] . Emerging applications for high-K dielectrics in 10 nm and larger nodes of CMOS are described. High-K dielectrics are also used in resistive RAM memories, metal-insulator-metal (MIM) diodes, ferroelectric logic and memory devices, and mask layers for patterning  [6, 43] . To continue device scaling to the 45 nm and below nodes, high-K and metal gate (HKMG) stacks have been added to metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) used in digital complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, which forms the basis for logic circuits within microprocessors and systems on a chip used in computers, tablets, cell phones, etc.  [46] . The relative dielectric constant is denoted by K in Eq.  (1.1) , where d denotes the dielectric's permittivity and 0 denotes the permittivity of space. High-K dielectrics include Al 2 O 3 , HfO 2 , ZrO 2 , HfZrO 4 , TiO 2 , Sc 2 O 3 , Y 2 O 3 , La 2 O 3 , Lu 2 O 3 , Nb 2 O 5 , Ta 2 O 5 , and simple mixtures of these materials. By replacing dielectrics like SiO2 (K ¼ 3.9) and SiON (K ¼ 4-6) with high-K dielectrics, CMOS and DRAM manufacturers could continue scaling the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) of their devices while using a physically thicker dielectric, resulting in a reduction in leakage current compared to SiO2 and SiON-based devices at the same EOT  [42, 45] . k ¼ e d e o ð1: 1Þ To continue device scaling to the 45 nm and below nodes, high-K and metal gate (HKMG) stacks have been added to metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) used in digital complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, which forms the basis for logic circuits within microprocessors and systems on a chip used in computers, tablets, and cell phones  [6] . Al 2 O 3 , ZrO 2 , HfZrO 4 , TiO 2 , HfO 2 , Y 2 O 3 , Sc 2 O 3 , Lu 2 O 3 , La 2 O 3 , Ta 2 O 5 , and Nb 2 O 5 are a few examples of high-K dielectrics  [45] . Many emerging applications for high-K dielectrics depend on properties other than their dielectric constant  [6] . For instance, ReRAM uses the high-K dielectric, and current conduction across it is frequently regulated by ion migration within the dielectric to produce conducting filaments  [40] . The growing uses for high-K dielectrics are outlined in this review, some of which could be used in the semiconductor industry in the future. Along with the most popular deposition techniques and equipment categories, this section introduces the current state of high-K dielectrics in DRAM and CMOS fabrication. 
 Silicon and Group IV Molecules Silicon  (Si)  is one among the family of nonmetallic chemical elements in the carbon (Group IVof the periodic table). The Latin word silex or silicis, which means "flint" or "hard stone," is where the name silicon originates  [47] . However, silicon was known to the early Chinese, the predynastic Egyptians, who used it for beads, miniature vases, and many other ancient peoples. It was also known to the predynastic Egyptians as rock crystal  [48] . Silicon is usually found in nature in combination with oxygen to produce silica (SiO2, silicon dioxide) or with oxygen and other elements to form silicates, as it is too reactive to be found in nature alone (such as oxygen and aluminum, magnesium, calcium, sodium, potassium, or iron). Both crystalline minerals like quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite, as well as amorphous or seeming amorphous minerals like agate, opal, and chalcedony include silicon dioxide in compounds that are present in all terrestrial locations. Natural silicates are characterized by their structural and chemical complexity, wide dispersion, and abundance. Commercial production of elemental silicon involves reducing silica (SiO 2 ) with coke in an electric furnace, followed by refinement of the impure by-product  [49] . By reducing the oxide with aluminum, silicon can be extracted from it on a small scale. By reducing silicon tetrachloride or trichlorosilane, nearly pure silicon can be produced. Single crystals are created for use in electronic devices by gradually removing seed crystals from molten silicon  [50] . Due to its distinctive atomic structure, silicon is an essential semiconductor in the electronics and technology sectors. The main element in computer chips, integrated circuits, transistors, silicon diodes, liquid crystal displays, and several other electronic and switching devices is a silicon wafer, also highly pure silicon  [51] . It is doped (infused) with multiple elements, including boron, phosphorus, and arsenic  [52] . When p-and n-silicon wafers are put together in the p-n junction process under sunlight, electrons can move across the junction, and current can flow in an external circuit connecting the two wafers. As a renewable energy source and a power supply for space equipment, solar cells of this type are utilized in solar power arrays  [53] . Lower-purity silicon is used in metallurgy to alloy and reduce materials like steel, aluminum, brass, and bronze. The many silicates and silicon dioxide are the two most important silicon compounds (silica). Concrete and bricks are made from silica-containing sand and clay, also used to make refractory materials for hightemperature applications  [53] . The compound can be heated to soften and mold into a glass, as with the stone quartz  [54] . As an abrasive in creating glass and other ceramic substances and as an adsorbent, silica (silicon dioxide) is beneficial  [55] . Glass, enamels, pottery, china, and other ceramic materials are all made with silicates, most of which are insoluble in water. Sodium silicates, commonly known as water glass or soda silicate, are used in dyeing, soap production, cement, egg preservation, and wood preservative treatments. Both naturally occurring and synthetically produced silicates are used in building materials, absorbents, and ion exchangers. Silicones, synthetic organosilicon oxides consisting of silicon, oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen, are used as lubricants, hydraulic fluids, waterproofing compounds, varnishes, and enamels because they are all chemically inert and extraordinarily stable at high temperatures. Selected international clients in the medical and industrial sectors work with Group IV as a plastic solutions partner. With our primary injection molding process and related value-added processes, Group IV provides a wide spectrum of brand name customers in the industrial industry. The group's members exhibit a range of behaviors as they move down the group, from nonmetallic to metallic, with the significant valency of the elements being IV  [45] . From carbon to lead, the reactivity of the elements rises. On heating, all interact with oxygen. The second group of transition metals in Group IVof the periodic table includes the four elements; such as rutherfordium (Ru),  [56]  (Zr), hafnium (Hf), and titanium (Ti) (Rf). In honor of its lightest member, the group is sometimes known as the titanium group or titanium family. As is common for early transition metals,  [56]  and hafnium are extremely electropositive and have a less complex coordination chemistry. They only have the group oxidation state of +4 as the main one. They are remarkably similar in terms of their physical characteristics due to the lanthanide contraction. Due to its smaller size, titanium is somewhat unique because it also possesses a well-defined +3 state (although +4 is more). Group IV elements are all brittle, hard metals. Due to the creation of a thick oxide layer that shields them from corrosion and attack by several acids and alkalis, their innate reactivity is totally concealed  [55] . The first three of them are natural occurrences. Due to its significant radioactivity, rutherfordium must be synthesized artificially because it does not exist naturally. Nevertheless, based on its observed and theoretically expected features, rutherfordium is a heavier version of hafnium, and they are all biologically inert. 
 Thermal Function of Nanomaterial As nanotechnology continues to evolve, a wide range of novel nanomaterials, including internal or external characteristics or surface structures on the nanoscale, has become the go-to components for sustainable and effective energy solutions  [32] . Due to their optical and magnetic properties, nanomaterials can produce and significantly improve the heating capacity at the tumor site  [57] . Numerous elements that are typically minor in bulk materials play a role in thermal characteristics of nanostructures  [58] . The heat transport in nanomaterials is greatly influenced by surface properties, interfacial structures, and quantum or classical size effects, resulting in carrier scatterings and localization that are otherwise nonexistent or barely noticeable in bulk materials  [32, 58] . Since "nanomaterials" refer to mixes of various particles, either diluted or dense, with diameters between 0.1 and 500 nm, that can significantly change the matrix's properties  [57] . These components, collectively known as nanostructures, are arranged in a five-letter "alphabet": nanoparticles, nanowires, nanotubes, superlattices (stacked nanofilms), and nanofilms  [57] . These structures are either produced by expensive, large-scale machinery like focused ion beams or molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) or by comparatively easy chemical procedures like electrochemistry, emulsions, milling, etc. (FIB)  [59] . Plasma and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) chambers have a relatively intermediate state since masking and etching may require significant investment when a high resolution is needed  [32, 57] . Thermal applications are now being developed for energy conversion, insulation, comfort, and cooling  [60] . Thermal applications are now being designed for energy conversion, insulation, comfort, and cooling  [57] . Thermoelectric conversion is undoubtedly a fascinating application for nanostructures. It has spurred the most significant research and substantial advancements  [58] . High electrical conductivity and low heat conductivity are required for efficient materials in this  [23, 61] . Nanomaterials that provide unique specifications compared to conventional designed materials have drawn significant attention since the advent of the key concept of nanotechnology. Materials possessing at least one dimension at the nanoscale are referred to as nanomaterials  [59] . Researchers are currently attempting to change their properties to adapt nanomaterials for use in various industries  [32, 57, 61]  (Fig.  1.5) . Additionally, nanoporous materials' excellent gas storage characteristics are determined by their high specific surface area properties  [34] . Numerous industries, including energy, aerospace, environmental research, microelectronics, bioengineering, and medicine, have shown significant application potential for nanostructured materials  [32, 59] . Phonons are the leading energy carriers in heat transport in nonmetal crystalline materials, whereas electrons and phonons are the energy carriers in metallic nanomaterials  [62] . Fig.  1 .5 Schematic representation of solid nanostructured materials with different diameters  [61]  It is generally known that the thermal properties of nanomaterials, such as the specific heat and the thermal conductivity, differ noticeably from those of bulk materials due to the sizes and shapes of the embedding particles. The thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and electrical conductivity of nanomaterials are primarily independent of their size and structure  [32, 59] . On the other hand, the size and geometries of a nanoparticle's embedding in a host material determine thermal transport in nanomaterials. The most recent focus on nanoparticles has been on their thermal conductivity, which is thought to be the most critical factor influencing how well these materials transport heat. Theoretical research has been done on the thermal conductivity of nanomaterials, which are made from nanoparticles implanted in a host dielectric medium. It has been found that boundary phonon scattering contributes more to the thermal conductivity of nanomaterials because nanoparticles have a high surface-to-volume ratio  [59, 61] . The thermal conductivity of nanomaterials, which are constructed from nanoparticles implanted in a host dielectric medium, has been studied theoretically  [58, 63] . Due to surfacearea-to-volume ratio of nanoparticles, boundary phonon scattering is reported to contribute more to the thermal conductivity of nanomaterials  [63] . 
 Mechanical Function of Nanomaterials By transforming materials, structures, and systems at the tiniest scale, the developing field of nanoengineering is revealing countless opportunities for breakthroughs in manufacturing, robotics, health care, energy, and other areas  [64] . Nanoparticles have drawn much attention as developing materials because of their small size, surface effect, quantum tunneling effect, and potential uses in traditional fabrics, medical devices, electronic devices, coatings, and other industries. Here, it is investigated how grain size, manufacturing process, and grain boundary structures affect the mechanical properties of nanomaterials. Our reviews shape this field of study through their work on novel materials and designs, bioinspired microrobotics, and studies of the effects of nanoparticles on human health. To mention a few, increased qualities of nanoengineered materials, or "nanomaterials," include biological sensitivity, strength, selective transport, thermal conductivity, and optical capabilities. Many products and processes can perform better when they have these kinds of unique features  [64] . Mechanical properties describe how a material behaves mechanically under various external loads and environmental conditions. The ten components that make up the mechanical properties of metals, which are regarded as classic materials, are brittleness, strength, plasticity, hardness, toughness, fatigue strength, elasticity, ductility, rigidity, and yield stress  [64] . Nanoparticles' volume, surface, and quantum effects give rise to the extraordinary mechanical properties of nanomaterials. When nanoparticles are added to a regular substance, the nanoparticles will partially or entirely refine the grain, forming an intragranular or intergranular structure that will enhance the grain boundary and mechanical properties of the mixture. Nanomaterials have a wide range of potential applications because they have superior mechanical properties and unique qualities not present in macroscopic materials  [33] . We must determine the mechanical characteristics of various tools to identify future technical applications and industrial productions  [32] . If the right application, technique, loadings, size, and type of nanomaterials are used, adding nanoparticles to composite materials typically improves their mechanical characteristics and fracture toughness. The study provides some guidance to researchers on choosing nanoparticles for the primary mechanical characteristics of heterogeneous materials, such as fracture toughness. 
 Electrical/Electronic Function of Nanomaterials Conduction electrons travel "freely" in bulk materials because they are delocalized until they are scattered by phonons, defects, grain boundaries, etc.  [55] . Electronics is just one of the many fields where nanotechnology, a rapidly expanding scientific topic, has applications. Electronic chips with lines only 65 or 90 nanometers broad that are used in smartphones and computers are currently commercially available  [65] . The miniaturization of electrical components using nanotechnology in electronics does not in and of itself harm human health, but there may be additional problems due to novel procedures and/or process chemicals required to carry out such tiny structures  [34, 65] . Various distinct nanomaterials are already being employed in electronics, either commercially or for research and development. Nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, and silver nanoparticles, are some of the most often used ones for electrical and electronic devices  [7] . The so-called "bottom-up" strategy, which is based on atom and molecule self-assembly, is currently being developed by scientists, but, for the time being, they are employing the "top-down" method, which entails creating nanoscale components and materials from more extensive beginning materials  [15] . Factors like the diameter, crosssectional area, twist in the conducting wire, etc. have little effect on a large or bulky substance's conductivity. However, it has been found that when the crosssectional area varies, the conductivity of carbon nanotubes alters. Nanostructures like carbon nanotubes, nanowires, and graphene are being extensively researched for potential electrical, photonic, and energy applications. For these nanosystems to move from the research lab to technology, it is imperative that charge injection at the electrical connections be precisely understood and controlled. Because nanostructures have unique properties that set them apart significantly from bulk semiconductors, existing models of electrical contacts in bulk devices are occasionally inapplicable at the nanoscale. Such technologies need finegrained control over the charge carriers to operate at high performance levels  [66] . This control is directly tied to the ability to regulate charge injection into the active material using electrical connections. Early on in the history of technology, the significance of these contacts was realized, and this realization sparked a great deal of research into how to engineer these contacts to enhance device performance. Due to the advancement of technology, a sizable body of work in basic science has been done to comprehend the foundations of electrical contacts  [67] . The electrodes for energy storage devices can be made in various ways. A complex problem in the energy industry is the storage of electrical energy. Batteries currently in use are unreliable for long-term storage  [66] . The application of nanotechnology to energy storage is a recent area of study interest. The most recent innovations in the energy field include supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries, and hydrogen storage  [68] . The electrodes for energy storage devices can be made in various ways. Light-emitting diodes are one example of a nano-based component that efficiently uses electricity. Numerous micromaterials and nanomaterials have been created, and they have been used as functional components in a number of device applications due to their distinctive mechanical, electrical, and photonic capabilities  [69] . For instance, nanoelectronic circuits, solar cells, and nanosensors for detecting chemical and biological species have all been built using semiconductor nanowires  [66] . For instance, to construct nanotransistors and biosensors using one-dimensional nanomaterials, nanowires and nanotubes must be positioned between the source and drain electrodes. 
 Optical Function of Nanomaterials Nanomaterials' absorption, transmission, reflection, and light emission characteristics can differ significantly from those of the same bulk material  [70] . Nanomaterials' absorption, transmission meditation, and light emission characteristics vary considerably from those of the same bulk materials  [58, 71] . Nanomaterials' optical properties are exciting to study because of their nanoscale size and surface plasmon resonance  [71] . Nanocrystalline systems have attracted much interest because of their distinctive visual properties, which differ significantly from bulk crystals. Examples of applications for the optical properties of nanomaterials include optical detectors, sensors, imaging, displays, solar cells, photocatalysis, photoelectrochemistry, and biomedicine  [72] . Nanomaterials' optical properties can be easily altered by changing their size, shape, composition, and surface properties  [34, 73] . Consequently, optically active nanomaterials are frequently used to create chromogenic and fluorogenic sensors as well as biosensors for the selective detection of a variety of ions (metal ions, anions, small-charged molecules, etc.)  [73] . 
 Photovoltaic Functions of Nanomaterials A photovoltaic system involves turning sunlight directly into electricity. Photons are absorbed by a suitable semiconductor, which produces electron-hole pairs. In this area, we have examined the efficiency of photon absorption and photon-carrier collection  [71] . Nanochemistry and nanomaterials present a multitude of prospects for a new generation of photovoltaics with high solar energy conversion efficiencies at low fabrication costs  [70] . It is also feasible to modify the material properties by altering the size and form. The pairs are then split apart at a p-n junction or other interface, and metal contacts finally collect the carriers. Since photovoltaic solar energy doesn't release any harmful gases into the atmosphere that contribute to the greenhouse effect, it is regarded as one of the cleanest energy sources on the planet  [71] . A semiconducting material experiences the photovoltaic effect, a physiochemical phenomenon where voltage and electrical currents are generated across the p-n junction due to the absorption of radiant energy  [35] . The photovoltaic system comprises solar panels, each containing a specific number of solar cells used to produce electricity  [70] , as illustrated in Fig.  1 .6. Because silicon is so abundant on earth, solar energy is a resource that can be expanded quickly. The primary goals are increasing conversion efficiency and lowering costs to make photovoltaics more energy competitive and capable of replacing conventional fossil fuels. Nanotechnology is the most promising area in developing organic/inorganic-based solar cells. 
 Conclusions In this book chapter, we have discussed emerging materials or nanomaterials like metamaterials, perovskite materials, Group IV molecules, and high-K materials, on past and present nanomaterials and nanostructures for thermal, biomedical, electrical/electronic, mechanical, optical, and photovoltaic applications. For instance, the properties of nanoparticles, particularly their size, offer several benefits over the bulk forms of the materials, and their versatility in that they may be tailored to specific needs accentuates their usefulness. Another advantage is their high porosity, which increases demand for their use in various industries. Utilizing NMs' physical, electrical, chemical, and optical capabilities allows for using biomolecules that are beneficial to medicine. For example, nanometer-scale quantum mechanical phenomena give rise to a wide range of unanticipated physicochemical features that are beneficial for biosensor applications that address issues with current techniques. Since they are often made in organic solvents, the NMs used in medicine are hydrophobic and incompatible with biological molecules. According to our studies,  
 Introduction The science and technology of regulating matter at the nanoscale is known as nanotechnology. It is a very interdisciplinary area that incorporates physics, chemistry, electrical, and mechanical engineering, as well as biosciences  [1] . All of these fields of study and their application areas will be significantly impacted by nanotechnology. It is frequently credited with developing the technology that produced materials with a nanometer size (10 À9 m). In comparison to other materials, this feather of nanoparticles has a greater surface area per unit mass. Top-down and bottom-up approaches may both be utilized to construct nanostructured materials; the key distinction between the two lies in the size of the principal entities employed to form nanocomponents with or without atomic scale control. The transistor has been progressively downsized during the last few decades. Transistors as tiny as 32 nm are used in modern integrated circuits  [2] [3] [4] . In a general sense, nanotechnology refers to all technologies that deal with nanoscale materials, and in a more specific sense, it refers to scientific and technological developments that address peculiar phenomena that take place between 10 and 100 nm in size. 
 Fabrication Using Nanomaterials The top-down and bottom-up strategies have each been used to manufacture components of these sizes by semiconductor industry. 
 Top-Down Approach For instance, it is becoming clear that silicon-based chip-based computer technology's ability to become smaller is quickly reaching its upper bounds. This strategy has been quite effective up to this point, enabling physicists and technologists to work with the ever pieces of matter using electron-beam fabrication, photolithography, X-ray lithography, and related processes. However, on the level of atoms and molecules, it is quite big. For further downsizing, there is therefore plenty of room at the bottom. The production of graphene can be accomplished using Scotch tape, immediate liquid phase exfoliation of graphite/graphite complexation compound, high-pressure homogenization, or combustion of graphite to graphite oxide (GO), emulsifying agent of GO to graphene oxide by ultrasonication, and reduction to restore electronic properties. Direct exfoliation techniques used to manufacture graphene from graphite have relatively excellent crystal quality (high electrical conductivity, fewer crystal defect), but the production yield is still too low for practical application. It is challenging to regulate the amount of graphene layers because products are typically contaminated by organic impurities. The most common technique (Hummer's method) for producing graphene is by the oxidation of graphite to form graphene oxide (GO), exfoliation of the resultant GO, and decrease of exfoliated graphene oxide (RGO). This process frequently produces multilayer graphene (RGO) flake types with lateral lengths between a few hundred nanometers and a few micrometers. This method can produce large amounts of graphene flakes for a variety of applications where high purity is not necessary, including such fillers for polymer nanocomposites, coating, conductive ink paste, and energy storage applications (electrode for lithium ion, lithium sulfide, lithium-air batteries, and supercapacitors), among others, at a relatively low cost to production. 
 Bottom-Up Approach The field of nanoscience and nanotechnology is mostly based on the bottom-up methodology. The bottom-up strategy, which begins from nano-or sub-nanoscale entities presents an alternative and most promising method for realizing innovation and technology at the nanometer scale. Because of their ability to work with atoms and molecules, chemists are the perfect candidates to advance nanoscience and nanotechnology. The bottom-up approach is used to combine chemicals or nanoparticles into submicron materials, analogous to how living organisms produce DNA and proteins, incorporate materials into cells, and then come together to create a body. Processes like the semiconductor process are subject to the top-down approach. Any exploitation of nanotechnology must start with the capacity to construct structures with nanometric accuracy. One of the nanotechnology's major promises is the potential to accomplish more in the same amount of space: to develop our present technologies through shrinking, resulting in electronics that are each smaller, quicker, and more potent than before. Nanomaterials have extremely large surface areas for every unit volume as a result of their extremely tiny size. Nanomaterials may be categorized into four groups based on their size: (a) 0D spheres and clusters (b) 1D nanofibers, wires, and rods (c) 2D films, plates, and networks (d) 3D nanomaterials Specifically, whenever their sizes are equal in length, the surface properties of nanoparticles will affect the material as a whole. The qualities of the bulk materials may then be improved upon or altered as a result. Metallic nanoparticles, for instance, can be utilized as highly effective catalysts. Chemical sensors using nanowires and particles have improved sensitivity and selectivity. The spatial confinement feature of nanoscale feature sizes in nanomaterials also contributes to their quantum effects. The electrical and optical properties of the materials may alter dramatically beyond their bulk states due to changes in their charge carrier density with energy band structure. There are two ways to make graphene: chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or epitaxial growth on a surface with properly controlled thickness. These methods use a variety of substrate catalysts and growing conditions. The CVD technique of producing graphene has a wide surface area, excellent quality, and the greatest potential for producing high-purity graphene in big quantities. 
 HOPG Mechanical Cleavage The technique, also known as the Scotch tape approach, was invented by  Novoselov and Geim in 2004 . This technique may include separating graphene from graphite crystals using adhesive tape. Many sheets of graphene were peeled off of graphite in the first peel. The graphene is repeatedly removed from the sticky tape to get a monolayer, bilayer, or a few layers of graphene. Finally, the adhesive is dissolved by dissolving it in a solvent like acetone after the tape has been attached to a substrate. 
 Solution Processing Graphite is dispersed in an organic solvent (0.3 mg/mL sodium cholate) that has a surface energy that is quite similar to graphite. The liquid phase chemical abrasion of graphite is carried out in order to lower the energy barrier and permit the detachment of the graphene layer. The graphite is subsequently separated into individual graphene sheets as suspensions by either ultrasonically processing this solution for 100-400 h or by applying voltage to the solvent. To get rid of the larger particles, the fluid is centrifuged between 500 and 2000 rpm. This method yields graphene flakes with 1-10 stacked monolayers and up to 20% of flakes with a single layer. 
 SiC-Based Substrates with Epitaxial Growth Epitaxial graphene is produced on silicon carbide wafers using high-temperature graphitization. Si atoms sublimate at high temperatures, ultrahigh vacuum, and atmospheric pressure, while the carbon that is left forms graphitic layers on either the silicon or carbon sides of a SiC wafer. There are techniques for limiting the expansion of the graphene layers. 
 Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) For the direct synthesis of nanomaterials from carbon sources or precursors like methane, CVD is a bottom-up method that is subsequently transferred to a substrate. Metal foil substrates like Cu foil, large-area, single-and few-layer graphene sheets are generated using the CVD technique. After being deposited on the Cu foil, the graphene sheet is transferred directly to a dielectric surface or other relevant substrates. By using this technique, square meters of monolayer graphene has been created and transported on a 200 mm Si wafer. It has a lot of potential for touch screen applications. The potential and promise of CVD make it a promising commercial technology. 
 Semiconductor Quantum Dot Quantum dots (QDs) in semiconductors have garnered a lot of attention recently. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are 10 2 -10 5 atom-strong nanoscale material clusters. Quantum confinement of electrons and holes is possible in all three spatial dimensions as a result of the size of QDs, which is several orders of magnitude larger than a normal atomic radius. They are also known as artificial atoms as a result. The ability to customize the energies and wave functions of the quantum confined states by modifying the semiconductor QDs' size, shape, and composition is one of their most distinctive features. In the nanostructures referred to as quantum dots, electrons and/or holes are limited to a tiny area. Quantum confinement events provide colloidal nanocrystalline semiconductors like quantum dots (QDs) with their unique photophysical properties. QDs have special optical and electronic properties that set them apart from conventional organic fluorophores (like fluorescent proteins and organic dyes), including sizetunable light emission, higher absorption coefficients, resistance to photobleaching, superior signal brightness, and simultaneous activation of multiple fluorescence colors. Single-electron transistors and the control of one or two electron spins are the two best examples in quantum mechanics. Other uses for quantum dots are included in the field of optics. For example, certain quantum dots can enclose both electrons and holes in the same space, allowing for the conduct of atomic-scale experiments in solid-state systems. In particular, quantum dots have been used to successfully produce single photons, photon pairs in an entangled polarisation state, and unidentifiable photons. Another way to alter the effectiveness of light harvesting devices is by the fusion of two or more nanostructure layouts. Light-harvesting components (including semiconductor particles as well as dye molecules) can be attached with the aid of a nanotube or nanowire support to transport photogenerated charges to electrodes. In contrast to dye-sensitized solar cells, quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) provide new potential. First off, switching to quantum dots from dye molecules allows for finer control over the optical absorption in the solar cell by allowing for different semiconductor materials and particle sizes. Second, QDSSCs may be able to surpass the efficiencies suggested by  Shockley and  Queisser by making use of the recently discovered multiple electron-hole pair creation per photon. The metal oxide species TiO 2 is used in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), which employ quantum dots as the sensitizer. In order to create these devices, a coating of TiO 2 is applied to a conductive material before quantum dots are placed. Numerous deposition techniques are often used, including electrodeposition, SILAR (successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction), chemical bath deposition, and colloidal deposition. The working electrode for the QDSSC is located in this section of the setup and is coupled to a counter-electrode through an external circuit. A sandwich cell is made by pushing the working electrode, also known as the photoanode. The reference electrodes are placed near one another and sandwich an electrolyte between them. As charge carriers are removed to create a current, the electrolyte acts to refill them. The QDSSC overview is displayed in Fig.  2 .1. According to the Bohr radius, electrons may easily migrate among a few nanometers and a few hundred nm in a bulk semiconductor. This means that there exist continuous valence and conduction energy bands separated by an energy gap. While excitons are unable to move freely in a quantum dot, distinct atomic-like states having intensities that rely on the quantum dot radius do exist. From transistors and photonics to biological applications, the impact of quantum confinement is very technologically relevant. As shown in Fig.  2 .2, the emission hue of quantum dots may be adjusted by varying the particle size. Longer wavelengths of light are emitted by larger quantum dots than by smaller quantum dots. The relationship between the energy band gap Eg and particle size is that the energy increases as the particle's dimension decreases. 
 Semiconductor Nanowire Future electrical and optoelectronic devices are anticipated to heavily rely on semiconductor nanowires (NWs), which also constitute a novel framework for studying occurrences at the nanoscale. Over the past two decades, research on semiconductor nanowires (NWs) has improved our understanding of how off of an external circuit to produce power. The charge carriers are then replenished by the electrolyte  [5]  crystals are built at the atomic scale and revealed novel nanoscale quantum weirdness. Next-generation electrical and photonic devices also widely use compound semiconductor NWs as key parts  [8, 9] . When the core and shell segments are built to be smaller than the minority carrier diffusion lengths, this is especially advantageous for the effective collection of photogenerated carriers. Finally, due to the geometry of NWs' ability to tolerate strain caused by heteroepitaxially produced heteroepitaxiality by relaxing over the NW free surface. Solutions for multimodal integration are more suited for the NWs. Compared to epi-layers with fully planar geometry, this benefit significantly raises the patterns that play an important of lattice-mismatched NW crystals. The ability to design and synthetically produce complex nanowire materials makes them one of a kind among nanomaterials and makes it possible to construct systems or building blocks with predictable physical characteristics. Catalytic vapor-liquid-solid chemical vapor deposition was used to create silicon nanowires. The schematic of silicon nanowires SEM -10KX is shown in Fig.  2 .3. 
 Novel Semiconductor Nanowire Structure Semiconductor nanowires make it feasible to create cutting-edge optoelectronic devices such as heterojunctions, crystal phase quantum dots, LEDs, quantum electronics, and solar cells. A new class of nanohybrid systems called graphene 2D and 1D integrated semiconductor nanomaterials have been used because of their exceptional electrical and optoelectronic capabilities. Strongly oriented 1D semiconductor Fig.  2 .2 A schematic illustration shows how the size of a nanoparticle affects its optical performance. Top: Quantum confinement, the electronic structure of QDs has a blue shift  [6, 7]  nanowires as well as nanorods, for instance, might show unique properties when grown on graphene substrates. The nucleation of NWs/NRs in desired orientations may be defined by the existence of a graphene layer over certain substrates. One atom thick sp2 hybridized carbon, excellent optical transparency, flexibility, high carrier mobility, and high thermal conductivity are just a few of the extraordinary characteristics of graphene that make it possible to combine it with semiconducting nanowires, and nanoribbons (NRbs). 
 High-Quality Heterojunction Nanowires In contrast to the bulk, the bottom-up nanowire growth technique offers greater flexibility in mixing various semiconductor materials and enables the formation of heterojunctions with good interface quality. Lattice matching is a crucial condition for constructing a heterojunction without introducing mismatched displacement at the interface. This makes it very difficult to build heterojunctions in traditional thin film technology without misfit dislocations. The tension at the interface between two distinct semiconductors is substantially lower in a nanowire than it is in a thin film, though. The explanation is that an elastic radial compression or expansion is possible because a nanowire's tiny footprint (often less than 200 nm) allows for it. As a result, nanowires may be used to stack various bandgap semiconductors with significantly wider lattice mismatches without causing any misfit dislocations. For instance, a nanowire-based InSb/GaAs heterostructure with a 14.6% lattice misfit between InSb and GaAs has been developed. In bottom-up nanowires, a wide range of III-V materials have also been axially incorporated. This is a significant development for potential material leads because it could offer a solution to several persistent technical issues that have long plagued the thin film community. For instance, integrating optoelectronic devices manufactured from III-V materials into conventional Si-based electrical devices is one of the major objectives in microelectronics. This is immediately attainable in nanowire technology via III-V nanowire growth on Si. 3 Silicon nanowires produced utilizing a FirstNano ® Easytube ® device for catalytic vaporliquid-solid chemical vapor deposition  [10]  Solar Energy-Based Technologies The terms "solar energy technologies" and "solar energy resources" describe energy sources that could be directly linked to the sun's heat or light. Photovoltaic (PV) energy technology, on the other hand, may be broadly split into two categories: (i) Solar (ii) Photovoltaic This is the process of gathering solar energy and storing it or transforming it for use in different ways. When light strikes a semiconductor material, the PV technology causes electron excitation and significantly increases conductivity, converting the radiant stored energy in light quanta into electrical energy  [11] . The market now offers two major forms of PV technology: (a) Thin film technologies (b) Crystalline silicon-based PV cells Both are derived from a variety of various semiconducting materials, such as cadmium-telluride, amorphous silicon, and copper indium gallium diseline. Solar heat is employed in solar thermal technology, which may then be converted into electricity or used directly for heating or cooling purposes. The two subcategories are (i) solar thermal nonelectric and (ii) solar thermal electric. The first relates to the use of solar heat to create steam for electricity generation, commonly known as concentrated solar power (CSP), and the later refers to applications including such solar water heaters, agricultural drying, solar air warmers, solar cooling systems, and solar cookers  [12] . The potential for creating novel methods for converting light energy has been further enhanced by recent efforts to regenerate nanostructures of exactly articulated geometrical shapes and organize them as two-and threedimensional groupings. The essential properties of semiconductor nanocrystals are presently used in three separate types of solar cells: (i) Schottky junction (or) metal-semiconductor photovoltaic cell (ii) Semiconductor sensitized quantum dot solar cell (iii) Semiconductor nanostructure-polymer solar cell, as shown in Fig.  2 
 .4 Semiconductor quantum dots have particular advantages for solar cell light collection systems. First, one may adjust the noticeable response and band offsets to change the vectorial electron transport across various particle sizes according to their size quantization feature. Additionally, these quantum dots provide novel opportunities for the use of hot electrons or the production of several charge carriers from a single photon. A single photon with energy larger than the bandgap can create two or more excitons, as demonstrated by multiple carrier creation in PbSe nanocrystals. 
 Thin Film Application The active component is placed as a thin coating on a cheap substrate in the thin film method, which is a more economical alternative. Because of this, costs are decreased and much less material is utilized (little enough as 1% less than with wafers). The bulk of these cells employ amorphous silicon, which, although being substantially more economical to make, only has an efficiency of 8% because, as its name suggests, it lacked a crystalline structure as shown in Fig.  2 .5. The quantum dot-containing nanomaterials are wrapped in microscopic semiconductor crystals. Unlike traditional materials, which can only create one electron from a single photon, quantum dots are able to divide high-energy photons into a large number of electrons. The same principles govern quantum dots, although instead of producing one photon of light, they produce three electrons. Valance band electrons move into the conduction band. The dots also enhance thermal efficiency by up to 65% by absorbing more sunlight's spectrums. Making what are known as "hot carrier cells" is another application for quantum dots. However, the additional energy from photons leads to higher-energy electrons in hot carrier cells, which in turn results in a larger voltage. In most cases, a photon's extra energy is lost as heat. 
 Photovoltaic Application The need for clean electricity generation based on renewable energy sources has grown significantly over the past 10 years, along with the installed photovoltaic (PV) power capacity's exponential rise. Crystalline silicon wafer solar cells (SC) continue to make up the lion's share of the real PV energy supply. Nanoscale designs often display distinctive optical and electrical features for photo-functional materials. However, due to effects that require on size and shape in addition to semiconductor systems, and metal-semiconductor junctions  [13]  collective behaviors from the incorporated building blocks, the capacity to change size and shape gives better optoelectronic properties. As brand new components for photocatalysis systems, several organic and inorganic-based nanostructures have already been created. Organic nanostructures have generated greater interest than their inorganic counterparts because of their excellent molecular design flexibility, impressive capacity to tune optoelectronic properties, and acceptable solution processability. The development of organic nanomaterials for photocatalytic applications is therefore crucial for research. Numerous important advantages come from using nanowires as photovoltaic parts. Additionally, the bottom-up design approach allows for the rational management of key nanomaterial properties, such as the chemical/dopant combination, size, and shape, which significantly affect photovoltaic performance. Second, energy may be produced for low-power applications using single or paired nanowire components using traditional electronics or nanoscale electronics. Finally, a single nanowire level would make it possible to evaluate the inherent limitations, potential growth areas, benefits, and perhaps even unique ideas for this kind of nano-enabled devices for energy conversion. Figure  2 .6 depicts schematically two distinct structural motifs that might result in practical solar systems at the single nanowire level. 
 PV Based on Bulk Semiconductors When photons with energy over the semiconductor band gap are absorbed by PV solar cells, they split into negative electrons and positive holes. Most photogenerated electronic particles may move around unhindered in the conduction and valence bands of bulk inorganic semiconductors, resulting in the reason these are known as free (charge) carriers. At normal temperature, the photogenerated carriers in organic Fig.  2 .  5  An illustration of a solar cell that turns light into electricity by using nanorods  [11, 14]  semiconductors have low dielectric constants, create bound electron-hole pairs known as excitation energy, and are correlated. An internal electric field is necessary to correctly segregate the free electrons and holes in the first situation so they may be gathered at electrodes with opposing charges and used in a solar cell. 
 Conclusion As a result, one of the components that may be created utilizing top-down or bottomup nanomaterials is a semiconductor. Our ability to produce distinctive nanomaterials that have been modified by incredibly fine particle size, crystalline structure, geometry, or surfaces is made possible by advances in nanotechnology. It shows that the electronic device architects that are employing are slimmer and more powerful compared to what we employed previously; nanotechnology-based materials have become the foundation for our modern way of life. Due to its growing efficiency, the semiconductor sector is developing into an essential instrument for energy harvesting. Solar energy harvesting is one of the most crucial applications for semiconductors, so solar cells or photovoltaic materials are those that are created by nanotechnology with an increase in photon trapping and energy conversion efficiency by declaring the material into quantum dots, quantum wires, and quantum wells. Fundamental of Carbon-Based Nanomaterials: Graphite, Graphene, and Carbon Nanotube (CNT) various fields like medical, nuclear industry, electrical industry, energy storage devices, etc. 
 Keywords Carbon-based nanomaterials • Graphite • Graphene • Carbon nanotubes • Energy storage devices See Fig.  3 .1  [1] . 
 Graphite Graphite is semi-metal, prominent allotrope of carbon. It is greyish black and opaque substance. It is favored by high pressure and temperature, so it is the most stable form of carbon under standard condition. Two main forms of graphite exist, i.e., natural graphite and synthetic graphite. Natural graphite is mined and is ancient fossil carbon. It is found in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Natural graphite is classified as vein (lump) graphite, flake graphite, and amorphous graphite. Vein has more than 98% purity, and is rare and expensive. Flake graphite is 90-95% pure and are most commonly used. Amorphous graphite has purity less than 85% and contains high ash. Synthetic graphite is obtained from petroleum feedstock. Synthetic graphite can be produced by heat treatment of preprocessed petrochemicals (cokes and pitches), precipitation during steelmaking, heat treatment (pyrolysis) of polymers, and hot pressing of vapor-deposited carbon. In all cases, graphite is produced in polycrystalline form. It is challenging to give it complex shapes due to anisotropy.  
 Structure Graphite is made of parallel layers of graphene. In each layer atoms are arranged in hexagonal ring. Each atom is bonded to three other atoms. This affects the property of graphite and enable them to conduct electricity. Weak van der Waals forces keep layers together. So, the important features of the crystal that are ultimately responsible for many of the unique properties of graphite are (i) the system of strong chemical bonds forming large sheets of hexagonal rings in which the electrons are quite mobile and (ii) the large spacing and weak bonding between planes. The layers are able to slide over each other on application of slight pressure. They show crystalline structure. Two forms of graphite called alpha (bernal) and beta (rhombohedral) exist. They have similar properties but differ in terms of stacking of graphene layer. In alpha graphite stacking is ABA while in beta graphite stacking is ABC (Figs.  3 .2 and 3.3)  [2, 3] . 
 Properties The bonding between layers is weak so that graphite cleaves easily between the layers which account for the remarkable softness of the graphite. Although it is flexible, it is not elastic. The spacing of sheets is wide and atoms do not back together to fill the space very effectively and hence density of graphite is lower (2.25 g/cm  3  ) than diamond. As we know that layers can slide easily on pressure application, hence graphite is considered as smooth material. Monocrystalline graphite is diamagnetic at any temperature and has very high anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility. It is the only metal that conducts electricity. Each carbon atoms have one electron that is not used in bonding and is free to move. It is this free electron responsible for conduction of Fig.  3 .2 Structure of graphite  [2]  electricity. In graphene electrons have long mean free path without disrupting the electron-electron interactions and order. Hence they show distinguished properties than those of other metals and semiconductors. Graphite is anisotropic and due to its plane metallic bonding it shows excellent thermal conductivity. Atoms are bonded by strong covalent bond, hence graphite also shows higher melting and boiling points. It can work in temperature exceeding 3600 C. Graphite under high temperature and high pressure can be converted into diamond. It is noninflammable. Chemical reaction can be carried out by allowing reactant molecule called intercalate between graphene layers. Such reactions are called intercalation. At low temperature, graphite is inert to all but the strongest oxidizing agent. However, its reaction proceeds at a measurable rate with oxygen at 380 C, water vapor at 625 C, and carbon dioxide and hydrogen at about 750 C when any of these gases are present at atmospheric pressure. Graphite is compatible with several metals, notably bismuth, lead, tin, magnesium, and aluminum. Sodium and the other alkali metals react rapidly with graphite, causing it to swell. Copper is one of the least reactive metals with graphite. It does not form a carbide and solubility in graphite is immeasurably small. 
 Applications (a) Daily use: The most common use of graphite is in making core of pencils. Also, for paint production graphite is used. (b) Industry: Due to its softness, powdered graphite is used as lubricant far fastmoving parts of machinery. Graphite is used for making carbon electrodes in dry cell and electrolysis. This has major application in making batteries. Graphite electrodes are highly demanded in steel-making industry, because of their low coefficient of thermal expansion, which is related to the capacity of resisting high temperatures. The graphite is used as refractory material which are heat resistant. They are frequently used to make crucibles, wall liner for hightemperature furnace, products that are molded and fireproofing systems. (c) Nuclear application: Graphite is chemically inert. It displays low absorption of X-rays and neutrons, hence can be useful for nuclear applications. Electrographite is used for nuclear producing reflector components and moderator rods in nuclear reactors. (d) Electrical applications: For the manufacturing of carbon brushes in electric motors, as electrical materials, graphite is used. (e) Electronic applications: In optical devices like photodetectors, light-emitting diodes, solar cell using graphene for improved performance, graphene can also be utilized in various electronic sensors owing to its unique device property. (f ) Thermal applications: Graphene shows excellent thermal properties, hence can be used for temperature sensing applications and thermal management. It is used in temperature sensors, thermoelectric sensors, and thermal biosensors. (g) Graphite shapes: Graphite can be easily machined into variety of shapes. Graphite shapes is the term used to describe solid shaped graphite products used in many industries mostly in elevated temperature applications. These are useful in aerospace, automotive, and electronic industries. (h) Carburizing: Carbon additives like mixtures of synthetic graphite are introduced to some iron and steel, to increase carbon content in order to improve the final performance. The process of adding carbon is called carburization or recarburizing. (i) Matrix materials: For fuel particles, graphite is used as a matrix. Efforts has been directed for the development of fuel particles that will retain fission gases. ( j) Bearings and bushings: Bearings are components that support a load while in contact with and moving relative to another part. A type of bearing, bushings are thin tubes designed to reduce friction between two surfaces sliding against each other. Graphite is used because of its self-lubricating capacity, long service life, and capability to thrive in harsh environment. 
 Graphene Graphene is just one atom thick. This material is mathematically two dimensional. Dr. Konstantin  Novoselov and  Professor Andre Geim discovered this wondered material in 2004.They were examining how efficient graphite is as transistor. The story goes that graphene appeared. In 2010 they got Noble prize. The most common method of graphene production is exfoliation technique to separate graphene from bulk crystals. Another technique for graphene production is disperse graphene from solution. Currently the technique which has the potential for mass production is direct growth of graphene. This can be done by heating a SiC wafer which leads to partial graphitization of the upper layer. Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) are also important routes for the growth of graphene. 
 Structure Graphene has honeycomb like structure. These are 2D carbon nanomaterials having atomic thickness of about 0.34 nm. All carbon atoms are SP 2 hybridized. In graphene each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three other carbon atoms. Due to strength of covalent bonds between carbon atoms, graphene shows great stability and very high tensile strength. Graphene is flat, hence every atom is on the surface and is accessible from both sides, so there is more interaction with surrounding molecules. Despite being 2D, graphene can still be seen. This single layer of atoms is perfectly visible to the naked eye (Fig.  3 .4). 
 Properties Graphene is not only one of the thinnest but also strongest materials. This material carries electricity more quickly, more precisely, and more efficiently than any other known material. The reason is current density of graphene is many million times better than that of copper. Graphene is incredibly stretching material. It can stretch as much as 25% of its length. Graphene is good conductor of electricity. It is the lowest resistivity substance known at room temperature. It also conducts heat better than all other materials. It is optically transparent, yet so dense that it is impermeable to gases. It cannot even pass helium through it. Graphene is nearly transparent to visible as well as other forms of electromagnetic radiation. It absorbs only 2% of light incident on it, whether it is ultraviolet, infrared, or any wavelength in between. One more quality of graphene is that it expands when cooled and shrinks when gets hot. 
 Applications (a) Photovoltaic devices: Due to its excellent electron transport properties and extremely high carrier mobility, graphene can be used for its low cost, flexibility, and highly efficient photovoltaic devices. (b) Water filtration system: For purification of water graphene can be used, as it allows water to pass but not other liquids and gases. (c) Medical sensor and drug delivery: Several biomedical applications are being explored for graphene, including drug delivery, cancer therapy, and as a sensor. However, its toxicity profile must be investigated before clinical use. (d) Energy storage: Graphene is useful for upper capacitors, graphene batteries, and catalysis for fuel cells. Defect free graphene might solve lithium-metal batteries dendrite problem, i.e., electrical short circuit and overheating of electrodes. (e) Flexible solar panel: Graphene has made ease for engineers who are trying to make new, lightweight, and flexible solar panels that would be used to cover the outside surface of building other than the roof. (f) Bionic devices: Graphene is thin and flexible, hence it can be used to make "bionic" devices that would be implemented in living tissue. Bionic means those devices which help or improve tissue or organ such as artificial hearts or assist people with hearing loss. (g) Graphene-based composites: Several researchers have demonstrated that adding even a trace amount of graphene to plastic, metals, or other materials can make these materials much stronger or lighter. Such graphene enhanced composite materials can find applications in aerospace, building materials, mobile devices and many other applications. (h) Display screens in mobile devices: Researchers have found that graphene can replace indium-based electrodes in organic light emitting diodes (OLED). These diodes are used in electronic device display screens which require low power consumption. The use of graphene reduces the cost and also eliminates the use of metals in the OLED. 
 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) Carbon nanotube is a quasi-1D nanomaterial. CNT can be described as a sheet of graphene rolled into cylinder, constructed from hexagonal rings of carbon having one layer or multiple layers. It is one of the famous allotropes of carbon. Carbon nanotube has attracted attention of many researchers and industry due to remarkable electrical, thermal, mechanical, and optical properties. Since the diameter of nanotubes is of the order of nanometer, hence their name is derived from their size. There are various methods of production of carbon nanotubes. These methods are mainly classified into physical processes and chemical processes. Arch discharge method and laser ablation are included into physical methods. Chemical vapor deposition and liquid electrolysis are included in chemical methods. 
 Structure Carbon nanotubes can be considered as cylinders formed by rolling or folding of a graphene sheet. CNTs are tubular in shape. There are two types of carbon nanotubes. (a) Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs): Single-walled carbon nanotube is the single folding of thick layer graphene sheet. Catalysts are required for its synthesis. It can be easily twisted and is more pliable. The SWCNT has three types: • Arm chair • Zig-zag • Chiral or helical These three types of SWCNT are formed by folding of graphene sheet in three different ways. The choice of rolling axis relative to hexagonal network of the graphene sheet and the radius of the closing cylinder allows for different types of SWCNTs (Fig.  3 .5)  [4] . (b) Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs): It can be considered as collection of concentric SWCNT with different diameters. It is multiple rolled layers or concentric tubes of graphene. It can be produced without catalyst. It cannot be easily twisted (Fig.  3 .6)  [5] . 
 Properties In carbon nanotube, atoms are chemically bonded with SP 2 bonds like graphene. This bonding structure is stronger than the SP 3 bonds found in diamonds, which make them uniquely strong. CNTs have exceptional mechanical stiffness and tensile Fig.  3 .5 Types of single-walled carbon nanotube  [4]  strength. The mechanical tensile strength of CNT could be 400 times that of steel. CNT is having high stability to withstand extreme strain. CNTs can recover from severe structural distortions. CNTs are extremely physically and chemically stable, hence may not be biodegradable. However, novel approaches have been developed for degrading CNTs. Methods that use neutrophils, peroxides, and macrophages have yielded some encouraging results. CNTs are very light weight. Their density is one-sixth that of steel. CNTs have very high aspect ratio, greater than 1000. Tip surface area of CNTs is near the theoretical limit. An amazing feature of CNTs is its elasticity. They retain their original geometric structure under maximum force and high pressure. CNTs have semiconductor character except arm chair SWCNT, which show electrical conductivity. In SWCNTs, conduction occurs through discrete electronic states so it can be treated as quantum wires, at very low temperatures. Thermal conductivity of CNT is better than diamond. Thermal conductivity increases with decrease in diameter. Carbon nanotubes are highly chemically stable that make them extremely resistant to corrosion. CNTs have useful absorption, photoluminescence (fluorescence), and Raman spectroscopy properties. 
 Applications (a) Breast cancer tumor destruction: Carbon nanotubes are used to destroy the breast cancer tumors. They play like an antibody. The antibody along with nanotubes is attracted to the proteins by the cancer cell in the body and nanotubes absorb laser beam killing the bacteria of tumor. (b) Tissue engineering: CNTs have prominent application in the field of tissue engineering. They are used for tracking of cells, sensing of microenvironment, and delivering of transfection agents. (c) CNTs for biomaterial: For application to spine interbody fusion material, a polyetheretherketone (PEEK) composite with MWCNTs possessing excellent mechanical and bone compatibility has been developed. (d) CNT-based biosensors: For biosensor development, probe molecule for a given target can be attached to CNT tips. It has direct, fast, and specific response. (e) Wind mill blades: Carbon nanotubes are used in the wind mill blades because of their low weight and produce more electricity at faster rate. (f) Filtration: Carbon nanotubes can be used to separate particles of size greater than diameter of CNTs, during filtration through carbon nanotubes. CNTs can also be used to trap smaller sized ions from a solution. (g) CNTs as nanocylinders: A gas like H 2 for energy, battery, or vehicle can be safely stored inside CNT and problem of H 2 storage hazards can be solved. CNTs have also shown to absorb infrared light and may have application in the I/R optics industry. (h) Air craft stress reduction: Nanotubes are used in the space and air craft to reduce the weight and stress of the various components working together. (i) Catalyst in some reactions: CNTs are used in drug delivery system. Also, they have applications related to conductivity in electronics. (j) Field emission: Carbon nanotubes are excellent electron emitters, hence used in field emission-based devices. (k) Optoelectronic and sensor devices: For improved performance of optoelectronic and sensor device carbon nanotubes are used. (l) Chemical sensors: In single-walled carbon nanotube, every atom is on the surface and exposed to the environment. Charge transfer or small changes in the environment of a nanotube can cause drastic changes to its electrical properties. Monitoring the change in conductivity forms the basis of sensing. It has applications in industrial toxic chemicals, leak detection, and safety. (m) Vacuum tube lamp: CNTs are used in vacuum tube lamp and this lamp is having high life time and good brightness. 
 Introduction Nanoscience and nanotechnology have the potential to benefit a wide range of industrial sectors, including the chemical and electronics industries, as well as manufacturing. Nanoscience can have significant applications in health care, medical practice, and environmental protection. Nanomaterials have unique properties due to their small size and high surface-area-to-volume ratio. These properties differ significantly from those of bulk materials, making them useful in a wide range of applications including electronics and biomedical engineering. The themes underlying nanoscience and nanotechnology are often centered around two key approaches, namely the bottom-up approach and the self-assembly approach. The bottom-up approach, as articulated by Richard Feynman in his 1959 lecture "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom," involves the miniaturization of components to the nanoscale. This approach involves the manipulation of individual atoms and molecules to create new materials and devices with unique properties and functionalities. The bottom-up approach has led to the development of a wide range of nanomaterials and devices, including nanoelectronics, nanomedicine, and nanocomposites. The self-assembly approach, on the other hand, involves the spontaneous organization of individual molecules or nanoparticles into larger, functional structures. This approach is often driven by noncovalent interactions between the individual components, such as hydrogen bonding or Van der Waals forces. The self-assembly approach has led to the development of complex and functional supramolecular structures with potential applications in a wide range of fields  [1] . Over the past few decades, carbon-based nanomaterials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes have captured the attention of researchers and industry professionals due to their remarkable properties and potential applications in the semiconductor industry. The pioneering research by Iijima in the early 1990s on carbon nanotubes kickstarted a wave of investigations that led to the discovery of other carbon-based materials, such as graphene  [2] . The unique electronic and physical properties of these nanomaterials have opened up new possibilities for the development of high-performance electronic devices with unprecedented performance  [3, 4] . Carbon nanotubes can be used as tips in scanning probe microscopy, which allows for the imaging and manipulation of individual atoms and molecules on a surface. Carbon nanotubes also find its application in the development of efficient field emitters for use in display devices. Carbon nanotubes have been shown to exhibit excellent electron field emission properties, which makes them attractive for use in displays, lighting, and other electronic devices. The electronic structure of carbon nanotubes is also of great interest for many applications. Since single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) can be either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality, they have potential applications in a wide range of electronic and optoelectronic devices  [5] . 
 Graphite The word "graphite" is derived from the Greek word "graphein," which means "to write"  [6] . The name was given by Abraham Gottlob Werner in 1789. Graphite is the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions, and it is found naturally in rocks such as marble and schist. Synthetic graphite was first produced by American scientist Edward Acheson in 1896, using a process in which a mixture of coke and clay was subjected to high temperatures and pressures. Since then, various methods have been developed for producing synthetic graphite, including chemical vapor deposition and graphitization of carbon fibers. The unique properties of graphite can be attributed to its crystal structure. The carbon atoms in graphite are arranged in a flat, layered hexagonal lattice structure, with each carbon atom bonded to three neighboring carbon atoms in a planar condensed ring system  [7] . This gives graphite its characteristic layered structure, with weak intermolecular forces allowing the layers to slide past one another. This gives graphite its characteristic softness and ability to be used as a good lubricant in dynamos and electric motors. Graphite is also an excellent electrical conductor, making it useful for electrodes in electrical arc lamps and other electrical applications. This is due to the delocalization of π-electrons in the carbon atoms in graphite, which allows for the movement of electrons and the flow of electrical current  [8] . The applications of graphite is illustrated in the following Fig.  4 .1. 
 Graphene Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, which gives it a distinctive honeycomb shape. This material is incredibly strong, lightweight, and has excellent electrical conductivity due to its unique electronic structure  [9] . It was first isolated and characterized in 2004 by Andre  Geim  and Konstantin Novoselov at the University of Manchester, UK  [10] . Since then, graphene has gained significant attention due to its unique properties and potential for various applications. Graphene is the thinnest material known to exist, with a thickness of only one atom. It is also the strongest material known, with a tensile strength about 200 times greater than steel. Graphene is also an excellent conductor of heat and electricity, with a high surface area and low electrical resistance. The unique properties of graphene make it an attractive material for various applications, including electronics, energy storage, sensors, and biomedicine. Graphene has the potential to revolutionize these fields by enabling the development of new technologies that are more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly  [11] . Graphene has a unique electronic structure due to its zero bandgap, which means that it has no energy barrier to prevent electrons from flowing through it. This property makes graphene an excellent conductor of electricity and enables its use in various applications. The electronic properties of graphene are determined by its two-dimensional structure and the way in which the carbon atoms are arranged in the hexagonal lattice. Graphene has a honeycomb lattice structure with carbon atoms arranged at the corners of each hexagon as shown in Fig.  4 .2. Each carbon atom in graphene has four valence electrons, which form strong covalent bonds with neighboring carbon atoms. In graphene, the valence electrons are delocalized, meaning that they are not confined to individual atoms but are free to move throughout the lattice. This gives rise to a unique electronic band structure, in which the valence and conduction bands overlap, resulting in a zero bandgap. The delocalized electrons in graphene behave like massless particles, known as Dirac fermions, which travel through the lattice at nearly the speed of light. The unique electronic properties of graphene, along with its high carrier mobility and excellent conductivity, make it an ideal material for use in electronic devices.

 Graphene FETs Graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) are a type of transistor that use graphene as the channel material, which makes them particularly attractive for use in electronics due to graphene's unique properties. The working principle of graphene-based electronic devices  [12] , such as field-effect transistors (FETs), is based on the control of the flow of electrons through graphene. In FETs, a gate electrode is used to control the flow of electrons between a source and a drain electrode, by applying a voltage to the gate electrode. GFETs work based on the principle of field-effect modulation. The basic structure of a GFET consists of a graphene channel, a gate electrode, and an insulating layer separating the graphene channel from the gate electrode and it is shown in Fig.  4 .3. When a voltage is applied to the gate electrode, an electric field is generated that extends into the graphene channel. This field causes the Fermi level of the graphene to shift, resulting in a change in its electrical conductivity  [13] . By varying the gate voltage, the conductivity of the graphene channel can be precisely controlled, allowing GFETs to function as amplifiers or switches. GFETs have the potential to revolutionize a wide range of applications due to their unique properties such as high carrier mobility, large surface area, and high mechanical strength. GFETs have the potential to replace conventional silicon-based transistors in high-performance electronic devices due to their high electron mobility and high carrier velocity. GFETs can be used in logic gates, amplifiers, and memory devices  [14] . GFETs have been demonstrated to be highly sensitive to changes in the surrounding environment, making them excellent candidates for various types of nanosensors such as gas sensors, pressure sensors, and biosensors  [15] . GFETs also find their application in energy storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors due to their high surface area and electrical conductivity.GFET-based electrodes exhibit high energy density and fast chargingrates  [16] . Graphene is transparent and hence GFETs can be easily integrated into flexible and transparent electronic devices due to their excellent mechanical properties and transparency. GFETs can be used in flexible displays, touch screens, and wearable devices  [17] . Graphene is a remarkable material with unique properties that make it useful in a wide range of applications. As shown in the Fig.  4 .4, its strength, conductivity, flexibility, transparency, and chemical resistance make it an attractive material for use in electronics, energy storage, and other fields. However, there are also challenges associated with the production and use of graphene, including environmental concerns, lack of standardization, fragility, and potential health risks which will be overwhelmed by ongoing research and development in the field and even more potential applications for graphene will be unlocked in the future. 
 Carbon Nanotubes Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are cylindrical nanostructures  [18]  made up of hexagonally arranged carbon atoms. They have distinct mechanical, thermal, and electrical qualities  [19]  that make them appealing for a variety of applications such as electronics, energy storage, and biomedical engineering. CNTs have a high strength-to-weight ratio, excellent electrical conductivity, and a large surface area, making them attractive as electrodes in batteries and supercapacitors. Carbon nanotubes are already well established as perfect model systems for understanding the physics of one-dimensional solids and offer tremendous potential as building blocks for a variety of practical nanoscale technologies. They also have high thermal conductivity, making them ideal for thermal management applications. The advancement of nanotube growth has facilitated basic research and uses of nanotubes. Despite their remarkable potential, there are significant challenges  [20]  in the synthesis, purification, and functionalization of carbon nanotubes. Sumio Iijima, a Japanese scientist, made the initial discovery of CNTs in 1991  [2]  and ever since then, scientists, engineers, and researchers from all over the world have been very interested in them. The tremendous mechanical strength of CNTs is one of their most impressive characteristics. They are an excellent choice for several applications in the aerospace, automotive, and construction sectors since they are significantly stronger and lighter than steel but about 100 times stronger. CNTs also have a very high length-to-diameter ratio due to their high aspect ratio. They are a great reinforcing material for composites because of this property, which may be exploited to improve the mechanical characteristics of diverse materials.

 High electrical conductivity CNTs are particularly well suited for application  [21]  in electronic devices because of their exceptional electrical characteristics, which complement their exceptional mechanical qualities. They have a large surface area, great electrical conductivity, and are therefore perfect for energy storage devices like batteries and supercapacitors. As they can be used to create transistors that are quicker and smaller than those made of ordinary silicon, CNTs have also demonstrated potential for application in nanoelectronics  [22] . The high heat conductivity of CNTs is another intriguing characteristic. They are perfect for use in heat management applications, such as thermal interface materials and heat sinks, since they are good thermal conductors. CNTs are advantageous in the realm of optoelectronics because they can both absorb and emit light. Although there are still certain obstacles to be addressed before CNTs can be widely employed in practical applications, it is impossible to overlook their potential to completely transform a number of sectors. The future of carbon nanotubes appears to be quite bright as a result of the continuous research in this area, which is anticipated to lead to several new discoveries and developments. 
 Types of Carbon Nanotubes Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are carbon cylinders with distinctive electrical, mechanical, and thermal characteristics. Based on their structural characteristics, CNTs may be split into two main groups: single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The diameter and chirality of CNTs also affect their electrical characteristics. 
 Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs) A single layer of carbon atoms organized in a hexagonal lattice pattern, producing a cylindrical tube, makes up single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). SWCNTs can have a length of up to several millimeters and a diameter that can range from 0.4-2 nanometers  [23] . Whether SWCNTs function as metals or semiconductors depends on their diameter and chirality, which affects their electronic properties. Whereas SWCNTs with greater diameters and various chirality indices behave semiconducting  [24] , those with smaller diameters and specific chirality indices behave metallically. SWCNTs are a desirable material for several electronic applications, including transistors and sensors, due to their distinctive electronic characteristics. The huge surface area of SWCNTs makes them desirable for applications requiring a large surface area, such as catalysis or energy storage devices. Also, because of their tiny size and ease with which they may pass through cell membranes, they are well suited for biological uses including medication administration and imaging. SWCNTs are a fascinating and versatile material that has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries. One of the key advantages of SWCNTs is their unique electronic properties, which make them ideal for use in a variety of electronic applications. One such application is in the development of high-performance transistors. SWCNTs can be used to create field-effect transistors (FETs). FETs made from SWCNTs have been shown to have excellent electrical properties, including high electron mobility and low power consumption. These properties make them ideal for use in high-speed, low-power electronics. Another area where SWCNTs show great potential is in the development of sensors. Because of their high surface area and unique electronic properties, SWCNTs can be used to create highly sensitive sensors for a wide range of applications, including gas sensing, biosensing, and environmental monitoring. SWCNT-based gas sensors have been developed that are capable of detecting trace amounts of gases such as nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide. Furthermore, SWCNTs also have unique mechanical properties that make them ideal for use in a range of structural applications. SWCNTs have a tensile strength that is several times greater than that of steel, while still being incredibly lightweight. This makes them ideal for use in the development of high-strength, lightweight materials for a range of applications, including aerospace, automotive, and construction. SWCNTs also show great promise in the field of energy storage. SWCNTs have a high surface area, which makes them ideal for use in supercapacitors and batteries. Supercapacitors made from SWCNTs have been shown to have high power density and excellent charge-discharge cycling stability. SWCNT-based lithium-ion batteries have been developed that have improved energy density and cycling stability compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. The biomedical field also presents a promising area of application for SWCNTs, given their unique properties, such as their small size and ability to penetrate cell membranes, which make them well suited for drug delivery and imaging applications. 
 Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are cylindrical tubes with multiple walls made of several layers of concentric layers of carbon atoms  [25] . MWCNTs can range in diameter from a few to tens of nanometers, and they can have two to hundreds of walls  [26] . With lower-diameter MWCNTs being semiconducting and bigger-diameter MWCNTs being metallic, the electrical characteristics of MWCNTs depend on their diameter and the number of walls. MWCNTs offer greater thermal stability and are mechanically stronger than SWCNTs. MWCNTs are utilized as reinforcing material in composites, polymers, and metals to increase their strength and stiffness because of their distinct mechanical characteristics. In order to increase the heat conductivity of polymers and other materials, MWCNTs are also employed as thermal interface materials. MWCNTs offer several unique advantages over SWCNTs, such as greater thermal stability and mechanical strength. Because of these properties, MWCNTs are often used as reinforcing materials in composites, polymers, and metals to increase their strength and stiffness. By incorporating MWCNTs into these materials, manufacturers can create products that are more durable and resistant to wear and tear. MWCNTs are also employed as thermal interface materials, which are used to increase the heat conductivity of polymers and other materials. By adding MWCNTs to these materials, manufacturers can improve their ability to dissipate heat, which is especially important in applications where heat buildup can cause damage or reduce performance. Like SWCNTs, MWCNTs also show great promise in the field of biomedical applications. Because of their small size and unique properties, MWCNTs can be used in a variety of drug delivery and imaging applications. MWCNTs can also be used in imaging applications, such as in the development of high-resolution imaging probes. Because of their small size, MWCNTs can be used to create imaging probes that are capable of penetrating deep into tissues, allowing for high-resolution imaging of cells and tissues. As research into their properties and potential applications continues, it is likely that SWCNTs and MWCNTs will become increasingly important materials in a variety of fields such as biomedicine, materials science, and energy storage. The difference between the SWCNT and MWCNT is given below (Table  4 .1): 
 Features of Carbon Nanotube Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are intriguing for a variety of applications due to their distinctive electrical, mechanical, and thermal characteristics. Designing and maximizing the use of these features in various applications requires an understanding of their properties  [27] . The electrical and mechanical characteristics of carbon nanotubes are greatly influenced by their chirality and diameter. The angle at which a graphene sheet is rolled up to produce a carbon nanotube determines its chirality. The chirality of a carbon nanotube is determined by two indices, (n,m), which represent the number of unit cells along the graphene sheet's two separate directions. In a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT), the (n, m) indices determine the tube's diameter and electronic properties. If n ¼ m, the tube is called an armchair nanotube and is metallic. If n 6 ¼ m, but n À m is a multiple of 3, the tube is called a zigzag nanotube and is also metallic. If n 6 ¼ m and n À m is not a multiple of 3, the tube is called a chiral nanotube and exhibits semiconducting behavior. In a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT), the (n, m) indices can vary for each wall, and the tube can have a range of electronic properties depending on the combination of diameters and chirality of the individual walls. The circumference of a carbon nanotube determines its diameter, which is correlated with its chirality indices. Carbon nanotubes' electrical characteristics are influenced by their chirality and diameter, with some displaying metallic behavior and others semiconducting activity. CNTs are desirable for a variety of electronic applications, including transistors, sensors, and energy storage devices, due to their distinctive electrical characteristics. Carbon nanotubes' mechanical characteristics are also influenced by their chirality and diameter, with smaller-diameter carbon nanotubes being more flexible and biggerdiameter carbon nanotubes being stiffer. The strong covalent bonds between the carbon atoms in CNTs make them exceptionally strong and stiff, with a Young's modulus estimated to be around 1 TPa. This high stiffness makes them one of the stiffest materials currently known, and they are therefore attractive for use in a wide range of mechanical applications where high strength and stiffness are required. CNTs are extremely lightweight, with a density that is around one-sixth that of steel. This makes them particularly appealing for use in aerospace applications, where reducing weight is critical to achieving improved performance and fuel efficiency. CNTs are also highly malleable and can bend without breaking, which is another desirable mechanical property. This makes them ideal for use as reinforcement in composites, where they can be embedded in a matrix material to enhance its mechanical properties. The exceptional thermal conductivity and stability of CNTs make them an attractive material for a variety of thermal applications. CNTs are particularly well suited for use as thermal interface materials, which are used to transfer heat between two surfaces by filling gaps and minimizing thermal resistance. In this application, CNTs can help to improve the efficiency and performance of electronic devices by facilitating the dissipation of heat. CNTs are also being explored for use in other thermal applications, such as in thermal management systems for spacecraft and satellites, where they could help to regulate temperatures and prevent overheating. CNTs are being studied for use in thermoelectric devices, which can convert waste heat into electrical energy, and in high-temperature sensors and probes. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have unique optical properties due to their one-dimensional structure, which makes them appealing for a range of optical applications. The most notable optical characteristic of CNTs is their ability to absorb and emit light in the near-infrared (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. This makes them ideal for use in sensors and photovoltaic devices, which often require NIR absorption for their operation. CNTs have a large surface area, which is also an attractive feature for optoelectronic devices. The large surface area enables efficient charge transfer between the CNTs and other materials, making them useful for creating interfaces in devices such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes. Moreover, the distinctive form of CNTs, which is essentially a rolled-up sheet of graphene, can lead to unique optical properties such as chirality-dependent absorption and emission. These properties can be exploited to create optoelectronic devices with improved efficiency and performance. CNTs exhibit high carrier mobility. The charge carriers in CNTs can move quickly and efficiently through the tube, which makes them useful in creating faster and more efficient electronic devices. CNTs can be easily integrated with other materials, such as polymers, to create composite materials with tailored optical and electronic properties. This enables the design of a wide range of optoelectronic devices with improved performance and functionality. CNTs can also be used as transparent conductive electrodes, which are essential components in many optoelectronic devices, such as touchscreens and flat-panel displays. The high transparency and conductivity of CNTs make them ideal for this application. Likewise, CNT-based electrodes can be fabricated using low-cost, scalable methods, which make them a cost-effective alternative to traditional materials such as indium tin oxide (ITO). CNTs' ability to absorb and emit light in the NIR region, combined with their large surface area, unique form, and high carrier mobility, make them promising candidates for creating high-performance optoelectronic devices. 
 Synthesis and Production of Carbon Nanotubes Carbon nanotube (CNT) synthesis and manufacture is a difficult process that necessitates exact control over several variables. The process involves the conversion of carbon-containing gases or solids into CNTs using a variety of techniques. Several techniques, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), arc discharge, laser ablation, and high-pressure carbon monoxide (HiPCO) synthesis, have been developed to create CNTs  [28, 29] . One of the most popular processes for creating CNTs is chemical vapor deposition (CVD). CVD is a common method for the synthesis of MWCNTs. It involves heating a carbon-containing gas, such as methane or ethylene, to high temperatures in a reactor while using a metal catalyst, such as iron, cobalt, or nickel. The reactor is heated to high temperatures, typically in the range of 600-1000 C, and pressurized to low pressures, typically less than 1 bar. As a result of the catalytic breakdown of the carbon-containing gas, the metal catalyst serves as a nucleation site for the formation of CNTs, which develop on its surface. CVD is a versatile technique that can produce CNTs with different diameters, lengths, and chiralities, but it requires careful control of the reaction conditions to obtain high-quality CNTs. Arc discharge is a technique for CNT synthesis that is based on passing a high electrical current through two graphite electrodes in an inert gas atmosphere, typically helium or argon. The high electrical current generates a high-temperature plasma that vaporizes the graphite electrodes, and the carbon atoms then condense to form CNTs. Arc discharge can produce high-quality CNTs with well-defined structures, and it is particularly useful for producing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with a narrow diameter distribution. Arc discharge is a batch process, which means that only a limited amount of CNTs can be produced in a single run. Also, the purification of CNTs synthesized by arc discharge can be challenging because the process generates a mixture of CNTs with different structures, lengths, and diameters, as well as other carbon structures, such as amorphous carbon and fullerenes. Despite these limitations, arc discharge remains an important technique for the synthesis of high-quality CNTs for research and development applications. Ongoing research aims to optimize the process parameters and improve the scalability and reproducibility of the technique to enable large-scale production of CNTs for commercial applications. Laser ablation is a technique for CNT synthesis that involves the use of a highpower laser to vaporize a graphite target in an inert gas atmosphere, typically argon or helium. The vaporized carbon atoms then condense to form CNTs. Laser ablation can produce high-quality CNTs with a narrow size distribution and well-defined structures, making it particularly useful for producing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). However, the production rate of laser ablation is relatively low, and the technique is not scalable for large-scale production. Laser ablation produces CNTs with a significant number of defects, such as vacancies and structural distortions, which can limit their electrical and mechanical properties. This technique requires expensive equipment and consumes a large amount of energy, which can increase the cost of production. High-pressure carbon monoxide (HiPCO) synthesis is a technique for CNT synthesis that involves the reaction of carbon monoxide gas with a metal catalyst at high temperatures and pressures. The process typically involves the use of iron pentacarbonyl or cobalt carbonyl as the metal catalyst. In the HiPCO process, carbon monoxide gas is first introduced into a reactor vessel containing the metal catalyst, which is typically supported on a porous substrate such as alumina. The reactor is then heated to high temperatures, typically in the range of 800-1000 C, and pressurized to high pressures, typically in the range of 20-50 bar. Under these conditions, the carbon monoxide gas decomposes into carbon and oxygen, with the carbon atoms forming CNTs on the surface of the metal catalyst. The CNTs grow perpendicular to the surface of the catalyst, forming a dense forest of nanotubes. HiPCO synthesis can produce high-quality CNTs with a high yield, typically in the range of 70-80%, and a narrow size distribution. The process is also relatively scalable, with production rates of up to several grams per hour possible. However, careful control of the reaction conditions is required to prevent the formation of other carbon structures, such as amorphous carbon or fullerenes, which can reduce the yield and quality of the CNTs. Advancements in HiPCO synthesis are also focused on improving the purity of the CNTs produced. One approach is to use purified carbon monoxide gas to eliminate impurities that can affect the quality of the CNTs. Another approach is to use higher pressures and temperatures to promote the growth of longer, more uniform CNTs. HiPCO remains an important technique for producing high-quality CNTs for a range of applications, including electronics, energy storage, and composite materials. 
 Applications of Carbon Nanotubes The remarkable characteristics of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), including their huge surface area, high strength, and good electrical and thermal conductivity, have made them one of the most promising nanomaterials. These characteristics make CNTs appealing for a variety of applications in several industries, such as optics, mechanics, thermal management, and electronics. Due to their distinctive electrical characteristics, CNTs have been employed to create high-performance transistors and sensors in the field of electronics. Higher current densities and quicker switching rates have been demonstrated for CNT-based transistors in comparison to conventional silicon-based transistors. The excellent sensitivity and selectivity of CNT-based sensors make them perfect for a variety of sensing applications. Highstrength composites for application in aerospace, automotive, and sporting goods have been created in mechanics using CNTs. CNTs are a perfect reinforcing material for composites because of their tensile strength, which is more than 100 times greater than that of steel. Composites based on CNTs have demonstrated enhanced mechanical characteristics, such as higher stiffness, strength, and toughness. CNTs have been employed in thermal management to provide high-performance thermal interface materials for electronics and power equipment. CNTs are the perfect material for thermal management applications because of their outstanding thermal conductivity. In comparison to conventional materials, CNT-based thermal interface materials have demonstrated superior performance, including increased thermal conductivity and enhanced thermal stability. CNTs have been employed in optics to create very effective photodetectors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The applications are given in Fig.  4 .5. The great sensitivity and selectivity of CNT-based photodetectors make them perfect for a variety of sensing applications. In addition to having greater efficiency and longer lives than conventional LEDs, CNT-based LEDs have demonstrated superior performance. In spite of the overall special qualities and exciting potential uses of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), there are still several issues that must be resolved before their widespread adoption. The large-scale manufacture of CNTs with constant quality and purity, which is essential for their commercialization, is one of the biggest obstacles. Another problem is CNT toxicity, which is currently poorly known and needs further research  [30]  to be used safely in many applications. CNTs' high price is another key barrier that prevents their usage in several applications. Further developments in CNT synthesis and purification methods are anticipated to result in reduced manufacturing costs and improved quality control. Concerns about the toxicity of CNTs can be reduced by creating new procedures for their security management and disposal. More innovation and increased economic feasibility will be sparked by ongoing research and development in CNT-based applications, including in the disciplines of optics, mechanics, thermal management, and electronics  [31, 32] .

 Abstract The electronic charge transport property of novel ferrous oxide (FeO), cupric oxide (CuO), europium(II) oxide (EuO), and magnesium oxide (MgO) connected between the gold (Au) electrodes are probed using density functional theory (DFT) with nonequilibrium Green's functions formalism. The state of the art of this work is to study the electronic properties of XO (X ¼ Fe, Cu, Eu, and Mg) monowire in terms of the device density of states, transmission spectrum, and current voltage characteristics under various bias conditions. The density of states provides insight for the localization of charges in the valence band and conduction band. The transmission spectrum provides insight to transmission along the different monowire molecular device. It is evident that increasing the bias voltage leads to transition of current flow across various monowire molecular devices in the order of few microampere. The results of the present work provide a clear vision to enhance and control the current efficiently in the low order of magnitude in the XO (X ¼ Fe, Cu, Eu, and Mg) monowire devices. This study is useful to researchers as well as nanoelectronics device manufacturers. 
 Introduction The development of nanoscale technology in semiconductor materials plays a vital role in the development of nanoelectronics devices. With the continued trend in the miniaturization of electronic devices, the size and dimensions of materials have assumed profound significance. As materials gradually shrink down to the nanoscale, the surface to volume ratio increases and the importance of the surface heightens in low-dimensional materials. Moreover, quantum confinement effects come into play at the nanoscale, bringing forth unprecedented bonuses. The low dimensionality and modified properties of nanostructures such as nanoribbon, nanowire, and nanotubes are in focus among the scientific community  [1] . Molecular wires, which are usually understood as one-dimensional rod-like molecular structures made from single molecules or their assemblies, constitute one of the most important building blocks of molecular electronics. In this paper, ferrous oxide (FeO), cupric oxide (CuO), europium(II) oxide (EuO), and magnesium oxide (MgO) based molecular device is our choice of interested nanostructure material for the future nanoelectronics and optoelectronics devices application. Recently, cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoribbon, graphene, aluminium nitride (AlN), gallium arsenide (GaAs), aluminium phosphide (AlP), tungsten nitride (WN), gallium phosphide (GaP), cerium nitride (CeN), indium phosphide (InP), and gallium nitride (GaN) nanostructure with various geometrical morphologies, such as nanotube, nanosheet, and nanoribbon based molecular devices, have been investigated by a variety of methods. With this as objective, literature survey was conducted for binary semiconductor nanotube materials. Analogous to carbon nanotubes and graphene, many researchers have reported structural studies, and electronic properties of various binary compound nanotube materials such as cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoribbon  [2] , graphene nanoribbon  [3] , aluminium nitride (AlN) nanoribbon  [4] , gallium arsenide (GaAs) nanoribbon  [5] , aluminium phosphide (AlP) nanoribbon  [6] , tungsten nitride (WN) nanoribbon  [7] , gallium phosphide (GaP) nanoribbon  [8] , cerium nitride (CeN) nanoribbon  [9] , indium phosphide (InP) nanotube  [10] , gallium nitride (GaN) nanotube  [11] , and gallium phosphide GaP nanotube  [12] . From the literature survey, it is inferred that most of the reported works are in the study of molecular devices simulation of nanotube, nanosheet, and nanotube semiconductors. To the best of our knowledge, monowire based XO (X ¼ Fe, Cu, Eu, and Mg) molecular devices have not been investigated using density functional theory (DFT). The systematic computational study could be a pioneer step for the experimental characterization of molecular devices. The novel aspect of the present work is to study the XO (X ¼ Fe, Cu, Eu, and Mg) molecular device. 
 Materials and Methods In this present work, XO (X ¼ Fe, Cu, Eu, and Mg) monowire is attached between the gold electrodes as shown in Figs.  5 .1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4, respectively, and acts as scattering region. In the scattering region on each side, four layers of 17 gold (Au) atoms are present. In the proposed model, the XO (X ¼ Fe, Cu, Eu, and Mg) monowire scattering region is joined to the left and right gold electrodes. The density of states (DOS) and transport property of XO (X ¼ Fe, Cu, Eu, and Mg) monowire with different bias voltages are studied and reported. The computational calculations are performed with density functional theory (DFT) utilizing TranSIESTA module in SIESTA package. For electron-electron interactions, generalized gradient approximation (GGA) via Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange correlation functional is used throughout the calculation. The Brillouin zones are sampled with 3 Â 3 Â 50 k points in the present system.  To calculate the transport properties, the DFT technique with nonequilibrium Green's function formalism (NEGF) is used. The current through the molecular junction is calculated from the Landauer-Butiker formula  [13] , I V ð Þ ¼ G 0 þ1 À1 n E ð ÞT E, V ð ÞdE where G0 ¼ (2e2/h) is the quantum unit of conductance, n(E) is the distribution function, and T(E, V) is the transmission coefficient for electrons with the energy E and voltage V and h is Planck's constant. 
 Results and Discussion Device Density of States (DDOS) The electronic structures of XO (X ¼ Fe, Cu, Eu, and Mg) monowires have been investigated through the DOS spectrum. The Fermi energy (EF) is taken as 0 eV. Looking at the DDOS spectrum at 0 V, near the Fermi energy level (EF) in the valence band at À0.15 eV, a peak is observed. This means the localization of charges is seen in the valence band at 0 V, and on applying the potential to monowire the charge will easily transit to the conduction band. Interestingly, on applying a potential difference of 0.25 V between the left and right electrodes as depicted in figure below, density of charge between the energy interval changes, in this case the peak near EF in the valence band is not observed, and the bias voltage makes the electrons in the valence band move to the conduction band. Usually on increasing the bias voltage, the electrons in the valence band moves toward the conduction band, which forms the electron-hole pair. This gives rise to the peak amplitude in certain energy interval in the DDOS spectrum. 
 Transmission Spectrum The electronic properties can be explored using the zero-bias transmission spectrum. Figure shows the zero-bias transmission spectrum, even in the zero-bias condition due to the variation in the chemical potential between the left and right electrode, electronic transmission is seen along the monowire. In the valence band, the overlapping of orbitals gives rise to localization of charges at different energies. In the conduction band, almost constant transmission is noticed due to the variation in the chemical potential. Figure below refers the transmission spectrum of monowire at 0.25 V, the applied low-bias voltage modifies the electronic transmission from zero-bias condition, even though there is modification there is no significant change noticed, this implies the applied bias voltage is not sufficient to make a prominent transmission. 
 Conclusion In conclusion, the investigation on the transport property of XO (X ¼ Fe, Cu, Eu, and Mg) monowire is carried out using the first-principles calculation based on the DFT and NEGF. The DDOS for different applied voltages are studied and it is seen that most of the peaks are seen in the valence band. This refers to the localization of the charges in the valence band. The bias voltage will have a significant impact on the DOS of different monowires, due to the drift of the electron increased number of states is found in the valence band for higher applied voltages. The DOS provide insight for the electronic states for the applied voltages. The current through the monowire can be controlled with the applied voltages. The magnitude of the current is in the order of microampere, from which NiO monowire can be used to fine-tune the flow of current with the applied voltage. From this implication, the molecular device can be fabricated with XO (X ¼ Fe, Cu, Eu, and Mg) monowire which can control the current efficiently in nanoelectronics. 
 Introduction If a substance has at least one three-dimensional dimension or if its composition has been scaled down to the nanoscale (1-100 nm), it is referred to as a "nanomaterial." Nanostructured materials and nanostructured elements are the two categories into which nanomaterials are often divided. Nanostructured materials have extremely small structural dimensions. The exterior diameter of at least one structural component of nanostructured components is in the nanometer range when compared to other materials, nanoparticles. For instance, the 28th day measurement of the compressive and flexural strengths of cement mortar with nano-SiO 2 or Fe 2 O 3 is higher than that of the control group. Nano-Al 2 O 3 ceramics are more flexibly strong than microscale monolithic alumina ceramics. Mechanical properties describe how a material behaves mechanically under various external loads and environmental conditions. Mechanical characteristics vary among different materials. The mechanical characteristics of metals, which are considered classic materials, consist of ten elements: yield stress, brittleness, strength, plasticity, hardness, toughness, fatigue, strength, elasticity, ductility, and toughness. Most inorganic, nonmetallic materials lack characteristics like plasticity, toughness, elasticity, ductility, and other corresponding features. Aside from that, some organic materials are elastic and lack stiffness and brittleness. Nanomaterials' volume, surface, and quantum effects result in superior mechanical properties. When nanoparticles are applied to a common substance, the particles will partially or completely refine the grain, producing an intragranular or intergranular structure that will enhance the grain boundary and enhance the substance's mechanical qualities. For example, by adding 3% nano-SiO 2 , the compressive strength, bending strength, and splitting tensile strength of concrete can all be raised. By adding 3% nano-oil-palm empty fruit string filler, it is possible to significantly boost the tensile strength, elasticity, break strength, and impact strength of kenaf epoxy composites. Nanomaterials offer a wide range of potential applications since they possess exceptional qualities as well as singular qualities that are not present in macroscopic materials. However, further study needs to be done on these materials. To find potential technical and commercial uses for particular nanomaterials, we must first assess their mechanical properties. The evolution of nanoparticles from the early universe is depicted in the following diagram. 
 Important Aspects of Nanomaterials • The strange mechanical, electrical, optical, and magnetic characteristics of these materials have recently aroused a lot of interest. Here are a few examples. Because they are more ductile at high temperatures than coarse-grained ceramics, nanophase ceramics are of great interest. • Semiconductors with nanostructures have a wide variety of nonlinear optical properties. Quantum confinement events in semiconductor Q-particles can produce distinctive properties like luminescence in silicon powders and silicon germanium quantum dots as infrared optoelectronic devices. The window layers of solar cells are constructed from semiconductors with nanostructures. • Gas-tight materials, dense components, and porous coatings have all been created using metallic nanopowders. They are useful for metal-to-metal bonding, notably in the electronic industry, due to their ductility and cold welding capabilities. Factors Affecting the Mechanical Performance of Nanomaterials Properties of Nanomaterials  
 Mechanical Characteristics • Nanoparticle materials are the topic of much research into their mechanical behavior due to their fundamentally unique properties. The tensile hardening, creep, fatigue, and deformation behavior of nanocrystalline materials differ significantly from that of their bulk counterparts as a result of the intricate penetration of fault systems. The main reasons for diversity in the mechanical behavior of nanostructural materials are as follows: • The behavior of these defects under strain is significantly influenced by the extremely high atom fractions at triple junctions and grain boundaries. In addition to affecting dislocation dynamics for mechanical properties and material design, grain size also affects dislocation stability. Since dislocations are the primary deformation mechanisms that determine the mechanical properties of coarsegrained materials, the plastic deformation mode of nanoparticles may be very different from that of coarse-grained materials. For the aforementioned causes, alternative deformation mechanisms, such as grain boundary migration or sliding, crack growth, etc., become important. • The degree of porosity in nanomaterials, which can be crucial, is significantly influenced by the processing method, as in the case of mechanically alloyed specimens. Even after agglomeration, the pore size may be smaller than or equal to the grain size. Following are a few of the odd mechanical characteristics that were originally noted for nanostructural materials: • Researchers discovered that materials with typical grain sizes had 30-50% lower elastic moduli. Almost all materials display very high values for their tensile and compressive strengths at the nanoscale scale. Nanocrystalline metals have hardness levels that are up to seven times greater than conventional coarse-grained metals. • Nanoscale multilayers constructed of metallic or ceramic materials have shown extremely great toughness. The Hall-Petch slope is negative below a threshold particle size, demonstrating that as grain size grows in the nanoscale grain size domain, hardness decreases. 
 Intensity and Abrasiveness It has long been known that materials with typical grain sizes (grain diameters d > 1 m) differ in their hardness and strength depending on their grain size. It is common knowledge that grain boundaries stop dislocation motion, strengthening a material. As grain size reduces, there is an increase in the surface area of grain boundaries per unit volume, which might result in a hardening and strengthening of the material. It has been demonstrated that for ductile polycrystalline materials, the grain size dependence of the flow stress at any plastic strain up to ductile fracture may be described by a semiempirical relationship known as the Hall-Petch equation. 
 Freestanding Flexibility and Strain Stiffening It is well known that for microcrystalline materials, a reduction in grain size increases both ductility and strength. Perhaps the only mechanism that can increase a material's toughness, ductility, and hardness is grain size strengthening. As grain size reduces, crack deflections at grain junctions may enhance the constraint on crack propagation, increasing the material's fracture toughness and ductility. When GB/triple junction migration is a more dominant mechanism of plastic deformation than dislocation, especially as the grain size approaches close to the limit of instability of dislocations, it can result in early GB/triple junction crack interaction and crack propagation due to GB sliding even at low temperatures. As the grain size is reduced to nanocrystalline proportions, one would expect an improvement in the material's ductility. However, it is usually mentioned that ultrafine-grained materials are more ductile than nanocrystalline ones. Koch identified three major sources of limited ductility in nanocrystalline materials: • Parsing related artifacts (e.g., nasal passages) • Strain rate unpredictability • Shear fragility or the initiation of cracks Due to the synthesis process, bulk nanocrystalline specimens created for tensile testing typically include a high percentage of porosities and other artifacts. Bulk nanostructured materials are difficult to prepare without these artifacts due to the consolidation of 60 nanoscience and technology. Studies in both theory and experimentation point to the existence of three regimes. Work hardening and unit dislocations control plasticity in the grain size d > 1 m domain. The fundamental deformation process in the smallest grain size domain (d 10 nm) is grain boundary shear, which exhibits little intragranular dislocation activity. Ordinarily, uniform tensile elongation cannot be supported in materials with intermediate grain size regimes (10 nm to 1 m), which, in comparison to nanocrystalline and ultrafine-grained materials, are less well understood. In contrast to the behavior of coarse-grained polycrystalline metal, they do not exhibit strain hardening beyond an initial period of rapid strain hardening within a small plastic strain regime (1-3%). This is because dynamic recovery and annihilation at grain boundaries have saturated the dislocation density in nanocrystalline materials. These materials show work hardening after being subjected to large additional pressures. Dynamic recovery at room temperature is also typical for nanocrystalline materials. With decreasing metal grain size, many research teams have shown both an increase and a decrease in strain rate sensitivity. Iron, which generally exhibits strain rate sensitivity with a strain rate exponent m in the order of 0.04, loses value and drops to 0.004 when the grain size is 80 nm. 
 Nature in Superplastic and Crawlers Creep If conservative dislocation motionthat is, motionis the primary factor that determines creep. If conservative dislocation motion, that is, motion, has a major role in determining creep. Nanocrystalline materials have better creep behavior than materials with traditional grain sizes, as well as better glide paths for the dislocations. However, this only happens when the stress is high enough to approach the materials' yield stress, at which point the condition resembles a tensile test. However, the primary mechanism controlling grain size is in the nanoscale range, i.e., where more high diffusivity routes are available. This is because the nanometer region is under lower stress and at higher temperatures. But grain boundary diffusion alone is not necessarily sufficient to explain the creep behavior of nanocrystalline materials. The creep speeds of nanocrystalline materials are frequently lower in reality than those that can be predicted solely from the diffusion mechanism along grain boundaries. For instance, adding yttrium oxide to a titanium oxide reduces grain size increase during the test. A recent study found that the creep rates of doped titanium oxide were lower than those of the nondoped, nonstabilized grain titanium oxide at temperatures that are typically relatively low for that material (973 and 1073 K). This defies assumptions at first. Due to the high volume percentage of grain boundaries and the close proximity of diffusion sites, rapid creep is anticipated in nanophase materials. Rapid grain-tograin diffusion in nanophase metals encourages sintering and neck formation as well as increased creep rates, which can be seen even at temperatures near to room temperature. Because free surfaces have a tendency to boost diffusion rates in comparison to grain boundary rates, the degree of porosity in nanophase materials may have an impact on creep rates. The Ashby-Verral model, which is based on the idea of grain boundary sliding with diffusional flow, can explain creep behavior in nanophase ceramics. Diffusional flow occurs at the boundary areas when a system of equiaxed grains is subjected to a compressive force. As a result, the external shape changes, yet the grains continue to be equiaxed, maintain their size, and slide over one another at the interfaces due to diffusional accommodation. Diffusion can assist in filling interface cracks when they form. 
 Fracture and Toughness The fracture strength of a material, not the yield strength, represents a significant constraint in practical applications. Through this technique, a material can give and maintain itself while under stress. Grain boundaries and behavioral dislocation, which prolong plasticity, make this conceivable. The challenge for real-world applications is that a material that has been treated to increase strength might also fail unexpectedly in a brittle manner with limited plasticity. Increases in toughness and a lower brittle-to-ductile transition temperature can be obtained by shrinking the grains of microstructured materials. Nanomaterials also fall under this heading. However, when intragranular cracking gave way to intergranular fracture, it was shown that toughness declined with decreasing grain size in brittle intermetallics like TiAl (grain size from 100 nm to 70 m). Depending on the grain size, the mechanical failure that limits ductility can be viewed as the competition between dislocations and the emergence or propagation of cracks. The considerable increase in yield stress observed in nanomaterials, on the other hand, raises the prospect that fracture stress may be lower than yield stress and result in a complete lack of ductility. 
 Corrosion Characteristics According to several researches, the considerable changes in characteristics of nanocrystalline alloys are caused by the high density of grain boundaries. When compared to conventional materials, the corrosion examination of nanocrystalline materials revealed a more intense active anodic dissolution. The small grain size, which causes a higher percentage of high-energy grain boundary flaws in the material, can be used to explain the difference in behavior. As favored anodic dissolution sites, such high-energy grain boundary locations can lead to enhanced corrosion rates for nanocrystalline alloys. Higher fault densities, though, are not always bad. Because they are simple pathways, grain boundaries can promote increased surface diffusion coefficients, which lead to the early production of a well-adherent and thick oxide layer and passivate the surface. Some writers demonstrated that the thickness of the passive film was unaffected by the grain size. Nanocrystalline Ni with grain diameters of 500 and 20 nm showed higher passive current densities in electrochemical polarization tests than standard Ni with coarser grains. The passive film on these materials underwent XPS analysis, and the passive film thickness between the nanocrystalline and conventional materials was not different. But compared to passive films on ordinary Ni, those on nanocrystalline specimens had more flaws. Decreased grain size was found to increase the defect density of the film, which made it simpler for Ni cation to diffuse through more defective film and resulted in greater current densities for the nanocrystalline specimens in the passive potential range. It was also demonstrated that, when the grain size is in the nanoscale range, the number of atoms at the grain boundaries equals the number of atoms inside the grains. As the grain boundary area grows, the quantity of contaminants per unit grain boundary decreases in nanomaterials compared to materials with bigger grains and the same bulk impurity concentrations. Due to the increased purity of the grain boundaries, nanoparticles have been demonstrated to exhibit more uniform corrosion morphology and stronger intergranular corrosion resistance than materials with larger grains. Another factor that affects how corrosion behaves in nanocrystalline materials is the coating's porosity. If the coating is less porous in nature, it will have better corrosion resistance. 
 Electrical Characteristics Nanomaterials' huge grain boundary (surface) area allows them to store more electrical energy than bulk materials. The charge carrying density and energy band structure of nanomaterials can be altered significantly differently from their bulk size, which will alter the materials' electrical characteristics. The introduction of an electric field or the passage of current in nanoscale can change an optical absorption band. 
 Optical Characteristics Nanodevices enable effective energy and charge transfer at nanoscale distances due to the quantum confinement of electrical carriers within nanoparticles. By carefully adjusting the crystal dimensions, one can finely alter the linear and nonlinear optical characteristics of nanomaterials. When the surface plasmon size is decreased, the color of the nanomaterial is altered. An organic oscillation of the electron plasma inside a specific nanosphere is known as a surface plasmon. 
 Magnetic Characteristics Coercivity and saturation magnetization readings are used to gauge a magnet's power. These values rise when the grains' specific surface area (surface area per unit volume) and grain. 
 Thermal Characteristics Due to photon confinement and quantization, photon transport inside the materials will be considerably altered, changing their thermal properties. For instance, compared to bulk silicon, silicon nanowires have substantially lower thermal conductivities. The materials' thermal conductivity would be decreased by nanomaterial architectures with high contact densities. The lowering of thermal conductivities is thought to be caused by a number of factors, including interfacial roughness, photon bandgaps, dispersion mismatch, doping, structural flaws, processing conditions, etc. Application Relevant to the Mechanical Properties of Nanoparticle  
 Nanoparticles Used as Solvents To lessen wear and friction, lubrication is the interposition of a solid, liquid, or gaseous substance between the surfaces of two materials in contact. Every commercially available lubricant has additives that improve the oil's viscosity, pressure resistance, corrosion resistance, wear reduction, and ability to reduce friction and wear. The usage of nanoparticles as additives is common. Since the advent of nanotechnology, the use of nanoparticles as lubricant additives to produce better tribological qualities has drawn a lot of attention. How can a nanoparticle be made?  
 Lubricant Mechanism Bearing-ball effect: The spherical nanoparticles transform the friction phenomena from a sliding process to a combination of sliding and rolling friction by acting as nanometric ball bearings that roll between the shearing surfaces. Forming protective films: On the surface, the nanoparticles create a thin layer of protection. Numerous studies demonstrate that this technique of protective coating development reduces both friction and wear. Mending effect or self-healing effect: According to this mechanism, nanoparticles accumulate on the surfaces that interact and make up for the mass that is lost. The lubricating oil's nanoparticles have the capacity to fill the scars and grooves left by friction surfaces. EDX analysis has been used by the majority of studies reporting the mending effect to support the deposition of nanoparticles. Polishing effect: The pending effect is thought to be observed when the lubricating surface's roughness is decreased through abrasion helped by nanoparticles. In certain research, the polishing effect is also referred to as the smoothing effect. Less friction and hence less wear would result from a smoother surface. 
 Effect of Tribo-Test Type, Concentration, and Nanoparticle Shape, Size, and Surface Nanoparticles can be any shape, including platelets, spherical solids, spherical multilayered particles, and hollow core nanoparticles. The contact forces between interacting surfaces can be used to choose a nanoparticle's form. Most research pertaining to the usage of nanolubricants have a substantially greater participation rate for spherical nanoparticles. 
 Size of nanoparticles: The tribological properties of nanoparticles are influenced by their intrinsic mechanical and physicochemical qualities, which are determined by their size. In some environments, the hardness increases as the size of the nanoparticle decreases. Placed between these shears are nanoparticles that scratch and indent the surfaces because they are harder than the shearing surfaces. Therefore, while designing nanoparticle-based lubrication systems, it is important to take into account the size-induced differences in nanoparticle hardness. The ratio of the root mean square roughness of the lubricated surface to the radius of the nanoparticles is a crucial factor when choosing the appropriate nanoparticle size. Asperities will not deposit on the contact zone if the nanoparticle size is too large compared to the distance between them, which will result in inadequate lubrication. Surface functionalization: In the context of nanoparticle-based lubricant formulations, surface functionalization serves two distinct roles: It controls the colloidal stability of nanoparticle dispersion and improves the lubricity of the nanoparticles' outermost layers. Nanoparticle concentration: Base oil's tribological properties are significantly influenced by the quantity of nanoparticles present in it. To lessen wear and friction, the proper quantity of nanoparticles is required. Nature of tribo-testing: In contrast to dissolved additives, the mechanics of the rubbing contact and the presence of separating oil layers also play a significant role in the augmentation of rubbing surfaces with nanoparticles. Since the tribological efficiency of nanolubricants is probably quite system specific, very diverse performances are probably going to be seen under various test scenarios. 
 Coating with Nanoparticle Coatings: Nanoscale particle coatings are produced by nanoparticle deposition techniques in very uniform, conformal surfaces. For instance, Modumental developed a nanocoating method in 2015 that boosts steel's strength by up to ten times while also making it more corrosion resistant. Nanoengineered polymers: Manufacturers have access to thousands of hybrid polymer blends and nanoengineered polymers. Usually to boost strength, temperature, and corrosion resistance, nanoparticles are incorporated into the polymer at extremely precise quantities and orientations. Lubricant coatings: Nanoparticles can be designed to have lubricity and resistance to wear. These are frequently coated on solid surfaces or dissolved in lubricating liquids like oil. DNA-based structure: Human DNA can be used to create the frameworks for mechanical buildings and gadgets. For instance, according to Nanowork, a top-tier nanotechnology portal, "DNA molecules can serve as precisely controllable and programmable scaffolding for organizing functional nanomaterials in the design, production, and characterization of nanometer-scale electrical devices and sensors." 
 Nanoparticles in Nanofabrication New and expanding opportunities to synthesize and market innovative materials at the nanoscale are made possible by advances in nanotechnology. These resources are essential for advancing advanced manufacturing, enhancing product performance, and developing brand-new, cutting-edge products that improve manufacturing. Nanomachines: From chemical and biological molecules, researchers have successfully created functional nanomaterials, nanorobots, and nanomachines. These molecules self-assemble into programmable, functional machines at the nanoscale. They have enormous potential in the realm of medicine since they are small enough to pass through the circulatory system. For instance, they could function as microscopic robots that hunt down and kill cancer tumors by penetrating the tumor and discharging tiny medication payloads. 
 Selected Applications of Nanotechnology Including Nanoparticles (Source from Braincart website) Numerous uses for nanotechnology and nanomaterials can be found in the energy industry. Because of their superior chemical, physical, and mechanical capabilities as well as their extraordinary formability, nanomaterials clearly perform better than their traditional equivalents. Energy sectors: Far more cutting-edge nanotechnology is connected to energy conversion, storage, improvements in manufacturing through lower material and process rates, energy savings, and increasing renewable energy sources. The most cutting-edge applications of nanotechnology include energy storage. Better insulation systems, the use of more energy-efficient lighting or combustion systems, and the use of lighter and stronger materials in the transportation industry can all reduce energy usage. Quantum caged atoms (QCAs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are two nanotechnological methods that have the potential to significantly reduce the amount of energy needed for lighting. Even with layers of various semiconductors stacked together to absorb light at various energies, solar cells can only manage to use about 40% of the sun's energy. The efficiency of light conversion may be enhanced by using nanotechnology and nanostructures with a range of bandgaps. 
 Heavy Industries An Inevitable Use of Nanotechnology Will Be in Heavy Industries Aerospace: Manufacturers of aircraft will greatly gain from lighter, stronger aircraft, which will improve performance; spacecraft would also benefit where weight is a significant element. The size of the equipment might be decreased with the use of nanotechnology, which would cut down on the fuel needed to transport it on an aeroplane. Catalysis: Fuel cells, catalytic converters, and photocatalytic devices are just a few of the technologies that could use nanoparticles for catalysis. Novel "nanomaterials" are produced by the synthesis, and in the long run, advanced techniques like "self-assembly" will make it possible to develop energy-saving measures. Due to their extremely high surface area, platinum nanoparticles are currently being examined for the development of the next generation of vehicle catalytic converters. Automobile industry: There are more internal parts in modern cars. These components are more heat and wear resistant and durable. Due to incomplete gas combustion, the car engine wastes fuel and increases population. Sparkplugs are now likely to be heavily influenced by nanotechnology. Nanomaterials are being examined for use in spark plugs because they are tougher, stronger, and more resistant to wear and erosion. Fuel tanks: It has been shown that the addition of nanoclay can lessen solvent transmission through polymers like polyamides. According to the data that is currently available, adding nanoclay filler significantly reduces the amount of fuel that is transmitted via polyamide (6/66 polymers). As a result, these materials are currently attracting interest as automobile fuel tank and gasoline line components. The fact that the lowered fuel transfer characteristics come with a sizable material cost reduction is also intriguing for this kind of application. Coatings: The term "nanocoating" describes the act of covering a substance with a layer that is only a few nanometers thick or a nanoscaled object. By combining two or more nanometer-sized substances into nanocomposites, nanocoating creates materials that typically have improved or targeted qualities as a result of the components' combined properties and/or structuring effects. Steel coating: The physical characteristics of steel are improved by nanotechnology; fatigue or structural failure of steel is caused by cyclic loading. Carbon nanotube cables are stronger than steel cables and can be used to build structures for less money. Food coating: By applying antimicrobial substances directly to the coated film's surface, a nanocomposite coating technique could enhance food packaging. Additionally, they can lessen oxygen transport rate while enhancing mechanical and thermal resistance qualities. In order to use chemical and biological substances for food sensing, research is being done to employ nanotechnology in this direction. Glass coatings and other areas: Nanotechnology is also applied to glass. Glazing is coated with TiO 2 nanoparticles because of their sterilizing and antifouling qualities. Due to its hydrophobic properties, TiO 2 can draw rainfall, which can wash the dirt particles away. Glass is made of silica nanoparticles with a clear instrument layer sandwiched between glass panels. When heated, the glass transforms into an opaque, rigid fire shield. Fire retardation: According to Gilman, polymers with a few weight percent of nanoparticle clay have significantly increased their fire resistance. The PNC now has better thermal characteristics. Burning occurs at a far slower rate, and melting and dripping are both delayed. The addition of flake-like clay nanoparticles decreases air diffusion into the polymer as well as the diffusion of volatiles (fuel) from the polymer composition to the burning surface. Corrosion protection: Typically, a surface coating is used to protect metals and alloys from corrosion. This coating must be resistant to both chemical assault and mechanical damage (scratching, impact, and abrasion) (slats, acids, bases, and solvents). If the metal that needs to be safeguarded has a high coefficient of thermal expansion, it shouldn't be damaged (cracked) either. Due to its greater hardness and enhanced flexibility, PNCs have improved scratch and abrasion resistance. Sports: Soccer, football, and baseball are just a few of the sports that could benefit from nanotechnology. To make new sporting shoes (and athletes) speedier, lighter materials may be used in the construction of the shoes. Carbon nanotubes are used in baseballs that are already on the market to strengthen the resin and, allegedly, improve performance by making the ball lighter.  
 Future Potential Information technology, military, medical, transportation, energy, environmental research, telecommunications, and electronics are just a few of the manufacturing areas that are being revolutionized by nanotechnology and nanomanufacturing. For applications in smart phone and e-reader displays, semiconductor nanomembranes have been used to create flexible electronics, according to NNI. Making electronics that are lightweight, nonbrittle, flat, flexible, and highly efficient opens the door to a plethora of smart goods. However, intelligence is dependent on data; a device is only as intelligent as the input from sensors. The monitoring of machinery and equipment will continue to be improved by nanoscale sensors and devices to increase productivity and efficiencythe core of the Internet of Things (IoT). NNI collaborates with nearly 100 research centers and user facilities across the nation to give researchers access to the workspaces, specialized tools, and skilled personnel they need to create nanotechnology applications and related manufacturing processes. This helps to advance R&D in nanomanufacturing. 
 Conclusion The world of materials is being transformed by nanotechnology. It has a significant influence on the creation of a new generation of composites with improved functioning and numerous applications. Researchers may better understand and make use of the unique chemical and material principles behind these cutting-edge polymer nanocomposites with the help of data on production, characterization, and application. Nanocomposites are being used in many important industrial domains, but there are still significant technological and financial obstacles preventing their widespread commercialization. These include ways to achieve and measure nanofiller dispersion and exfoliation in the polymer matrix, impact performance, and complicated formulation connections.

 Introduction Perovskite materials are a group of materials which has a specific crystal structure that is is releated to the perovskite materials. The term pervoskites was first introduced in 1839 which was discovered in the Ural Mountains of Russia by Gustav Rose and later named by Russian mineralogist L. A. Perovski  [1] . The general chemical formula for perovskites is ABX 3 , where A and B are two positively charged ions which are known as cations and X is known as anion (negatively charged ion). The atom "A" is generally larger than the "B" atoms. The A-site is typically occupied by larger cations, such as alkali or alkaline earth metals which have 12-fold cuboctahedral coordination, while the B-site is occupied by smaller cations which has sixfold coordination, and is occupied with transition metals. The X-site is occupied by an anion, such as oxygen or halogens. Additional perovskite forms may exist where either/both the A and B sites have a configuration of A1 xÀ1 A2 x and/or B1 yÀ1 B2 y and the X may deviate from the ideal coordination configuration as ions within the A and B sites undergo changes in their oxidation states  [2] . The perovskite materials have received a lot of attention in recent years due to their potential applications in a wide range of technologies, including solar cells, LEDs, lasers, and photodetectors. In particular, perovskite solar cells have shown great promise in achieving high-power conversion efficiencies at low cost  [3] . The pervoskite materials can be classified into several categories based on their composition, crystal structure, and physical properties. There are different types of perovskite materials including (i) inorganic pervoskites  [4] , (ii) organic hybrid perovskites  [5] , (iii) double perovskites  [6] , (iv) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites  [7] , (v) brownmillerite perovskites  [8] , and (vi) relaxer perovskites  [9] . All the pervoskites are discussed in details as under. 
 Classifications of Perovskite Materials 
 Inorganic Perovskites During the nineteenth century, the discovery of inorganic perovskites was introduced, when the Russian mineralogist Lev A. Perovskite first described a mineral with the composition calcium titanium oxide (CaTiO 3 ) mineral which has cubic crystal structure. Inorganic perovskites are a group of materials that contain only inorganic elements and have a perovskite crystal structure. The most commonly studied inorganic perovskites are based on lead and halides, such as methylammonium lead iodide (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ), but other combinations of cations and anions can be used to synthesize inorganic perovskites with different properties  [4] . The general formula for inorganic perovskite is ABX 3 , where A and B is the cations in which "A" is located at the center of the unit cell, "B" cation is located at the face-centered of the unit cell, and X is the anion which is located at the corners and crystal structure is characterized by the presence of corner-sharing BX 6 octahedral. These octahedral share corners with each other, creating a three-dimensional network. The A cation occupies the center of the octahedral, and this arrangement of octahedral and A cations creates a threedimensional framework with a large open space. The B cation is surrounded by six X anions in octahedral coordination geometry, forming a three-dimensional network. The A cation occupies the interstitial spaces between the B-X octahedral, providing structural stability and a 12-fold coordination with the anions, while the B-site cations are in sixfold coordination  [9] . The colors of inorganic perovskites include black, brown, gray, orange, and yellow. In recent years, inorganic perovskites have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in the field of optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors. 
 Organic Perovskites The organic perovskites, also known as hybrid perovskites, is a class of perovskite materials. The organic perovskites have similar crystal structure to that of inorganic perovskites but with organic molecules incorporated into their structure. The crystal structure of organic perovskites consists of a three-dimensional network of cornersharing BX 6 octahedral, where B represents the metal cation and X represents the halide anion, surrounded by organic cations. Organic perovskites typically consist of a metal halide framework, such as lead halides, and organic cations, such as methylammonium (MA, CH 3 NH 3+ ) or formamidinium (FA, CH(NH 2 ) 2+ )  [5] . The organic cations are typically small, positively charged molecules that fit into the spaces between the BX 6 octahedra, forming a continuous network that stabilizes the crystal structure. These types of perovskites have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their remarkable optoelectronic properties, which make them highly suitable for use in a range of applications, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors. Organic perovskite solar cells, in particular, have gained a lot of attention because they offer high power conversion efficiency at a low cost  [5] . Despite their impressive properties, organic perovskites are still subject to stability issues, such as degradation in the presence of moisture and heat. However, significant progress has been made in recent years to address these challenges, and researchers continue to explore new ways to improve the stability and performance of organic perovskites  [10] . 
 Hybrid Perovskites In 1839, the first perovskite structure discovered by "Lev Perovski" was based on calcium titanate (CaTiO 3 ), which is a type of oxide-based perovskite compound. A hybrid perovskite is a type of perovskite that consists of both organic and inorganic components that have crystalline structure with the general formula ABX 3 , where A and B are the inorganic metal cation and X represents the halides  [6] . Therefore, the most commonly used inorganic cations are lead (Pb) and tin (Sn) and the halide anions are chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), or iodine (I). The organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites have several unique properties which is highly dependent upon the composition and structure of the material such as high absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility, and tuning of energy bandgap. By varying the type and ratio of the organic and inorganic components, the organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites have shown a great interest in the field of electronic and optoelectronic applications such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors  [11] . Despite of various applications, the organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites have some challenges such as stability issues related to their sensitivity to moisture and heat. 
 Double Perovskites Double perovskites are a type of perovskite material. The double perovskites have a more complex crystal structure than the simple perovskite structure. The chemical formula for double perovskite is A 2 BB 0 O 6 , where A represents an alkali metal or rare earth metal cation, B and B 0 are transition metal cations, and O is oxygen. The occupancy of two transition metal cations in the crystallographic sites within the structure leads to the name "double perovskite." The crystal structure of double perovskites consists of a three-dimensional network of corner sharing octahedral, with two types of transition metal cations occupying alternate octahedral sites  [7] . The A-site cation is located in the center of the cube formed by the octahedral. The crystal structure can be viewed as a face-centered cubic lattice of the B-site cations, with the A-site and B 0 -site cations occupying the octahedral sites. Due to the interesting structure in the pervoskites, it has a variety of different interesting applications in the field of electronic, magnetic, catalysts, spintronics, and quantum computing  [12] . 
 Ruddlesden-Popper Perovskites Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite is a class of perovskite materials. During 1957, the first series of various Ruddlesden-Popper pervoskites Sr 2 TiO 4 , Ca 2 MnO 4 , and SrLaAlO 4 have been confirmed by the scientists J. Ruddlesden and P. Popper. The general formula for Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite is A nþ1 BnO 3nþ1 , where A represents the cation which is made up of rare earth or alkali metal, B be the transition metal cation, and n is an integer that determines the number of perovskite-like layers in the crystal structure. The n can range from 2 to infinity, although the most commonly studied Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites have n ¼ 2, 3, or 4 and these layers have been separated by a rock salt-type layer of cations and anions  [8] . Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites can be synthesized using a variety of methods, including solution-phase synthesis, vapor-phase synthesis, and sol-gel synthesis. However, their synthesis can be more challenging than simple perovskites due to the layered structure and the need to control the stoichiometry of the material. These perovskites have shown multiple interesting properties that make researchers attractive for various applications such as solar cell, thermoelectric, colossal magnetoresistance, superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and catalysis  [13] . 
 Brownmillerite Perovskites Brownmillerite perovskite is a type of perovskite material which has the chemical formula of A 2 B 2 O 5 , where A and B are the cations. The crystal structure of brownmillerite perovskites is more complex than the simple perovskite structure, with a distorted cubic or orthorhombic lattice. In 1932, the Brownmillerite perovskites were discovered by H. Brownmiller. These types of material have interesting properties, such as high ionic conductivity, electronic conductivity, and catalytic activity  [9] . Due to their unique properties, these materials have potential applications in solid oxide fuel cells, oxygen membranes, and as catalysts in various chemical reactions. These pervoskites have been synthesized by a variety of methods, including solid-state reactions, hydrothermal synthesis, and sol-gel methods. Although Brownmillerite perovskites have many promising properties and potential applications, there are also some challenges associated with their synthesis and use. Some of these challenges are synthesis, stability, and cost  [14] . 
 Relaxer Perovskites The relaxer perovskite refers to a type of perovskite material that exhibits a unique property called relaxor ferroelectricity. This type of pervoskites is commonly found in materials science and solid-state physics. The crystal structure of relaxor perovskites have the same crystal structure as regular perovskites, which is composed of an A-site cation, a B-site cation, and an oxygen anion. In relaxor perovskites, the B-site cation is often a transition metal, such as titanium or niobium, and the A-site cation is often a rare earth element, such as lanthanum or yttrium  [9] . The only difference between regular and relaxor pervoskites are the regular perovskites have a well-ordered crystal structure, while the relaxor perovskites have a disordered structure that lacks long-range order. The disordered structure of relaxor perovskites is due to the presence of two types of cations at the B-site, which are randomly distributed throughout the crystal lattice. These cations have different charges and sizes, which lead to a complex and disordered arrangement. This disorder is known as chemical short-range order, and it is a characteristic feature of relaxor perovskites, which make the pervoskites highly tunable and responsive to external stimuli, such as electric fields or temperature changes. The disordered structure of relaxor perovskites is important for their unique properties, such as their high piezoelectric response and their ability to exhibit ferroelectricity at a wide range of temperatures. However, it also makes them difficult to study and to model using traditional crystallographic methods  [15] . Despite the various changes, there are various challenges in relaxor pervoskites such as, stability, synthesis, toxicity, and scability.

This approach can help reduce energy costs and carbon emissions associated with buildings. • Space applications: Perovskite solar cells can be used in space applications due to their high efficiency and lightweight design. They can be used to power satellites, spacecraft, and other space exploration missions. Hence, overall, the perovskite solar cells have a wide range of applications, and their potential for high efficiency, low cost, and ease of fabrication makes them an attractive option for the future of renewable energy  [22] . 2.

Here are some potential applications of perovskite materials in fuel cells: • Proton-conducting membranes: Perovskite materials can be used as protonconducting membranes in fuel cells. These membranes are essential for separating the anode and cathode compartments in the fuel cell, while allowing the flow of protons from the anode to the cathode  [13] . Perovskite materials such as BaZrO 3 , BaCeO 3 , and SrCeO 3 have been studied as potential proton-conducting materials due to their high proton conductivity and thermal stability. • Electrodes: Perovskite materials can also be used as electrodes in fuel cells. These materials can act as both anode and cathode electrodes, and have been shown to exhibit good electrochemical performance  [17] .

Memory devices: Perovskite materials have emerged as a promising class of materials for next-generation memory devices due to their unique electronic, optical, and structural properties  [24] . Perovskite materials have several potential applications in next-generation memory devices due to their unique electronic and optical properties. Some of the applications of perovskite materials in memory devices are: • Phase change memory (PCM): Perovskite materials can be used as a highcapacity storage medium for PCM. PCM is a type of nonvolatile memory that uses materials that can switch between two stable states, amorphous and crystalline, to store information. Perovskite materials have been found to exhibit excellent phase change properties, including high thermal stability, high speed, and low power consumption, making them promising candidates for PCM. • Resistive random access memory (RRAM): Perovskite materials have also been investigated for their potential use in RRAM devices. RRAM is a type of nonvolatile memory that stores data by changing the resistance of a thin film of material. Perovskite materials have been shown to exhibit resistive switching behavior, which makes them suitable for use in RRAM devices. • Ferroelectric memory: Perovskite materials have been found to exhibit ferroelectric behavior, making them promising candidates for ferroelectric memory applications. Ferroelectric materials exhibit a permanent electric polarization that can be reversed by an electric field, making them useful for nonvolatile memory. • Optoelectronic memory: Perovskite materials have been explored for use in optoelectronic memory devices, which can store and process data using light instead of electrical signals. Perovskite materials have unique optical properties, including high absorption coefficients and long carrier lifetimes, which make them attractive for use in optoelectronic memory devices. 4.

 Introduction The field of spintronics emerged from discoveries in the 1980s concerning spindependent electron transport phenomena in solid-state devices  [1] . One of the key discoveries that led to the development of spintronics was the observation of spinpolarized electron injection from a ferromagnetic metal to a normal metal by  Johnson and Silsbee in 1985 [2] . This effect, known as spin injection, involves the transfer of electrons from a ferromagnetic material to a nonmagnetic material while preserving their spin polarization  [3] . This discovery was followed by other important developments in the field of spintronics, including the observation of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) by Albert  Fert and Peter Grünberg in 1988 [4] . GMR is a phenomenon where the resistance of a material changes in the presence of an external magnetic field, and it is the basis for magnetic read heads used in hard disk drives. Since then, the field of spintronics has expanded rapidly, and it has led to the development of a wide range of spin-based devices, including spin valves  [5] , magnetic tunnel junctions  [6] , and spin transistors  [7] . Spintronics are also known as magnetoelectronic (spin electronics) devices  [8] . Spintronics is an emerging technology that is based on the spin of electrons. The spintronic devices exploits both the intrinsic spin of electrons and their associated magnetic moments to encode and manipulate the data or information  [9] . While the traditional electronics rely on the charge of electrons to encode and transmit information  [10] . Spintronics fundamentally differs from traditional electronics in that it uses the spin of electrons as an additional degree of freedom  [11] . In traditional electronics, information is stored and processed based on the presence or absence of electrical charges, which can have significant implications for the efficiency of data storage and transfer. One of the main advantages of spintronics is that it allows faster and more efficient data transfer and storage than traditional electronics  [12] . Hence, the spin-based devices can operate at lower energy levels, and the spin of electrons can be controlled more easily and quickly than their charge. Additionally, spin-based devices can also store information for longer periods of time without the need for continuous power, making them more energy efficient and potentially reducing the need for active cooling and have potential applications in the field of magnetic sensing, data storage, and quantum computing-based devices  [10] . The spintronic systems can be realized in a variety of materials, including metals  [9] , insulators  [13] , and magnetic materials  [14] , dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS)  [15] , and Heusler alloys  [16] . Dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS) are semiconductors doped with a small concentration of magnetic ions (manganese or iron), which can interact with the electrons in the semiconductor to create a spinpolarized current, which can be used for computing, and spin-based electronics  [17] . DMS materials have potential applications in the spin-based transistors, lasers, and memory devices  [18] . Whereas the "Heusler alloys" are intermetallic compounds that exhibit a variety of magnetic, electrical, and structural properties and have interest in spintronics due to exhibit half-metallic behavior such as one spin channel is metallic and the other is insulating, and it is desirable to have a high spin polarization in the current  [19] . Such type of alloys can be useful for spin-based electronics and computing  [20] . Both "DMS" and "Heusler alloys" can be used further in the fields of quantum computing and neuromorphic computing  [21] . The quantum computing involves the properties of quantum systems, such as electron spins and spin qubits  [22]  and the neuromorphic computing involves computing systems that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. DMS and Heusler alloys have potential applications in creating artificial synapses and neurons for use in neuromorphic computing  [23] . Spintronics has also enabled the development of new technologies for data storage and transfer, such as magnetic logic, and magnetic computing devices, which show potential applications to replace traditional memory technologies. Figure  8 .1 shows the spin-based devices. 
 Magnetic Logic Devices Magnetic logic devices are a type of spintronic device that uses the magnetic state of materials to perform logical operations, rather than electrical signals  [5] . These devices have the potential to offer advantages such as nonvolatility, low power consumption, and radiation hardness  [24] . The magnetic logic devices have the potential to offer new and improved capabilities in areas such as data storage, signal processing, and computation, and are an active area of research in the field of spintronics. There are several types of magnetic logic devices that have been proposed and studied in the field of spintronics which includes: 
 Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) Devices The MTJ-based memory, also known as spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM)  [25] . The MTJ devices consist of two ferromagnetic layers separated by a thin insulating layer (aluminum oxide). The resistance of the device depends on the relative magnetization orientation of the two ferromagnetic layers, which can be magnetized in parallel or antiparallel orientations. When a voltage is applied across the MTJ, electrons can tunnel through the insulating layer, but the tunneling probability depends on the relative orientation of the magnetization of the two layers. MTJ devices are nonvolatile, which makes them attractive for use in mobile devices, embedded systems, magnetic logic circuits, and other applications where power consumption and data retention are important factors  [26] . 
 Domain-Wall Racetrack Memory Devices The domain-wall racetrack memory devices use the motion of magnetic domain walls along a thin magnetic wire to store and manipulate data. The position of the domain walls can be used to represent logical states, and the walls can be moved using a combination of magnetic fields and spin-polarized electrical currents  [27] . The data is stored in the form of domain walls with opposite magnetization orientations. To write data, a spin-polarized current is applied to the wire, which creates a magnetic field that moves the domain walls  [28] . To read data, a second spinpolarized current is used to detect the presence or absence of domain walls at specific locations in the wire  [29] . The DWRM has the potential to be faster and more energy efficient than conventional magnetic memory technologies such as hard disk drives and flash memory. It also has the advantage of being scalable to smaller sizes, which is important for applications such as mobile devices and high-performance computing. However, DWRM has still some challenges such as density, speed, and power consumption  [30] . 
 Magnetic Spin Wave Logic Devices Magnetic spin wave logic devices are a type of computing technology that uses spin waves, also known as "magnons," to process and transmit information. Spin waves are collective excitations of the spin of electrons in a magnetic material, which can propagate through the material and carry information  [31] . Magnetic spin wave logic devices consist of a network of "magnonic" waveguides, which guide and manipulate the spin waves. The spin waves can be used to perform logical operations, such as AND, OR, and NOT, by controlling their phase and amplitude  [32] . The output of one waveguide can be coupled to the input of another waveguide to create more complex circuits. The primary advantages of magnetic spin wave logic devices is their potential for low-power operation, less energy loss, and high-speed computing with new levels of functionality and complexity which make the devices an attractive and alternative to conventional electronic devices  [33] . The magnetic spin wave logic devices are still in the experimental stage, and the main challenges are developing materials with the necessary magnetic properties to support spin wave propagation, manipulation, and improving the efficiency and reliability of the devices  [34] . 
 Magnetic Quantum Dot Cellular Automata (MQCA) The magnetic quantum dot cellular automata (MQCA) is a computing technology that uses the magnetic properties of "quantum dots" to process the information  [35] . In MQCA, each quantum dot acts as a single bit of information, and the interaction between adjacent dots can be used to perform logical operations. MQCA devices consist of a regular array of quantum dots made of a magnetic material, such as iron (Fe) or cobalt (Co), embedded in a nonmagnetic material. The orientation of the magnetic moment of each quantum dot can be used to represent a binary digit (0 or 1), and their interaction between adjacent dots can be used to perform logical operations, such as AND, OR, and NOT. The primary advantage of MQCA devices is their potential for low-power operation and high-speed operation  [36] . But the devices of MQCA are still in the initial experimental stage, and there are still many challenges to overcome before they can be used in practical applications. One of the main challenges is developing materials with the necessary magnetic properties to support MQCA operation and to improve the efficiency and reliability of the devices  [37] . 
 Magnetic Computing The magnetic computing is an emerging technology that is being explored as an alternative to traditional semiconductor-based computing. Magnetic computing is based on the manipulation of magnetic fields instead of electrical charges  [38] . Magnetic computing devices use magnetic properties to store and process information, and have the potential to be more energy efficient and faster than traditional computing devices. Here are some examples of magnetic computing-based devices: 
 Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM) The magnetic random access memory (MRAM) is a type of nonvolatile memory that uses the magnetic properties of materials to store data/information. MRAM can retain data even when power is turned off, making it an attractive alternative to other types of memory, such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and flash memory  [39] . The MRAM uses the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic materials to store data, and each bit of information is represented by the orientation of the magnetic moment of a small magnetic element, such as a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). This makes it ideal for applications that require instant access to stored data, such as computers and mobile devices. There are several advantages of magnetic random access memory (MRAM): (i) Low power: The MRAM devices consume very little power when in standby mode, which makes them ideal for low-power applications, such as batterypowered devices and Internet of Things (IoT) devices  [40] . (ii) Endurance: The MRAM devices can withstand a large number of write cycles without degradation, which makes them suitable for applications that require frequent updates to stored data, such as file systems and databases  [41] . (iii) Radiation tolerance: The MRAM is less susceptible to radiation-induced data errors than other types of memory, such as DRAM and flash memory. This makes it ideal for use in space and other high-radiation environments  [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . (iv) Compatibility: The MRAM devices can be fabricated using standard semiconductor manufacturing processes, which make them compatible with existing manufacturing infrastructure and enable integration with other types of memory on a single chip  [8] [9] [10] . 
 Magnetic Logic Devices The magnetic logic devices are being developed as an alternative to traditional semiconductor-based logic devices like transistors. Magnetic logic devices use the magnetic properties of materials to perform logical operations  [10] [11] [12] . They have the potential to be faster and more energy efficient than traditional logic devices. Magnetic logic devices have several potential applications and advantages, including: (i) Low-power operation: Magnetic logic devices have the potential for low-power operation, which makes them attractive for energy-efficient computing  [12] . (ii) Nonvolatile memory: Some magnetic logic devices, such as magnetic random access memory (MRAM), can retain data even when power is turned off, making them ideal for nonvolatile memory storage  [11] . (iii) High-speed operation: Magnetic logic devices can switch between states much faster than conventional electronic devices, making them attractive for high-speed computing applications  [10] . (iv) Radiation tolerance: Some magnetic logic devices are less susceptible to radiation-induced data errors than conventional electronic devices, making them ideal for use in space and other high-radiation environments  [21] . (v) Compatibility: Magnetic logic devices can be fabricated using standard semiconductor manufacturing processes, which makes them compatible with existing manufacturing infrastructure and enables integration with other types of memory on a single chip  [21] . (vi) Potential for novel computing architectures: Magnetic logic devices can be used to implement novel computing architectures, such as spin-based logic and quantum computing  [7] . Some potential applications of magnetic logic devices include: (i) Nonvolatile memory: The magnetic logic devices, such as MRAM, can be used for nonvolatile memory storage in a wide range of applications, including consumer electronics, automotive, and industrial control systems  [21] . (ii) High-speed computing: Magnetic logic devices can be used to implement high-speed computing architectures, such as magnetic spin wave logic devices, which have the potential to outperform conventional electronic devices  [12] . (iii) Radiation-resistant computing: Magnetic logic devices can be used in space and other high-radiation environments where conventional electronic devices are susceptible to data errors  [12] . 
 Magnetic Field Sensors The magnetic field sensors are devices that are used to measure the strength and direction of magnetic fields. There are several types of magnetic field sensors, including Hall effect sensors, magnetoresistive sensors, and fluxgate sensors. (i) Hall effect sensors: The Hall effect sensors are based on the Hall effect, which is a phenomenon in which a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the direction of current flow in a conducting material generates a voltage difference across the material. Hall effect sensors are commonly used in applications such as current sensing, speed detection, and proximity sensing  [20] . (ii) Magnetoresistive sensors: The magnetoresistive sensors are based on the phenomenon of magnetoresistance, which is a change in the electrical resistance of a material in the presence of a magnetic field. There are several types of magnetoresistive sensors, including anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) sensors, giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensors, and tunnel magnetoresistive (TMR) sensors. Magnetoresistive sensors are commonly used in applications such as compasses, position sensing, and automotive applications  [19] . (iii) Fluxgate sensors: The fluxgate sensors use a magnetic core that is magnetized by an AC current. The magnetic field generated by the AC current is modulated by the external magnetic field being measured, which induces a secondary AC current in a sense coil. The amplitude and phase of the secondary AC current are proportional to the strength and direction of the external magnetic field. Fluxgate sensors are commonly used in applications such as magnetic navigation, geophysics, and nondestructive testing  [11] . The magnetic field sensors have several advantages, including: (i) Noncontact sensing: The magnetic field sensors can measure magnetic fields without physical contact, which makes them ideal for applications in which physical contact is not possible or desirable  [10] . (ii) High sensitivity: The magnetic field sensors can detect very small changes in magnetic fields, which makes them suitable for applications that require high sensitivity and accuracy  [9] . (iii) Wide range of measurement: The magnetic field sensors can measure magnetic fields over a wide range of strengths and frequencies, which makes them versatile for a range of applications. Some magnetic field sensors, such as Hall effect sensors, have low power consumption, which makes them ideal for battery-powered applications. Overall, the advantages and versatility of magnetic field sensors make them a useful technology for a wide range of applications, including automotive, consumer electronics, and industrial control systems  [22] . 
 Magnetic Quantum Computing The magnetic quantum computing is a field that aims to use the spin of electrons to perform quantum computations. It is based on the principles of quantum mechanics and has the potential to perform certain computations much faster than traditional computers. Magnetic quantum computing is still in the early stages of development, but it has the potential to revolutionize computing in the future  [20] . The magnetic quantum computing is a type of quantum computing that uses the magnetic properties of electrons to store and manipulate quantum information. In magnetic quantum computing, quantum bits or qubits are encoded in the spin of electrons. The spin of an electron is a magnetic property that can have two possible states, "up" or "down," which can represent the two states, "0" or "1." Magnetic quantum computing has several potential advantages over other types of quantum computing, including  [22, 41] : (i) Scalability: Magnetic qubits can be easily integrated into existing semiconductor technology, which makes them scalable and easier to manufacture compared to other types of qubits  [1] . (ii) Long coherence times: Magnetic qubits have relatively long coherence times, which is the time during which a quantum system can maintain its quantum state before it becomes entangled with its environment. Long coherence times are important for performing quantum operations and correcting errors  [9] . (iii) Robustness: Magnetic qubits are relatively robust and can withstand external magnetic fields and other environmental factors that can cause errors in other types of qubits  [5] . (iv) Compatibility: Magnetic qubits are compatible with existing magnetic storage technologies, which could potentially lead to new hybrid technologies that combine classical magnetic storage with quantum processing  [8] . Some potential applications of magnetic quantum computing include: (i) Cryptography: Magnetic quantum computing could be used to break conventional encryption algorithms, which could have significant implications for data security  [21] . (ii) Materials science: Magnetic quantum computing could be used to simulate the behavior of complex materials, which could lead to the development of new materials with unique properties  [11] . (iii) Drug discovery: Magnetic quantum computing could be used to simulate the behavior of complex biological systems, which could accelerate the discovery of new drugs  [9] . (iv) Machine learning: Magnetic quantum computing could be used to accelerate machine learning algorithms, which could have applications in fields such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles. Overall, magnetic quantum computing is a promising technology that could have significant implications for a wide range of fields, from cryptography to materials science, and to machine learning  [18] . 
 Introduction to Latest Fabrication Techniques Laxman Raju Thoutam   
 Abstract In this section, we are going to cover the overall content of semiconductor processes required in university or graduate programs, or in the semiconductor industry. In this first chapter, the eight major semiconductor processes will be comprehensively covered for understanding the recent semiconductor technology. Therefore, this chapter will briefly introduce eight major semiconductor fabrication processeswafer manufacturing, oxidation, photolithography, etching, ion implantation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), metallization, and 
 Introduction So far, the semiconductor industry has undergone significant development. Therefore, comparing the past and current semiconductor process technologies has become meaningless, and various technologies have been applied to semiconductor chip production  [1] [2] [3] . Among various semiconductor process techniques, N-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (NMOS) and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes are close to the standards that many people in the semiconductor industry refer to  [4] [5] [6] [7] . In this chapter, based on middle school level chemistry knowledge, the authors aim to describe the eight major semiconductor processes. Through this knowledge, the authors believe that even nonspecialists in semiconductors, especially students in liberal arts or humanities, can easily learn about eight semiconductor processes. Through various familiar chemical formulas, the readers might learn what the eight major processes of semiconductors are, and what important issues exist in each process. Furthermore, by taking a step further, the readers could also learn about the issues that are currently being debated in the recent semiconductor industry, regarding semiconductor process. 
 Raw Materials Needed to Manufacture Semiconductor Chips Figure  9 .1 describes how semiconductor chips are usually made and the relationship between raw material and semiconductor chips  [8] . Considering the semiconductor is "solid" not "liquid," the basic source material of the semiconductor could be obtained in the "ground" not "air." In this regard, thanks to plentiful resources on earth, silicon could be obtained by refining sand (Fig.  9 .1), and this silicon contributes to the production of wafer (most wafer is produced by silicon  [Si] ). Then, by applying various chemical and mechanical processes to silicon wafer (Si wafer), the semiconductor chip could be finally produced (Fig.  9 .1). Then, here is the important question: "Why is most wafer produced by silicon rather than other elements?" There are two major reasons: First reason is that silicon can be easily obtained from the earth. Figure  9 .2 illustrates what are the major components of earth's crust and why raw material of semiconductors could be easily earned  [9, 10] . As illustrated in Fig.  9 .2, silicon is the third largest component of earth's crust. Thanks to earth, humankind has been able to obtain a great deal of silicon. Second reason is that silicon has excellent material properties to perform semiconductor functions. More than anything else, silicon has four valence electrons (to put simply, silicon atoms have four electrons on the outside). Therefore, silicon can have either metal characteristics (by obtaining electrons 4 ! 5 or 6 or 7) or insulator characteristics (by losing electrons 4 ! 3 or 2 or 1). For this reason, silicon can perform either metal function (conducting electric current) or insulator function (not conducting electric current). Under certain conditions, electrical current can flow in silicon. On the other hand, under other conditions, electrical current can't flow in silicon. The more detail will be covered in later chapters.  
 Overall Semiconductor Production Process Flow Even though the semiconductor manufacturing process (also known as semiconductor process) could be summarized by eight processes, the semiconductor process has a variety of processes. Figure  9 .3 explains the overall semiconductor process, and this flowchart is technically called "process flow"  [11] . Among these various processes in Fig.  9 .3, eight major semiconductor processes usually indicate "start (wafer production)," "oxidation," "photolithography," "etching," "ion implantation (also known as implantation)," "metal deposition," "testing," and "packaging." 
 Wafer Manufacturing and Cleaning (Start) The first step for making a semiconductor is wafer manufacturing and preparation. By refining sand, we can obtain pure silicon wafer with extremely low impurities (something like dust). However, even though the wafer-manufacturing factory produced cleaned wafers, the wafer could be quickly contaminated when we open vacuum sealed wafers and pick them. Within a few minutes, wafers could be contaminated and we need some action. More than anything else, since oxygen (O) in the air loves silicon (Si) so much, silicon at the surface of the wafer reacts and combines with oxygen within a few minutes (Si þ O 2 ! SiO 2 ). Since this naturally formed SiO 2 has really low quality, we need to remove them and make the wafer much clearer. This process is called the "cleaning process." By dipping the wafer in some certain cleaning liquids for 5 ~20 min at high temperature, the wafer becomes so much clearer. The detailed description (e.g., what kind of liquid is used for wafer cleaning, what temperature is adopted for wafer cleaning, etc.) will be discussed in the later chapter. 
 Oxidation Oxidation process is the process of making silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) layer at the surface of wafer. This is conducted by the chemical process (Si þ O 2 ! SiO 2 ) by exposing oxygen to silicon wafer. This process is usually done in the high temperature (over 626 C, over 900 K). The reason for adopting high temperatures is to make this process faster, so that impurities (such as dust) might not easily get into the wafer. There are two major types of oxidation processes. The first one is dry oxidation, and the second one is wet oxidation. Wet oxidation utilizes water (technically, deionized water ¼ DI water) to make this process much faster. Each process has its own advantages and disadvantages. The details will be discussed in the later chapter, and the recent issue in the oxidation process is how to make "uniform SiO 2 (with extremely low variation in thickness of SiO 2 )" on the silicon wafer. 
 Photolithography Photolithography process utilizes taking a "photo," as shown in its own name. In this process, an engineer sheds light on the part of the liquid (this liquid is called photoresistance  [PR] ). The region where it gets sunlight becomes harder, and the other region where it doesn't get sunlight becomes softer. After that, the engineer digs "this wafer with PR" in the remover liquid. In this manner, only some part of PR remained on top of the wafer. This process is called photolithography. 
 Etching Etching process is like "digging" as described in Fig.  9 .3. To understand this, let's take a look at Fig.  9 .4. Figure  9 .4 describes the wafer which undergoes oxidation and lithography processes. As we know, PR became harder after being exposed to sunlight. Therefore, this PR can now act as "protector (shield)." Figure  9 .5 describes the etching process. In this process, silicon wafer is exposed to some ions (shown as blue stars in Fig.  9 .5), and these ions dig the wafer. After this process, some part of SiO 2 that wasn't protected by the PR protector is removed, as shown in Fig.  9 .5. 
 Ion Implantation Ion implantation is the process that adds some dopants (atoms) to silicon. By doing this process, electrical current can easily flow in the silicon. In order to make a negative-type (N-type) doping, 15 group atoms such as phosphorus (P) or arsenic (As) are put into silicon wafer. On the other hand, to make a positive-type (P-type) doping, 13 group atoms such as boron (B) are used.  
 Metal Deposition Metal deposition process is the process that deposits metal materials on the silicon wafer. After this process, a metal layer could be added on the top of the wafer. This process is usually done at the last step of the fabrication. The main purpose of this process is to make some metal channel that can convey electrical voltage (V). 
 Testing Semiconductor testing is usually conducted at the later stage in semiconductor manufacturing. Therefore, this "testing" process belongs to "back-end process." Back-end process is composed of various processes such as testing and packaging. The aim of this testing process is to ensure the quality of semiconductor chips by removing poor quality chip in advance. The recent issue of the semiconductor industry is how to make yield rate over 86% (yield rate ¼ the number of highquality chips/the number of all produced chips). 
 Packaging Packaging is the process of making a semiconductor chip, so that the packaged chip can survive under severe conditions. For example, during the shipping process, some semiconductor chips can be shipped to customers who live in hot and wet conditions. Therefore, the semiconductor chip can also survive in harsh conditions such as hot and wet. For this reason, the semiconductor factory finally packages the semiconductor chip so that its quality might not be easily degraded. This process is called packaging. Figure  9 .6 illustrates the manufactured semiconductor chips after packaging. Usually, the semiconductor chip has black color (Carbon). The reason for this black color is to prevent static electricity that can damage the semiconductor chip.  
 Conclusion This chapter addressed the overall semiconductor process. Most semiconductor is manufactured by silicon wafer, since the silicon has excellent material characteristics for semiconductors. In addition, silicon can be easily obtained in the crust of earth. When silicon wafer is made by refining sand, various semiconductor processes are done and high-quality semiconductor chips are produced after packaging.    
 Abstract In semiconductor manufacturing, one of the most important processes is wafer fabrication and wafer cleaning. Even if a wafer appears free of scratches to the naked eye, there are often various impurities such as dust and particles when viewed under a microscope. Considering the fact that recent semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) chips utilize nanoprocessing, even slight amounts of dust or impurities can greatly impair the performance of the manufactured semiconductor. Therefore, cleaning the wafer is extremely important. In this chapter, we would like to talk about the representative types of wafers that exist in the semiconductor industry and their characteristics. Next, the specific process and solution used for wafer cleaning will be covered step by step. 
 Introduction If we were to compare semiconductor wafer production and cleaning to a human as an analogy, we could say that semiconductor cleaning is similar to creating a suitable environment for a baby to grow  [1] . It is widely known that newborns are more vulnerable to even minor viruses. For this reason, a newborn room is maintained with appropriate humidity, temperature, and high cleanliness. The same goes for semiconductors. Once the wafer is made, the following semiconductor processes must be carried out in a high-cleanliness environment, and impurities should be removed through cleaning before starting the following semiconductor process  [1] . Otherwise, the ratio of high-quality semiconductors among all produced semiconductors may be greatly reduced when tested later. Even if the semiconductor chip worked normally at first, the probability of failure increases over time. Therefore, selecting good wafers is critical, and cleaning before starting the semiconductor process is also crucial. In this chapter, we will learn about the types of wafers and the specific process of wafer cleaning. Of course, there is no definitive answer to wafer cleaning, and the concentration of cleaning solutions may vary slightly depending on the desired characteristics of the semiconductor to be produced, but there will be no significant changes in the type of solution and the cleaning process. 
 Types of Wafer In the semiconductor industry, there are three major types of wafer (Fig.  10 .1). The first one is bulk wafer, which has been used and considered as traditional wafer. This one is the cheapest wafer among these three wafers in Fig.  10 .1. This silicon (Si) bulk wafer is composed of silicon only, and its thickness is usually about 0.6 mm or so. The second wafer is silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer, which has been utilized for low-power application  [2] [3] [4] . For example, this wafer has been used for cell phones, portable laptop computers, smart phones, and smart watches. This is because silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) in SOI wafer effectively suppresses the off-current of the semiconductor. That is to say, when semiconductor is manufactured based on SOI wafer, it will consume little energy while the electronic devices are not used. The third one is silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) wafer  [5] [6] [7] [8] . This one is the most expensive wafer among these three wafers. This SOS wafer is mainly used for power electronics. For example, recently, many people use gallium nitride (GaN) phone chargers  [9] [10] [11] . This is because GaN can make the phone charging faster. As a rule of thumb, GaN phone charger charges the smart phone three times quickly, compared to normal phone charger these days  [12] [13] [14] . In SOS substrate, silicon is on the aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 , also known as "alumina"). Since Al 2 O 3 has excellent thermal conductivity, heat generated in the phone charger can easily dissipate when the phone charger is made from SOS wafer  [15] [16] [17] [18] . 
 Introduction to Cleaning Equipment Before discussing in-depth theory of cleaning, we would like to talk about the image of the cleaning process. Figure  10 .2 shows the bulk wafers which are prepared to undergo cleaning process. When engineers try to clean the wafer, people usually put a wafer in the carrier (as shown in Fig.  10 .2), and then dip this carrier in a certain cleaning solution  [1] . By doing so, wafer could be easily cleaned. In addition, the cleaning process is usually done in a wet station. Wet station equipment is used for cleaning, and it has about six types of cleaning liquid. By controlling the display of wet station, engineers can easily modulate the temperature of liquid. The cleaning liquid will be replaced with a new one, when the cleaning liquid is used over ten times or so. 
 Cleaning Process Regarding cleaning, engineers can clean the wafer either in (1) before oxidation process (initial stage) or (2) before making gate (before metallization), or (3) before connecting several transistors with metal lines (last stage). Each process requires different liquids and methods. 
 Wafer Cleaning Before Oxidation (Initial Stage) After selecting a visually cleaned wafer without scratches (Fig.  10 .3), engineers clean the wafer again by using a nitrogen gun to remove any dust or debris adhered  ** Caution: After cleaning is done, please kindly inspect the wafer under ultraviolet light, if possible. Just in case the cleaning state is not good enough, the engineer can repeat the process starting from step 4, so that the wafer could be surely cleaned  [1] . Cleaning Wafer Before Making Gate (Before Metallization) Regarding the cleaning process before making the gate of the transistor, engineers can follow the two steps. Step 1) Dip the wafer in the 10H 2 O:1HF solution for 2 min and 30 s, then rinse in water for 12 min. Step 2) Repeat steps 1 through 5 of the initial cleaning process. ** Caution: The removal of the stress-relieving oxide layer should be done at this stage, and the wafer should immediately proceed to the gate oxidation process.  
 Cleaning Before Making Metal-Contact Line Among Transistors (Final Stage) Step 1) To clean the deposition surface, soak it in a 2H 2 SO 4 :1H 2 O solution for 10 min, then rinse in water for 12 min. Step 2) Soak in a 10H 2 O:1HF solution for 10 s, then rinse in water for 15 min and spin-dry. (Note: "Spin-dry" means the process of putting the wafer in drying machine (spin-drier) so that the remaining water on wafer could be quickly evaporated from the wafer.) ** Caution: When using a spin-dryer (Step 2), the engineer must carefully select the revolutions per minute (RPM), so that the processed wafer could be safely dried  [1] . 
 Conclusion So far, we have learned the representative types of wafer that have been used in the semiconductor industry. Then, the cleaning processes are discussed, according to the stage of wafer. Of course, the exact time and concentration of liquid could be slightly changed. It depends on the situation, and cleaning equipment. Different cleaning equipment has slightly different instructions. Regarding the exact temperature, cleaning time, and types of solution, please kindly follow the instructions of the cleaning equipment. By doing so, the engineers could safely prepare the cleaned wafer, so that the following semiconductor process could be safely done. 
 Introduction Among the various stages of semiconductor fabrication, the oxidation process is practically the first step and is often used when creating a thin film on top of silicon  [1] [2] [3] [4] . The thin insulator layer formed by the oxidation process plays a crucial role in the performance of the semiconductor  [5] . Depending on the quality of the thin film formed by the oxidation process, the characteristics of the semiconductor, which has intermediate performance between conductors and insulators, are determined  [1, 4] . If the film is formed too thin, the final produced transistor will be closer to a conductor, and if the film is formed too thick, the final produced transistor will be closer to an insulator  [6] [7] [8] . Considering these points, it is important to accurately deposit the desired thickness throughout the silicon wafer, and it is also crucial to form the oxide layer without introducing various impurities  [4] . There are three major variables that affect the creation of the oxide layer: temperature, time, and humidity  [4] . The characteristics of the oxide layer and the time required for the oxidation process vary depending on how these three variables are controlled  [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . In this section, we will learn about the oxidation process and how the process steps differ depending on the type of oxidation process used. We will also investigate the performance differences of the resulting oxide layer. 
 Oxidation Furnace Figure  11 .1 illustrates the oxidation equipment (furnace) where overall oxidation process is performed. In this furnace, very high temperature will be implemented so that oxidation process could be done very quickly, thereby making it possible to produce oxidation layer with extremely low impurities. During oxidation process, some dummy wafer will be placed at the front of the carrier, so that our wafer will safely form oxidation layer with high uniformity. If there are no dummy wafers, the Fig.  11 .1 The photo illustrates oxidation equipment (furnace). During the oxidation process, silicon wafer is put into the oxidation furnace, so that the oxidation process could be successfully done under high temperature first wafer (which is placed at the front of carrier) will get oxide flow so much, and the produced oxidation layer will be so much thicker. Regarding the last wafer (which is placed at the last of the carrier) will get oxidation flow lower, and the produced oxidation layer will be too much thinner. Therefore, engineer normally put 2 ~3 dummy wafer in front of carrier, so that our wafer will have uniform oxidation layer thickness. Figure  11 .2 shows the chemical molecules used in oxidation furnaces. In this furnace, various gas molecules are used for making safer and uniform oxidized layers. Regarding deionized water (DI water), it will be used when the engineers want to grow oxide layer quickly but give up the uniformity of oxidation layer to some extent. In this case, DI water is used and this oxidation process is called "wet oxidation." On the other hand, if engineers want to produce a uniform oxidation layer slowly, the oxidation process will be processed without DI water, and this process is called "dry oxidation." Let's take a closer look at the furnace. As shown in Fig.  11 .2, what is needed for the oxidation process is a high-temperature furnace, a process tube with a gas injector, a carrier and boat that support the wafer inside the high-temperature process tube, and various high-purity gases necessary to create the oxidation conditions. To perform dry oxidation, a mixture gas containing O 2 or N 2 /O 2 is introduced into the furnace tube. On the other hand, for wet oxidation, as mentioned earlier, a mixture of N 2 and O 2 injected into the process tube as bubbles through a flask containing DI water helps in the process. The wet oxide layer formed by wet oxidation is created by injecting H 2 with a proper amount of O 2 into the process tube or passing through an O 2 bubbler containing water. Halogen elements such as HCl or TCA (trichloroethane) can also be added to the gas flow in the process tube to form the oxidation layer mentioned above.  consumed. Importantly, nearly 45% of the final thickness of the oxide film is from the original silicon that has been consumed by oxide. This proportion can be calculated based on the density and molecular weight differences between Si and SiO 2  [4] . Now, let's explore in more detail how the oxide film is formed through various equations. 
 Visualization of Oxidation Process 
 Mathematical Interpretation of Oxidation Process Understanding Henry's law is the most important thing in understanding the oxidation process. From a physical point of view, Henry's law can be defined by the following statement: "The mass of a gas dissolved in a fixed volume of liquid solvent at a constant temperature, i.e. solubility, is proportional to the partial pressure of that gas in equilibrium with the solvent"  [4] . In Fig.  11 .4, X 0 represents the initial thickness of SiO 2 region (assuming the variable X 0 for mathematical analysis, let's consider X 0 ¼ 0 when there is no oxide layer). Let's call C G the concentration of O 2 in the gas in the furnace, and C S the concentration of O 2 close to the oxide layer surface. Oxygen (O 2 ) must penetrate the SiO 2 layer and react with silicon  (Si) . Therefore, there will be a difference in oxygen concentration within the oxide layer. As shown in Fig.  11 .4, let's call C O the concentration of O 2 at the outer surface of the oxide layer and C i the concentration of O 2 near the silicon and oxide layer interface. In addition, the oxidation process involves flowing oxygen onto the silicon wafer in the furnace. Therefore, it is related to three fluxes, which we will call F 1 , F 2 , and F 3 . Assuming the oxidation process occurs at a steady state, F 1 ¼ F 2 ¼ F 3 . Let's assume a linear gas flow and define h G as the mass transfer coefficient in the gas phase. F 1 ¼ h G ⁎ C G À C S ð Þ Here, According to Henry's law  [4] , P S and P G are the partial pressures of oxygen at the gas-matrix and gas-bulk interfaces of the oxide layer, respectively. Also, C * is the concentration of oxidant in the gas bulk outside the oxide surface at equilibrium. H is the constant in Henry's law as mentioned earlier. From the ideal gas law, PV ¼ nkT, which can be applied here. C O ¼ HP S , C ⁎ ¼ HP G F 1 ¼ h C ⁎ À C O ð Þ Here, h is corresponding to h G /HkT. According to Fick's law, the expression for F 2 can be represented as D(C O -C i )/X O , where D is the diffusion coefficient (area/time). The corresponding flux for the oxidation reaction can be expressed as F 3 ¼ K S C i , where K S is the surface reaction rate constant. Now, let's apply F 1 ¼ F 2 ¼ F 3 . Then, we can obtain the following equation: C i ¼ C ⁎ 1 þ K S h þ K S X O D C O ¼ 1 þ K S K O D C ⁎ 1 þ K S h þ K S X O D The above equation is important because it allows us to understand the effect of the diffusion constant D on the O 2 concentration within the oxide film. That is, if D is small, C i approaches 0 and C O approaches C * . Therefore, F 1 approaches 0. On the other hand, if D is large, C i and C O become equal. Now, we can obtain the growth rate G of the oxide film using the following equation. In the equation below, N represents the number of oxidizing agents per unit volume of the oxide film. (In dry oxidation, N ¼ 2.3 * 10^22 cm^-3, while N ¼ 4.6 * 10^22 cm^-3 under wet oxidation).  G ¼ dX O dt ¼ F N ¼ K S C ⁎ N 1 þ K S h þ K S X O D To simply put, we can obtain the following description. X 2 O þ AX O ¼ B t þ T ð Þ A ¼ 2 D 1=K S þ 1=h ð Þ B ¼ 2 D C ⁎ =N In other words, it can be inferred that the rate of the oxidation process is inversely proportional to the thickness of the oxide film. Moreover, the following can be derived from the equation above  [4] . G ¼ dX O dt ¼ B A þ 2X O X O ¼ A 2 1 þ t þ T A 2 =4B 0:5 À 1 This implies that the growth of the oxide film occurs in a parabolic relationship with time. Additionally, considering that N is larger in wet oxidation, the following can be concluded: Principle 1) The rate of oxide film formation is faster in wet oxidation than in dry oxidation. This is because the solubility of H 2 O in SiO 2 is about 1000 times greater than that of O 2 in SiO 2 . Principle 2) Even if the oxidation process is repeated several times, the previously formed oxide film does not affect the growth rate in subsequent oxidation processes. Principle 3) The addition of halogen elements accelerates the rate of silicon thermal oxidation in dry oxidation. In the case of halogen compounds, a small amount of water vapor is formed, which affects C * and thus affects constants A and B. On the other hand, halogen gas itself affects the effective diffusion coefficient by combining with ions in the growing oxide film. 
 Conclusion In this chapter, the oxidation process has been carefully discussed. During the oxidation process, silicon wafers are put in a hot furnace, and silicon wafers meet a great deal of oxide molecules. As a result, thin silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) layer would be formed. When it comes to this oxidation process, the DI water could be involved and the speed of oxidation could be faster. In addition, this oxidation process has been mathematically investigated, so that three major principles of the oxidation process could be understood. Regarding oxidation process, the selection of chemical molecules and temperature could be carefully selected, so that the good SiO 2 layer could be formed, thereby realizing high-quality transistors in the end. 
 Introduction In the semiconductor industry, producing high-quality oxide films is a crucial process  [1] [2] [3] [4] . To achieve this, researchers in both electrical engineering and materials science have conducted various studies on how to create high-quality oxide films  [4] . In particular, with the development of diverse semiconductor production equipment, the quality of oxide films has continuously improved, and now the focus is on creating oxide films with high density and high reliability rather than simply producing high-quality SiO 2  [5, 6] . 
 Relationship Between Oxide Layer's Characteristics and Producing Method Table  12 .1 shows how the characteristics of SiO 2 layers change depending on the process technique used  [4] . The properties of the oxide layer can be described by density, breakdown field, and etch rate. Among these, the most important parameter is the breakdown field, which indicates how much voltage the oxide layer can withstand  [4] . In particular, in modern semiconductors that use thin oxide layers, breakdown field plays a crucial role. If the breakdown field is low, an electrical path can be formed through the SiO 2 layer when voltage is applied to the semiconductor  [7] [8] [9] [10] . This phenomenon can cause the transistor to become a conductor rather than a semiconductor, resulting in failure. In contrast, SiO 2 made through silica glass has a very low breakdown field, which can be calculated using capacitor-destructive techniques  [11] [12] [13] [14] . Additionally, it can be observed that the anodized oxide layer has a significantly lower density compared to other oxide layers. This phenomenon is due to the fact that during anodization, oxygen does not enter the silicon but rather the silicon moves. Other small differences in density between different oxide layers arise from impurities added during the process. On the other hand, sputtering can produce the same thin film at different temperatures. In particular, the advantage of sputtering over thermal oxidation, which requires temperatures above 800 degrees, is that SiO 2 can be made at lower temperatures. In contrast, thermal oxidation can produce the same density of SiO 2 layer at high temperatures of up to 1300 degrees  [4] . Finally, in Table  12 .1, it can be seen that anodization results in significant changes in the breakdown field. This is because the composition of the electrolyte used during anodization causes the oxide layer to change significantly  [4] . Additionally, the properties of the anodized oxide layer also change significantly during postprocessing after the semiconductor process is complete. Therefore, careful design is necessary when using anodization to create SiO 2 layers.  When it comes to wet oxidation, [111] silicon wafer has faster or equal speed of oxidation, compared to [100] wafer. When temperature is lower than 900 C, [111] wafer has higher oxidation speed. On the other hand, when temperature is higher than 900 C,  [111]  wafer has almost same oxidation speed, compared to [100] wafer. At low temperatures, oxide's diffusion occurs faster than surface reaction, so the oxidation speed depends heavily on the atomic density of the crystal plane. On the other hand, at high temperatures, the surface reaction occurs faster than oxidation diffusion, so the oxidation speed depends more on the diffusion rate of the oxidant than on the atomic density of the crystal plane. 
 Effect of Silicon Orientation on Oxidation Process Comparison Between Ideal SiO 2 and Real SiO 2  Figure 12 .3 shows the actual situation of the produced SiO 2 . It has various ions and charges. Specifically, it has mobile ionic charge with K + , Na + , and it also has various charges. These ions and charges affect the characteristics of transistors. Conventionally, the effect of these ions and charges has been analyzed by capacitance (C)-voltage (V) analysis. Unfortunately, C-V curve slightly shifts due to these factors, so that the transistor will have slightly different characteristics from the ideal transistors. As shown in Fig.  12 .4, there is an interface trapped charge in the interface between SiO 2 and Si. Because of this, some holes will be moved upward in silicon. Therefore, another capacitance called interface capacitance (C it ) will be formed, as illustrated in Fig.  12 .4. Because of this, the speed of the transistor might be lowered. In order to analyze the effect of these charges, C-V characteristics could be analyzed before and after the stress. As shown in Fig.  12 .5, by applying stress to wafer, the effect of charges could be analyzed. The existence of oxide-trapped charge only shifts the C-V curve, whereas the existence of interface trap charge also makes some distortion on the C-V curve. Therefore, it is essential to design transistors with low charges as much as designers can. Table  12 .2 shows the relationship between the state of silicon and the transistor's function. When the silicon is depleted, there will be low charges in the silicon region; therefore, the effect of charges will be minimized. Therefore, the transistor will function efficiently (Table  12 .2). However, in other cases, the transistor will not perform properly, due to the effect of various changes in the SiO 2 layer. 
 Conclusion In this chapter, the overall characteristics of the SiO 2 layer has been analyzed. The characteristics of the SiO 2 layer strongly depend on the method how SiO 2 is formed. Therefore, it is critical to properly select the fabrication method, so that the desired characteristics of SiO 2 will be achieved. In addition, the effect of ions and charges in SiO 2 layers has been explained, so that the real SiO 2 characteristic could be understood. In contrast to an ideal transistor, the real transistor has some ions and charges in the SiO 2 layer, so the transistor's characteristics might be slightly changed. As a result, the function of the transistor could be affected by SiO 2 's characteristics.

 Introduction In semiconductors, metal processing is a very important process. This is because metal processing greatly influences the yield and reliability of semiconductors  [1] . In other words, how successfully metal processing is performed determines the production of high-quality transistors  [2] . Metal processing is also used when creating a metal gate on SiO 2 and when creating metal wires to connect various transistors  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Finally, metal processing is used to create wires that connect the outside of the semiconductor chip and the transistors  [4] . In this section, we will learn about these metal processing techniques. 
 How to Select Good Metal Material In order to proceed with the metallization process, we need to carefully select which material to use. Each metal material has its own advantages and disadvantages  [4] . The most representative parameter to select good metal is "resistivity"  [4, [9] [10] [11] [12] . As shown in Table  13 .1, each metal material has different metal resistivity. More than anything else, titanium (Ti) has worst (highest) resistivity, whereas silver (Ag) has best (lowest) resistivity  [13] [14] [15] [16] . Normally, the metal materials shown in Table  13 .1 are often used in semiconductor design. Each material has its own advantages and disadvantages.  
 How to Utilize Each Metal Materials Traditionally, aluminum has been the most commonly used metal in the semiconductor industry. However, aluminum has the disadvantage of being susceptible to corrosion. Nonetheless, aluminum has a significant advantage in that it is easy to process, which is why it has been traditionally used so much. To use aluminum in semiconductor processes, a small amount of Si and Cu is added. When using aluminum, it is common to use Al þ 2% Si. This is to prevent Si from diffusing into aluminum at the interface between silicon and metal. If Si were to move, the junction between metal and Si would not be properly formed. This would result in voltage not being properly transmitted to silicon when voltage is applied to the transistor. Therefore, 2% silicon is also added to aluminum. When using aluminum, 2%  Si and 4%  Cu are also added. This is to prevent the metal wire from moving slightly when electricity flows through it. In other words, to suppress electrical movement, a small amount of Cu is added to Si. Copper has been widely adopted in recent years due to its low resistance and resistance to electromigration. As shown in Table  13 .1, Cu has a good resistivity and can be used to create very thin metal lines. However, dry etching of Cu is not easy and it is also susceptible to corrosion. Tungsten is a metal that can undergo chemical vapor deposition (CVD), making it very easy to fill holes and adhere to any surface. For example, W is heavily used in the latest memory components such as 3D NAND. However, W has a high work function of 5.5, so it is mainly used when filling holes is required. Ti, Co, and Ni are mainly used when doping metal into silicon. This is called a Schottky-barrier MOSFET (SB MOSFET) and has the advantage of high on-current. However, SB MOSFETs are difficult to make and have not yet entered mass production stages. Table  13 .2 shows characteristics of each metal material. Each material has its own characteristics. Among these metals, Al has attractive characteristics. Regarding compatibility, Al could be a better choice, compared to Cu. On the other hand, when it comes to electromigration resistance and process temperature, Cu could be a better option. The engineers must carefully select which materials to use. 
 Optimizing Metal Process As a rule of thumb, it has been widely known that Al has excellent metal characteristics. However, it would be much better to optimize the process with Al. There are four major ways to utilize Al in the semiconductor industry. Table  13 .3 summarizes characteristics of each option. The first option is using pure Al. In this case, it has the lowest melting point of 600 C. However, it has the best resistivity among them. It is also compatible with aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 , also known as alumina). However,   G N G G G G Adherence G N G - G G Delineation G N Y D D D Bond ability G G N N N N Contact resistance G G H B G G G G G Corrosion resistance F N G G G G Stability G G Good; N Not good; F Fair; Y OK; D Difficult; H High; B Best when 4% Cu is added to Al for preventing electromigration from happening, melting point becomes better whereas resistivity becomes worse. There is a trade-off between various characteristics. On the other hand, when 2% Si is added to Al, melting point is increased whereas resistivity is slightly degraded. Therefore, the engineer should consider these characteristics so that the semiconductor process could be optimized. Figures 13.  3 and 13.4  illustrate the result of the metallization process. The metal line could connect various IC chips, so that computers can perform various functions. Metal is used for making one IC chip and connecting several IC chips, at the same time. 
 Conclusion So far, we have investigated the metallization process. When it comes to the metallization process, the selection of material is paramount. The proper choice of metal material might improve the yield and reliability of IC chips, at the same time. Among various metal materials, aluminum (Al) has been most commonly used. However, the optimization of the metal process is still under process. The semiconductor engineer should carefully optimize this process so that the final IC chip could be both safely and quickly produced.    Aluminum +4% copper +2% silicon Al þ 4% Cu þ 2% Si 
 Introduction In today's technology-driven world, materials are often reduced to nanosizes as well as nanothicknesses, resulting in unique properties in optical, electric, optoelectronic, and dielectric applications  [1] [2] [3] . As a result, thin films and coatings have become a new branch of science/materials science. Thin film is defined as a thin layer of material whose thickness varies from several nanometers to a few micrometers  [4] . Thin film deposition plays a major role in the realization of small devices. The properties and flexibility of thin films can be obtained by using a suitable film. Nanoelectronic devices such as computers, since microelectronic solid-state devices all are made using thin films, play a critical role in the study of technological development  [5] . In order to produce solid-state devices with higher quality and sophistication, deposition technology has evolved rapidly. In the last few years, manufacturers have made successful efforts to improve and make more economical deposition systems as well as in situ process monitors and controllers for measuring film parameters. With the remarkable advances in analytical instrumentation over the past 20 years, it is possible to gain a deeper understanding of the physics and chemistry of films, surfaces, interfaces, and microstructures, which has led to the rapid growth of deposition technology  [6]  Advanced thin film technology has expertise in many fields including solar cells sensors, flat panel displays, micro/nanoelectronics, microcircuits, biomedical devices, optical instruments, microwave communications, integrated circuits, etc.  [7] [8] [9] . It is crucial to understand both the morphology and the stability of thin films for all applications. Deposition techniques greatly influence the morphology of thin films. Thin film deposition techniques can be generally classified into two categories: (i) chemical and (ii) physical methods. The only difference between chemical and physical thin film deposition techniques are based on how thin film material is deposited on the substrate  [10] . Physical methods involve only physical processes like evaporation, transport, condensation, etc. In contrast, the chemical method involves the chemical reaction of elements or compounds during the initial, final, or intermediate stages of deposition  [11, 12] . Thin film technology has many advantages in a variety of fields of application which includes: 1. Material cost reduction. 2. Reduced consumption of raw materials. 3. The material can be deposited on various substrates for various applications with the desired area. In the present chapter, a brief introduction to the working principal and application of spray pyrolysis, spin coating, sputtering, electron beam evaporation, thermal evaporation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD), cathodic arc deposition, and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) techniques will be discussed in details. 
 Spray Pyrolysis Technique Spray pyrolysis is a simple and inexpensive thin film deposition technique for preparing thin film of metal oxides such as simple oxides, mixed oxides, and spinal-type oxides. The word "paralysis" derived from word pyro which means heat and the word "lysis" means breaking  [13] . Thus the paralysis means the decomposition of precursor solution at very high temperature. Spray pyrolysis technique possess various advantages such as low processing temperature, high homogeneity, and purity of products  [14] . Figure  14 .1 exhibits the schematic illustration of the basic spray pyrolysis setup. The basic working mechanism of spray pyrolysis technique includes the breakdown of the precursor solution on a prehot substrate and eliminating toxic gases and additional solvent as vapors. It is important to select the chemical reactants carefully so that when they are sprayed in solution form on the heated surface, the excess solvent and other unwanted chemicals will be volatile at deposition temperature. For preparing the precursor solution, appropriate chemical compounds are initially dissolved in distilled water or other suitable solvent. A carrier gas is used to spray the final solution onto a preheated substrate where endothermic decomposition results in the formation of one crystallite or clusters of crystallites of the compound required  [15, 16] . Upon reaching the hot substrate, the fine droplets of the final prepared solution undergo pyrolytic decomposition. Finally, formations of smooth and uniform thin film take place on the substrate. The various important components of spray pyrolysis setup include: (i) spray nozzle, (ii) a hot plate, and (ii) a carrier gas regulator and air tight chamber. 
 • Spray nozzle The spray nozzle also called spray gun consists of a glass bulb at tip and capillary tube at center that sprays the precursor solution onto the substrate. As the carrier gas pressure is applied, a vacuum is formed at the nozzle's tip and the solution is drawn out of the capillary tube and sprayed on the substrate. 
 • Hot plate A hot plate usually consists of a disc of iron with a thermocouple in the center, which measures the temperature which heats the plate. Chromel-alumel thermocouples are used to measure the substrate temperature. A temperature controller was also used to maintain and monitor the hot plate's temperature. 
 • Carrier gas regulator and air tight chamber Using the carrier gas regulator valve, you can adjust the pressure of the carrier gas flowing through the spray gun. It was found that a great deal of toxic gases were released during the spraying of the precursor solution and were extracted by mounting the entire spray setup within an airtight chamber with exhaust fans. In order to produce good thin films, it is necessary to control various spray parameters such as solution concentration, spraying rate, substrate temperature, air pressure, and substrate-spray gun distance  [15] . 
 Spin Coating Method A spin coating is a technique that uses thin films deposition on flat substrates. In case of spin coating technique, a small amount of fluid is deposited onto a substrate's center and then spun at high speeds. By spinning the substrate at high speed, a small amount of viscous precursor solution gets uniformly distributed over the surface. As the solution is deposited on the substrate, it spreads uniformly due to centrifugal force. A constant rotation is carried out until the film reaches the desired thickness as the fluid spins away from the edge of the substrate  [17, 18] . In most cases, the solvent applied is volatile and evaporates simultaneously. Hence, thinner films result from higher spinning angular speeds. Based on the viscosity, surface tension, spinning rate, and postheating process, the thickness and nature of thin film layers are determined  [19, 20] . Figure  14 .2 shows the schematic illustration of the basic spin coating method. Spin coating technique has been widely used to fabricate thin films with thicknesses below 10 nm  [21, 22] .  Hanaor et al. (2011)  and  Wesam et al. (2009)  demonstrated its usefulness in photolithography, where layers of photoresist are deposited about 1 micrometer thick  [23, 24] . In order to fabricate transparent titanium dioxide and zinc oxide thin films on quartz or glass substrates, spin coating techniques are often employed due to their low thickness values that can be obtained. These thin film coatings may be self-cleaning and self-sterilizing in nature  [25] . The primary working mechanism of the spin coating technique can be understood as follows: (i) First, the viscous precursor solution is dispensed on the fixed substrate using a solution dropper. Two common methods of dispense are: static dispense and dynamic dispense. In static dispensing, a small puddle of fluid is placed at or near the center of the substrate. According to Hellstrom, Middleman, and Hochberg, this can range from 1 cc to 10 cc depending on the viscosity of the fluid and the size of the substrate to be coated  [26] . During dynamic dispensing, the substrate is rotated at low speed while the material is dispensed. At this stage of the process, a speed of about 500 rpm is commonly used (Hellstrom 2007, Middleman and Hochberg 1993)  [27] . (ii) During the spin upstage, the solution-deposited substrate is accelerated, and centrifugal force deposits a uniform layer on it. As a result of the rotational motion, fluid is aggressively expelled from the wafer surface  [28] . (iii) During the evaporation stage, the substrate goes through a postheat treatment process to remove the unnecessary solvent. (iv) In the final stage, the substrate is dried at room temperature, resulting in uniform layers. 
 Sputtering Figure  14 .3 presents a schematic illustration of sputtering technique. In thin film deposition field, sputtering is considered as the most efficient technique. It involves the ejection of atoms from a solid target material as a result of bombardment by energetic ions  [29] . It is the phenomenon in which atoms are expelled from a solid target material as a result of bombardment by energetic ions, normally by plasma, which produces charged particles that are accelerated anode and forms a layer of thin film onto the substrate. It produces high quality of layers with higher purity, controlled thickness with good accuracy, better adhesion, and homogeneity  [30] . Sputtering technique was first developed by W.R. Grove in 1852  [29] . It consists of cathode (usually target material) and anode (substrate holder). The uniformity, efficiency, and stress of the resulting film are all influenced by the pressure inside the sputtering chamber. Using turbo molecular pump, the chamber is initially evacuated to 10 À6 mbar pressure whereas during the deposition process the working pressure is of approximately around 10 À2 -10 À3 mbar  [31, 32] . The sputtering widely divided into two categories depending on the mode of power: (i) DC spurting and (ii) RF sputtering. The DC sputtering technique is the easiest and least expensive form of sputtering which uses a DC source power supply. The energetic particles used to strike target is generated by glow discharge that is called glow discharge sputtering. This technique is generally limited for conducting materials. In this technique a direct voltage is applied between the cathode and anode and typically inert gas such as argon was used during the deposition process to avoid any possible chemical reaction  [33] . In radiofrequency sputtering, an alternating potential of radiofrequency is applied at the target, causing electrons to move to and fro and collide repeatedly with gas atoms near the target surface, neutralizing surface charges on a periodic basis using plasma electrons, which are more mobile than positive ions. As a result of transverse magnetic and electric fields, the inert argon gas (Ar) atoms repeatedly hit the target material, which results in the emission of target material atoms. A uniform film is formed when these sputtered atoms move toward the substrate. Conducting and semiconducting samples can be deposited using RF sputtering  [34] . 
 Cathodic Arc Deposition The first industrial use of cathodic arc technology began in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and Western hemisphere in 1980s  [35] . This is a physical vapor deposition technique known as arc-PVD, in which an electric arc is employed to evaporate the material from a cathode target. The vaporized material subsequently condenses on a substrate and forms a thin film. Metallic, ceramic, and composite films are deposited using this method  [31] . The arc evaporation process begins with the striking of a high current, low voltage on the surface of the target that gives rise to a highly emitting area known as a cathode spot. The temperature of the cathode arc is exceptionally high, nearly 15,000 C, which results in high velocity to vaporized cathode material. This cathode spot is active for a short period  [31]  Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) In the late 1960s, J. R. Arthur and Alfred Y. Cho invented this technique at Bell Laboratories  [36] . This is one of the most common methods to deposit single crystals based on ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) technique. The most crucial property of MBE, clusters of atoms generated by slow deposition rate from the source by heating, migrates onto the hot substrate, incorporating growing film diffusion  [37] . During the operation of MBE, the reflection of high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) is used to monitor the crystal layers' growth. 
 Electron Beam Evaporation Figure  14 .4 shows the schematic illustration of the electron beam evaporation technique. An e-beam or electron beam evaporation method involves bombarding the target material with an electron beam from a charged tungsten filament in order to evaporate it and convert it into a gaseous state so it may be deposited on the material  [38] . An electron beam evaporation process (e-beam) leads to high deposition rates between 0.1 and 100 m/min at relatively low substrate temperatures  [39] . Atoms or molecules vaporized in a high vacuum chamber and then precipitate on a substrate, forming a thin film coating. The electron beam depostion technique has some clear advantages over the other depoistion layers. Some of them are listed as folows  [40] : • Only the target material is heated in the e-beam method, which reduces crucible contamination. • Suitable for metals with high melting points, it enables the direct transfer of energy with an electron beam. • Compared with other PVD processes, e-beam evaporation also has very high material utilization efficiency. Since e-beam evaporation has a high deposition rate and high material utilization efficiency, it can be used in a wide range of applications, including aerospace and automotive, where high temperatures and wear resistance are important, and hard coatings for cutting tools, as well as chemical barriers and coatings that protect surfaces in corrosive environments  [41] . 
 Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) Figure  14 .5 shows the schematic illustration of chemical vapor deposition process. CVD is a vacuum deposition technique that involves the deposition of a solid on a heated surface from a chemical reaction in the vapor phase to form metallic oxides on a suitable substrate  [42] . Endo et al. first reported the CVD technique in 1993 to create multiwalled nanocarbon nanotubes  [43] . Three years later, Dai successfully modified CO-based CVD to produce single-walled carbon nanotubes. During the deposition, the electric field applied to the substrate increases the growth rate of the material, which is found to be a relevant deposition control parameter in CVD techniques. In CVD, the various chemical reactions include pyrolysis, oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, etc. This technology may produce very pure materials with the best structural control at the nanoscale level at low temperatures, including single, multilayer, composite, and functionally graded materials  [44] . The most prominent CVD methods used to produce thin films are low-pressure CVD (LPCVD) and atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD). Plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) needed thermal energy supplied Fig.  14 .5 Schematic illustration of chemical vapor deposition process by a lamp resistive or inductive heating. This technology is important in the fabrication of semiconductors and other electronic components  [44] . 
 Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) Figure  14 .6 shows the schematic illustration of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) process. In 1965,  Smith and  Turner employed this technique for the first time to prepare semiconductors and dielectric thin films  [45] . PLD is a sophisticated thin film deposition technique used significantly in material science and the semiconductor industry. The deposition technique is a high-power laser beam focused on a target. PLD involves the ablation of target materials through laser irradiation, the formation of plasma plumes containing energetic ions, electrons, atoms, molecules, and charge-free particles, and the growth of crystals on the substrate as a result of the process  [46] [47] [48] . Different stages of interaction occur when a high-powered laser beam is focused on the target. There are four main steps of pulsed laser deposition, each of which affects crystallinity, uniformity, and stoichiometry of the thin film produced  [49] . • Laser-target interaction • Plasma plume formation • Deposition on the substrate • Nucleation and growth In the first step, the material surface begins to absorb the energy of the laser light, which results in the heating of the target. During the second stage, the gas is converted to plasma, and ionization occurs as a result of electron collision and the Fig.  14 .6 Schematic illustration of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) process ablated material moves toward the substrate, showing the forward peaking phenomenon, creating a plasma plume. Third, the heated plasma expanded away from the target and finally deposited on the substrate surface. The nucleation and growth of crystalline thin films at the fourth stage depends on a wide range of factors, including density, energy, degree of ionization, condensing material, temperature, and substrate properties. It is highly dependent on the substrate's temperature that determines the crystalline film growth, driven by the surface mobility of the deposited atoms  [50] . 
 Thermal Evaporation Thermal evaporation is one of the most common methods of physical vapor deposition (PVD). Figure  14 .7 shows the schematic representation of the thermal evaporation setup. A thermal evaporation system consists of a vacuum chamber in which the substrate and source material are placed  [51] . Typically, the source material is located at the bottom of the chamber, and the substrate is inverted at the top of the chamber. In thermal evaporation, a solid material is heated inside a high vacuum chamber to produce some vapor pressure after reaching a specific temperature and gets deposited upon the substrate to make a thin film  [52] . A variety of metals and nonmetals are deposited by thermal evaporation, including aluminum, chrome, gold, and indium. This method can be applied in a thin film device production process to deposit metallic contact layers, such as OLEDs, solar cells, and thin film transistors. There are a number of parameters that can be adjusted in a thermal evaporation system design and method to make it possible for process engineers to achieve desired results based on a number of variables such as thickness, uniformity, adhesion strength, stress, grain structure, optical properties, and electrical properties  [53, 54] .   
 Abstract Ion implantation is one of the most prestigious techniques used for circuit and device fabrication. It involves various processes to implant ion species into the material that alter the physicochemical states in the surface or near-surface region of the materials. Optimistic changes in the states with controlled doping and controlled depth with desirable doping species is the characteristic feature of ion implantation. A clear understanding of its processes and changes involved in the physicochemical states of modified structure is precious for utilizing ion implantation phenomena to engineer the material surface properties. This chapter presents the physics and material science of ion implantation, as well as its modifications and applications in various fields such as semiconductor devices, biomedical engineering, nanophotonics, nanoparticle synthesis, energy storage devices, etc. It also covers the present perspective of ion implantation in nanoscience and technology. 
 Introduction Ion implantation is a dominant fabrication technique in the area of semiconductor from almost 40 years and is expected to remain in future owing to its contribution in the developement of new emerging field of nanoscience and nanotechnology because it involves in the advancement of various type of modified nanomaterials that are being used in different devices such as sensors, environmental remediation, biomedical engineering, etc. including semiconductor industry  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . It is being popular and useful as compared to other techniques such as diffusion processes owing to its precise control over dopant profile as well as its distribution inside the implanted material  [1, 2] . In this technique ion species are ionized and accelerated from few to several thousand volts of energy by mass separator and acceleration tube and implanted into the material  [8] . This energetic ion species involeve in the replacement of thousands of atoms from their lattice site due to cascade collision. The energetic ion energy could be from few eV to MeV range and can penetrate the material up to subnanolevel to submicrolevel. The ion doses varies from 10 12 -10 18 atoms/cm 2 and higher doses are generally being used to formation of buried insulating layer within the semiconductor Material  [1, 2] . This dopant concentration varies with variation in implanted time as well as by beam current. Low-energy ions penetrates up to subnanolevel thickness and needs subnanosecond time during the thermal annealing process for the formation of shallow junction. Moreover, sometime during high-energy ion implantation rapid thermal annealing procedure requires little bit longer time to repair the damage. This technique is also being used for the fabrication of different devices as sensors, detectors, reflectors, etc and also in biomedical engineering for the formation of dopant compound within the material  [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . This idea of doping of additional compound can be used for advancement of new semiconductor devices for multiple applications. Such devices could be develop by introducing n-type phases layer within the p-type semiconductor nanomaterial or vice versa  [16] . 
 Ion Stopping Mechanism As each implanted species impinges onto the target surface, it undergoes several collisions processes in order to lose their energy before it comes to rest position inside the material. These collision processes behavior depend upon the features of ion species. In general, one know it from a daily life experiences that vehicles with more oil travels longer distances but it depends on vehicles features and road quality the similarly, higher energetic ions travels longer path and its path depends on ion species features and nature of the material. But, still, the complete phenomena of ionic specices collision processes could not be properly understood inside the material  [9, 10, 12, 17] . Only assumption-based simulated data gave a pictorial view/feel to the scientific communities. Where it is considered that energetic ion species losses its energy mainly via two processes, namely nuclear energy loss, i.e., energy loss due to nuclear collision, and electronic energy loss, i.e., energy loss due to electronic collision. Further, if an ion with energy (E) impinges inside the material surface and loses it energy per unit depth (x), where x is distance within the material normal to the surface, it is known as energy loss or stopping power (S), and is defined as dE/dx and expressed as: S ¼ dE dx ¼ dE dx n þ dE dx e ð15:1Þ where dE dx n and dE dx e represent stopping power due to nuclear collisions and electronic collisions, respectively (Fig.  15 .1). The rate of energy loss by nuclear collision per unit length is denoting the energy loss at each possible constituent multiplied by the collision occurring probability. During nuclear collision, incidence ion transferred its total energy to the target atom resulted for the recoil away from the lattice site. 
 Range and Straggle of Ion Implant Ion implantation is a well-planed and precise technique that produces random trajectories of implanted species and its scattering due to collision with target atom. This trajectory and scattering is specified if very large number of ion species are being implanted in the target material resulted for well-defined modification owing to all and every type of scattering and trajectories that are produced in the specified area and volume of the target material. On the other hand small number of species will have random trajectory and scattering due to less amount of modification in large volume resulted for prominent trajectory/strangling path visualization. The distance travel by the ion inside the material is known as range. In another word, the maximum depth up to which the implanted ion has created damages is known as range. It can be also defined as vector of the ion incidence trajectory of the actual integrated distance traveled by the implanted ion, which is perpendicular to the incidence surface, and is termed as range. It is also named as projected range of ion. It is basically measured along the ion trajectory path that reflects the resultant ion's net penetration into the material. For an example, a schematic representation of three-dimensional views is shown in Fig.  15 .2, where a projectile ion with significant energy enters into the material surface at point (0, 0, 0), at an angle α to the surface normal. The energetic ion is stopped at point (X s , Y s , Z s ). Here the ion penetration is not parallel to the surface normal, therefore the depth penetration path will be at something different i.e., at some angle and that could not be defined by simple X s due to cascade collisions. But, it will be given by radial range R r , which is the distance between the ion entrance points to ion's stopping position. Mathematically it is represented as: R r ¼ X 2 s þ Y 2 s þ Z 2 s 1=2 Similarly to see the spreads of ion, just keep X s ¼ 0, it will reflect the distance between the material surface entrance point and the projection of ion stopping position onto the material surface plane, this is known as spreading range (R s ) and mathematically represented as:  R r ¼ Y 2 s þ Z 2 s 1=2 Apart from this one more thing/coordinate is required for the well specification of the ion stopping position, called transverse projected range (R p t ), which is the vector connecting the radial range and projected range, and can be represented as: R t p ¼ X s Sinα À Y s cosα ð Þ 2 þ Z s 2 1=2 and the longitudinal projected range is given by R p ¼ R 2 r þ R t p 2 1=2 Since the ion stopping is a stochastic process, the collision sequence, deflection, and collision path of the ion moving inside the material before coming to rest are very random, and vary with ion to ion nature and features. As a result, ions with same energy, same mass, and same incidence angle in the same material will not necessarily follow the same projectile path and come at same rest position. So the ion distribution inside the material is not uniformed but it is random and can be expressed by statistical distribution given as: N x ð Þ ¼ ; 1 ΔR p 2π ð Þ 1=2 exp À 1 2 x À R p ΔR p 2 where N(x), ; 1 , R p , and ΔR p are the depth distribution of implanted ions, ion fluence, mean depth distribution (projected range), and projected range strangling, respectively. The depth distribution of ion is influenced by ion fluencies or doses. The dose and ion distribution profile can be approximated by Gaussian distribution as shown in Fig.  15 .3. There are several statistical distributions employed to explain the ion implanted distribution inside the target material but the possibly most fitted one, i.e., which explains better than Gaussian distribution to the ion distribution, is Pearson IV fit (Fig.  15 .4). To study this, one ion species is being implanted to a sample material with varying energy range 50 keV to 1 MeV to comparative visualization of dopant (ion) distribution. As ion energy is increased from 50 keV to 1 MeV, the ion distribution is more prominently placed at deeper positions of the material and deviate/scattered more from center positions or move more in transverse positions, i.e., deviate more from Gaussian profile toward Pearson IV fit. This is happening because at high energy (order of MeV) of ion, it gets less time to collide with lattice atom and it loses its maximum energy in interaction with electronic cloud of material developed due to available lattice atoms. Whereas low-energy ions have less kinetic energy, so it has maximum time to interact with surface lattice atom during the interaction with material which tiggers prominent nuclear collision and shorter penetration depth. Further, for heavier ion species, the ion distribution is more near the surface at low energy of ion species, whereas ion distribution will be deeper at high energy owing to its high momentum. So, to understand the role of ion species, a schematic plot is represented for constant Lighter ion species goes deeper as compared to heavier ion species due to its smaller momentum that followed electronic energy loss mechanism up to some energy. This means for the identical ion species with high energy creates longer projected range or ion distribution near subsurface level. Thereafter, as we know that all materials have its atomic arrangement, if implanted ion is being, somehow, targeted inside the gap between the atomic periodic arrangement, and then there is less possibility of it to collide with arranged lattice atoms, as compared to implanted ion which does not, somehow, get in between the periodically arranged atomic gaps. These phenomena of implanted ion less with collision inside the material due to periodic arrangement and angle of incidence are known as channeling (Fig.  15 .6a). It depends on the ion species features also, such as mass, size, charge state, etc. For example, red projected path ion is following channeling process while green and light green projected path ions are not following it due to large size or lesser energy. This problem could be solved by changing angle of incidence with material surface normal. This change of incidence angle leads to change in the ion distribution inside the material. It is found to be beneficial for shallow ion distribution resulted for higher angle of incidence. During this high angle of incidence, some ions came out from the material surface after cascade of collision which is known as back-scattered ions and it became prominent and its concentration is minimum at zero angle of incidence as shown in Fig.  15 .6b. To overcome this problem/situation, angle of ion incidence plays an important role during ion implantation technique. Now to get its feeling, the ion distribution due to scattering caused by identical ion falling on the material at different angles at a constant energy is represented in a schematic plot (Fig.  15 .7). From incidence energy is represented in a schematic plot it is clear that at normal incidence angle (i.e., at 0 ) ion species produces deeper ion distribution inside the material while for higher incidence angle (i.e., more than 45 ) the ion distribution is shallow near the surface or subsurface level. Apart from this, if after the variation in the incidence angle still implanted ion gets periodic arrange atoms gap, then it travels longer path that too without damaging the material for a distance. So to overcome this problem, one has to find proper angle of incidence to get proper ion distribution up to desirable level of thickness for semiconductor device fabrication. Further, after finding the suitable angle of incidence and all other parameters to obtained desirable ion distribution inside the material, one has to control on the ion dose, since higher dose may damage the material properties unexpectedly owing to sequential cascade collision with lattice atoms leading to larger damage inside the material. If only one ion of a ion species implants on the material surface at a particular angle, it creates negligible damage owing to easy lose of energy associated with lesser number of collisions within the material (Fig.  15 .8a), but as the number of incidence ions increases at same point or nearby area of the material, it will increase target material internal energy sequentially, leading to lesser energy loss in successive collision with higher internal energy lattice atoms. This happened with all additional implanted ions which are incidence at same coordinates of target, leading to greater number of collisions as dose increases, resulting in broader ion distribution inside the material. In such cases, there is large room vacant inside the material owing to cascade collision, creating very high damage inside the material as shown in cross-sectional view of three-dimensional disc as shown in Fig.  15 .8b. During this high-dose implantation, if the ion gets, somehow, periodic arrange gap path inside the material, then it disturbed the ion distribution and it may not be matched with the proposed Pearson IV fit or Gaussian distribution, which is known as channeling tell as shown in Fig.  15 .8c. Therefore, the ion distribution/strangling of implanted ion depends upon the type of ion species, nature of ion species, and charge state of ion, energy of the ion, and angle of incidence of the ion on the target material surface. These phenomena were theoretically estimated by Ziegler et al., with assuming nearly all approximation of activities of all atoms and materials given by name stopping and range of ions in matter (SRIM)  [17] . The ion distribution and ions projected range and ion damage can be theoretically estimated from SRIM calculations for any ion species. The change of projected range and cascade collision damage at different path of constant energy ions within the material surface at same angle of incidence is reflected in Fig.  15 .9. This clarify that incidence ions do not have regular or systematical travel path inside the material. Every single ion has its own path and damage track also. Initially all trajectory path is independent to each other but as number increased to millions times, large number of ions gets damage pathway to move inside the material resulted to more and deeper damage into the material  [13, 14] . To understand this, let's consider dose 10 3 ions/cm 2 in SRIM calculation. For example, the projected range of 60 keV energy of oxygen ion beam implanted on a polymer with zero incidence angles, i.e., normal to the surface of material for 500 ions, is 265 nm with straggling of 62 nm (Fig.  15 .10). These ions create lots of damages along their trajectory path as shown with green lines in Fig.  15 .10. All red line represents the ion trajectory path and green represents damages owing to cascade collision of implanted ion during their energy loss. Different ion species with smaller mass and size (e.g., B + , O + ), medium mass and size (transition metals, e.g., Fe + , As + , Ag + , and Au + ), and heavy elements (rare earth ion, e.g., Eu + ) with different energies such as 100 KeV, 500 KeV, 1 MeV, and 2 MeV are being used to study the their projected range and ion distribution with SRIM calculation at varieties of materials like polymer (PMMA, polyethylene), semiconductors (Si, Ge, ZnO, and ZrO 2 ), and metal (Al) as shown in Table  15 .1. Now, it is reflected that change in ion species and its energy leads to change in ion distribution in the material along with its penetration depth.  
 Ion Implanter A commercial ion implanter is same as ion accelerator. All procedures and process are identical to accelerators except ion acceleration capability which is limited as compared to accelerators. In initial time of ion implantation, the accelerators were being used as ion implantor which has no more their applicability in nuclear physics experiments, for study energetic ion material interaction. A schematic representation of implantation system is illustrated (Fig.  15.11) . The basic elements required in this technique are ion source, acceleration column, mass separator, and target chamber. Ions are generated through ionization discharge of atoms and molecules of vapor or gaseous chemical compounds. There are several ionization techniques to produce ions such as thermal ionization, RF, and microwave ionization. The ionized ions are being influenced by magnetic field inside the ion source to keep them in gyro-motion to produce more and more energy of that particular ion to enhance its penetration into the material. The acceleration column is used to accelerate ion energy up to a limited range, control the ion energy, and momentum of ions. The developed ions inside the ion source are being separated to each other on the basis of their mass corresponding to their size and atomic number is analyzed by their gyro-radius motion under the influence of magnetic force, which is always perpendicular to the charge ions motion, owing to their different mass to charge ratio for each type of ions. This is being used to identify or select right charge state ion species from the accelerating ions inside the accelerator tube. The charge species with less mass to charge ratio (blue line) gets defected more as compared to high mass to charge ratio (red line) ion species (Fig.  15 .12). This m/q ratio analysis is being used to filter suitable charge state ion species through the slit of the flight tube. After the selection of right and correct ion species, it is being accelerated through a voltage difference arrangement to enhance its energy and momentum according to desire purpose for the target materials. In the last section, there is a sample holder in the high vacuum to expose with energetic  ions. The sample in the holder can be moved or implanted ion beam can be moved in horizontal and vertical direction to achieve required implanted ion distribution in the desired region of the sample. The total number of ions entering into the target material/sample is known as dose or fluence. If the current associated with ion beam is I, then for a ion beam to sweep over a area A, the fluence or dose can be expressed as: ; ¼ 1 QA Idt where Q is the total charge on the ion and t is the total time of ion implantation or ion material interaction/exposure time. The accurate ion current can be measured by use of small positive bias around the Faraday cup cage. With different types of available ion sources, a wide variety of ion beams may be produced with sufficient ion energy for implantation purpose to fabricate different types of semiconductor devices and for integrated circuit technology. 
 Annealing It is a process in which activated atoms move to their suitable surrounding (environment) position inside the material volume owing to reduce their energy and enhance their stability. Thus, after ion implantation on semiconductor wafer or any type of material, rearrangement of their atoms/molecule is very important in order to achieve their previous characteristic with some required enhancement in their desirable properties, for example, increase in the electrical conductivity and stability of silicon wafer in case of VLSI or circuit design  [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . In this process, lattice gets repaired and dopant atom gets access to sit at lattice sites. These things can happen via two ways, firstly, by the movement of atoms and, secondly, by the diffusion of atoms. For the movement of atoms, it requires 5.0 eV of activation energy while for diffusion it requires 3.0-4.0 eVof activation energy. For VLSI integrated circuit, it is important during annealing that the dopant ions should not diffuse to a larger distance inside the material, so that the shallow dopant remains shallow and can be used for desirable applications  [20] [21] [22] . Therefore, for the rearrangement of atoms or repairing of ion implanted materials, it is very important to control the temperature or activation energy of ion or atoms in the implanted wafer/material. 
 Furnace Annealing The features of implanted ion species and their fluence define annealing characteristics of the implanted material. There are several cases where semiconductor materials such as Si have been amorphized and partially disordered. The regrowth of amorphized Si proceeds via solid phase epitaxy (SPE)  [18, 21, 22] . The atom/ions movements inside the semiconductor material depend on the crystal orientation as well as on the temperature of the material. It is important to note here that the activation energy required for solid phase epitaxy of amorphized Si is 2.3 eV, which is required to break the interfacial bond. Some impurities such as C, O, N, and Ar impede the growth process because it is believed that these form bond with broken silicon bonds. Whereas ion implanted species such as B, P, and As enhance the regrowth rate by ten times at high level of ion fluences such as 10 20 atoms/cm 3 owing to weakened bonds and increase in the likelihood of broken bonds of the substitutional impurities. Further, if the ion implantation could not generate amorphous layer inside the material, then the lattice repair only possible via diffusion of point defects required 5.0 eV activation energy and required high temperature of the order of 900 C to remove all the defects from the desirable portion of the material. At such high temperature, the competition between the atom movement and diffusion via solid phase epataxy and local diffusive arrangement can lead to the formation of polysilicon. Thus, it is better to proceed hightemperature treatment followed via low-temperature regrowth. Therefore, it is easier and suitable to repair fully amorphized layer as compared to partially damaged or amorphized layer of the material. 
 Rapid Thermal Annealing The motive of ion implante into the material/semiconductor and its annealing is to rearrange the implanted ions at lattice sites with lesser or negligible amount of damages and interstitial impurities. This can happened only and only if damage repairing could be completed with minimum diffusion of atoms/ions. This indicates that heating instance to the implanted material and the way to give temperature within a time period play a major role during the repairing of atomic position at lattice sites. Only this will define the minimum diffusion inside the material. The furnace annealing is able to supply sufficient amount of heat to the material atoms with supply of high temperature but practically it requires time to load and remove wafers from the furnace chamber; it is at least 15 min in order to get well-settled atoms without any stressing of lattice atoms  [8, 14, 18] . This time is very large as compared to time taken by the material in their repairing. Therefore, diffusion is unavoided. Rapid thermal annealing is the process that covers several techniques, such as adiabatic annealing, thermal flux, and isothermal annealing, of heating wafers for very shorter time up to nanoseconds to longer up to 100 s with minimum diffusion accessibility of atoms in the wafer or semiconductor materials. The dopant profile/ion distribution inside the material changes with time and temperature very quickly owing to faster movement of ions at primary/initial temperature exposure (Fig.  15.13) . This creates faster arrangement of ions in shorter region in few seconds but it plays effective role up to few atomic layers only as time exposure increases the deeper atomic layers are also employed to repair its mismatched lattice positions. But at higher exposer time with temperature, it distributes ions in broad regions, i.e., it can go up to nonmodified region also (Fig.  15.13) . It means to repair deeper depth ion distribution, longer time exposure of material with thermal flax energy is required. The complete time-dependent annealing and atomic arrangement shows schematically the cross-sectional view at atomic level in Fig.  15 .14. Blue and green are two different ion species implanted into the material. During the repairing or rearrangement of lattice atoms, these two different ions may come to nearby lattice places and could form an additional compound inside it. Such types of experimental reports are available  [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The most suitable rapid thermal annealing process is isothermal annealing, where tungsten halogen lamps are being used to generate heat for heating the implanted wafer from one side or both sides, owing to create suitable activation energy without much diffusion (Fig.  15.15) . This annealing procedure provides merit for VLSI proceedings owing to good activation without any larger diffusion as compared to other two annealing techniques  [18, 22] . In order to fabricate shallow junction devices, rapid  
 Shallow Junction Formation In order to fabricate today's advance semiconductor devices, there are several parts where shallow junction is more useful and important then deeper junctions, especially in case of sensor applications. The junction fabrication up to depth of subnanometer or less is required for deep submicrometer devices that can be achieved from different types of variation in the ion implantation technique such as by lowering the ion implantation energy and increasing the angle of incidence. Any of these changes in ion implantation will reduce the chances of cascade collision at deeper level within the material and prominent nuclear loss mechanism will be at near or subsurface level of the material (as discussed above). 
 High-Energy Implantation The high-energy ion implantation techniques are frequently being used in VLSI fabrication. It is being used to develop isolation region deep inside the material to separate characteristics of two division/areas/portion of the fabricated individual device. It is also used to fabricate tubs in CMOS structures as shown in schematic cross-section of an epi-substrate (Fig.  15.16) . It offers several advantages over traditional epitaxial CMOS processes. Firstly, the tubs can be fabricated through sequential ion implantation with different ion energy followed via short thermal annealing procedures to cover a subnanometer range. Secondly, the tubs characteristic can be improved further by varying the ion dopant concentration such that tubs surface is less doped as compared to bottom regions. This technique has some advantages for the fabrication of tub transistors as it can easily create epi-substrates for the transistor. This substrate can be distributed together by high-energy ion implantation. This technique is being used to fabricate buried layers, and heavily doped layers during the device fabrication process. Ion implantation as atomic arrangement technique: Literature reports and device fabrication techniques indicate that postdepositional treatments, e.g., thermal annealing, improved phase stability and repair the atomic arrangements of the materials  [16, 31] . However, as discussed previously, thermal annealing is associated with temperature gradient across the material thickness which might result in undue crystal growth at higher temperature owing to much more diffusion of atoms/ions. This is found to be not suitable for processing semiconductor fabrication such as VLSI or CMOS devices, as uncontrolled crystal growth could destroy the structure. Alternately, high-energy incident ions of the order of 100 MeV have been reported as a postdepositional treatment by  Balamurugan and Mehta et al. in 2002.  Here the local temperatures can be potentially raised to the order of 1000 K due to the interaction of such high-energy ions with target atoms  [31] . They have modified the crystalline structure and properties of the copper oxide nanocrystalline thin film by employing high-energy ion beam as posttreatment technique to anneal the material owing to transfer of required energy to the amorphized atomic arrangement to move at lattice position of the material. We have also developed a new technique to fabricate nanocrystalline thin film employing low-energy and high-charge state (N 5+ ) ion beam. Here we have demonstrated that low-energy ion implantation plays an important and crucial role in order to change amorphous as well as semicrystalline copper oxide thin film to purely crystalline stoichiometric thin film with some unique and advance characteristic properties. This happens because of heat transfer from low-energy ion implantation to amorphous constituent atoms through nuclear energy loose mechanism due to cascade collision. This procedure has one advantage over as commercial pulsed laser deposition technique for copper oxide thin film because bare fabricated copper oxide thin film has mixed phase as well as poor conductivity, whereas ion implantation treated copper oxide reflects pure single phase of copper oxide thin film with enhanced electrical conductivity  [16] . The complete process can be understood by schematic representation as shown in Fig.  15 .17 for synthesized copper oxide thin film by PLD technique, where bare prepared thin film is being exposed to high-energy ion beam as posttreatment technique, which resulted for the increase in the disordering and modification in the grain boundaries structure. This specimen sample (thin film) is then exposed to thermal annealing to get it ordered and arrange lattice atoms. Furthermore, similar mixed phase or amorphous phase synthesized copper oxide thin film prepared by PLD technique is being implanted with low-energy (N 5+ ) ions. This posttreatment with low-energy ion beam resulted for the fabrication of pure and single phase crystalline copper oxide thin film with enhanced electrical conductivity as compared to bare one. This upgradation in the thin film characteristic is due to rearrangement of copper and oxygen atom at their respective lattice site owing to get sufficient activation energy and collision stress of constituent atoms, resulted for the controlled diffusion of atoms/ions through defect points as comparison to atomic movement to limited range. This complete process is schematically illustrated in Fig.  15 .18, where (a, b, and c) are the three different situation of atomic arrangement during and after the ion implantation treatment. It is demonstrated that after treatment amorphous thin film converted to regularly arranged lattice ordered thin film material with dopant concentration, with well-defined grain boundaries and grain size. Therefore, suitable amount of ion energy can be used for the fabrication of the suitable semiconductor devices like VLSI, circuit design, sensors, etc., owing to its characteristics features as annealing techniques. 
 Introduction Innovations and discoveries have been made in a wide range of scientific fields as a result of continual improvements in science and technology. As science has advanced, nano-and atomic-scale materials have been developed to produce a variety of new materials with improvements in elemental output. It has become apparent through nanotechnology that the world's outlook is changing in many ways, and it has had a tremendous impact on medicine  [1, 2] , materials  [3] , electronics  [4, 5] , and many others. According to technical evolution, nanomaterials can be classified from zerodimensional (0D) to three-dimensional (3D). Quantum dots are an example of a zerodimensional (0D) material, while nanoribbons, nanotubes, and nanowires are examples of a one-dimensional (1D) material. Graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, and nanoballs are examples of 2D (two-dimensional) materials, while nanocones and nanoballs represent 3D materials  [6, 7] . Nanostructured based on carbon is a pioneering material in nanotechnology. Due to the numerous bonding patterns, carbon is one of the essential elements for life on earth, and it is found in many allotropic forms. There are a variety of carbon-based nanomaterial with attractive structural and physiochemical properties, such as graphene, nanotubes, and fullerenes  [8, 9] . Among the various 2D carbon materials, graphene is known for its superior properties in terms of physical, thermal, and electrical characteristics. The growing number of scientific publications related to graphene since its discovery in 2004  [10]  indicates that it is one of the most studied allotropes of carbon in material science. In 2021, Web of Science estimates that a total of 49,100 publications have been published about 2D materials, as compared to 1900 in 2004  [11] . As a new class of materials, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer unique properties that make them highly appealing for fundamental studies of novel physical phenomena, as well as for nanoscale sensing and actuation applications. Furthermore, for the development of other 2D materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and black phosphorous, graphene is considered as the fundamental building block  [12, 13, 15] . There are four basic categories of 2D materials which include metallic compounds, nonmetallic compounds, organic compounds, and salts. Figure  16 .1 shows the various classification and the basic crystal structure 2D materials. Transition metal dichalcogens (TMD) have the formula MX2, where M is a transition metal and X is a chalcogen. As a result of their trilayer covalent bonds, their crystal structure looks like X-M-X  [16, 17] . The enhanced mechanical, electrical, and optical properties of these 2D materials make them suitable for a wide range of applications such as transparent conductive electrodes, photodetectors, solar cell, memory storage, etc.  [18] [19] [20] . Here are some brief descriptions of graphene and two 2D semiconductors: (a) Graphene: Graphene is a single layer of graphite, which is a carbon-based material that consists of layers of hexagonally arranged carbon atoms.  bandgap and high thermal and chemical stability, making it promising for electronic and optoelectronic applications  [23] . The present chapter focuses on the various syntheses of graphene and two-dimensional materials, basic properties, and potential applications of graphene and 2D semiconductors. 
 Different Methods of Synthesis of Graphene and Two-Dimensional (2D) Materials Graphene from graphite was successfully exfoliated by Novoselov et al.  [10]  in 2004, opening the door to two-dimensional materials and become the subject of attention. It is becoming increasingly important to consider large-scale synthesis of 2D materials with desirable properties, with improved control over their morphology, crystallinity. In general, top-down and bottom-up approaches are employed to synthesize 2D materials. The top-down approach involves the breakdown of the bulk material at a controlled process into nanosized structures to create a 2D material. The various top-down techniques include mechanical, liquid-phase, ultrasonic, electrochemical, ion-change, and lithium-intercalated exfoliations or chemical reduction  [24] . A bottom-up approach involves synthesizing 2D materials from atomic or molecular precursors that can react and grow to form a 2D material. There are a number of different bottom-up methods, including epitaxial growth, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), pulsed laser deposition, wet chemical methods, and microwave-assisted methods  [25] . A mechanical exfoliation technique involves peeling or tearing 2D material layer by layer from bulk material  [25] . It is necessary to control the interaction of Van der Waals forces between layers during peeling so that one layer is separated from another. By controlling the properties of the material such as geometry and exfoliation kinetics, it is possible to produce single-and few-layered 2D materials. In general, when layers are separated from each other, two forces are involvedlateral and normal forces. A normal force is applied during the peeling process to overcome the Van der Waals force, while a lateral force is applied between the layers  [26] . During mechanical exfoliation, a single layer has to be separated by a force of 300 nN μm À2  [26] . A modified mechanical exfoliation method for producing high-quality graphene and tungsten diselenide (WSe 2 ) has been developed by Yuan et al.  [27] . According to the author, synthesis can be carried out in a glove box for better quality by controlling the speed of exfoliation. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors can be synthesized by various methods, each with its advantages and limitations. Here are some examples of synthesis methods of 2D semiconductors: (a) Mechanical exfoliation: This is a simple and effective method for producing high-quality 2D semiconductors. It involves mechanically cleaving a bulk crystal of the material using adhesive tape or a similar technique. The resulting thin flakes can be transferred onto a substrate to form a 2D semiconductor. This method has been used to synthesize graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as molybdenum disulfide and tungsten diselenide. Mechanical exfoliation requires large fractions of bulk material in order to produce nanosheets of suitable size, which is a major challenge. Jin An et al.  [28]  reported that exfoliating TMD nanosheets (MoSe 2 , MoS 2 , WS 2 , and WSe 2 ) using a high-power femtosecond laser was possible. (b) Chemical vapor deposition (CVD): CVD is a widely used method for synthesizing 2D semiconductors. It involves the deposition of a precursor gas onto a substrate, which undergoes a chemical reaction to form the desired 2D material. CVD can produce large-area and uniform 2D semiconductors with controllable thickness and crystal quality. This method has been used to synthesize graphene, TMDs, black phosphorus, and other 2D materials (Fig.  16 .2). Multilayer thin transition TMDs that are suitable for device applications can be developed by using the CVD method over large areas. The CVD process has been used by Zhan et al.  [29]  to produce MoS 2 nanosheets on SiO 2 substrates. (c) Liquid-phase exfoliation: This method involves dispersing bulk crystals of the material in a solvent, followed by ultrasonication to break the crystals down into thin flakes. The resulting dispersion can be deposited onto a substrate to form a 2D semiconductor. Liquid-phase exfoliation can produce 2D semiconductors with high yield and low cost, but the quality of the resulting flakes can be variable. This method has been used to synthesize graphene, TMDs, and other 2D materials. (d) Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE): MBE is a method for growing thin films of 2D semiconductors by depositing individual atoms or molecules onto a substrate under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. MBE can produce high-quality and atomically precise 2D semiconductors with excellent control over layer thickness and crystal quality. This method has been used to synthesize TMDs and other 2D materials. 
 Fundamental Properties of Graphene and Two-Dimensional (2D) Materials Graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have unique properties that make them attractive for various applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and energy conversion  [13, 14, 21, 22] . Here are some of their key properties: (a) High carrier mobility: Graphene and some 2D semiconductors have high carrier mobility, which is a measure of how easily electrons can move through the material. This property makes them promising candidates for high-speed electronics. (b) Direct bandgap: Some 2D semiconductors such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have a direct bandgap, which means that they can efficiently emit and absorb light. This property makes them promising for optoelectronic applications such as photodetectors and light-emitting diodes. (c) Tunability: The electronic properties of 2D semiconductors can be tuned by changing their thickness, composition, and crystal structure. This tunability makes it possible to optimize their properties for specific applications. (d) Large surface area: 2D semiconductors have a large surface area relative to their volume, which makes them promising candidates for energy storage and conversion applications such as batteries and supercapacitors. (e) Flexibility: Graphene and other 2D semiconductors are extremely thin and flexible, which makes them suitable for flexible and wearable electronics. (f) High thermal conductivity: Graphene has extremely high thermal conductivity, which makes it suitable for thermal management applications. (g) Chemical stability: Graphene and some 2D semiconductors are chemically stable, which means that they can withstand harsh environments and can be used in a wide range of applications.  
 Application of Graphene and Two-Dimensional (2D) Materials 
 Challenges and Opportunities in 2D Semiconductors Graphene and 2D semiconductors have shown great potential in various applications, including electronics, optoelectronics, energy storage, and sensing. However, there are still several challenges that need to be overcome for these materials to be commercialized and widely used. Here are some of the challenges: (a)  
 Conclusion In summary, graphene and 2D semiconductors have unique properties due to their thin and flat structure, and they have potential applications in various fields such as electronics, optoelectronics, and energy storage. 2D semiconductors can be synthesized by various methods, each with its advantages and limitations. The choice of synthesis method depends on the specific material and application requirements. Ongoing research is focused on developing new synthesis methods and optimizing the properties of these materials for practical applications. 
 Introduction Biosensors are devices or probes that that uses biological molecules, such as enzymes or antibodies, in combination with an electronic component to generate measurable signals to detect the presence of a target molecule or analyte  [1, 2] . Electronic components detect, record, and transmit information regarding physiological changes or environmental chemicals or biological materials  [3, 4] . In addition to measuring specific pathogens and toxic chemicals at low concentrations, biosensors are available in varying sizes and shapes. Figure  17 .1 shows the various important components. The design of a biosensor typically involves the following components: (a) Analyte: Substances of interest that need to be analyzed. An example of this is glucose, which is an "analyte" in a biosensor that detects glucose. (b) Bioreceptor: This is the biological molecule that specifically recognizes the target analyte. Depending on the analyte's nature, it may be an enzyme, antibody, or nucleic acid. (c) Transducer: The recognition element generates a signal, which is converted into a measurable electrical, optical, or mechanical signal by using transducer. In a biosensor, the transducer is an essential component. Examples of transducers include electrodes, optical fibers, and piezoelectric materials. (d) Electronics: It processes and displays the signal transduced by the biosensor. In order to increase the sensitivity and accuracy of the biosensor, signal amplification mechanisms can be incorporated. This can include enzymatic amplification or the use of nanoparticles. (e) Display: A display consists of a system that generates numbers and curves in a user-interpretable format, such as a liquid crystal display or a direct printer. Microfluidic channels or chambers can be incorporated to facilitate the transport of the analyte and improve the efficiency of the biosensor. A control system can be incorporated to automate the operation of the biosensor and to provide real-time data analysis. An accurate biosensor must be designed based on the application and target analyte. There are various types of biosensors, including electrochemical, optical, and acoustic biosensors, and each has its own advantages and limitations. Figure  17 .2 shows the function of important biosensor components. 
 History of Biosensors Biosensors have a rich history that dates back to the 1906 when M. Cremer  [5, 6]  showed that the liquid acid concentration is proportional to the electric potential arising between opposing parts of the fluid. The first true biosensor was developed by Clark and Lyons in 1962  [7] , which was an oxygen electrode that used an enzyme (glucose oxidase) to detect glucose levels in blood. Over the next few decades, biosensor technology developed rapidly, driven by the need for sensitive and selective methods for detecting biological and chemical analytes  [8] . In the 1970s, the development of biosensors was largely focused on glucose monitoring for diabetes patients  [9] . This led to the commercialization of the first glucose biosensors in the early 1980s. In the following years, biosensors found applications in a wide range of fields, including environmental monitoring, food safety, and medical diagnosis  [10] . The development of new sensing elements and technologies, such as nanotechnology and  microfluidics, has also expanded the range of applications for biosensors. In recent years, biosensors have become increasingly important in the field of personalized medicine, where they are used to monitor patient health in real time and provide personalized treatment options. Advances in biotechnology and bioinformatics have also enabled the development of more sophisticated biosensors, capable of detecting multiple analytes simultaneously and providing real-time feedback  [1] . As the field of biosensors grew, researchers began to explore new sensing elements and detection technologies. One important breakthrough was the development of biosensors based on antibodies, which could bind to specific proteins or cells with high selectivity. This opened up new applications in medical diagnostics and biotechnology. Another important development was the use of nanotechnology to create biosensors with high sensitivity and selectivity. For example, nanomaterials such as gold nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes can be functionalized with biological molecules to create sensors that can detect very low concentrations of analytes  [11, 12] .   
 Characteristics of a Biosensor Every biosensor has certain static and dynamic properties. Optimizing these properties affects the biosensor's performance. Figure  17 .3 describes the function of various biosensor characteristics. Some of the key characteristics of a biosensor include: (a) Specificity: Specificity is a crucial characteristic of a biosensor, which refers to the ability of the sensor to recognize and detect a particular target analyte or molecule with high selectivity and accuracy. The specificity of a biosensor is  determined by the selectivity of the bioreceptor or recognition element used in the sensor. Bioreceptors are biological molecules such as enzymes, antibodies, or nucleic acids that selectively bind to specific target molecules or analytes. The bioreceptor is immobilized on a transducer surface, as a result of which the binding event into an electrical, optical, or other measurable signal. The specificity of a biosensor can be enhanced by optimizing the binding interactions between the bioreceptor and the target analyte. This can be achieved by careful selection of the bioreceptor, designing the immobilization method, optimizing the surface chemistry, and controlling the environmental conditions during the analysis  [13, 14] . (b) Sensitivity: Sensitivity is another important characteristic of a biosensor, which refers to the ability of the sensor to detect and measure small concentrations of the target analyte with high accuracy and precision. A biosensor with high sensitivity can detect low concentrations of the analyte, which is particularly important in applications where the target analyte is present in small quantities or in complex biological matrices. The sensitivity of a biosensor is determined by several factors, including the affinity and specificity of the bioreceptor, the signal transduction mechanism, and the noise level of the detection system. The bioreceptor's affinity for the target analyte is a crucial factor in determining the biosensor's sensitivity. Higher affinity bioreceptors can detect lower concentrations of the analyte and can achieve a more significant signal response. The signal transduction mechanism is another critical factor in determining the biosensor's sensitivity  [15] . The noise level of the detection system also plays a crucial role in determining the sensitivity of the biosensor. Noise in the detection system can obscure the signal generated by the bioreceptor-analyte interaction and reduce the accuracy and precision of the sensor. In summary, the sensitivity of a biosensor is determined by the bioreceptor's affinity and specificity for the target analyte, the signal transduction mechanism, and the noise level of the detection system. A biosensor must be sensitive enough to detect low concentrations of the target molecule or substance, which may be present in complex biological samples  [16] . (c) Speed: Biosensors should be capable of providing results quickly and efficiently, making them suitable for use in real-time monitoring applications  [13] . (d) Reproducibility: Reproducibility is a critical characteristic of a biosensor, which refers to the ability of the sensor to produce consistent and reliable results over time, across different batches, and under different conditions. Reproducibility is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the biosensor in various applications. Several factors can affect the reproducibility of a biosensor, including the variability of the bioreceptor or recognition element, the fabrication process, and the operating conditions. The variability of the bioreceptor or recognition element can impact the reproducibility of the biosensor. The selection of a bioreceptor with high specificity and stability can help reduce the variability and improve the reproducibility of the sensor  [15] . The fabrication process is another critical factor that can impact the reproducibility of the biosensor. Ensuring that the fabrication process is wellcontrolled and standardized can help reduce variability and improve the reproducibility of the sensor. Operating conditions, which include temperature, pH, and buffer composition, can also affect the reproducibility of the biosensor. Careful control and standardization of the operating conditions can help improve the reproducibility of the sensor. In summary, the reproducibility of a biosensor is critical to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the sensor. Factors that can impact the reproducibility of the biosensor include the variability of the bioreceptor or recognition element, the fabrication process, and the operating conditions. Standardization and control of these factors can help improve the reproducibility of the biosensor  [17] . (e) Stability: An essential characteristic for biosensors used in continuous monitoring applications is stability. A biosensor should be stable over time, providing reliable and consistent results over extended periods of use. The stability of a biosensing device depends on its vulnerability to environmental disturbances inside and outside  [13] . (f) Portability: Many biosensors are designed to be portable and easy to use in the field or in remote locations, making them useful for environmental monitoring or point-of-care applications. (g) Miniaturization: Biosensors are often miniaturized to reduce the amount of sample and reagent needed for analysis, and to make them easier to integrate with other analytical or diagnostic systems. (h) Cost-effectiveness: Cost-effectiveness is an important characteristic of a biosensor, which refers to the ability of the sensor to provide accurate and reliable results at an affordable cost. The cost-effectiveness of a biosensor is a crucial consideration in many applications, including healthcare, food safety, and environmental monitoring. Several factors can impact the cost-effectiveness of a biosensor, including the cost of the bioreceptor or recognition element, the fabrication process, the complexity of the sensing platform, and the level of automation. The cost of the bioreceptor or recognition element is one of the most significant factors affecting the costeffectiveness of the biosensor. Selecting a bioreceptor that is widely available, stable, and cost-effective can help reduce the cost of the sensor  [18, 19] . 
 Classification of a Biosensor Biosensors can be classified based on various criteria, including the type of biological sensing element, the mode of transduction, and the application domain. These are just a few examples of how biosensors can be classified  [20, 21] . The classification scheme used will depend on the specific application and the needs of the user. Here are some common classification schemes. 
 Based on the Biological Sensing Element (a) Enzyme biosensors: Enzyme biosensors are a type of biosensor that uses enzymes as the biological sensing element to detect a specific target analyte. In addition to being highly specific and selective, enzymes can change the electrical or optical properties of a target molecule to yield measurable signals. Some common examples of enzyme biosensors include glucose biosensors, lactate biosensors, cholesterol biosensors, and alcohol biosensors  [22] . These biosensors use enzymes as the biological sensing element and are commonly used for detecting glucose, lactate, and other biomolecules. Enzyme biosensors work on the principle of converting the specific chemical reaction catalyzed by an enzyme into a measurable signal, which can be detected by a transducer. Solid supports, such as polymers or membranes, are used to immobilize enzymes, and then the enzymes are brought into contact with the analytes in the sample  [23] . The transducer can be based on different physical principles, such as electrochemical, optical, or mass based, depending on the specific application. Enzyme biosensors work on the principle of converting the specific chemical reaction catalyzed by an enzyme into a measurable signal, which can be detected by a transducer. The enzyme is immobilized on a solid support, such as a polymer or a membrane, and is brought into contact with the target analyte in the sample solution. For example, in an electrochemical biosensor, the transducer may be an electrode that is capable of detecting changes in electrical potential or current resulting from the enzymatic reaction. The product of the reaction may generate or consume electrons, which can be measured by the electrode and converted into an electrical signal  [24, 25] . (b) Immunosensors: Immunosensors are a type of biosensor that uses antibodies as the biological sensing element to detect a specific target analyte. Antibodies are highly specific and selective, and can bind to a specific antigen with high affinity. Immunosensors work on the principle of converting the binding of the antibody to the antigen into a measurable signal, which can be detected by a transducer. The amount of signal generated by the transducer is proportional to the amount of target analyte present in the sample and can be calibrated to provide quantitative measurements. Immunosensors offer high sensitivity, selectivity, and specificity, and can be designed for a wide range of applications, including medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food analysis  [26, 27] . The antibody is immobilized on a solid support, such as a polymer or a membrane, and is brought into contact with the target analyte in the sample solution. The binding of the antibody to the antigen forms an antigen-antibody complex, which can be detected by a transducer. (c) DNA biosensors: DNA biosensors are a type of biosensor that use DNA as the biological sensing element to detect a specific target analyte. DNA is highly specific and selective, and can bind to a complementary DNA sequence with high affinity. DNA biosensors work on the principle of converting the binding of the target DNA to the complementary DNA probe into a measurable signal, which can be detected by a transducer. The DNA probe is immobilized on a solid support, such as a polymer or a membrane, and is designed to be complementary to the target DNA sequence in the sample solution. When the target DNA is present, it forms a hybridization complex with the DNA probe, which can be detected by a transducer  [28] . The transducer can be based on different physical principles, such as electrochemical, optical, or mass based, depending on the specific application. For example, in an electrochemical DNA biosensor, the transducer may be an electrode that is capable of detecting changes in electrical potential or current resulting from the hybridization complex formation. The complex may generate or consume electrons, which can be measured by the electrode and converted into an electrical signal  [29] . Based on the Mode of Transduction (a) Optical biosensors: Biosensors that use optical transduction to detect a specific target analyte are referred to as optical biosensors. Figure  17 .4 exhibits the schematic illustration of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor. An optical biosensor converts the biological sensing element's binding to the target analyte into a measurable optical signal. The biological sensing element can be an enzyme, antibody, nucleic acid, or other biomolecule that is specific to the target analyte. The sensing element is immobilized on a solid support, such as a polymer or a membrane, and is designed to interact with the target analyte in the sample solution. When the target analyte binds to the sensing element, it causes a change in the optical properties of the sample, which can be detected by a transducer  [30] . The transducer can be based on different optical principles, such as absorbance, fluorescence, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), or interferometry, depending on the specific application. For example, in an absorbance-based optical biosensor, the transducer may measure changes in light absorption resulting from the binding of the target analyte to the sensing element. In a  fluorescence-based optical biosensor, the transducer may measure changes in fluorescence emission resulting from the binding of the target analyte to the sensing element. In an SPR-based optical biosensor, the transducer may measure changes in the refractive index of the sample resulting from the binding of the target analyte to the sensing element immobilized on a thin metal film. In an interferometry-based optical biosensor, the transducer may measure changes in the interference pattern resulting from the binding of the target analyte to the sensing element immobilized on a grating structure  [31] . The amount of signal generated by the transducer is proportional to the amount of target analyte present in the sample and can be calibrated to provide quantitative measurements. Optical biosensors offer high sensitivity, selectivity, and specificity, and can be designed for a wide range of applications, including medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food analysis. (b) Electrochemical biosensors: Electrochemical biosensors are a type of biosensor that uses electrochemical principles to detect a specific target analyte. Electrochemical biosensors work on the principle of converting the binding of the biological sensing element to the target analyte into a measurable electrical signal  [32] . Figure  17 .5 shows the schematic illustrations of (a) amperometric/ voltammetric and (b) potentiometric biosensors. The biological sensing element can be an enzyme, antibody, nucleic acid, or other biomolecule that is specific to the target analyte. The sensing element is immobilized on a solid support, such as a polymer or a membrane, and is designed to interact with the target analyte in the sample solution. When the target analyte binds to the sensing element, it causes a change in the electrical properties of the sample, which can be detected by a transducer. The transducer can be based on different electrochemical principles, such as potentiometry, amperometry, or impedimetry, depending on  the specific application. For example, in a potentiometric electrochemical biosensor, the transducer may measure changes in electrical potential resulting from the binding of the target analyte to the sensing element. In an amperometric electrochemical biosensor, the transducer may measure changes in electrical current resulting from the binding of the target analyte to the sensing element. In an impedimetric electrochemical biosensor, the transducer may measure changes in electrical impedance resulting from the binding of the target analyte to the sensing element. The amount of signal generated by the transducer is proportional to the amount of target analyte present in the sample and can be calibrated to provide quantitative measurements. Electrochemical biosensors offer high sensitivity, selectivity, and specificity, and can be designed for a wide range of applications, including medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food analysis. They are also often portable and cost-effective, making them ideal for point-of-care testing  [33] . (c) Mass-based biosensors: Mass-based biosensors are a type of biosensor that use changes in mass to detect a specific target analyte. These sensors work on the principle that when a target molecule binds to a surface, the mass of that surface changes, and this change can be detected using various methods. One example of a mass-based biosensor is a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), which consists of a thin quartz crystal that oscillates at a specific frequency when an alternating current is applied  [31] . Figure  17 .6 shows the schematic illustration of quartz crystal microbalance-based biosensor. When the target analyte binds to the surface of the crystal, the mass of the crystal changes, and this changes the oscillation frequency. The amount of frequency change is proportional to the mass of the target analyte that has bound to the crystal surface. Mass-based biosensors have many applications in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food analysis.    
 Conclusion In summary, the goal of biosensor design is to create a sensitive, specific, and reliable device that can accurately detect the presence of the target analyte in a complex biological sample. The history of biosensors demonstrates the immense potential of integrating biology and engineering to create innovative sensing technologies that can improve our quality of life. The specificity of a biosensor is critical to ensure accurate and reliable detection of the target analyte and is achieved by selecting the appropriate bioreceptor and optimizing the detection conditions. A biosensor with high sensitivity is essential in applications where the target analyte is present in low concentrations or in complex biological matrices. Biosensors have a wide range of applications and are becoming increasingly important in many fields due to their sensitivity, specificity, and ability to provide real-time monitoring and analysis.  
 Introduction With so many obstacles posed by component miniaturization, scaling down transistors to dimensions less than 5 nm is a top priority for the VLSI industry. To meet the problems of emerging technologies, several studies are being conducted throughout the world. This chapter discusses some of the alternatives to the current silicon FinFET transistor that might be used to solve the challenges of scaling it below the 5 nm node, including carbon nanotube FET, gate-all-around tunnel FET, and compound semiconductors. Microelectronics and computer-aided ultra-large-scale integration (ULSI) design technologies have reached a new pinnacle as a result of the continuous shrinking of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) device size  [1] . Because of its increased speed, enhanced performance, and lower power consumption, MOS integrated circuits have opened the way for real-time applications in computing, communication, and entertainment. The downsizing of transistors has been a driving force behind the exponential growth of the electronic revolution. The device's voltages have not decreased despite the device's rapid miniaturization and the rapid advancement of lithographic technology. When the applied voltage is raised, the electric field is also raised, resulting in a greater injection of hot electrons into the gate and a larger injection current. When the gate lengths are made smaller, short-channel effects (SCEs) begin to manifest in the circuit. Multi-gate tunnel FETs have evolved into an intrinsic reality that drastically reduces SCE in semiconductors, mitigating the deterioration impact. Future MOS engineering can benefit from the design and analysis of nanoscale TFETs to further reduce SCE. Traditional planar MOSFET's ultimate performance is threatened by short-channel effects such as threshold voltage roll-off, drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL), velocity saturation, and hot carrier effects as a result of its reduction in size. There are several gate terminals for the device to be controlled, which helps to counteract the negative impacts of the short-channel effects  [2] . Lessening a body's thickness reduces its mobility because scattering from the surface roughness rises with decreasing thickness. Compared to 2D structures, FinFET's 3D architecture makes it less effective in dissipating heat. The unique properties of TFETs, such as low leakage current, subthreshold swing less than 60 mV/dec, and minimal temperature dependence, make them promising devices that can replace traditional MOSFETs. The presence of a quantum tunneling barrier in TFETs is a major selling point for these devices. In order to simplify the design and fabrication of a device and gain a deeper understanding of its physics at the sub-nanometer scale, device modeling is essential. 
 Concepts Fundamental to Tunneling The quantum phenomenon of tunneling describes the passage of a particle through a potential barrier when the particle lacks the energy necessary to overcome the barrier directly. Classical particles do not exhibit this kind of behavior. Figure  18 .1 depicts the split nature of tunneling. The tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) is a gated p-i-n diode that conducts current in the opposite direction of the applied voltage. The output current of a TFET is determined by the band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) of charge carriers between the source and the channel  [3] [4] [5] . In contrast, a MOSFET injects carriers using thermal injection. Since a TFET has a lower leakage current and suppressed SCEs, it is ideal for low-power uses. The device can be scaled to 20 nm because the BTBT area on the source side is only about 10 nm. Benefits of TFET include lower threshold voltage roll-off, faster operating speeds, and reduced subthreshold swing (60 mV/dec). Also, TFETs are not vulnerable to the punchthrough effect because of their reverse-biased p-i-n structure. 
 Tunnel FET Scaling The term "scaling" refers to the practice of minimizing the physical size of a device while keeping its electrical characteristics the same. By reducing the size of transistors and increasing the number of circuits that can be produced on a given area of silicon wafer, scaling allows for significant savings to be realized. Figure  18 .2 shows the relationship between size and gate length over time. MOS components can be made smaller using a variety of methods. Dennard were the first to propose using a continuous electric field to scale the results of experiments  [6, 7] . The device's metric  equivalent can be found by employing a scale with no units when the electric field E remains unchanged. In order to obtain the scaled device, we hold the electric field E constant and use a dimensionless scale factor. Constant voltage scaling is the second technique utilized to shrink the device size. The device is scaled by applying a dimensionless scale factor while holding the applied bias V DD fixed. 
 Tunnel FET Future Perspectives It has been suggested that TFET could replace MOSFET in some low-power settings. Figure  18 .3a depicts a TFET, also known as a gated p-i-n diode. Applying a voltage to the gate and the p-i-n structure causes the device to flip ON. Highly doped p-type and n-type areas are used to construct the source and drain. There is an inherent layer with a moderate doping level in the intermediate channel area. The silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) utilized in this case is a dielectric for the gate  [8, 9] . The device operates as either a N-type TFET or a P-type TFET depending on whether a positive or negative voltage is supplied to the gate terminal V GS . Transistor operates as N-TFET when positive gate voltage is applied and as P-TFET when negative gate voltage is applied. By applying a positive gate voltage, the energy barrier between the source and intrinsic area of an n-type TFET is lowered, turning the device on. Specifically, as depicted in Fig.  18 .3b, the energy bands in the intrinsic region are lowered. It is at this point that band-to-band (BTBT) tunneling takes place, with electrons moving from the valence band of the p+Àdoped source to the conduction band of the intrinsic body  [10] . After that, drift diffusion transports the electrons to the n +doped drain area. The source-to-drain region of an n-TFET only conducts leakage   
 Problems with Gate Oxide Scaling Expanding gate sizes has both positive and negative outcomes. The performance of the device is also greatly aided by the gate oxide layer that lies below the gate metal region. It is necessary to reduce the gate oxide thickness to manage the short-channel effects. The reliability of the devices would suffer even more if scaling was done at random. Current escapes from the channel and flows through the gate because of the exceedingly thin gate oxide. As a result, the device's performance suffers since the gate oxide layer is no longer insulating  [11, 12] . The gate leakage current increases the power consumption and heat production. Hence, there will always be compromises to make while deciding on the best gate oxide thickness and limiting leakage current. The fast-moving silicon industry is on the lookout for alternatives to the standard silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) material as the difficulty of scaling gate oxide slows production. In order to revolutionize the nanoelectronics sector, researchers are focusing on finding ways to take advantage of the use of high-K gate dielectric materials to reduce short-channel effects. The leakage current in PMOS transistors has been  reduced by a factor of 100 times to this new generation of materials, and the leakage current in NMOS transistors has been reduced by a factor of 25. The best way to boost the performance of the device, then, is to use a high-K gate dielectric material. Intel's 32 nm high-K metal gate design, the company's most recent innovation, will serve as the basis for the company's next-generation computer architecture. 
 Gate Metal and Channel Engineering Human life has been profoundly altered by the developing semiconductor industry. Researchers are making an attempt to put forward new concepts of gate metal engineering due to numerous geometrical scaling challenges in a semiconductor device. The current in the ON state is drastically increased by combining a couple of materials with significantly different work functions to form the gate metal. As shown in Fig.  18 .4, a multi-gate device is configured with more than one gate to improve the device's properties. The short-channel effects can also be reduced by the application of channel engineering  [13] [14] [15] . The term "halo doping" is commonly used to describe a nonuniform channel profile in the lateral direction. The channel length dependence of the threshold voltage can be modified using this technique. Symmetrical or asymmetrical devices can be placed near source or drain. The halo implants have a mobility that allows them to be set in either a vertical or slanted position. They are often introduced after the gate pattern has been finalized. 
 Multi-Gate Tunnel FET The silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technique is quite interesting because it allows for high speeds, superior scalability, and minimal power usage. Short-channel effects are drastically diminished in ultrathin SOI films. Single-gate field-effect transistor (FET) configurations have been phased out in favor of a variety of other device topologies in Fig.  18 .4 A variety of multigate layouts recent years. The main reason multi-gate devices have appeared is to boost the device's performance  [16, 17]    [18] . The primary problems with TFETs are caused by the fact that they are ambipolar and have a low ON current. 
 Subthreshold Analytical Model Significant short-channel effects become a factor in electronics with extremely shortchannel lengths, implying an evaluation of the device subthreshold conduction. The first person to investigate the subthreshold conduction of MOSFETs was Taylor  (1978) . Problems with gadget functioning and power dissipation are especially noticeable in subthreshold devices  [19, 20] . Transconductance to current ratio change approach has been proposed by Rudenko et al.  
 Modeling of Gate Engineered Dual Halo Gate Stacked Triple Material Surrounding Gate Tunnel FET The proposed germanium-based DH-GS-TM-SG tunnel FET is depicted in Fig.  18 .5a. Different lengths and work functions of the metals M1, M2, and M3 generate the gate materials in this model. We use a 2 nm gated stack (GeO 2 /TiO 2 ), a 10 nm thick germanium body, a 40 nm long channel, and a halo-doped region denoted by L 1 and L 5-4 with a concentration of N halo , and an acceptor-doped region labeled by N ai at the source and drain. The formation of a Ge-DH-GS-TM-SG-TFET   18 .5b using 3D TCAD designing. In Fig.  18 .5c, we observe the mesh profile of the updated model. 
 Surface Potential In Fig.  18 .6, we see how the surface potential of three distinct TFET architectures varies along the channel length. The silicon-based single halo triple material surrounding gate TFET structure and the triple material surrounding gate TFET model are contrasted with this design. TCAD simulation results are also evaluated with the suggested model to ensure accuracy. The proposed model has a lower turn on voltage than the long channel variant. When compared to the low-K dielectric, all three topologies exhibit marginally enhanced short-channel effects.   
 Lower Surface Potential Limit 
 Threshold Voltage In Fig.  18 .8, we see a comparison of the threshold voltage shifts observed in germanium-based DH-GS-TM-SG TFETs, silicon-based single halo TM-SG TFETs, and TM-SG TFETs. Compared to single halo tunnel FETs based on silicon and triple metal surrounding gate tunnel FETs, the threshold voltage of a germanium-based twin halo tunnel FET is much lower. The proposed design utilizes Si-TM-SG-TFETs, and with a channel length of 40 nm, Vth is predicted to be 20%. The proposed structure employs a Si-SH-TM-SG-TFET with a threshold of 15% and a channel length of 40 nm. Si-TM-SG-TFETs are used in the suggested design, and it is predicted that Vth will be 20% at a channel length of 40 nm. The proposed Si-SH-TM-SG-TFET structure has a threshold of 15% and a channel length of 40 nm. For various values of high-K dielectric material, Table  18 .1 lists the gain values of subthreshold swing and the transconductance-to-drain current ratio of As can be seen in the table above, the combination of titanium oxide (TiO 2 ) with germanium dioxide (GeO 2 ) yields high ION current, improved transconductance, and reduced subthreshold swing. Our proposed germanium-based DH-GS-TM-SG TFET is more efficient than both silicon and germanium versions of the triple halo, triple material surrounding gate tunnel fieldeffect transistor. 
 Summary The development of novel device structures and the adoption of alternative materials have allowed humans to take advantage of a broader spectrum of prospects in the semiconductor industry. In order to achieve a subthreshold slope of less than 60 mV/dec, gate engineered tunnel FET has been selected as the most promising candidate among numerous multi-gate devices. Tunnel FETs with gate work function engineering have greatly reduced the effects of the short channel. The lowering of the electric field at the drain side has especially significantly reduced the hot carrier and DIBL effects. Because of the lightly doped drain structure, the peak electric field at the drain side is reduced. Compared to the source side gate material, the gate material employed towards the drain end has a lower work function. As part of the design, high-K gate dielectric material and stacked gate oxide layers are proposed. A subthreshold analytical model of the device was developed to investigate its operation at very low-power settings.   
 Introduction For the ultimate scaled MOSFET production from design phase, the principal bottleneck that springs to the horizon is the concept of limits of lithography or the utmost level of accuracy of critical dimension (CD) features on the mask being transferred on the wafer by multistage lithographic process and precisely calibrated instrumentation setup. There are three main constituents of the technology improvements that have kept the industry in-line with Moore's law based trajectory of technology node evolution for a sustained time period up until now. They are (i) lithography, (ii) increased wafer size, and (iii) design. Roughly half of the density improvements have been derived from innovation in lithographic process and techniques. With the cost to fabricate a wafer remaining roughly constant being independent of its size or contents, this has resulted in 30% reduction in cost per function per year over this sustained period. The ultimate limits of lithography therefore depend on the interplay of science, technology, and economics. The critical dimension or CD resolution becomes ever more important pegging issue during the wafer line test or burn-in test in the process yield and as feature size has entered less than 10 nm, most of the yield failure happens at the burn-in test with the percentage can be as high as 50% from a group of wafer lot which has gone through successful fabrication process developments. Even after burn-in success, borderline CD variation, line width roughness, and line edge roughness can still make the final FET device parametric variability related failures like drift of threshold voltage, in the subthreshold region, subthreshold slope, or subthreshold current variation, and interface roughness scattering variation and all these anomalies at the final device probe test can lead to die failure and that percentage can be 20-30% taking front end of line (FEOL) and back end of line (BEOL) in total. Therefore, lithographic techniques for device manufacturing becomes increasingly important for maintaining high yield for manufactured device as their feature size has already approached less than 5 nm where 2-3 nm devices are currently in production  [1] . When the die performance benchmark yield is high, pricing per packaged devices can be lowered by the manufacturers for the consumers and then revenues and earnings also become high. So, what lithographic techniques are prevalent today? From numerical aperture of lens NA ¼ 0.33, to be compatible with feature sizes within 5 nm, the industry has gone to high NA or 0.55 NA with high optical beam source power 92 eV 13.6 nm wavelength extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV), and ASML has the most sophisticated version of lithographic tool to transfer these features on the chrome pattern in the mask to wafer. But still optical lithography is hitting bottlenecks or yield issues and burn-in test failures. As the source power is more, the resist thickness has to be lowered for high-NA EUV lithography for increased photon absorption rate but as almost all chemically amplified resist (CAR) and nonchemically amplified resists in organic metallic forms and metal organic clusters show that there are more surface scattering with the control of incident beam angle and in the end, the photon absorption rate is not up to the mark where the reliable CD as per mask pattern can be reproduced on the wafer. Additionally, the absorbed photons give rise to secondary electron and hole generation spatially somewhere middle to the lower depth region of the resist. Some of the high-energy electrons recombine with the holes but some of the low-energy electrons with high inverse mean free path (IMFP) quickly move to within 1-4 nm of resist and cause extra photo-acid generation that subsequently, after exposure, gets dissolved and after postexposure bake (PEB) causes resist thickness variation, mostly known as affecting CD contrast through resist blur interference. So, the engineers need alternative technologies to optical lithography. The most potent of these technologies are (1) quantum interferometric optical lithography that overcomes Bragg's diffraction limit and can reduce the CD size multifold which will be discussed, but high photon absorption may still generate higher number secondary electrons in this case also but if their energies are lower with impact when they are generated deep down the resist, chances of the number of electrons coming within top resist surface proximity is less; also since CD is more amenably reduced, resist blur probably would not make contrast problem in the CD to be visible in optical microscope. Then, there are other nonoptical lithographic techniques, (2) thermal-scanning probe lithography (t-SPL), and using this technique recently an edge contact MoS2 2D FET has been realized with drive current within 1 mA/micron when the IRDS roadmap for drive current states it has to be within 3 mA/micron, so we are getting closer and in this technique, there are no optical photon absorption, no secondary electron generation, and no CD contrast obfuscation by resist blur. Next we have (3) nanoimprint lithography, a very promising technology with overlay control as enabled by mold or pattern generation by e-beam writing, and as precision is within the 5 nm ranges we are focusing on device manufacturing and avoiding the problems of optical beam source generation techniques such as high-NA EUV. Using nanoimprint lithography, a variety of memory and logic devices in current product demands have been manufactured. Next, we have (4) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) technique where through tip radius or diameter in close proximity to the wafer within nm separation and tip current modulation, mask pattern is directly transferred on the wafer with almost accurate precision, again not suffering from optical lithography related secondary causes for yield loss issues. The only drawback of this technique is that it has low throughput than high-NA EUV lithography, so batch manufacturing may be delayed from few hours to few days but wafer line test and burn-in test will result in less CD variation related yield problems. Finally, we are going to focus on another promising technique which is (5) block copolymer chain based self-assembly which has been successfully used to construct logic devices such as wrapped around gate FET and FinFET, and complex 3 D device patterns can be generated by the choice of suitable block copolymer chain and controlling their self-assembly based evolution into the finally conformed structure that we get by optical photolithography. So, which of these six techniques including high-NA EUV lithography will be the mainstream in the days to come? In the author's analysis, there are three choices, (1) optical interferometric lithography with multifold reduction of CD capability, (2) nanoimprint lithography, and (3) self-assembly based techniques. The prominent lithographic tool supplier ASML may need to shift their strategies and align with Canon's nanoimprint lithography and additionally using different block copolymer based self-assembly based device formation methods. Before we discuss these various techniques as listed in the introductory section, the limits of lithography from lowest CD pattern, depth of focus (DOF), optimum dose need to be discussed and for this author is going to analyze the classic reference paper of Lloyd R. Hariott in proceedings of the IEEE, March 2001 titled "Limits of Lithography"  [2] . The author of this chapter is at this point summarizing the key discussions in this reference paper  [2] . Leading-edge production lithography employs optical projection printing operating at the conventional Rayleigh diffraction limit. The image of the master pattern or mask (usually reduced by 4-5 times) is projected onto the wafer substrate that has been coated with a photosensitive material (resist). The solubility of the resist is changed by exposure to light so that a pattern emerges upon development. The remaining resist pattern is then used for subsequent process steps such as etching or implantation doping. The optical projection systems used today have very complex multielement lenses that correct for virtually all of the common aberrations and operate at the diffraction limit. The resolution of a lithography system is usually expressed in terms of its wavelength λ and numerical aperture (NA) of the projection lenses leading to resolution ¼ k 1 • λ NA , where the constant k 1 is dependent of number of process sequences used in final pattern transfer to the die on the wafer. In IC manufacturing, typical values of k 1 range from 0.5-0.8 with a higher number reflecting a less stringent process or reduced number of process sequence. The NA of optical lithography tool ranges from about 0.5-0.6 nowadays. Therefore, in order to maintain the CD resolution on wafer as per scaled node evolution, the smallest resolved wavelength λ of the optical illumination source is necessary. It leads to the typical rule of thumb that the smallest features that can be printed on the die are about equal to the wavelength of the beam being used restricted by Rayleigh diffraction limit. Historically, the improvements in IC lithography resolution have been driven by the decrease in the printing wavelength. The illumination sources were initially based on mercury arc lamps filtered for different spectral lines with progression along feature size evolution from 435 G-line to 365 nm I-line. This was followed by a switch to excimer laser sources with KrF at 248 nm and more recently ArF at 193 nm. The scaling evolution as per technology nodes suggests that the progress warranted in IC minimum feature size is on a much steeper slope than the trendline of reduction factor of lithographic wavelength. This stipulates resolution improvement to be on a more stringent path dictated by IC minimum feature size reduction over successive generations and thus with every lithographic technology improvement, attentions have been directed toward numerical aperture or NA adaptation or engineering in maintaining the resolution of fabricated feature size on the semiconductor wafer. The ability to print features significantly less than the wavelength of the exposure radiation can be largely attributed to improvements in the imaging resist materials. Modern resists exhibit very high imaging contrast and act as thresholding function on the aerial image produced by the optical system. In other words, even though the light intensity image turns out to be less than full modulation for the small features in traversal of overall contours, the combination of high-contrast imaging material and good process (exposure dose) control can reliably produce subwavelength features. In this way, the improvements in imaging resists have lowered the value for k 1 . One of the key functional abilities of any highly evolved lithographic technique is the image size reduction capability. As has been aforementioned, the image of the mask is generally reduced by a factor of four to five when it is printed on the wafer and equal CD size on mask and die are prohibitive from the point of high-contrast reliable pattern transfer. The main reason for this is due to the mask making process. Masks are patterned by a scanned electron or laser beam primary pattern generator. The original resolution preservation and placement accuracy of the pattern generator are the basis for the optical printing system. Reduction imaging relaxes the requirements on the pattern generators' beam exposure which makes the CD resolution on the pattern generator's exposure beam to be 4-5 times larger than the CD specifications on the wafer. In the regime where feature sizes printed on the wafer are less than the exposure wavelength, the process is deemed highly nonlinear. In terms of the mask, this introduces a complication referred to as mask error enhancement factor (MEEF). This regime usually puts the k 1 factor to be less than 0.5 where less of the light diffracted by the mask is accepted by the entrance pupil of the imaging system and contrast is lost. One of the consequences of lithography in this nonlinear imaging regime is that the enhancement of the printing of the linewidth control errors on the mask. As a result of this printing error, although the overall demagnification of the feature size from the mask to the wafer may still be four to five, small errors on the mask are not suppressed by the magnification ratio. The MEEF is defined as the derivative of the CD on the wafer to that of the mask (corrected for the magnification ratio) or MEEF ¼ @CD wafer @CD mask and is usually <1. But for a highly stringent or aggressively scaled process node, k 1 factor can be below 0.5 and about 0.35 and for equal lines and spaces on the mask pattern, the mask errors are enhanced by about 2.5 times and MEEF will also significantly increase. To counter this, the requirements for feature size control on the mask are 2.5 times more stringent than one would otherwise expect with reduction lithography performed at larger k 1 . Thus, the demands on mask making costs are becoming more intensive and overpowering in relation to successive feature size reduction as optical lithography is pushed below the wavelength of exposure. Some compensation for the image degradation from diffraction are possible by pre-distorting the mask features. A simple example is a correction for corner rounding by using serifs. The addition of subresolution features does not enhance the quality of the image on the wafer somewhat, but requires the addition of these correction features on the mask, increasing its complexity and cost. This kind of approach on the mask pattern is referred as optimal proximity effect correction (OPC) and will be discussed in a while. Increased NA of light concentrating lenses is another route to improved resolution in optical lithography. Improved optical designs aided by sophisticated computer modeling are enabling larger NA lenses to be designed. KrF systems with NA ¼ 0.7 will be available shortly with NA ¼ 0.85 systems being designed. The penalties for these very high-NA systems are primarily in cost and reduced depth of focus factor affecting image quality and contrast transferred on the wafer. The cost of the lens and thus the lithography system scales roughly with the cube of the NA (volume of the lens material). At these large NAs, the weight and size of the lenses also present many practical issues. The depth of focus (DOF) of a system can also be characterized by the wavelength and NA as DOF ¼ k 2 λ NA 2 where k 2 is also a process dependent parameter generally taken to have the same value as k 1 . Since DOF / 1/NA 2 , this clearly shows the penalty in DOF for high-NA systems. Reduced DOF requires extremely tight control and planarity in the wafer process. For even a modest 0.6 NA system, the DOF is only a few hundred nanometers. Usable NA will be limited to some value less than theoretical limit of 1 by DOF considerations as well as effects caused by the refraction of the high angle light and polarization effects in the resist film. A practical maximum is currently thought to be NA ¼ 0.85. Improvements in illumination methods have also been adopted to improve lithographic performance. The resolution limit equation reflects the fact that the first diffracted order must be captured in the lens as complete as possible for the image information to be transferred by the optical system. Off-axis illumination (OAI) uses a tilted illumination to capture one of the first diffracted orders while allowing the zero order also to pass. In other words, the resolution performance can be doubled in principle since the aperture of the lens now must cover the zero and one of the first diffracted orders, whereas for a conventional system the aperture covers the span of the À1 and +1 orders. In practice, however, this method is limited by the fact that the illumination must be tailored to the mask pattern since the diffraction pattern will be different for different mask pattern. Specific illumination patterns (annular or quadra-pole symmetry) are chosen for specific types of circuit patterns to emphasize the performance of specific features such as line-space gratings. Other strategies to improve resolution include phase modulation in addition to the image amplitude modulation introduced by the mask pattern in the imaging system. Most photomasks are made using a transparent quartz (synthetic fused silica) substrate with a patterned metal layer (usually Cr) as an absorber. The mask and thus the image are then binary, full, or zero intensity. The optical system then creates an aerial image at the wafer plane that is a convolution of the binary intensity pattern and the diffraction point spread function of the lens. Phase modulation or phase shifting can improve the effective resolution of the system through constructive and/or destructive interference in addition to the amplitude modulation. There are a great many implementations of phase shift masks (PSM) but the earliest form was the alternate aperture PSM. A variant of this PSM using two masks for gate levels utilizes the first mask which is a binary mask to print the gate level of a circuit with conventional design rules. Then a second mask is used to reexpose the same resist pattern with a phase-shift pattern. This "trim" mask acts to reduce the size of the gates and can, in principle, achieve linewidths as small as half that achieved by conventional masks. In the time of publication of this reference article and as per the knowledge of the author of this reference article, this method has been applied to the gate level of a three million transistor digital signal processor (DSP) chip yielding gate lengths of 120 nm using 248 nm KrF lithography. An important aspect of the two mask PSM approach and many other resolution enhancement technologies (RET) is that while they improve the minimum feature size that can be printed, they do not improve the density of features over conventional binary mask lithography. The phase shift approaches improve the printing of isolated features such as gates but do not improve the minimum distance (half pitch) for the patterns. In terms of IC performance, smaller gates will improve the circuit speed and power consumption but they do not increase the packing density or number of circuit elements per chip. This has led to a bifurcation of the roadmap for the IC industry over the past few years. The progress in the minimum half pitch or density of circuit elements has been driven mainly by memory applications and has continued to follow the Moore's law trend with some amount of acceleration due to improvements in resist and NA (numerical aperture). Meanwhile, minimum feature sizes are driven by the speed requirements of the microprocessors and have been following a more aggressive trend. In general, gate sizes are almost one generation ahead of circuit density or minimum half pitch as a result of limitations of RET. From this paper, it is evident, for ever decreasing CD, λ needs to be decreased which for high-NA lithography is 13.6 nm generating very high source power of 92 eV which cannot be compromised. On the other hand, DOF is decreased as NA is increased and for thin resist film, moderate dose, and low exposure time, this may lead to CD variation, CD line width variation, and line edge variation. So, all high-NA optical lithography techniques will suffer from these intrinsic scaling worsening that this paper shows as lithographic limits. Now systematically discuss the various lithographic techniques and their applications in today's manufactured logic and memory devices as per lowest feature lengths. The author for discussion purposes puts asides the OPC adjustments on the masks and various forms of computational lithography techniques applied on the mask patterns, so that after development and etching, the CD patterns edge turns from roughness to becoming smoother although CD resolution is still controlled by photon absorption rate in the thin resist and computational lithography cannot enhance that as this is related to wavelength of light, numerical aperture of lenses, incident beam angle, optimum dose, resist thickness, and incident beam power (Fig.  19 .1). 
 Quantum Interferometric Optical Lithography In the reference article titled "Quantum Interferometric Optical Lithography: Exploiting Entanglement to Beat The Diffraction Limit" by Jonathan P. Dowling et al.  [3] , it has been postulated that using nonclassical photon number states, entangled N at a time, it is possible to write feature size of resolution λ/2 N in an N-photon absorbing substrate. This allows one to write a factor of N 2 more elements on a semiconductor chip. The N-photon absorption cross-section with N entangled photons scales as I (input flux) but not I N as is expected from classically uncorrelated N-photons. This illustrates the point that although classical N-photon lithography requires unrealistically high optical powers, entangled N-photon lithography requires the same level of power as classical one-photon device whereas enabling CD accuracy down to Nth order. The N-parallel or uncorrelated photon generation procedure is described in this paper very well. The author would like the readers to go through another very good paper that supplements this paper titled "Quantum Lithography Beyond the Diffraction Limits via the Rabbi Oscillations" by M. Suhail Zubairy et al.  [4] . Here CD resolution may be able to achieve lower CD than the one stated in the "Limits of Lithography," but I have already discussed that secondary electrons generation may cause CD contrast problem through much engendered resist blur problems. Otherwise, this is a brilliant technique with batch manufacturing capability of lowest CD and very high throughput.  
 Thermal Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (t-SPL) In the reference paper titled "Thermal Scanning Probe Lithography-a Review" by Juergen Brugger et al.  [5]  in thermal scanning probe lithography t-SPL, thermal energy from a heated tip is used to induce local material modifications. Heat is a universal stimulus for material conversion and can induce material crystallization, evaporation, melting, etc. in a variety of materials. At the nanometer scale where only small volumes are heated, characteristic times are of the order of nanoseconds. Hence, heating for few microseconds is sufficient to alter the material under the tip with precision and the mechanical scan movement of the cantilever becomes the main limitation with regard to the writing speed. As a strength for this technique, the authors of this paper rightly points out that no charged particles like electrons, photons, or ions are involved in pattern transfer, thereby avoiding unwanted creation or scission of covalent bonds, lattice defects, vacancies, or trapped charges. The authors of this paper rightly point out that this aspect becomes increasingly important for low-dimensional materials such as graphene and MoS2 which suffer from high contact resistances out of interfacial defects or dangling bonds. The authors then point out that a heated tip with an apex diameter below 10 nm can produce complex geometries with a lateral resolution below 10 nm which is compatible with direct write laser technology. To increase throughput, the authors suggested to combine a high-resolution thermal scanning probe with a fast integrated laser writer in a single tool. Applications of t-SPL include (a) single-layer top gate MoS2 2D transistor with record low contact resistance and on/off ratio; (b) edge contact MoS2 from another reference that reports current within a fraction of 1 mA/micron  [6] , so a parallel use of these devices can achieve the 3 mA/micron drive current requirement of IRDS roadmap; (c) InAs nanowire transistor overlaid with t-SPL patterned metal top gate electrodes; and (d) integration of t-SPL with a laser writer for fabrication of silicon based room temperature single-electron transistor (SET). The readers of this chapter are thus referred to go through in detail the comprehensive review paper of t-SPL as written by these authors. 
 Nanoimprint Lithography In the review paper titled "Nanoimprint Lithography for Nanodevice Fabrication," Zhiyong Li et al.  [7]  stated that since the year it was first developed, in the succeeding years till today, nanoimprint lithography has established itself as an alternative to conventional optical lithography technology and has found applications in many areas in nanoscale device fabrication ranging from more standard semiconductor devices and bit patterned media to more unique applications in optics, plasmonics microfluidics, and biomimetic structures. The authors further state that nanoimprint lithography can be defined as a use of the mold (resin) to define nanoscale deformation in a resist which is then cured either by heat or UV application. Once the resist is cured, the mold is removed and the patterned resist can be used as is or treated through etching, subsequent metal deposition, or other standard lithographic techniques to generate a final device. This technique is broadly separated into two categories, (i) hard and (ii) soft nanoimprint lithography. Hard mold typically generates high resolution of the order of 5 nm but with the cost of higher defect rates from the particles in the mold and trapped air bubbles on the nonconforming mold and substrate. To address this challenge, the concept of soft mold usage was extended to nanoimprint lithography through the use of elastomeric materials such as PDMS, polyimides, and polyurethanes with PDMS finding more usage. However, due to higher flexibility and thermal expansion of elastomeric materials such as PMDS, registration to existing pattern can be challenging leading to overlay errors. Soft nanoimprint lithography has been further extended to roll-to-roll nanoimprint lithography for extremely high-volume low-cost applications. The authors opined that nanoimprint lithography found applications in memristor circuits with improvements of molecular resistance switching, Nanoimprint lithography was also used to integrate memristor onto a CMOS chip. This showed the potential of a chip with a reconfigurable logic circuit similar to field programmable gate array or FPGA. Nanoscale optical devices fabricated by nanoimprint lithography include wire grid polarizers, Bragg grating filters, and LEDs with improved performance. The readers of this chapter is referred to this excellent reference for further information. 
 Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) In a recent paper published in 2021 titled "Probing Topological Quantum Matter with Scanning Tunneling Microscopy" by M. Zahid Hasan et al.  [8] , the authors refer STM as a potential tool to probe and discover emerging topological matter, because of STM's unprecedented higher resolution, high-precision electronic detection, and magnetic tunability. They underscore the key points of this technique that by combining scanning and tunneling, probing of the nontrivial properties of electronic and magnetic materials is possible. Scanning tunneling microscopy based study on topological materials can be employed in subnanoscale engineering in developing quantum information science platforms. This paper is bringing forth one of the most potential applications of STM in characterization of topological matters like topological insulators used in magnetic memory. 
 Self-Assembly Based Techniques Here, the paper that will be discussed is a SPIE Newsroom paper titled "Directed Self-assembly for Ever Smaller Printer Circuits" by Matthew Colburn et al.  [9] , 22 nm FinFET with side wall image transfer has recently paved the technological pathways to sublithographic line width patterning based on directed self-assembly (DSA) based block copolymer (BCP) chains. As stated in this paper, DSA combines self-assembling materials with lithographically defined template patterns to produce grating-like structures. Track-compatible DSA patterning processes have demonstrated that low defectivity wafer scale gratings with 25 nm pitch can be achieved after selective removal of one of the BCP domains. A strategy is still required to apply DSA to manufacture circuit patterns without aggressive customization strategies and the same stringent overlay requirements as self-aligned multiple patterning. The authors conclude that DSA applications include 29 nm pitch fins etched onto SOI, implementation of a library of miniaturized FinFETs and SRAM patterns, DSA is a vital technique for processing single-digit process nodes. 
 Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) EUV lithography has evolved from NA ¼ 0.33 to NA ¼ 0.55 with 13.6 nm wavelength and 92 eV source energy. It has been discussed with its parametric impact on feature sizes in the first paragraph of this chapter. Here we just take reference from the paper titled "Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography: A Review" by Ajay Kumar et al.  [10] . For EUVL exposure tools, high power is needed for high resist sensitivity which generally is difficult to obtain with CARs and non-CARS and metal oxide resists (MOR) and organometallic clusters are further sensitive to these high-powered beam as beam incident angle deviation is a challenge, so significant beam diffraction and scattering can result from resist top surface. EUV reflective optics, a suitable reflective mirror with multilayer coating, reduces reflection of EUV light rather than diffract and scatter with changes in incidence angle, so that transmittance through resist top surface is enhanced. This has a chance of enhanced absorbance through the thin resist with moderate dose as prescribed. EUV mirror optics and metrology is very well discussed in this paper. With any lithographic tools, subsequent defect inspection, defect density characterization, and metrology tools are essential and are generally provided by the tool suppliers with the fabrication tools. The author here omits the discussion of high data-intensive metrology and inspection of defects as few part per billion can affect the operational life of the product and therefore some of these products lose their efficiency in operation and cause added yield loss. 
 Concluding Remarks As discussed in the beginning part of this write-up, industry is highly pursuing for high-NA EUV lithography for better photon absorption rate that will impact CD resolution of 2-3 nm in an affordable way. But the problem of high-NA EUV lithography is manyfold. One of the key problems of the residual concentration of secondary electrons lies near resist top interface and interact with photoacid generation which dissolves resist in unwanted region and causes resist thickness variation across the pattern masking the pattern contrast through resist blur. For this reason, alternatives to optical lithography systems have to be pursued and thermal scanning tunneling microscopy, nanoimprint lithography, and self-assembly based block copolymer methods are proven to be highly effective in CD resolution with feature length as small as 2-3 nm in semiconductor device manufacturing. So industry efforts have to be developed and benchmarked for these lithographic techniques also. The readers are referred to some other excellent references  [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19]    
 Abstract High-NA EUV lithography deemed as the most successful patterning technique for feature sizes as low as 2-3 nm for FET architectures is reviewed for its patterning efficiency and associated bottlenecks that introduce various forms of stochastic defects causing high percentage of yield loss at wafer line test or burnin test. Secondary electrons related stochastic defects such as resist blur, photon shot noise, LER, and LWR are identified as possible defects detected for yieldrelated failures. A possible technique to minimize the concentration of secondary electrons near the resist top surface is proposed for the first time by the author in this chapter. Curbing or minimizing the secondary electrons concentration is identified as the most unresolved issue today from the perspective of making high-NA EUV lithography a successful technique the semiconductor industries are looking for deployment. 
 Introduction Due to the requirement of critical dimension or (CD) in the ranges within 3 nm, industry has increased the numerical aperture (NA) of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) from 0.33-0.55 with 13.6 wavelength and high power of 92 eV. Two of the requirements of optical high-NA based EUV fabrication systems are high optical power and high NA. Whereas for low exposure time, the resist must be thin, with such high energy scattering from top of the resist surfaces increases and reflectance from optical mirror stages for light concentration and focus decreases due to tight incidence angle variation requirements through the slit for the passage of light beam. These effects are detrimental for CD resolution requirement on the die. The other requirement comes from the depth of focus (DOF) which must be high enough for good photon absorption rate impacting CD resolution and contrast. Again, DOF reduces at a reciprocal of squared NA proportional rate when NA is changed from 0.33 to 0.55. For thin resist, such low depth of focus again may generate CD contrast problem due to short exposure time and medium dose. Higher dose to offset lower depth of focus related CD contrast generates photon shot noise and the entire pattern image now can be corrupted. Other problems of smaller DOF and inadequate exposure after ultimate postexposure bake may be line edge roughness (LER), linewidth variation across die, and from die to die a recently emerging most conspicuous stochastic failure related problem that is resist blur. A resist blur is the variation of freestanding resist layer thickness on which the pattern is overlaid and is mostly detected at the postexposure bake observation in high-resolution optical microscopy. When photons are absorbed in thin resist through optical beam rays, they collide with the resist molecules and generate secondary electron-hole pairs and most of these secondary electron-hole pairs are generated near the middle portion of the resist toward the lower half of the resist as the photons are highly energetic and secondary electrons-hole pairs thus released are also highly energetic. Some of these secondary electrons are required for photoacid generation or (PAG) action in the resist for optimum CD resolution after exposure. A significant number of other secondary electrons recombine with the holes. The remainder of the holes generally are low energy and do not induce or do not have enough strength to cause PAG action like electrons. A small portion of secondary electrons with low energy travel faster through the thin resist and lie near the top interface of the resist within 3-4 nm and avoid recombination with holes which remain trapped in certain larger depth from top interface of the resist. Now, high-NA EUV's most major problem is this residual low-energy secondary electrons concentration near the top resist interface and these electrons keep continuing chemical actions in the resist through PAG even when exposure time is set off and also cause additional PAG action when the exposure time is on. As a result of this, after development, these PAG affected resist areas are subsequently dissolved and, after postexposure bake (PEB), result in thickness variation on which the pattern is overlaid, causing pattern obfuscation or clarity of resolution observation by added interference or blur through this resist thickness variation. Minimum blur length also poses restrictions on barrier potential of resist to be sufficiently low and of the order of 3 eV which has not been detected through comprehensive research on resist materials involving chemically induced resist (CAR), nonchemically induced resist (non-CAR), organometallic resists, metal organometallic material cluster resists, and metal oxide resist (MOR). Also, another requirement is reducing the concentration of these low-energy secondary electrons near the resist top surface so that patterns cohere with the minimum resist blur window. In this chapter, the author will analyze one comprehensive review paper from literature on high-NA EUV lithography, its instruments related parameters related to CD resolution and challenges that high-NA system faces, computational lithography techniques applied to mask pattern, cost of high-NA lithography systems, and then will analyze through other reference papers the kinetics of secondary electrons generation, as well as their spatial trajectory and distribution through the resist, particularly their inelastic mean free path (IMFP) through metal containing resists like MOR which will be the future resists for high-NA EUV due to their considerably high photon absorption rate, and the author will suggest his own conceptual method of curbing the secondary electrons concentration near the top resist surface through combination of low barrier energy resist and also selective implantation of high density of ion traps within the 3-4 nm spatial distance from top resist interface that may annihilate these secondary electrons. If one trap annihilates or recombines with one secondary electron, that positive ion trap becomes neutral and will not charge the top resist interface. Similarly, other ion traps will do the same action. This method has not been suggested by other authors up until to date who did research on secondary electrons distribution and their effect on resist blur related stochastic defects and yield reduction issues in high-NA EUV lithographic systems. A concluding remarks or summary of chapter discussion will then be provided (Figs.  20  The Key Characteristics of High-NA EUV Lithography In these number of subsections of this chapter, the paper "High-NA EUV Lithography: Current Status and Outlook for the Future" by Harry J. Levinson  [1]  will be analyzed in detail. The readers will be also referred to other related references in the literature for amassing a sound understanding of different aspects of high-NA lithography tools, their functional characteristics, final pattern, and yield related challenges and drawbacks and then cost associated with the process of batch manufacturing of giga-scale integration of chips. As referred by the author in this article, a NA value of 0.55 was chosen so that 7 nm ½ pitch lines and spaces will be theoretically resolvable. Masks used in 0.55 NA upgraded from 0.33 NA EUV have the same form factor so that mask pattering or writing techniques remain unaltered using the modestly improved version of high-NA EUV tool. The angle of incidence is directly proportional to NA of used lenses and is inversely proportional to larger lens reduction. Because of the reflection geometry, the maximum angle of incidence is >2θ and the angle becomes larger and causes defocus or aberration as NA become larger or the reduction of larger lens used in the optics system is smaller. Here θ also denotes the illumination rays angle from the normal incidence line and for better CD resolution, this angle deviation has to be within certain specified range value. Because high reflectance from multilayered films is achieved by having in-phase beams of light reflected from the interfaces, the reflectance depends strongly on the angle of incidence. For Mo/Si multilayered films, reflectance falls off sharply for angle incidence greater than 12 . The initial choice of four times reduction of lens size was unable to maintain the illumination ray's complete rotational angle of incidence less than this value with immediate effect on poor value of reflectance. ASML and Zeiss have solve this problem by engineering eight times reduction of lens size which reduces the largest angle of incidence to 9.5 . The author further explains that the architectural choice of anamorphic lenses reduces the impact on throughput for the eight times reduction lens size technology in the scan direction but increases the difficulty of lens fabrication. Anamorphic lenses require mirrors that are not rotationally symmetric, necessitating the developments of appropriate polishing techniques that meet stringent requirements of figures and roughness. High-NA lenses are targeted to have figure accuracy <20 pm rms. Mid-and high-spatial frequency roughness is currently below 100 pm rms for 0.33 NA lenses and similar values will be needed for high-NA lenses to keep flare or scattered light to acceptable levels. The narrow range of angles of incidence over which multilayered mirrors have high reflectance has implications for lenses as well as for masks. Extending the lens design concept from the current generation of 0.33-0.55 NA results in large angle of incidence from normal line of mirror surfaces which is problematic. Increasing numerical aperture (NA) means that the largest mirror in the multilayered and multistage mirror systems should also increase in size. Automated robotic handling of the mirrors is suggested by Zeiss in place of human handling of such massive size mirrors in 0.55 NA EUV optical system manipulation and usage. Metrology of EUV optics is typically performed in vacuum, which necessarily required nm wavelength EUV light which does not propagate through the air and greater precision is possible in vacuum at optical wavelengths due to elimination of air turbulence induced measurement noise. The deposition of the multilayered coatings on the mirror's glass with sub-nm control also must be done in large vacuum systems. Fully assembled lenses are very complex consisting of more than 20,000 individual components. Considering the levels of complexity and precision in fabrication and measurement needed for high-NA EUV lenses, it can be inferred that substantial financial investments were required to enable the infrastructure required for high-NA lenses when these tools came to market. As with all optical elements of EUV lithography, the author continued in this article, the mirrors in the illuminator need to be of prime quality. Although the quality requirements are not as exacting as projection optics, each mirror must be fabricated and mounted individually with precision making way for complex pattern production through the mask onto the wafer. EUV illumination is broken into hundreds of pixels, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the number found in the illuminators of other optical exposure tools, because of this manufacturing complexity. The mirrors are movable enough to generate programmed illumination shapes. With the current illuminator design, illumination with pupil fill down to 20% can be used without significant loss of light intensity. The capabilities established by ASML to build and assemble high-NA EUV exposure tools are equally impressive to the author's statements in this article. For instance, to support more precise mechanical motions of wafers and reticles, new electron beam methods are used to weld the exposure tools' frames so they will be more rigid than in prior generation exposure systems. Electron beam welding must be performed in vacuum, so necessarily done by robotic arrangement in a vacuum chamber sufficiently spacious to accommodate the sizable frames being welded. The increase of lens reduction from 4-8 times means that the mask must scan during exposure at twice the speed of mask scans when 0.33 NA was used for EUV in order to achieve same wafer scan speed. Wafer scan speeds on EUV exposure tools are currently limited by exposure source power so they are currently less than 800 mm/s, but mask scan speed is still required for high throughput and this must be achieved with sub-nm position control required for nm dimension overlay and imaging. The modern lithography companies will also use laser produced tin-incorporated plasma light sources with its high-NA illumination sources. Such light sources, incorporating CO 2 lasers and tin droplet targets, were developed over the course of several years and have been used for high volume manufacturing since 2019. Accordingly, there is considerable experience with light sources that can be leveraged for high-NA EUV lithography. ASML is continuing to increase the output of LPP sources and 400-500 W at intermediate focus is currently being achieved with efforts going on for higher light output. 
 Key Challenges of High-NA EUV Lithography As has been stated and analyzed by the author of this article, while engineers at ASML and Zeiss are addressing the technical issues associated with designing and fabricating high-NA EUV exposure tools and optics, there are several other issues of concern to lithography engineers at various chip companies who need to create integrated patterning solutions using these tools with high wafer line or burn-in test yield. Resists with variable photon absorption rate have long been limiting the capabilities of EUV lithography. With demands for increased performance to meet the requirements of scaled feature sizes, resists are deemed to be existential constraints to achieve this goal even with continuing advances of lithographic materials. Early in the development of EUV lithography, it was recognized that resolution was limited by photoacid generation (PAG) rate after postexposure bake (PEB). Steps were undertaken by resist developers to reduce photoacid blur, leading to resists capable of improved resolution at a relaxed pitch. Later, the resolution can be further improved with feature size scaling by photoelectron and secondary electron blur control, which is the topic for next discussion in the chapter. It was also understood that line edge roughness (LER) has reduced the applicability of EUV lithography as feature sizes were scaled to smaller values. LER is fundamentally treated with quantum mechanical analysis. The small feature sizes required for patterning EUV lithography on die meant the rms dispersion of LER values that were smaller for other optical lithography methods at larger nodes became a more conspicuous teasing problem for EUV lithography. Moreover, the weakness of EUV lithography light sources to reduce the dose from high level to mid-or lower level has resulted in sizable photon shot noise to LER with its rms dispersion becoming larger. While LER and defects due to stochastic mechanisms are not fully specific to high-NA EUV lithography only, they are highly relevant, since in future, high-NA is expected to be used in patterned devices with giga-scale level integration of transistors, necessitating a lower defect number to boost the first wafer line yield or burn-in yield and on the other hand, with ever decreasing feature size, low LER is also required from device modeling perspectives, where parameter based variability get mounted due to LER variation intra-die and die to die and causing device performance variability in benchmark tested values. An important aspect in this chapter is that as the feature size continues to scale, the diameters of resist molecules become non-negligible fraction of critical dimensions, showing, at the molecular level, the resist is not structurally homogeneous. Inhomogeneity can result from randomness, component segregation, and aggregation. When photoacid generators (PAG) are not bonded to resist polymers, PAG-PAG cross-linked spaces will be variable and for a resist with high PAG loading, the author quoted the PAG-PAG separation limit to be 1.7 nm which sets the scale for roughness. In addition, variation in component spacings can be increased from beyond that expected from pure randomness due to the phenomena of segregation and aggregation. PAGs are polar in nature, so they can attract each other causing aggregation affecting the inhomogeneity based chemical actions in resist. Base quenchers added to the resist are subject to similar variability in distribution. Segregation in resist films has been observed for ultrathin resist films relevant to high-NA EUV lithography, even though the author opined that the mechanism behind this segregation is not well understood. Gradients of photoacids from top to bottom of resist films were inferred from simulations, where observed results could not explain this feature through models assuming uniform distribution of photoacid generation. Ultrathin resists are not only needed for avoiding pattern collapse but also to tune to low depth of focus (DOF) in high-NA EUV lithography making segregation related chemical reactions variability in resist to be precisely calculable. Also, for many years, the size of the resist molecule was considerably smaller than the feature size or device nodes at those times, so the detailed structure of resist was not highly important from process control standpoint we are seeing today. The generally used chemically amplified resists (CAR) on photoacid-induced deprotection are also subject to pattern collapse at tight pitches where height to width of the patterns are also getting scaled as lithography is being shifted from deep ultraviolet lithography (DUV) to EUV. Considerable research has been invested to mitigate the incidents of pattern collapse but the problem continues to persist below ½ pitches less than 12 nm. The fraction of the feature volume composed of lower rigidity material increases as shapes get smaller which leads to greater susceptibility to pattern collapse and a need to reduce aspect ratios (height/width) when fabricating FinFET and Trigate like transistors. One resist issue that will be discussed in later sections in this chapter and is common to all resist materials being used for EUV lithography is blur. The radiation chemistry in EUV resists are driven by photoelectrons that are generated by absorption of EUV photons up to certain depth into resists, and is an effect attributed to secondary electrons rather than photogenerated primary electrons which cause the main PAG chemical actions in the resist. Understanding the impact of resist blur requires the knowledge of minimum energy at which secondary electrons can initiate further PAG action and the energy ranges through which these electrons travel before they scatter and have insufficient energy to cause chemical actions. Later the author of this chapter will show that even after scattering, the residual low energy secondary electrons still cause PAG actions that aggravate the blur effects on CD. Current estimates from the distances of initial photoabsorption over which secondary electrons can induce PAG action is 3 nm although this is not a fixed value due to molecular level structural inhomogeneity of resist components. In addition to image blur due to secondary electrons, there is additional blur in chemically amplified resists due to photoacid diffusion during postexposure bake (PEB). As the nature of stochasticity indicates, the blur effect being statistical can be significant even when such incidences are small in number. Individual photoacid chemical reactivity is modeled to have random walk like progression based diffusion whereas, as will be discussed later in the chapter, secondary electrons trajectory can be Rayleigh to exponential distribution in energies interrupted by random scattering events which generate more secondary electrons in number. Random walks moving to one general direction can generate defects and even with low part per billion (ppb) defect distribution, they critically affect the first wafer line yield failure or burn-in failure acceleration. Metal oxide resist has deemed to be the future resist material with high photon absorption rate and better CD resolution although they generate scums that need to be removed after resist development. As will be shown later, suitable choice of metal oxide resist (MOR) controls the inelastic mean free path (IMFP) of secondary electrons in these resists where, compared to chemical and organometallic resists, the IMFP can be very large for secondary electrons in MOR and hence low-energy secondary electron concentration can be higher at the top resist surface and if their numbers are not curbed, MOR can be a source of extra PAG activities by these secondary electrons. The author in this chapter will also show a mechanism where when a MOR is found to have minimum energy barrier, positive ion traps can be implanted in a small depth from top resist surface similar to ion implantation process and these traps then can recombine with the excess secondary electrons and become neutral or ineffective in the process not charging the resist top surface. 
 Light Sources That Can Support Photon Shot Noise and Productivity Requirements Apart from the needed research in effective resist structure determination that will overcome resist related high-NA EUV lithography's problems and challenges as discussed in section "Key Challenges of High-NA EUV Lithography" of this chapter and as described by the author in his paper, there is an optimum dose in mJ/cm 2 below which photon shot noise adds to the rms dispersion variability of LER and defects that can cause yield problems and later if yield related tests passed, device operational reliability problems arise. It has been postulated in this paper that doses greater than slightly 80 mJ/cm 2 may be required for 10 nm half-pitch patterning. This imposes the light sources to be designed with sufficiently high output power to avoid low throughput and productivity. For a 500 W source power and 80 mJ/cm 2 dose for high NA of 0.55 for EUV, the throughput is 120 wafers per hour. To increase throughput to 185 wafers per hour, the source power needs to be beefed up to 1.3 kW with the same dose value as above. Laser produced plasma (LPP) source developed by ASML is capable of producing 400-500 W of output power. Increases in the output power of LPP sources have been achieved through higher efficiency in converting infrared laser light to in-band EUV light as well as improvements in pulse-to-pulse repeatability. Higher power infrared lasers further increase the output power of LPP light source. According to evidence in this paper, free electron lasers are being considered as an alternative to LPP light source for high power output. Such sources of light are based on particle accelerator technology. Solutions for Meeting Small Depth of Focus at 0.55 NA Focus control has long been a challenge for optical projection lithography. The Rayleigh depth of focus (DOF) is related directly to wavelength of EUV light and inversely to square of NA through another proportionality factor that is process dependent which the author in this paper omits in his analysis. For 13.5 nm wavelength and 0.55 NA, direct calculation gives DOF of 45 nm but it will be reduced further due to k2 or process dependent factor being less than unity. Larger value of refractive index of the resist n resist can allow deeper penetration of light into the resist and augment the depth of focus (DOF). However, for EUV lithography, the real part of refractive index of most resist materials is less than 1 making the blur detection length even smaller than the 3 nm limit. This necessitates use of very thin resists with obvious handicapped component segregation effect that decreases the patterning efficiency, decreasing photon absorption rate and possibility of pattern collapse issues as discussed earlier. Excellent wafer flatness will also be required, starting from bare silicon wafers and continuing through wafer processing. This places tight requirements on ultrathin metal film deposition circumventing metal polygrains granularity effects and particularly on chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Substrate uniformity will help the focus control but focus sensors that are insensitive to substrate effects will be also required. Polarization Control for Maintaining High Contrast at 0.55 NA At high numerical aperture (NA), image contrast is dependent on polarization of light rays of illumination light source as described by the author in this reference paper. Image contrast of two interfering plane waves can be maintained with large high NA with S-polarized light for which the polarization vectors are perpendicular to the plane of incidence but contrast becomes smaller for P-polarized light where the polarization vectors are in-plane of incidence and also for unpolarized light as NA increases. For this reason, the illumination systems of advanced immersion scanners provide polarization control. The LPP source discussed previously use unpolarized light and using polarizer to polarize light incurs more image contrast loss or polarization loss which is a sign of concern for low source power illumination sources used in EUV systems. On the other hand, the emission of free electron lasers illumination source is polarized providing additional motivation to choose it as an alternative to LPP sources for high-NA EUV exposure systems. The image contrast of unpolarized light sources such as LPP is improved further by refraction at the resist top surface directing to the requirement of high refractive index resist. Fortunately, for the initial application of high-NA EUV lithography, light rays at the largest angle by rotational symmetry for high NA will not be essential for typical fabrication related applications of high-NA EUV systems where contrast loss will be still tolerable.

 Secondary Electrons Kinetics, Their Distributions, Their Impact on Resist Blur, and Possible Way of Containing Secondary Electrons (SE) In this subsection, the author of this chapter finds it very relevant to analyze the reference paper titled "Localized and Cascading Secondary Electron Generation as Causes of Stochastic Defects in Extreme Ultraviolet Projection Lithography" by Hiroshi Fukuda  [2] . As the author explains, for EUV light projection, atoms emit photoelectrons in random directions upon photon absorption. Photoelectrons change their directions by elastic scattering conserving momentum, undergo momentum loss by inelastic scattering with generating secondary electrons (SE), and stop when their energies become lower than certain threshold level. Here the point is the light rays are incident on resist top surface with 92 eV, so the threshold level could be high hindering complete stop of SEs' and a low probability finding their concentration within fraction of a nm from resist top surface. As opined by the author in this second reference paper, discrete loss approximation is used in modeling electron scattering processes since scattering cross-sections are comparable for elastic and inelastic scattering systems for the low energy range of photoelectrons generated by EUV photons absorption. In chemically amplified resists (CAR), the probability of acid-catalytic reactions is in proportion to acid existence probability, which is approximated by a Gaussian distribution centered at acid generation site with a acid diffusion length resulting in resist related blur. On the other hand, metal oxide resist (MOR) providing higher photon absorption rate is also prone to much higher secondary electron generation and for MOR, the elementary reaction to flip the solubility of the molecules takes place somewhere in proportion to SE existence probability which is approximated by Gaussian distribution centered at SE generation site with SE mean free path acting as a blur which is different from resist related blur as observed for CARs. The author then discusses the role of secondary electrons in creating defects through a probabilistic model of pattern defects. The author of this chapter invites the readers to go through these findings narrated in this paper related to defects as defects detection and characterization are not focus in this subsection but secondary electron's distribution and containing their distribution within 3 nm of resist top surface to limit their impact on SE related blur. In another paper  [3]  by the authors, three different types of resists are analyzed for their PAG rate computation for (i) polymer only, (ii) polymer + PAG, and (iii) polymer + PAG þ quencher where it was found that SEs generate less catalytic crosslinking for resist type (iii). It has been demonstrated that low rate of PAG and chemical activity are found for secondary electrons with energies as low as 3 eV and this is also dependent on the barrier potential of the resist material where MOR are generally found with low barrier potential energy with their metal nanoparticles composites. There are also debates about the secondary electron distribution with its energies between 0 and 100 eV (for EUV, maximum light source energy is 92 eV) with focus on distribution shape below 10 eV. From Rayleigh distribution from a very low concentration within 1-2 eV, the concentration reaches a peak and then scatter and lose their number by electron-hole recombination at higher energies. The other distribution suggested is exponential distribution where the SEs are highest near low energy within 1-2 eV and falls off sharply as energies are increased as recombination effects with generated holes become a stronger effect and also scattering, making their concentration very sparse and sporadic. The inelastic mean free path (IMFP)  [4]  of secondary electrons as studied in some metals by a paper can be a very good source for understanding their generation rate to reach the resist top surface through very high IMFP but low kinetic energies for thin resists used in high-NA EUV systems. In some metals for energies below 4 eV, the IMFP of SEs can be as high as 12 nm and for photons absorbed within the 30% of typical resist thickness of 40 nm, this is really of concern as high-density SEs can lie near resist top surface causing PAG actions and resist thickness variation through resist dissolution and thickness variation after postexposure bake (PEB) known as resist blur, or resist's interference on top lying CD's image contrast. The author of this chapter proposes one authentic technique to contain these SEs' distribution near resist top surface with low energies. First, ion traps like H 2 + can be implanted following typical ion implantation process within the top 3 nm resist depth. These ion traps one by one will recombine with preexisting SEs there one by one and eventually generating a distribution of neutral H 2 traps. These traps can be subsequently annealed by highly directional and precision laser annealing mechanism, so that now there is no charging particles present in the resist and there are also no neutral traps or SEs present within 3 nm of the resist top surface with energies within 4 eV if a resist can be found whose barrier potential energies are within 4 eV. In this way, secondary electrons concentration and their resist blur effects can be minimized. The processes outlined here should be performed as fast as possible after exposure time is switched off. 
 Concluding Remarks High-NA EUV systems are analyzed here with their existing patterning challenges and the most conspicuous yield reduction for high-NA EUV patterning is the secondary electrons related resist blur. The author here for the first time proposes a technique to curb or contain these SEs within the 3 nm spatial depth from top resist interface. Although no effective solutions to decrease the number of SEs' generation are found from literature survey to date that complicates the most advanced sophisticated lithography tools provided by ASML and Zeiss where if SEs cannot be contained, precision metrology tools will be required for defect inspection which seem to some part per billion (ppb). This chapter's main focus is not defect inspection, because as long as minute level SEs will be present in the spatial extent of resist top surface, they will initiate PAG actions and cause blur, shot noise, LER and LWR (line-width variation), and yield loss. So, ultimately controlling their number density is important as they can propagate very fast to resist top surface owing to their high IMFP when their energies are low and recombination events are almost very low percentage. The readers are referred to the referenced articles  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]  other than the ones chosen in this chapter for discussion.  
 Contact Engineering for Contact 
 Abstract Due to ever-shrinking channel lengths of FETs, typical advanced fabrication techniques employed for source and drain junction or contact formation make the contact resistance and contact resistivity issue a very important factor for theoretical modeling and experimental precise extraction. Contact resistances are also important for probe based current measurement where probe contact resolution depends on the contact resistances of source and drain junctions. When contact resistances become larger than a few factors of the order of R ch or channel resistances which can be very low for ballistic FETs, the maximum achievable drive current decreases at actual measurement point at probe station different from advanced device and transport based modeling values. This chapter therefore investigates the physics of metal-semiconductor interface for contact resistance minimization and identifies key limiting intrinsic interfacial physics based factors for lower contact resistance measurements. Metals and their alloys and other methods are reported for conventional, III-V, and 2D FETs. Atomic layer 
 Introduction As feature lengths shrink and source and drain junction become in close proximity of one another, the drive current when measured at a probe station with a source contact probe and drain contact probe usually provides lowered value of drive current or drain current than estimated by numerical and other forms of simulation modeling. This is due to the high contact resistance of the source and drain junction formation owing to their close proximity, even when very high advanced junction formation techniques are employed. Therefore, these source and drain contact resistances when heightened due to the very scaled miniature FETs become of the order of probe contact resistance for measurement purposes and, therefore, additional source and drain contact resistances add up to the channel resistance and decrease the drive or drain current and for multigate structures like FinFET with high aspect ratios, these contact resistances can be very significant number and the drain current as a function of gate voltage or drain to source voltage, both can give less maximum saturated drive current which is typically used as benchmark metric for logic high "ON" current. Now before we get into the contact engineering techniques all focused on reducing Schottky barrier height (SBH) for conventional silicon FETs, III-V FETs, and 2D FETs, which is the main discussion topic in this chapter. First we intuitively understand what are the parameters generally relevant for SBH reduction so that tunneling type contact can be formed at metal contacted source and drain contact and ohmic conduction in place of rectifying conduction can eventually reduce the contact resistivity or contact resistance in the ranges so that roadmap drive current value decrease will be minute so that their values can be still acceptable. When metal and a semiconductor, in this case n-type, are brought in close contact, before forming contact through sophisticated fabrication techniques based alloying, metal Fermi level and semiconductor Fermi level are different and metal is generally highly degenerately doped with donor like materials so that its work function φ M is generally slightly higher than n-type silicon affinity or χ when the junction contact is in accumulation with electrons. Metal work function need not be generated by highly degenerately n-type doped material but it can typically have a work function close to conduction band edge of n-type silicon source and drain contacts. Now before alloying the contact when separated, metal to semiconductor intrinsic barrier height SBH intrinsic ¼ φ M À χ. When the alloyed junction or contact is formed, the metal to n-type contact is reverse biased both at source and drain and steep band bending occurs when the Fermi levels of metal and n-type silicon are aligned. The steep band bending more powerfully depends on n-type silicon donor density which has to be highly degenerated with values between 10 foot_24  /cm 3 and 10 22 /cm 3 both at source and drain junctions. We need to keep in mind that the reverse biased energy profile of the alloyed source and drain contact more resembling like a very narrow width steep line form reverse biased with very low bending at the edges of semiconductor conduction band edge where electrons tunnel from metal conduction band edge to n-type semiconductor conduction band edge, and the maximum donor density should be less than 5 Â 10 22 /cm 3 which is the maximum carrier density in a diamond like crystal structure of silicon. The bending of the reverse biased steeper energy profile near the n-type silicon side also depends on conduction band edge E c to Fermi level E F difference and that is the bulk potential of n-type silicon φ b . Simple equation wise, φ b ¼ kT ln N D n i , where to reduce the banding of energy band tail that connects with conduction band edge of n-type silicon first, φ b has to be as small as possible, so the energy profile will be more steeper with decreased tunneling width from metal reservoir electron to silicon n-type contact tunneling which is our goal for contact resistance minimization out of ohmic type of contact with linear current-voltage relationship that passes through the origin. For making φ b smallest, N D has to be high which we will see has been employed as one form of contact engineering technique for conventional, III-V, and 2D FETs for minimized contact resistance and as we know as N D goes into degenerate level or above 10 18 /cm 3 , bandgap narrowing increases intrinsic carrier concentration n i very higher than typical room temperature value of 10 10 /cm 3 but as the N D level is further increased from few times 10 20 /cm 3 to 10 22 /cm 3 , the n i quickly drops making φ b higher in these doping ranges typically chosen for source and drain contact formation in conventional, III-V, and 2D FETs. Lower φ b means metal and semiconductor Fermi levels aligned at the alloyed contact, and conduction band edge of n-type silicon will be shifted up causing more band bending rather than extension of steeper line type energy band profile formation and that causes the eventual rectifying contact or departure from ohmic contact engendering contact resistance. High tunneling current based ohmic contacts at the source and drain contact of a typical FET is also appropriate when probed with contact probing tools which also depend on high tunneling current at the probe contact in source and drain for the highest resolution of extracted source and drain contact resistivity or source and drain contact resistance. One of the reasons for decrements of n i at very high donor doping is the upshifting of Fermi level deeper into conduction band which generates less and less minority carrier holes p o in n-type silicon, making n i lower which overpowers typically bandgap narrowing based n i increase which was beneficial for lower doping ranges of degenerate doping but to reduce contact resistivity of n-type silicon source and drain contacts, the push is toward higher donor density. Another factor that may somewhat curb this rapid decline of n i is the increase of density of states (DOS) effective mass of electron with doping above 10 18 /cm 3 very much nonlinearly which increases the effective density of states in the conduction band N c which will increase n i to an extent which will check the decline of n i so that φ b increases near 10 21 /cm 3 donor doping of source and drain contact will not be that high so that the bended tail will still be extended in a shorter region before merging with conduction band edge of n-type silicon contacts of source and drain. This is somewhat beneficial for making the contact less rectifying type by decreasing metal to source and drain contact tunneling width slightly and enabling slightly better ohmic type conduction in place, a requirement for reducing source and drain contact resistivity to the level so that IDRS roadmap based maximum drive current even if decreased from peak is still at an acceptable value for conventional FET, III-V FET, and 2D FET. Recently, the cumulative efforts of the scientific and engineering communities have substantially extended the physical limits of the S/D contact resistances, thanks to the ingenious process optimization techniques to near 100% activation of highly degenerate dopant concentrations in S/D junctions and to the engineering of their Schottky barrier. The first subsection of this chapter highlights key physics and chemistry concepts behind Schottky barrier height (SBH), its inhomogeneities, and impact on S/D contact resistance (most of these physical aspects are covered in references  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] ). Critical device physical aspects of dipole formation due to band polarization at the metal-semiconductor interface and metal-induced gap states (MIGS) on Fermi level pinning effect are discussed. This subsection also enunciates theoretical analysis of formation mechanisms for ohmic contacts with the allowance made for reduction of surface states charges at high doping levels. Considerations are given to experimental findings that at a given carrier concentration fast approaching the maximum density of semiconductor atoms per cell; there is a lower limit below which the contact resistivity cannot be reduced any further. This lower limit results from the finite interface transmission probability, the finite carrier velocity, and the finite number of interface gap states (IGS) available for carrier trapping based transport across the metal-semiconductor interface. The role of intrinsic transmission probability of electrons being injected from the highly band-bent metal-semiconductor interface further depends on the Fermi energy of the metal and on the effective masses of the metal and semiconductor and are discussed in this subsection. Various saliciding techniques and dopant segregation techniques along with dangling bons passivating agents like sulfur and selenium of S/D contacts and gate contacts in providing interfacial dipole induced SBH tuning are discussed. Rare earth metal doped salicided contacts are also used for source and drain contact resistance minimization and all these techniques are equally applied to conventional, III-V, and 2D FETs in general and discussed in section "Proper Understanding of Physics and Chemistry of SBH, Fermi Level Pinning Effect". In section "Different Contact Resistance Minimization Techniques Applicable to all FET Architectures", the author addresses the potent contact resistance minimization techniques applied for conventional, III-V, and 2D FETs. Concluding remarks highlight the proper understanding of fixed SBH and its unchangeability which is termed as Femi level pinning and is present in all contact minimization techniques developed so far and conclude with different techniques that are applied as relevant to conventional, III-V, and 2D FETs based on their material nature and current transport dynamics. 
 Proper Understanding of Physics and Chemistry of SBH, Fermi Level Pinning Effect Contact resistance impact on device performance and the physics of contact resistance formation that allows a device performance with boost in drive current in terms of source and drain reduced contact resistance. The first paper that fundamentally extracts the key physical aspect of observed contact resistance variation among various metals and their salicides are Schotty barrier height or (SBH)  [1] . As the author opines, the lack of a coherent explanation of a wide spectrum of experimentally observed SBH data and then lack of control over the magnitude of SBH speak volumes about the difficult and complex problem of SBH nature itself. The main sticking points can be traced to a sharp dependence of the SBH on the atomic structure of metal-semiconductor (MS) interface. Presently, due to short of full-fledged numerical calculations, there exists no comprehensive and quantitative theories on the formation of interface dipoles to explicitly address the most crucial part, the structural dependence of the SBH. As the author in this classic review points out that through an examination of experimental and theoretical results on atomically controlled MS interfaces and known fundamental principles, a comprehensive quantum mechanics based picture of SBH formation can be precisely calculated. However, as it is the problem of quantum description of any realistic and practical phenomena, the formation of SBH shows distinct structural setting intricately dependent on the specifics of MS interface under study. Therefore, quantum description SBH in general cannot be formulated into simple analytical equations that are applicable to all MS systems, especially since there are too many important details about the chemical nature of many MS interfaces materials that are not experimentally reliably extractable. Now while delving into SBH further, the author of this classic paper termed that why SBH is so mysterious and unpredictable due to its interface chemistry. Experimental results confirmed the absence of a strong dependence of SBH on metal work function and correspondingly resulting in Fermi level pinning fixing the barrier potential with an unchanged Fermi level and making the SBH's effect on contact resistivity worse. The author's physical explanation to this nature is that the charge distribution in any real MS interface turns out to be significantly different from a simple superposition of the charge distribution on the original surfaces. In reality, during formation of an MS interface, the metal and semiconductor come within close range of one another. From quantum mechanics we know that when an atom is brought so close to another atom, some orbitals from the atoms significantly overlapped, and these isolated orbitals are no longer eigen states of the system. Instead, molecular orbitals are formed which will lead to chemical bonds. The chemistry at the MS interface should not be any different because metals and semiconductors are made of atoms. Electronic states that belonged to only the metal or only the semiconductor have to be modified so that they can be incorporated in the larger quantum mechanical system. States that are related to the surfaces of the two crystals will not survive the formation of MS interface needing serious modifications. New interface states that are localized in the interface region and are interacting with interface atomic structure may form. Because of chemistry, the actual charge distribution at an MS interface will be quite different from a linear superposition of the charge distribution in two individual surfaces. This difference of charge rearrangement at the interface can be attributed to formation of additional interface dipole. The interface dipole can be largely viewed as the result of transfer of charge between the metal and semiconductor. 
 Different Contact Resistance Minimization Techniques Applicable to All FET Architectures In the next paper  [2] , advanced source and drain technologies for the parasitic source drain resistance reduction are discussed. In the source drain region of a MOSFET, contact resistivity ρ c is exponentially dependent on ϕ B N p where N is the active doping concentration in the source and drain contact and hence is made extremely degenerate and φ B is the Schottky barrier height between the source and drain region and metal silicided layer  [2] . Without Fermi level pinning, surface states and metal induced gap states φ B are generally engineering tunable but in all fabricated MS interface, φ B seems to be fixed in nature, highly degenerate values of N is required. Nevertheless, fabrication and process techniques have been designed that aim at reducing φ B by selection of metal silicide work function. Silicides of low and high work function are needed for contacting n-type and p-type semiconductors, respectively. Dopant segregation technique allows the contact resistivity to improve in presence of high doping and when the degenerate limit is high, some of these dopants may also enhance contact resistivity through incomplete ionization although very small. A third approach involves the interface Schottky barrier height engineering, for instance, introduction of atomic species like sulfur (S) or selenium (Se) for n + Si or aluminium for p + silicon. The segregation of sulphur at the metal semiconductor interfaces with NiSi revealed that electron SBH values tend to converge toward the conduction band of the semiconductor. This also opens up the possibility of implementing a single metal silicide to independently control contact resistances of n-and p-type MOSFETs. For electron barrier height ϕ n B adjustment for the n-FETs, rare earth silicides generally have low work functions and may be used as salicides in S/D contacts. Other notable silicides are ytterbium silicide and erbium silicide. Metals such as Yb, Er, Ti, and Al were co-sputtered with Nickel and annealed to form Ni alloy silicides  [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, the metal introduced may not necessarily distribute uniformly in NiSi and the extent of ϕ n B tuning depends on whether the added metal can be found at high concentration near the interface with the heavily doped S/D. Ti, Dy, and Yb tend to redistribute at the top surface of the silicide, thereby limiting their effectiveness in reducing ϕ n B . In addition to tuning the work function of the silicide contact though material selection, another approach as just mentioned priorly is to exploit dopant segregation effects  [6, 7]  to boost the active dopant concentration in the S/D region beneath the silicide. In this approach, traditional dopants such as As + ions are implanted at very shallow depth prior to silicidation. For As segregation, does of As + implanted may range from 1 Â 10 14 cm À2 to 1 Â 10 15 cm À2 . As segregates at the NiSi/Si interface during the nickel silicidation process. The heavily doped region of segregated As + at the contact interface effectively reduces R c . Furthermore, it has been shown that the dopant segregation can be combined with nickel alloy silicidation or work function tuning method to yield additive effects. NiAl silicidation when combined with As + segregation gives greater reduction in ϕ n B than either of the method alone. A classic paper that discusses study on the intrinsic limitations on contact resistances will be discussed here  [4] . In this paper the authors opine that recently cumulative efforts of the scientific and engineering communities have substantially extended the physical limits of the source and drain contact resistance thanks to the increase of activated dopants in the S/D contact region and to the engineering of Schottky barrier which have been discussed in previous paragraph. As a result, contact resistivity as low as 2 Â 10 À9 Ω cm 2 and 8.4Â 10 À10 Ω cm 2 n-Si:a-TiSi and p-Si  30  Ge 70 :a-TiSi with dopant concentrations as high as 6 Â 10 20 cm À3 to 1 Â 10 21 cm À3 have been reported to be achieved  [4] . Aside from pushing the doping limits in conventional semiconductors  [5] , new materials are also being investigated which may allow better scaling and transport by virtue of their properties. Two-dimensional materials (2D) specially transition metal dichalcogenides have emerged as possible candidates in this regard for both MOSFET and tunnel-based FET applications. Electrostatic doping in 2D materials also promises higher carrier concentrations allowing for better transport. Although these accomplishments are impressive, little is known on the intrinsic limits that will ultimately determine the contact resistivity of conventional 3D and 2D semiconductors and it is unclear at the moment while higher bound of dopant species will keep the contact region to perform equilibrium kinetics due to many body or atomic concentrations. The authors in this paper have shown that through first principles calculations with nonequilibrium green functions transport simulations, whereas metal-semiconductor intrinsic contact resistivity initially being scaled doping concentration, it is found to saturate at 2 Â 10 À10 Ω cm 2 at a doping level of 5 Â 10 21 cm À3 that may make the contact resistivity calculation deviating from equilibrium at high degeneracy being required. The authors through their simulation found beyond this doping concentration, the electron injection is governed by Ohm's law. It turns out that at high doping regions, the electron injection does no longer depend on barrier height set by the interface potential to be crossed. In turn it also becomes less sensitive to the chemical composition of the interface or degree of disorder as suggestive by surface states or metal induced gap states, but the carrier injection is limited by intrinsic transmission probability of electrons being injected from metal into the semiconductor and imposes an intrinsic physical limit to the contact resistance since neither ϕ N B tuning nor dopant activation magnitude can lower the contact resistivity set by this limit. This intrinsic transmission probability depends on the value of the Fermi energy level of the metal, on the effective masses of the metal and semiconductor and imposes an intrinsic physical limit to contact resistance. A very important conclusion from this paper is that in high doping regime where intrinsic transmission probability is the dominant process, contacting metals with a heavy electron effective mass S/D region help increasing the transmission probability and hence contribute to semiconductor metal intrinsic contact resistivity. In this context, the author of this chapter strongly infers that for metal salicidation of source and drain contacts, only those metals which have degenerate carrier density in the vicinity of maximum number of atoms per unit cell for silicon, i.e., 5 Â 10 22 /cm 3 , should be identified for reduced contact resistivity. Metal silicides with metal degenerate carriers above 5 Â 10 22 /cm 3 will not be stable and there will be a departure from equilibrium kinetics enabling us to derive the contact resistivity, Schottky barrier height, etc. So, with the drive to ensure intimate salicidation technology with metal silicides, we must study metals with their crystal structure and determine number of atoms per unit cell and only retain those metals for silicidation formation for which free carriers for the metal is still below 5 Â 10 22 /cm 3 . Therefore, from the above paper, the increasing transmission probability contributing to silicide material's intrinsic contact resistivity is only valid when equilibrium kinetics can still be applied and hence the silicide forming metal's maximum free carrier density derived from its number of atoms per unit cell is very important to include in study and research when determining intrinsic contact resistivity reduction limit for all metal silicides in silicon. 
 Typical and Advanced Contact Minimization Techniques Applied to Conventional, III-V, and 2D FETs For conventional FETs, most of the contact minimization techniques are covered in section "Different Contact Resistance Minimization Techniques Applicable to all FET Architectures". So, in this section "Typical and Advanced Contact Minimization Techniques Applied to Conventional, III-V, and 2D FETs", the author of this chapter will mostly focus upon III-V and 2D FETs contact engineering techniques. The author now systematically analyzes this following reference article that shows ways of forming ohmic contacts to GaAs, InP, and GaN substrates  [12] . As described in this reference article, the earliest form of contacting n-GaAs source and drain contact is through Sn metal. But after that, the introduction of Ni-AuGe contacts for a eutectic composition of Au (88% wt) and Ge (12% wt) with the Ni overlayer has become the most widely used contact for n-GaAs. Historically, the Ni metallization was cited as a wetting agent but it was later deduced that Ni has other functions like reduction of surface oxides and reacting with GaAs at low temperatures to form binary and ternary compounds that may be electrically important. These latter compounds also may facilitate the incorporation of Ge dopants with good electrical contact resistivities better than 10 À6 Ω-cm 2 with Ni-Au/Ge contacts in n-GaAs. Though the Ni-Au/Ge has improved morphology over Au/Ge alone, it still suffers from a propensity of spiking, poor controllability, poor edge definition, and inadequate thermal stability for many applications. A major problem of Ni-Au/Ge contact is the strong propensity to form Au/Ga which has been observed at the TEM temperatures of 420 C and above and is responsible for spiking and poor morphology. Many methods have been touted for improving the contact resistivity of Ni-Au/Ge contacts of which rapid thermal annealing (RTP) and a properly optimized thickness of a Ni first layer in a Ni/AuGe/Ni contacts are most promising. Rapid thermal annealing is one method for stopping the complex alloy reactions which include early reproducible termination of AuGa to limit the tendency of total consumption of Au from the contact. The used Ni as the first deposited layer is said to improve the uniformity of contacts due to its ability to consume native oxides and the susceptibility of forming Ni x GaAs compounds at temperatures below 400 C, thus providing excellent electrical properties at low temperature alloyed contacts and avoiding some of the undesirable Au-GaAs reactions. As per this paper, the other forms of contact to n-GaAs include Ge/Pd ohmic contact where solid phase regrowth principle was used to study this alloy mechanism but was later extended to study other forms of alloys. The author of this chapter invites the authors to refer to the description of how solid phase regrowth mechanism works to consume Pd from Pd x GaAs complex and results in regrowth of the GaAs lattice with the additional advantage of incorporating defects such as Ge to improve the electrical properties of the contact. Other types of contacts developed to n type GaAs with the solid phase regrowth principle include Si/Pd, Pd/In/Pd, and Pd/In/Pd/Ge/Pd. In the latter processes of these contacts mentioned here, it is believed to create the InGaAs layers during the GaAs regrowth process which is also a surface bandgap lowering approach essentially benefiting SBH reduction as described in previous subsections. Al/Ni/Ge is another example of non-Au contact which achieves 10 À6 Ω-cm 2 contact resistivity and, from thermal stability standpoint, is motivated by a higher eutectic temperature of 424 C compared to 361 C of AuGe. With Al/Ni/Ge contacts to n-GaAs, more important than eutectic temperature, stable phases such as Al 3 Ni and NiGe compounds are formed within the contact structure after sintering at 500 C. Another promising non-Au contact to n-type GaAs using Cu 3 Ge exhibits a planar and abrupt interface and excellent contact resistivity of 6.7 Â 10 À7 Ω-cm 2 to moderately doped GaAs around 10 17 /cm 3 . Ohmic contacts were observed with both excess Cu and excess Ge from a stoichiometric Cu 3 Ge phase suggesting that the epitaxial Ge might not be the reason rather observation of Ga in Cu 3 Ge phase promotes the observation that Ga outdiffusion incorporates Ge in high mole fraction in n-GaAs bettering its electrical properties. When the doping level in n-GaAs increases beyond 10 19 /cm 3 , formation of a nonalloyed source and drain contact through a tunneling mechanism typically occurs and this will offer better flexibility in metal choices for contact formation. As the authors in this paper point out, Sn segregation to the surface of an n + GaAs layer during MBE growth provided high surface concentration in the contact region to use a nonalloyed contact based on Au/Pt/Ti, Al, or TiW metals. Nonalloyed ohmic contacts followed by (NH 4 ) 2 S surface passivation followed by thermal desorption in vacuum have been demonstrated where sulfur was found to be incorporated below the surface as an n-type dopant raising the surface doping level to 7 Â 10 18 cm À3 . Refractory metals and contacts can also be used with n-GaAs for reducing surface semiconductor bandgap. The use of a refractory metal with low bandgap In has greatly improved the rather higher contact resistivities found in Ag-In, Au-In, and Al-In contacts; for instance, W/In produces contact resistivity in the same range as Ni-Au/Ge contacts. The refractory metals must be inert with GaAs for contact formation at the typical higher eutectic temperatures than conventional ohmic contacts as discussed before. The thermal stability of these refractory metal to In alloyed contacts to n-GaAs is excellent for temperatures in the range 400 C. The role of refractory metal is to cap a fairly thin In film to maximize the coverage of InGaAs phases at the GaAs interfaces thus reducing the surface energy bandgap of GaAs. W-containing contact materials mostly act as diffusion barriers different from a highly conductive metal such as Au incorporated contact, for instance, Au/TaSiN/Au/Ge/Pt contact where thin resistive Au/Ge/Pd from the ohmic contact to GaAs and TaSiN acts as a diffusion barrier to separate a more conductive Au layer from Au/Ge/Pd. Contact resistivity of 3.7 Â 10 À6 Ω-cm 2 was obtained for a doping of 10 18 /cm 3 . The conventional ohmic contact to InP is Ni/Au/Ge and it shows many analogies for this same contact properties described by the authors of this paper for GaAs. Solid phase regrowth techniques applied to GaAs with Ge/Pd and Ge/Pt contacts can be applied to InP with good contact resistivities less than 10 À6 Ω-cm 2 . Other similar approaches to GaAs contact for surface bandgap lowering include lower bandgap material such as InGaAs for the surface epitaxial layer allowing nonalloyed contacts where the device design permits. A sputtering etching approach is based on the fact that InN produces an excellent ohmic contact to GaAs. In this case, degenerately doped n-type InN is deposited by metal organic molecular beam epitaxy (MOMBE) and the high conductivity is due to the presence of native defects. These results suggest the formation of a nitrided surface layer on InP by low energy nitrogen ion bombardment can be an efficient technique for in situ ohmic contact formation. Nonalloyed Au/Pt/Ti contacts deposited in situ onto nitrogen ion bombarded n-type InP demonstrated a contact resistivity as low as 3.4 Â 10 À6 Ω-cm 2 . The most widely used ohmic contact on GaN is based on Al/Ti according to this paper. Enhancements on the Al/Ti contact scheme have focused on modifying the GaN surface prior to metallization. One such approach is to expose GaN surface to a plasma that will remove a higher mole fraction of N than Ga on the surface, creating N-vacancies which act as donors to form a n + layer. These vacancies promote tunneling currents needed for contact resistance minimization. In a similar way, a degenerate surface layer can be formed by a high temperature annealing step where residual N is preferentially eliminated from the surface. By using ion implantation of a high dose of Si atoms in the surface of GaN, annealing the sample at 1100 C and evaporating a Au/Ti contact layer resulted in a contact resistivity 3.6 Â 10 À8 Ω-cm 2 for the implanted sample. Still, another approach to obtaining a low resistance ohmic contact to n-type GaN is to employ highly doped, lower bandgap epitaxial layers as is done with InGaAs on GaAs. The analogy in the GaN case is the use of a n + -InGaN layer which can be grown degenerately n-type with intrinsic defects to form low resistance contacts. In addition, thermally stable ohmic contacts based on refractory W metallization on InGaN and InAlN have been reported. A related approach is the use of short-period superlattice (SLS) to grade the potential barrier between the metal and GaN. InN/GaN SLS and Al/Ti metallization was used although the contact resistivity obtained through this method is higher as GaN is intrinsically a more higher bandgap material than GaAs and contact formation with resistivities in the range of 10 À7 Ω-cm 2 or lower is a challenge for GaN substrates. Low contact resistance of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) FETs is critical for high on current in logic device applications, good photoresponse for optical device applications, and high frequency for analog and RF applications. However, the contact resistance of 2D FETs is much higher than conventional and III-V FETs lowering the drive current further even though dimensional scaling from 3D to 2D should have generated higher drive current for these devices. In the 2D limit, the properties of the contact, as well as the chemical interactions between the metal and semiconductor contact govern everything as dimensional scaling also introduces quantum confinement effects at the source and drain contacts of 2D FETs. In addition, the pristine surface (no dangling bonds) of a 2D material makes it difficult to form strong interface bonds with a metal, thereby increasing contact resistance. The author now discusses an excellent reference paper  [13]  on this to analyze the 2D contact resistance issues and resistance minimization methods. According to the authors of this paper, the quantum limit to the contact resistivity R c min is determined by the number of conducting or transport modes within the semiconductor channel, which is connect to the 2D charge carrier density n 2D , yielding R min C ¼ h 2e 2 k F ¼ 0:026 n 2D p 30 Ω-μm at n 2D ¼ 10 13 /cm 2 , a value three orders of magnitude below than typical contact resistivities of monolayer MoS 2 2D FET devices. According to this paper, edge contact instead of purely top contact for metal deposition on 2D semiconductor material, monolayer graphene has been fabricated whose experimental contact resistance is found to be better than top contact approach. Edge contacts can lead to shorter bonding distance with stronger hybridization than top contacts and transport simulations show that incorporation of additional interfacial species (such as oxygen) can help to improve bonding and increase transmission. For TMDC 2D materials, edge contact can be also advantageous compared to less lithographically complex top contacts for both monolayer and multilayer TMDC. The main reasons are the stronger orbitals overlap and the reduction of tunneling barriers. Most practical contact structures to 2D TMDC materials involve both the edge and top surface of the 2D material, with the top surface providing the greater contribution due to the large surface area to edge area ratio of the contact. Hence, according to this paper, other than optimizing the edge contact, the contact resistance can be reduced by reducing the tunnel barrier at the top surface. This can be achieved by the hybridization of between metal contact atoms and 2D semiconductor. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations show that specific metals can form covalent bonds to 2D semiconductor surfaces and hence eliminate the van der Walls gap. Examples are Ni on graphene, Ti on MoS 2 , Pd on WSe 2 Mo/W for MoS 2 /WSe 2 , and Ti 2 C (a 2D metallic material) for MoS 2 . DFT predicts that selected metals such as Ti and Mo create nonlocalized overlapped states in the original bandgap of MoS 2 , which effectively turns MoS 2 under the metal into a new metallic compound. In such situations, contact resistivity of 2D MoS 2 decreases as desired. On the other hand, if the monolayer is partially metallized, the contact resistivity may increase due to localized states. The authors of this paper note that although a number of selected metals form strong hybridization at the interfaces and therefore reduce tunnel barriers, Fermi level pinning occurs due to the work function of the metal at the changing interfaces (into metal-MoS 2 alloy's work function) as well as creation of gap states from the weakened intralayer S-Mo bonding. Such effects can significantly impact the SBH. Apart from 3D metals, one must also research upon contact formation on 2D TMDC materials by other or same low-dimensional materials as the authors opined in this paper. For example, carbon families include the metal allotropes such as metallic carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene nanoribbons (GNR), one can first fabricate semiconducting or metallic carbon and then tune one side to be metallic or semiconducting. The concept of seamless contacts from all graphene circuits can also be adapted to 2D semiconductor materials. In recent studies, contacts between metallic 1T-MoS 2 and semiconducting 2H-MoS 2 have been fabricated using phase engineering changing 2H into 1T. The resulting contact resistivity of 0.2 kΩ-μm is the lowest ever reported for this material but still above than the theoretical limit of previously calculated 30 Ω-μm. Another option could be to grow metallic and semiconducting TMDC in sequence by atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique (the authors referred to chemical vapor deposition but these days precision stacking of atomically thin growth of materials can be done by ALD technique). Apart from 1T MoS 2 with monolayer and 2H monolayer MoS 2 , other contact metals and their alloys like Au/Ti, Au/Mo and Au/Ni all show very high contact resistivities in the 10 4 -10 5 Ω-μm range which demonstrates why 2D materials suffer even more from source and drain contact resistances than conventional and III-V materials. 
 Concluding Remarks Source and drain contact junction area, periphery, and 2D aspect ratio as the device dimensions shrink suggest that a significant research effort must be directed to the minimization of source and drain contact resistances in all typical FET devices such as conventional, III-V, and 2D FETs. Although dimensional scaling of 2D FET devices provides higher mobility and drive current, it possibly has the worst contact resistances. Also, as feature sizes shrink, ballistic transport is possible and channel resistance R CH becomes very small. Then contact resistance from source can limit the source injection velocity of electron transport from source edge into the channel and also increase back scattering. So, in ballistic and quasi-ballistic transport regime, contact resistances can be a limiting factor on maximum achievable drive current. The author of this chapter further stressed the point that atomic layer growth or deposition (ALD) technique of metal alloy formation, particularly for 2D materials, and laser or flash annealing for minimizing defect induced gap states can decrease the contact resistances of these different FETs.

 Measurement and Utilization Quantum Effects in Multi-gate MOSFETs  
 Abstract In the modern days, VLSI technology meets the requirement of integrated circuits with enhanced speed, better packing density, and lowest power consumption with energy efficiency. To downscale the device geometry and increase packing density, it is essential to apprehend the device approaches in many ways, resulting in shortcoming of several short-channel effects in classical MOS devices. As silicon films becoming significantly narrower due to the downscaling of multi-gate MOSFETs, additional factors like quantum confinement must be taken into account. The fact that this effect manifests in numerous dimensions makes characterization and modeling of quantum effects crucial. When appropriately interpreting their electrical and transport properties, quantization effects are critical. The book chapter focused on quantum effects on double gate MOSFET in both modeling and simulation. The coupled Schrodinger-Poisson equation is evaluated using the variational method to evaluate the impact of quantum effects. The penetration of the average inversion layer, sometimes referred to as the inversion charge centroid, is the most difficult parameter to model and the most important factor in determining the importance of quantum effects on the inversion charge of MOS devices. The inversion charge centroid is often calculated using the quantum charge distribution function. To acquire the electrical potential distribution and the energy levels followed by all the electrical properties of the devices divergent to device materials, the aforementioned equations must be consistently solved. 
 Introduction The demand for devices with higher speeds, massive packing densities, energy efficiency, and low-power dissipation is met by today's VLSI processors. The short-channel effects such as the hot electron effect and the likelihood of velocity saturation, threshold voltage roll-off, subthreshold swing, an increase in leakage current, and drain-and gate-induced barrier lowering (GIDL)  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Therefore, using device approaches to shorten the device's channel length and channel width for the planar transistor in order to achieve higher packing density is even more critical. The surrounding gate transistor (SGT), which projects a channel in a vertical direction, is classified as a nonplanar device. The gate electrode surrounds the silicon pillar in this device, lowering the overall transistor area. This enhances the package density of the surrounding gate MOSFETs by up to 50%. In order to use an increasingly thin silicon sheet for downscaling multiple-gate MOSFETs, new anomalies like quantum mechanical confinement must be taken into account. This effect turns up in multiple dimensions, which makes quantum effectsbased modeling and characterization mandatory  [6, 7] ; even if considering conventional bulk MOSFETs resulting in 1D quantization effects, to evaluate the electrical and transport properties it is most important to analyze thoroughly  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Nonetheless, multiple iterations of simulation must be carried out, resulting in increased validation time thus, which is inappropriate in the beginning stages of the design for ICs, where multiple simulation iterations must be carried out. As a result, modifications to classical simulators are used to take into account quantum effects by analyzing conventional empirical or semiempirical models. 
 Methodology Different approximation methods are employed to solve the time-independent Schrodinger equation for the MOS system. Variational method  [13, 14]  allows approximating the ground state energy of a system without solving the Schrodinger equation. To exemplify the influence of quantum effects, the coupled Schrodinger-Poisson equation is solved using a variational approach. The intricate process is depicted in Fig.  22 .1. To determine the electrical potential distribution and energy levels, these equations must be consistently evaluated. The Poisson-Schrödinger equation can be used to evaluate the wave function that is essential for investigating the quantum effects  [15] . The normalization constant is evaluated by integrating the trail wave function along its dimensions, and variational parameter is captured by solving the Schrödinger wave equation and is reliant on inversion charge density and for any device metrices. The most important parameter of the model, the inversion charge centroid, also known as average inversion layer penetration, has been utilized to investigate the impact of quantum events on MOS device inversion charge. The inversion charge centroid is computed using the quantum charge distribution function. The centroid x i mathematical expression is assessed. By isolating the inversion charge distribution from the oxide interface and projecting a new oxide thickness, the inversion charge model is generated employing quantum effects to offer corrected oxide capacitance. The standard oxide capacitance has been replaced by an oxide layer capacitance in series with a semiconductor capacitance that contains an inversion charge centroid. The inversion charge is computed while accounting for quantum phenomena. On integrating the inversion charge model within limits of quasi-potential, we obtain the drain current model. The expression for device gate capacitance and  
 Device Structure The device geometric views of double gate, triple gate, and gate-all-around (surrounding gate) MOSFET are elucidated along with all the device parameters for silicon channel material. Silicon dioxide is used as oxide material in all the three devices and aluminum as gate electrode for all the contact terminals  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Table  22 .1 lists the device specifications for these devices. The cross-sectional perspective of a long, symmetrical DG MOSFET composed of silicon  (Si)  is shown in Fig.  22 .2. The abbreviations L, t Si , and t ox stand for the channel length, also known as the gate length, the Si film thickness, and the oxide or dielectric thickness, respectively. The x axis is perpendicular to the channel and the y axis is parallel to it respectively. Reference frame must be obtained at the Si channel's source end, precisely in the middle of two gates. The device's two controlling gates receives the same voltage, V gs . The Fermi potential at point (x, y) along the channel to its source end would be the surface potential. It is presummated that current only flows in the y direction and that the channel's quasi-Fermi level does not change in the x direction. Figure  22 .3a depicts the three-dimensional (3D) construction of a triple gate MOSFET; L represents the length of the channel, also known as the length of the gate. Figure  22 .3b exhibits the cross section of a three-gate SOI MOSFET, where H stands for the Si film's or channel's thickness, W for the channel's width, and t ox for the oxide or SiO 2 dielectric thickness.

The two-dimensional (2D) representation of a surrounding gate MOSFET in cross section is shown in Fig.  22 .4b. The Fermi potential along the (r, ϕ) axes refers to the surface potential of the device. It is presumed that flow of electrons is from source to drain along the direction of ϕ, and it is constant over radial direction. 
 Quantum Model In MOSFETs, surface potential induces the quantum confinement, and the confinement of accelerating electrons in the thin Si film causes the quantum effect. Quantum confinement is often observed when the particle size is exceedingly small in comparison to the electron's wavelength. When electrons are confined in the quantum wells, they propagate but are only allowed to move through certain energy levels.   d 2 dx 2 ϕ x ð Þ ¼ q e Si N A þ N inv ψ 0 x ð Þ j j 2 ð22:1Þ The conduction band of the transistor is divided into numerous distinct sub-bands over the channel due to the constriction of electron mobility that is typical of the dielectric/semiconductor interface. Eigen function ψ 0 (x) is used to compute the lower energy sub-band E 0 . Surface potential ϕ(x) is used to solve the Schrodinger equation for the lower energy sub-band E 0 by adopting the variational approach. The Schrodinger equation is expressed as: h 2 2m x @ 2 @r 2 þ 1 r @ @r þ 1 r 2 @ 2 @φ 2 ψ 0 r, φ ð ÞþE c r ð Þψ r, φ ð Þ ¼ E v ψ r, φ ð Þ ð22:2Þ In this equation, ϕ(x) denotes the electric potential, ψ 0 (x) the Eigen function, h the Planck's constant, E 0 the lower sub-band energy, and m x the effective mass of the electrons moving in the x direction. Below is a discussion of the thorough modeling for double gate MOSFETs for a variety of factors, including inversion charge, inversion charge centroid, drain current, transconductance, and capacitance. 
 Inversion Charge Model Electrical parameter analytics vary depending on the geometry of the device. Without using iterative approaches, a direct computation is applied to formulate an inversion charge model for a double gate MOSFET. Eq. (  22 .3) can be used to evaluate the inversion charge and is constituted by: Q V ð Þ ¼ 2C ox À2C ox v 2 t Q 0 þ 2C ox v 2 t Q 0 2 þ 4v 2 t ln 2 1 þ exp V GS À V th þ ΔV th À V 2v t ð22:3Þ C ox ¼ e ox =t ox 1 þ x i t Si e ox t ox

The term C ox includes the centroid derivative, which is used to express the device capacitance by substituting Eq.  (22.5)  in Eq. (  22 .3) to account for the quantum effect. The equation for inversion charge density, or with regard to the Eq. (  22 .3), determines the threshold voltage. 
 Drain Current Model In connection to the preceding modeled inversion charge model, this part provides an equation that gives the continuous mathematical drain current interpretation for the DG MOSFET. I d ¼ μ W L V ds 0 Q V ð ÞdV ð22:6Þ where Q (V) is the inversion charge that was demonstrated in the section before, and μ is the mobility of the electrons. W is for width, L is for length, and W/L is the DG-MOSFET's aspect ratio. The drain to source voltage is referred to as V DS . 
 Transconductance Model Transconductance is the divergence parameter of drain current; it measures the deviation of device drain current in deviation with V GS (gate to source voltage) for a constant V DS .g m ¼ @I D /@V GS and the expression for transconductance is given by: g m 4Aμ W=L ð ÞV DS C ox v t ln 1 þ A ð Þ 1 þ A ð Þ 2C ox v 2 t =q 2 þ 4v 2 t ln 2 1 þ A ð Þ ð22: 7Þ where, A ¼ exp V GS À V th þ ΔV th À V 2v t 
 Capacitance-Voltage Model The DG-MOSFET's gate capacitance is represented as follows: C g ¼ dQ V ð Þ dV GS ð22:8Þ where Q(V) is calculated from the preceding section and modeled by taking quantum effects into account. C-V analysis is helpful to evaluating details about MOS gate stacks, including oxide thickness, flat band voltage, substrate doping density, and work function of the gate. 
 Results and Discussion For physics-based two-dimensional simulations of semiconductor devices, the numerical simulator provides a wide range of capabilities, including electrical characterization of the semiconductor devices, DC and AC small signal analysis, energy band models, band-to-band tunneling models, etc. In this part, the 2D numerical simulation produced by simulation software is contrasted with the findings that acquired using MATLAB. Figure  22 .5 shows the plot for inversion charge centroid in deviation with N inv (electron concentration) which is taken in logarithmic scale for multiple semiconductor (Si and Ge) thickness. Thick lines are indicated by the variation in Si material, and a dashed line refers to the germanium material. The features of the inversion charge centroid are shown in figure in variation with inversion charge densities ranging from 10 10 to 10 14 for various channel thicknesses for Si and Ge channels from 05 nm to 20 nm with a step size of 05 nm. It is evident Fig.  22 .5 Inversion charge centroid (x i ) in variation with N inv (electron concentration) in inversion region (logarithmic scale) for multiple  Si and  Ge thickness that the centroid for the thinnest inversion layer (t Si & t ge ¼ 05 nm) is essentially constant for the range of inversion charge concentrations. The charge centroid behaves as anticipated, and it can be shown that the value of the centroid will drop with the rise in inversion charge by virtue of the charge distribution for both Si and Ge materials shifts toward the oxide/channel interface. Figure  22 .6 shows the relationship between the inversion charge density and gate voltage, which ranges from 0 V to 2.50 V for varied semiconductor thicknesses, from 05.0 nm to 20.0 nm with a 5.0 nm step size, having a 1.50 nm gate oxide thickness and a 0 V electron quasi-Fermi potential. For all dimensions, the inversion charge density will increase over the threshold voltage, and it does so linearly for smaller dimensions, as depicted in the figure. The transfer characteristics of the DG MOSFET device structure are shown in Fig.  22 .7a for various V DS . Figure  22 .7a illustrates the curve for drain current in variation with input voltage V GS ; the figure makes it abundantly evident that we will have a very low current with a smaller value of V DS (0.1 V ). It is evident that I D is exactly in relation to the V DS because it rises as V DS increases. Similarly, Fig.  22 .7b shows the V-I characteristics for the Ge channel-based device for similar device parameters as of the Si counterpart. Figure  22 .7c infers the comparison of drain current for both Si and Ge material-based MOSFETs. Thick lines indicate the V-I characteristics for the Si channel, and dashed lines refer to the characteristics for germanium channel. It is clearly seen that for the same device parameters, device with Ge material shows higher drain current than Si material. The transfer characteristics of the device is shown in Fig.  22 .8a as a function of channel and oxide thickness. The I D against V GS for (t si ¼ 05 nm, t ox ¼ 01 nm), (t si ¼ 05 nm, t ox ¼ 03 nm), (t si ¼ 10.0 nm, t ox ¼ 03.0 nm), and (t si ¼ 15.0 nm, t ox ¼ 05 nm) with V ds ¼ 0.10 V are plotted in this figure. It is evident that a better higher drain current reads for the lower values of channel and oxide thickness. Similarly, Fig.  22 .8b shows that the V-I characteristics for Ge material-based model for the different device parameters shows similar results when compared with the Si material-based model. The behavior of the g m (V GS ) curve, which is determined using Eq. (22.7), is displayed in Fig.  22 .9 as transconductance versus gate voltage (V GS ). Although the rising edge of the curve has a propensity to saturate with V DS , it can be seen that in the region of strong inversion, g m linearly grows with V DS and the inflection point shifts to the higher V GS value. When utilizing the modeled drain current equation, the curve is smooth and continuous, proving that the compact model correctly predicted the data. The plot for C-V curve inclusion with quantum effects is shown in Fig.  22 .10 referring to the outcome of Eq.  (22.8) . This graph displays the gate capacitance fluctuation as a function of input gate to source voltage. The graph displays V ds ¼ 0.10 V and the device parameters t si ¼ 05 nm, t ox ¼ 1.5 nm, 03 nm, and 05 nm, respectively. It is evident that the oxide thickness has a direct relationship with the variation in gate capacitance, and it can be seen that gate capacitance may be successfully observed in strong inversion regions, including quantum effects. Figure  22 .10b shows the comparison of C-V curves between Si and Ge channels for the same device parameters channel thickness ¼ 5 nm and oxide thickness ¼ 1.5 nm. The increased capacitance for Ge in comparison to equivalent Si is noticeably higher. Ge-based devices have a maximum capacitance that is almost three times greater than the Si-channeled devices. Table  22 .2 shows the finalized comparison for various electrical parameters for both Si and Ge channel which shows Ge channel has better performance. As discussed in the structure of double gate MOSFET structure, the quantum influence can be modeled and simulated for other multi-gate MOSFETs also modeled, simulated, and published by authors in various reputed journals.

 Introduction Graphene has grown as an ideal material in variety of applications such as in photonic and microelectronic devices due to its unique properties. The two major properties of graphene material like weak photon-electron interaction and poor heat capacitance make them ideal for various bolometric applications. Apart from that, graphene has a two-dimensional electronic system with high carrier mobility  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Graphene, whose valence band and conduction band are connected at the K-point, is a zero-gap semiconductor material having single to multiple layers of crystalline carbon. Single-layer graphene has reported high carrier concentration of approximately 10 12 cm 2 and large carrier mobility of >20,000 cm 2 /Vs in room temperature. It is expected that graphene will also be an ideal candidate in next-generation highspeed logic devices applications. In recent years, rapid advancements has been reported in biological and chemical sensors based on graphene technologies as a result of its high material stability  [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Electrostatically tunable carrier density (<10 14 cm À2 ) due to its strong electric field as well as its high carrier mobility has made graphene as ideal material in high-speed field-effect transistors. Gra-FET is fabricated usually in three major configurations, namely, top gate, back gate, and dual gate, respectively (Fig.  23 .1). Among these, backgate configuration is the most commonly investigated structure  [18] [19] [20] . In this chapter, we have comprehensively investigated the application of various Gra-FET sensors used as biological and chemical sensors as well as their recent developments. 
 Graphene-FET Biosensors High surface area of graphene (2630 m 2 /g) as well as its flexibility makes it ideal in different bio-sensing applications by proving desirable sensitivity. The surface of graphene has to be functionalized in order to employ it in various bio-sensing applications. In the year 2012, Y.H. Kwak et al.

 Modeling and Simulation of Dual-Material Asymmetric Heterojunction Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors fundamental limit of device operation, making it unfavorable while scaling from the micrometer to the nanometer region. Another MOSFET constraint brought on by a reduction in gate oxide thickness is improved by using high-k dielectric material in the gate stack structure and SiO 2 as an interfacial layer to reduce leakage current. To overcome all these limitations, tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) is taken into account. TFET offers low I OFF, and its subthreshold swing is below 60 mV/dec. This chapter focuses on physics-based simulation and modeling of heterojunction TFETs with various gate topologies. A combination of SiO 2 and high permittivity dielectric material is used as the gate oxide stack. The first part of the chapter focuses on the analytical modeling of a dual-material asymmetric heterodielectric gate tunnel field-effect transistor (FET), which is carried out based on the Poisson equation and parabolic approximation techniques. An asymmetric gate with two materials having different work functions is used to increase the ON current of the device. The lengths of metal one and metal two are taken to be 10 nm and 10 nm, respectively, and the device performance is analyzed. Expressions for the surface potential, electric field, and drain current are obtained by using a two-dimensional (2D) mathematical model, whose results are compared with those obtained using the Silvaco technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulator, revealing good agreement. The proposed dual-material asymmetric gate tunnel FET produces an improved ON current of 10 À5 A/μm and a decreased OFF current of 10 À10 A/μm, with an ON/OFF ratio of 10 5 . The influence of trap carriers at the Si-SiO 2 interface near the source channel junction is analyzed in the second part of the chapter. The device's performance is analyzed by considering the depletion regions of the p-i-n structure. The analytical model of the proposed device is carried out with appropriate boundary conditions, and the Poisson equation is solved by using the parabolic approximation technique. Surface potential, electric field, and drain current are computed using the developed model. This work considers the device's four lengths (L1, L2, L3, and L4) for the source, channel, and drain regions. This work employs two metal work functions (M1 and M2) placed over HfO 2 and SiO 2 . The drain current is computed using the analytical model for SiO 2 /HfO 2 cylindrical gate tunnel FET. An ON current of 10 À5 A/μm and OFF current of 10 À19 A/μm, with an ON/OFF ratio of 10 14 is produced in the proposed device. 
 Introduction In a period of automated supercomputing gadgets, smart watches and smartphones have become an unavoidable element in human existence. Integrated electronics will replace electronics in the time ahead. The goal was to miniaturize electronic equipment to accommodate more sophisticated electronic operations in a small space and lightweight. Techniques like micro-assembly, thin film structures, and semiconductor integrated circuits are preferred to incorporate many components within a small area. Among these techniques, semiconductor integrated circuits are used in most applications. Silicon, the semiconducting material, is considered inexpensive in low-frequency applications and abundant in nature compared to germanium. Moore predicts that scaling transistor devices is one of the optimal solutions for improving the performance and operating frequency and reducing the area and power dissipation. Most semiconductor industries follow Moore's Law  [1] , which states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every 2 years. The tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) is a feasible option. In 1965, the first TFET was invented by Stuetzer, O.M.  [2] . Traditional MOSFETs are switched by modulating thermionic emission across a barrier, whereas TFETs are by modifying quantum tunneling. A TFET is a reverse-biased gated p-i-n junction with a quantum mechanical band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) mechanism to inject most carriers from the source into the channel. Figure  24 .1 shows the structure of an n-channel TFET. 
 The Necessity of Tunnel Field Transistors The constant scaling down of device size is a critical area of concentration in semiconductor technology. Apart from the increased number of transistors in a chip, scaling the length of a MOSFET provides several advantagesthe attainment of improved switching speed by reducing the gate length, thereby reducing gate capacitance. Reducing power consumption is required for miniaturization and is obtained by voltage scaling. The OFF-state power consumption of MOSFETs became a significant issue as device dimensions decreased to 50 nm and the power supply dropped to 0.5 V. From the source region to the channel region, a thermionic emission is produced and regulates the drain current of MOSFET. A potential barrier exists between the source and the channel region, and the barrier reduces as the gate voltages rise. It leads to an increase in drain current. This effect leads to two issues: an increase in OFF current and subthreshold conduction. The subthreshold conduction is required to increase the drain current I DS by ten, and there is a requirement for gate voltage. Reduction in power dissipation at OFF state and higher I ON /I OFF ratio are achieved by reducing the value of subthreshold conduction. But in the case of MOSFET, the subthreshold swing is limited to 60 mV/decade. The gate voltage value is required to increase the turn-on ratio (I ON /I OFF ). Hence, it is not easy to scale down the voltage in the case of MOSFET. Tunnel field transistors preferred to overcome the limitations for the following reasons. Due to a fundamental difference in the current control mechanism between TFETs and MOSFETs, a subthreshold slope is less than 60 mV/decade in TFETs. The thermionic emission of free carriers over the potential barrier between the source and the channel determines the current in MOSFETs. TFETs, on the other hand, rely on charge carriers tunneling over a potential barrier between the source valence band and the channel conduction band to generate current. Because this potential barrier is so significant in the device's OFF state, TFETs have a shallow OFF-state current. Along with these issues, MOSFET also suffers from specific effects when the channel reduces. Short-channel effects like leakage current, velocity saturation, deterioration of mobility, outcomes of hot carriers, drain-induced barrier lowering, the subthreshold current between drain and source, and variation of threshold voltage to the channel length occur when the channel size shrinks. Tunnel fieldeffect transistors are needed to avoid this. 
 Challenges of TFET The main limitation noted in tunnel FETs is the ON current. The ON current of TFET is comparatively low when compared to the MOSFETs. Because of this, low ON current degrades the performance of the TFET and increases the threshold voltage. The major limitation in TFET occurs at negative gate voltage. The holes, the minority carriers, and the tunnel from the drain region to the channel region produce a reverse current equivalent to the current produced at positive gate voltage. In complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, 45 nm ON current is in the range of mA, and the OFF current is nA. However, in TFET, 45 nm ON current is μA, and the OFF current is in pA to fA. Negative gate bias reduces the barrier width at the drain-channel junction, causing ambipolar conduction. 
 Overview of Heterostructures and Homostructures in TFET For improving the ON current of TFETs, numerous research works  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]  have been conducted in the areas of gate engineering and channel engineering. Due to their small effective masses, high electron mobility, and enhanced band-to-band tunneling generation rate, TFET devices (heterojunction devices) based on III-V compound materials are increasingly desirable. Low-bandgap material has been added to the source channel interface to increase the ON current. In contrast, wide-bandgap material has been added to the drain channel interface to decrease the ambipolar current.   
 Evolution of TFET with a Heterostructure As shown in Fig.  24. 3, an interface between two layers or areas of different semiconductors is known as a heterojunction. In contrast to a homojunction, these semiconducting materials exhibit asymmetrical bandgaps. Improvisation in ON current is proposed by using a source material other than a channel. The channel's energy bandgap is more than the source material in the heterostructure case. The energy bandgap improves the tunneling probability, reducing the tunneling barrier width between the channel and source region. Sahoo et al.  [8]  demonstrated the Gaussian doping that improves the performance of heterojunction double gate TFETs. A heterojunction enhances the device's drain current and transconductance properties by reducing the leakage current.  
 Need for Modeling Building proper TFET models to use the device in various applications is mandatory. The models help analyze and optimize the device and provide a physical understanding of how the device works. For computing more applications of TFETs, circuit simulators tie in with the models proposed in TFETs. These models are used to highlight the dominance of tunnel FETs over conventional MOSFETs. Apart from the above features mentioned, they are also used to explore the device details and analyze the performance at the system and circuit levels. The modeling of surface potential is done by parabolic approximation method. 
 Parabolic Approximation Method One of the most frequent methods to solve the surface potential is the parabolic approximation method or pseudo-2D modeling by employing one-dimensional linear differential equations and various mathematical techniques. There are two different classifications of computing the surface potential using the pseudo-2D model. The potential distribution computes by considering the TFET in both the x and y directions. The boundary conditions determine its associated coefficients. As a result, the parabolic approximation approach is to solve the surface potential. In resolving the 2D Poisson equation, the first step involved is considering the characteristic equation of 2D Poisson and making the constant values zero. The next step involved is the computation of a particular integral. 
 Modeling and Simulation of Dual-Material Asymmetric Hetero-Dielectric Gate TFET  Figure 24.4  indicates the two-dimensional and three-dimensional structure of a heterojunction, hetero-dielectric dual-material asymmetric gate. This structure uses germanium in the source (P + region) and silicon materials in the intrinsic and drain (N + region). Two different materials, hafnium and silicon dioxide, are taken at the top and bottom of the oxide layer, forming the asymmetric structure. M1 and M2 metals are taken as gold and tungsten, respectively. Its corresponding work functions of L1 and L2 are ɸ M1 and ɸ M2 . The reduced barrier width allows the tunneling of electrons from the valence band of the p þ source region to the conduction band of the channel region. After tunneling to the channel region via the BTBT mechanism, electrons transport to the drain via drift diffusion, forming a drain current. Also, the influence of ambipolar conduction reduces when the acceptor (source region) concentration is higher than the donor (drain region).

 Drain Current Model The built-in tunnel barrier is the prominent part of tunnel FET features. The current through the source and drain current is controlled by gate. The influence of band-toband tunneling accomplishes this. The generation rate (G BTBT ) is to tunnel the electron toward the intrinsic region of the channel from the source. Band-to-band tunneling is performed by employing different device models and is attainable from the TCAD simulator. Using Kane's model, the electric field in vertical and lateral directions is considered for computing the band-to-band tunneling. The path of tunneling lipped on the midpoint of the electric field. The electric field taken in the lateral direction from the source and channel predicts to be irregular.

 Results and Discussion Figure  24 .5 represents the transfer characteristics of drain current over various gate voltages. From the graph, the inference is OFF current obtained is 10 À10 A/μm (at V gs ¼ 0 V), and the ON current obtained is 10 À5 A/μm (at V gs ¼ 1 V). Hence, the resultant value obtained is I ON /I OFF ¼ 10 5 . Thus, the asymmetric gate improves ON current performance and reduces one of the properties of the short-channel effect: leakage current. Figure  24 .6 indicates the influence of the drain current over the gate voltage. The drain-to-source voltage (drain bias) varies from 0.1 V to 0.6 V. From the figure, the resultant drain current obtained (for V ds ¼ 0.6 V) is 5 Â 10 6 . In turn, this causes a rapid increase in tunneling current, which achieves by reducing the tunneling barrier width of the device.  In the source region, the effect of trap carriers analyze. The influence of trap carriers is considered as damaged length and is L d . In this work, a donor-type charge trap is supposed to improve band-to-band tunneling. The acceptor-type trap avoids because it leads to an increase in tunneling width. The ON current increases due to the influence of the donor-type charge trap. The donor-type interface traps have been considered rather than the acceptor type. The trap level is located at the source channel junction and not at the drain end can make the ON current increase. It can decide the effect of leakage current (OFF current). As the traps do not include the drain end, the electric field increases the ambipolar current. The oxide thickness is taken in the lower value to reduce the effects of ambipolar current. Two different metal functions are gold and tungsten. The simulation for the device structure obtains by using the TCAD simulator.

 Drain Current Modeling To develop a drain-current model, the first step is to compute the minimum tunneling length. The valence band of the source aligns with the conduction band of the intrinsic channel area, and the charge carrier begins to tunnel at the source-channel interface. The lateral distance between the source-channel interface (z ¼ 0) and the point in the channel where the surface potential changes by an amount of unit bandgap energy per elementary charge (E g /q) are the shortest tunneling distance. For such reasons only, the minimum tunneling length observes at the valence band and the conduction band, i.e., the two-equilibrium energy points length. The band-to-band tunneling rate is used to compute the drain current by assuming the radius of the channel proportional to the thickness.

Abstract Following Moore's law, semiconductor mainstream electronics (processors, memories, etc.) enjoyed a very dynamic evolution over decades. Key to this success was the continuous scaling of the silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (Si MOSFET). In 2020, Si MOSFETs with 20-nm gates is in mass production, currently we are in 7-nm gate, and the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) predicts 3-nm technology in future. As the MOSFETs are scaled down to nanometer scales, the prime area of concern becomes the drive current deterioration. This is because of the very high vertical and horizontal electrical fields which reduce the carrier mobility and hence the drive current in scaled devices. Field Effect Transistor is the backbone of semiconductor electronics. It represents the basic building block of systems of modern information and communication technology, and progress in the important field critically depends on rapid improvements of FET performance. An efficient option to achieve the goal is the introduction of novel channel materials into FET technology. In the last decade, the Tunnel Field Effect Transistors (TFETs) have received a significant σ 1 ¼ qB kane E g þ β 2 Þ ð 24:21Þ 
 Results and Discussion 
 Introduction Electronics industry growth over the past three decades has been mostly driven by complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology scaling, which has made it possible to integrate more components densely at faster degree  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Present manufactured transistors are 20 times faster and occupy less area. Moore's prediction has been used to direct long-term planning and establish goals for research advancement, acting in some ways as a self-fulfilling prediction. Moore proposed that numeral of transistors in integrated electronic circuits will upsurge exponentially. Recently, the size of CMOS has decreased to the nanometer range, making power management challenging for metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) scaling. This has commanded to a number of problems, including gate tunnelling current, source or drain-to-channel coupling and parasitic effects, subthreshold swing limited to 60 mV/dec, as well as short-channel effects (SCE), which include drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL), higher leakage current, and lower I ON /I OFF ratio  [6] . In order to solve these issues, a MOSFET alternative called TFET has been developed. Tunnel transistors were developed by T. Baba in 1992. TFETs are suitable for low-power applications because of their lower subthreshold swing, higher I ON /I OFF ratio, less short-channel effects, and reduced leakage current  [7] . TFETs can be classified into two types such as planar TFET and three-dimensional TFET structure. Figure  25 .1 depicts the schematic view of planar TFET. When compared to MOSFETs, it features a p-i-n structure with a strongly doped p-type source and n-type drain. This illustrates the simple fabrication combination of TFET and MOSFET. Planar TFET is p-i-n structure that operates under reverse biased condition; it exhibits the lower leakage current, five orders higher magnitude of I ON /I OFF ratio but has low ON-state current  [8] . voltage due to which channel potential is comparable with drain potential. As a result of this phenomena, a further rise in gate voltage has trivial effect on the energy bands in channel. Low ON current restricts the applications of TFETs, despite their mastery of subthreshold swing and OFF current enhancements  [9] . To overwhelm the disadvantage of low ON-state current, many TFET structures were introduced such as double gate (DG) TFET, triple gate (TG) TFET, and gate-all-around (GAA) TFETs. Further, to improvise the ON-state current, the heterostructures and gate engineering are used for various models. Gate engineering technology of device is variation of work function of gate material. The drain current is directly impacted by the work function, which is represented by an energy difference with a lattice. The work function variation has impact on ions and electrons to tunnel at faster rate  [10] . Due to this advantage of the gate engineering, this technology is used for the various devices to improve the drain current such as double material double gate (DMDG) TFET, triple material double gate (TMDG) TFET, double material triple gate (DMTG) TFET, triple material triple gate (TMTG) TFET, double material gate-all-around (DMGAA) TFET, and triple material gate-all-around (TMGAA) TFET. 
 Gate Material Engineering As the MOS device dimensions shrink to nanometer regime, the gate of CMOS device loses its control over the channel. To overcome this, gate material engineering was introduced by Long et al.  [11] . The performance of device is significantly influenced by modification of gate metal work function. Gate metal work function of device further improves ON-state currents compared to multiple gate device structure. 
 Double Material Gate Dual material gate (DMG) silicon-on-insulator (SOI) TFETs are promising devices to continue CMOS technology scaling in sub-22-nm regime, since they provide better control of short-channel effects (SCE) as compared with SG TFETs. The DMG TFET device is fabricated using silicon-on-insulator (SOI), which offers higher electrical characteristics over SG SOI TFET such as reduced leakage current, excellent latch-up immunity, and enhanced output current. The proposed work is to learn the potential benefits offered by DMG TFETs using parabolic approximation method, which provides simple and accurate predictions. A new dual material gate (DMG) FET device construction was introduced in 1999, as shown in Fig.  25   The first part of gate nearby source regime is called tunnelling gate with lower work function that controls the tunnelling rate. The second part of gate nearby the drain is called auxiliary gate with higher work function compared to tunnelling gate that controls the OFF-state current. As a result of the choice of lower work function for tunnelling gate exhibits higher I ON , lower I OFF , and better subthreshold swing is attained. Electrons tunnel to the channel using drift diffusion mechanism. Figure  25 .5 shows surface potential profile of DMDG TFET. It is observed that when the gate metal 1 length is reduced, electric potential shifts towards the source side. By reason of this potential across channel, the electric field is uniform, which results in higher carrier drift velocity  [12] . Figure  25 .6 shows that the drain current comparison plot varied with regard to gate voltage; in this graph, the SG TFET drain current is compared with the DMDG TFET. It is studied that DMDG TFET drain current is high compared to the SG TFET device.  material. Silicon dioxide act as dielectric medium for width of front gate and buried oxide width  [13] . Figure  25 .9 depicts the surface potential comparison plot of SMTG TFET and DMTG TFET; it is observed that the channel potential enhances when gate-to-source voltage is improved at drain voltage constant. From the figure it is vibrant that the screening effect is additionally noticeable in DM TG-TFET when compared with SM TG-TFET, which indicates an advantage of double material gate engineering. Figure  25 .10 shows the transfer characteristic comparison of the SMTG TFET and DMTG TFET; it is studied that the DMTG TFET plot follows the same trend as     For negative gate voltages, the device performs as a p-type TFET. The energy bands in the intrinsic region underneath the gate are raised, and band-to-band tunnelling occurs flanked by the intrinsic region's valence band (VB) and the n þ region's conduction band. Figure  25 .14 shows that the leakage current has been pointedly reduced, indicating that SCE has been suppressed. 
 Triple Material Gate Tri-material gate (TMG) MOSFETs are a novel structure that is suggested as a way to improve immunity to short-channel effects (see Fig.  25.15) . This has three metals, M1, M2, and M3, in the gate, each with a distinct work function  [16] . The occurrence of two steps in the surface potential profile is beneficial for both suppressing SCE and increasing carrier transport efficiency at the same time. This structure's surface potential profile steps minimize the electric field at the drain, resulting in a smaller hot carrier effect (HCE) at the drain. Triple Material Double Gate TFET Figure  25 .16 shows the schematic view of the TMDG TFET; in this structure, three metals are used for both the gates. The work function of the three metals has to be chosen between 4 and 5 eV. By reason of the use of reduced work function at source side exhibits the low OFF-state current. Because band overlap increases as tunnelling width decreases, the probability of carriers tunnelling on the source side increases. Figure  25 .17 shows the surface potential of TMDG TFET; it is observed that use of triple material presents the steep variation due to the variable work function.

From the plot it is observed that the TMDG TFET has higher drain current variation compared to DMDG TFET.  the bandgap to lower nanometer stage to facilitate the charge carriers to migrate from source regime to the conduction band of the drain through narrow band. Channel potential is improved with increase in the gate-to-source voltage  [17] . Figure  25 .22 indicates the transfer characteristics of the TMTG TFET; it is studied that the I ON current is 10 À4 for the TMTG TFET whereas 10 À7 for the DMTG TFET. The ON-state current of TMTG TFET represents the more significant device compared to the DMTG TFET.

Figure  25 .26 depicts the IV characteristics of TMGAA TFET for different drain-to-source voltage of 0.8 V, 1 V, and 1.2 V. When VDS is amplified, a higher drain voltage exists at the tunnelling junction, causing the potential barrier to lower. The channel resistance rises, and the drain potential has no effect on the tunnelling barrier width across the source regime. As a result, the drain current becomes saturated  [18, 19] . Analytical Model (TMSGTFET)  Junctionless TFET Transistors TCAD(V GS = 1.2 V) V GS = 1.2 V Drain Current (A/Pm) TCAD(V GS = 1.0 V) V GS = 1.0 V TCAD(V GS = 0.8 V) V GS = 0.8 V Drain Voltage (V) The fundamental limitations of MOSFET scaling are about to be reached. A transistor with no metallurgical junction has recently been proposed, successfully manufactured, and given the name junctionless field-effect transistor (JLFET). A concentration gradient in the lateral direction of the conduction layer has disappeared from this device, indicating no p-n junction. This device should also be easier from fabrication point of view, have superior electrostatic properties, and should be less variable than MOSFET, because it does not require any metallurgical junctions. While the JLFET exhibits better electrical characteristics than MOSFET and less fluctuation, its subthreshold slope (SS) is still constrained, much like in a MOSFET  [20] .    
 Abstract The invention of the transistor marked a pivotal moment in microelectronics, enabling the development of smaller, more efficient electronic devices. Transistors, particularly MOSFETs, have undergone significant size reduction, facilitating the integration of billions of them into a single integrated circuit (IC). This miniaturization has fueled the evolution of portable gadgets, such as smartphones, into powerful handheld computers. However, aggressive scaling of transistor size presents challenges such as increased leakage current and the dominance of parasitic elements, necessitating innovative structural modifications. Despite these challenges, advancements like Double Gate MOSFETs and FinFET structures have improved device performance. This chapter explores the transformative impact of transistor scaling on electronics technology, addressing both its benefits and challenges. 
 Introduction The invention of transistor was revolutionary in the field of microelectronics technology  [1] [2] [3] . The vacuum tube used to require several hundred volts of anode voltage to operate which required few watts of power, whereas transistors required only few millivolts of power  [4] [5] [6] . Transistors are the key circuit components of any electronic circuit both for digital and analog applications. With time, the size of the transistors has reduced to a few nanometers. To enhance the functionality of the existing electronic gadget, it is desirable to put more number of transistors in the IC of same chip area  [7] [8] [9] . More and more transistors in the same chip area help to incorporate more circuits, which results in more applications. For that reason, the transistor size has to be scaled down day by day with the increasing demand of complex portable device functionality  [10, 11] . This leads to the aggressive scaling of the device size. The smaller transistors size will help to pack more and more devices in a given chip area, hence the electronic gadgets will be smarter as well as cheaper  [10] [11] [12] [13] . This leads to incorporating few billions of transistors in a single IC, thus making it possible to build computers which are portable and handheld. A real-world example is our mobile phone which is much more powerful than the computers of a few decades back. A simple computer used to require a huge room for its circuitry in the 1960s, whereas our handheld smartphones are much more efficient now  [14] . This is possible as the transistor size has reduced to below 10 nanometers in size and efficient technology is there to fabricate billions of transistors and their interconnections in small chip area  [14] [15] [16] . The circuits are more or less the same as earlier, only the difficulty level has increased due to the few nanometer size  [16] . How small is it? To familiarize with this small size, the example of human hair can be taken which is around 100 micrometers in diameter. If the human hair is divided equally into 100 pieces, then a single piece would give 1 micrometer. That 1 micrometer has to be divided equally 1000 times to get 1 nanometer. The dimensions we are using to design transistors are 7-8 nanometers. There are different types of transistors, mainly BJT (bipolar junction transistor), JFET (junction field-effect transistor), and MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor). Among these different types of transistors, size reduction is possible for MOSFETs only  [17] . Therefore, MOSFETs are considered ideal circuit components for the VLSI (very large-scale integration) circuits. Small transistor size helps to incorporate more circuit components and more applications in the same chip area. More and more applications mean the portable gadgets become smarter. Hence, the mobile phones of a few years back were for calling and texting purposes only, now it is a handheld smart computer. With the reduction of transistor size, other benefits like faster and less power consuming circuits are achievable. Any processors consist of two parts, a basic memory part and different types of combinational circuits for its logic operations designed using MOSFETs only as shown in Fig.  26 .1. Although logically size deduction of MOSFETs are possible and hence, industry start scaling in aggressive way, several challenges came into the picture. Nothing comes for free; therefore, with the benefits of size reduction of MOSFETs, some disadvantages and challenges also come into the picture. When the size of the MOSFETs are reduced below certain limits, ON/OFF control becomes difficult as the gate loses control. This increases leakage current of the device and drains out portable gadget battery quickly  [18, 19] . Besides that, parasitic elements start dominating over the device performance. Therefore, conventional device structure needs modifications to improve device performance with the device size reduction or scaling. This is a huge scope for innovative structure design for the engineers with the modification of conventional MOSFET structure. Several modifications have been implemented to bring back the gate control of the MOSFETs in the scaled below 100 nanometer devices. Structures like double gate MOSFET (DG-MOS), tri-gate MOSFET, and gate-all-around or FinFET structures improve device's gate control and analog/digital/RF performances  [17] [18] [19] [20] . The miniaturization of the electron devices of millions of times by the micro/ nanoelectronics technologies has given us tremendous improvement of billions trillion times on the system and machine performance, such as on operational speed, energy consumption, size, and cost, and opened today's smart society. Progress of the micro/nanoelectronics has been accomplished by the downsizing  [21] [22] [23] .  
 Why MOSFET? The first inception of metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) was in 1960  [24] [25] [26] [27] . It has been one of the most important devices in the semiconductor industry to be integrated in monolithic ICs to serve as a basic switching element for digital circuits and as an amplifier for analog applications. In conventional silicon MOSFET as shown in Fig.  26 .2, the gate metal is separated from the channel by an insulating silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) layer. The charge carriers of the conducting channel constitute an inversion charge, that is, electrons in the case of a p-type substrate (n-channel device) or holes in the case of an n-type substrate (p-channel device), induced in the semiconductor at the siliconinsulator interface by the voltage applied to the gate. The electrons enter and exit the channel at n + source and drain contacts in the case of an n-channel MOSFET, and at p + contacts in the case of a p-channel MOSFET. The channel of the device is considered L G , and the effective channel length L is (L G -L D ), where L D is the gate-source/drain overlap length. In case of MOSFET, the drain current equation (Eq. 26.1) in saturation is:  It signifies that if the technology and voltage parameters remain unchanged, while W and L are reduced, keeping the ratio constant, the drain current I d will also remain unchanged in spite of scaling the device. As a result, MOSFET has been considered as a very suitable transistor for VLSI circuits. The aggressive scaling of MOSFETs started and the semiconductor industry has showcased a spectacular exponential growth in the number of transistors per integrated circuit for several decades, as predicted by Moore's law  [28] . The doubling of transistor density was first observed by Gordon Moore, the cofounder of Intel in 1965 and is commonly referred to as Moore's law. This prediction has been the case for many years and remarkably followed by the semiconductor industry for more than the last 50 years. The number of transistors in the computer processors are increasing with the time. The main driving forces behind the gate length scaling are the higher switching speed and increase of packing density. Industry has been following the graph as predicted by  Moore 1965 . The processor speed is almost fixed between 1.3 GHz and 2.8 GHz, after 2010 which is barely double, but what needs to be kept in mind is that the 2.8GHz is a quad core  [29, 30]  while the 1.3GHz is a single core. This means that the actual power of the 2.8GHz would be found if you multiply by four though the individual processor speed is fixed. To continue to improve the performance of the circuits to integrate more functions into each chip, feature size has to shrink. As the number of transistors has increased, the amount of power per unit area is growing and heat removal has become a concern. Though the supply voltage has scale down to 5 V to 2.5 V, power dissipation has not reduced. I d ¼ μC ox 2 W L V gs À V th 
 Challenges and Scaling Issues The cost of cooling subsystems makes the entire system costly  [31] [32] [33] . In the past, computational work was the primary use of any portable device, whereas, presently, major power consumption is taking place due to the increase of processing speed. With the aggressive scaling of the MOSFET, the device channel length has reached to sub-nanometer range and the device size has become comparable with the size of bacteria, virus, and DNA as shown in Fig.  26 .3 where a 35 nm MOSFET  [34]  is shown with bacteria, virus, proteins, and DNA. The MOSFETs having sub-35 nm channel length are facing several challenges and complications to fabricate in a single IC for the modern processors with billions of transistors with their interconnections. With reducing the geometrical parameters increases fabrication complexities and challenges in device fabrication. A MOSFET device is considered to be short when the channel length is the same order of magnitude as the depletion-layer widths of the source and drain junctions. As the channel length L is reduced to increase both the operating speed and the number of components per chip, the so-called short-channel effects (SCE) arise. The SCE is the major problem where the device tends to lose control of the channel carriers when the source and drain are brought into close proximity without scaling other device parameters  [35] [36] [37] . Eventually, the gate terminal cannot turn off and therefore it increases the OFF-state static leakage power. Therefore, power consumption of the device increases, and it is very difficult to use the device as there is no control over the gate. Researchers need to come up with new device structure to continue the scaling. Parasitic capacitance and resistance are the two main quantities that cause a real transistor to switch more slowly and dissipate higher power than expected from the purely intrinsic device. The parasitic capacitances and resistances start dominating over the device's performances and limit the overall device performance  [38] . The parasitic capacitance limits the cut-off frequency of the device. It is a serious problem for engineers involved in processor design. The devices inside the processor cannot deal with the applied high frequency input signal as the increased parasitic elements limits its maximum frequency of oscillation (f max ). As a result, it is required to use multiple processors where multicore processor is integrated for enhanced performance and to reduce the processing time instead of increasing the single processor's speed to overcome the cut-off limitations  [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . A dual-core processor contains two cores, and a quad-core processor contains four cores. Integration of a multicore chip drives production yields down and they are more difficult to manage thermally than lower-density single-chip designs. Multicore processors cost more than their single-core counterparts. The higher the number of cores, the higher is the power consumption and the heat radiated from the processor. Multicore processors need additional heat sinks to cool the processors. These are the challenges for the sustainability of the battery power of any portable gadgets  [5, 37, 38] . 
 Origin of Power Dissipation in CMOS Circuits MOSFET-based circuits, which consist both PMOS and NMOS, are called complementary MOS or CMOS  [22] [23] [24]  circuits as PMOS and NMOS have complementary characteristics. The symbolic representation of CMOS inverter is given in As the voltage at the input of the CMOS device varies between 0 and 5 volts, the state of the NMOS and PMOS varies accordingly. It can be considered each transistor as a simple switch activated by v 1 . The ON resistances between the source to drain have been considered as on r DSN and r DSP for NMOS and PMOS, respectively. These resistances are considered because the MOSFETs are not ideal switch. Always there is finite amount of channel and source/drain resistance of the device. The interesting feature of the CMOS circuit is that there is no short circuit path between V DD and ground either input is high or low which is evident from Figs. 26.5 and 26.6. Therefore, power consumption of the CMOS circuit is very low. Maximum power consumption takes place in any circuit when there is direct path between V DD and ground. The ground is the infinite sink of the current, and when the circuit gets a short circuit path between V DD and ground, maximum power consumption takes place. For the portable gadget, V DD comes from the battery of the portable gadget. During the logic transition, both the transistor go to the ON state momentarily and then a short circuit path is being created between V DD and ground. Therefore, in any CMOS circuits, the first source of power consumption is logic transition of the circuits. Consequently, the battery needs to charge again and again, which is not at all an option when someone is moving or travelling. To reduce the short circuit power dissipation, it is required that MOSFETs will switch faster. The output logic translation of the CMOS circuit depends on the charging or discharging of the parasitic capacitances of the MOSFETs associated with the circuits as shown in Fig.  26 .4. The associated parasitic capacitance of the transistor restricts the cut-off frequency of the transistor. This parasitic capacitance reduction can reduce the output logic transition time, in turn the dynamic power or power consumed in the circuit during logic transition. Another source of power dissipation is called static power dissipation and subthreshold leakage power dissipation. The subthreshold leakage power is also known as static power dissipating through the device in the absence of any switching operations. This leakage current occurs as the transistors are not a perfect switch and not faster due to the parasitic elements associated with it. The parasitic elements dominate over the device's performance with scaling, which is a major obstacle to the size reduction of the MOSFET  [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] .  
 Parasitic Elements of the MOSFET The parasitic capacitance of the MOSFET is considered as unavoidable and unwanted capacitance that exists due to the stored charges in the conducting channel and depletion layers which can be expressed through different capacitance elements as indicated in Fig.  26 .7. The parasitic overlap capacitance is considered between the gate electrode and the highly doped source/drain regions (C 3 and C 4 ). The parasitic junction capacitance is between substrate and source/drain regions (C 5 and C 6 ). The intrinsic gate region charge is divided as the mobile inversion charge and the depletion charge. These charges are distributed along the channel non-uniformly when drain to source voltage is applied. MOSFET capacitances can be classified into two distinct groups: extrinsic capacitances and intrinsic capacitances as indicated in Fig.  26 .8. Here C gso and C gdo are the gate-to-source overlap capacitance and gate-to-drain overlap capacitance, respectively, which are indicated in Fig.  26 .7 as C 3 and C 4 . R s and R d are the resistances due to source and drain regions of the MOSFET. The capacitive element below the gate oxide where the channel forms between the drain and the source is considered as intrinsic capacitances  [15, 17, 18, 23, 43] . These capacitances are highly dependent on the voltages at the terminals and the distribution of the electric field in the device. Hence, intrinsic capacitance is considered as external voltage-dependent parameter. Extrinsic capacitances refer to the sum parasitic capacitive effects outside the channel region, mainly overlap, other parasitic and junction capacitances. Source and substrate junction capacitance is denoted as C js , and drain and substrate junction capacitance is denoted as C jd in Fig.  26 .9 and as C  5   The equivalent circuit of the MOSFET in OFF state with extrinsic parameters is depicted in Fig.  26 .9. After application of the voltages, using the Y parameter analysis, both intrinsic and extrinsic values can be calculated. To determine the values of extrinsic components, the zero bias has to be applied and the parameters on which effects voltages will be eliminated. Using the de-embedding techniques, both the component values are calculated from the Y and Z parameter matrix. De-embedding is the method of removing parasitic components  [17] . The source and drain resistance are evaluated using shift and ratio method. The intrinsic and extrinsic components are calculated from the small-signal equivalent circuit of a MOSFET using Y and Z parameter analysis. The [Y in ] matrix is converted to [Z in ], and source/drain resistance R s and R d are de-embedded to obtain the pure intrinsic Y-parameter matrix [Y int ] as reported in Ref.  [40] . The parameters are calculated and represented in the following equations from Eqs.  26   C gdo ¼ À Im Y 21 ð Þ ω ð26:2Þ C gso ¼ Im Y 11 ð ÞþIm Y 21 ð Þ ω ð26:3Þ Z int À R s R s R s R s þ R d ð Þ ¼ Z int ð26:4Þ C gd ¼ À Im Y int 12 ω ð26:5Þ R gd ¼ À Re Y int 12 ω 2 C 2 gd ð26:6Þ g m ¼ Re Y int 21 ω 2 ¼0 ð26:7Þ g ds ¼ Re Y int 22 ω 2 ¼0 ð26:8Þ L sd ¼ g ds τ m ð26:9Þ C gs ¼ Im Y int 11 þ Im Y int 12 ω ð26:10Þ R gs ¼ 1 C 2 gs Re Y int 11 ω 2 À R gd C 2 gd ð26:11Þ τ m ¼ 1 g m À Im Y int 21 ω À C gd ð26:12Þ 
 RF Performance of the MOSFET The RF (radio frequency) plays an important role in the wireless communications, and the wireless communications market dramatically grows up. Transistors/devices used in the communications technology-related circuits should be able to deal with this high frequency. To determine the transistor RF performance, the two main figure-of-merits (FoMs) are the cut-off frequency f T and the maximum frequency of oscillation f max . In this section, the cut-off frequency f T and the maximum frequency of oscillation f max will be discussed  [17, 37, 40] . 
 Cut-Off Frequency The cut-off frequency f T is defined as the transition frequency where small-signal current gain I out I in drops to unity. It is a determine of the maximum useful frequency of a device when it can be used as an amplifier. When small-signal current gain I out I in drops to unity, the transistor will not be used as the amplifier anymore for that particular frequency. It will limit the use of transistors for higher frequencies. The f T is a more appropriate figure-of-merit for digital circuits where speed is the primary concern. The basic small-signal equivalent circuit of a MOSFET has been indicated in Fig.  26 .10. To determine the effects of parasitic elements which limit the cut-off frequency and maximum frequency of oscillation of the transistor, gate and drain capacitance C gd and gate and source capacitance C gs have been incorporated in the small-signal equivalent as shown in Fig.  26 .11. For AC analysis, all DC sources must be considered as zero, as shown in the equivalent circuit in Fig.  26 .12. Gate-todrain capacitance C gd and gate-to-source capacitance C gs will form a parallel configuration. Therefore, in the equivalent circuit, C gd and C gs will be in series as shown in Fig.  26 .12. Now let us consider the current pushed to the input gate terminal indicated as I in and output current measured in the drain terminal as I out . From the circuit of Fig.  26 .12 as the input voltage and current at the gate terminal are V gs , and I in , respectively, hence V gs can be denoted in Eq. 26.13 as follows:    I out g m ¼ I in jω C gs þ C gd ð26: 16Þ I out I in ¼ g m jω C gs þ C gd ð26: 17Þ I out I in ¼ 1 ¼ g m jω C gs þ C gd ð26:18Þ ω T ¼ g m C gs þ C gd ð26:19Þ f T ¼ 1 2π g m C gs þ C gd ð26:20Þ 
 Maximum Frequency of Oscillation Maximum frequency of oscillation f max is defined as the frequency at which the power gain is unity. The power gain goes down as square of frequency and f max is more relevant for analog-circuit applications as it signifies at which the device can provide power gain  [22, 23, 38] . The transistor's high frequency performance is commonly characterized by the maximum frequency of oscillation f max . The V gs , V out , and Z in are the input gate-to-source voltage, input impedance and output voltages, respectively. Considering the small-signal equivalent circuit of a MOSFET as depicted in Fig.  26   Z in ¼ R g þ 1 jωC gs % R g ð26:21Þ Z out ¼ V out i out ð26:22Þ Considering the output current I out which is equal to the summation of output voltage by output current g m V gs and current between drain to gate terminal is expressed in Eq. 26.23. i out ¼ V out i out þ g m V gs þ i dg ð26:23Þ As we know, i dg ( g m V gs , hence, output current I out can be written as given in Eq. 26.24. i out ¼ V out i out þ g m V gs ð26:24Þ From the small-signal equivalent circuit of a MOSFET as shown in Fig.  26 .13, the arrangement of C gs and C gd with respect to output voltage and gate-to-source voltages is shown in Fig.  26    V gs ¼ 1 jωC gs 1 jωC gs þ 1 jωC gd V out ð26:25Þ V gs ¼ V out C gd C gs þ C gd ð26:26Þ V gs V out ¼ C gd C gs þ C gd ð26:27Þ Z out ¼ V out i out ð26:28Þ Z out ¼ V out V out i out þ g m V gs ð26:29Þ Z out ¼ V out V out V in þ g m V out C gd C gs þ C gd ð26:30Þ Z out ¼ 1 1 r o þ g m C gd C gs þ C gd ð26:31Þ Z out ¼ 1 1 r o þ g m C gd C T ð26:32Þ [Considering, C gs + C gd ¼ C T ] Therefore, it appears that r o k C T g m þ C gd The conjugate match of the small-signal equivalent circuit at the input side is depicted in Fig.  26 .15. For the maximum power transfer, according to the maximum power transfer theorem, the source impedance Z s should be equal to the gate resistance R g , so that input current i in is equal to i ins . In this way, I in has been expressed in Eq. 26.34. Similarly, the conjugate match of the circuit at the output end can be indicated in Fig.  26 .16. For the maximum of current, according to the maximum power transfer theorem, R L ¼ R out . Hence, i out ¼ i os 2 as shown in Fig.  26 .  16  and the power gain, hence, the maximum frequency of oscillation is derived using Eqs.  26   i in ¼ i ins ¼ V s Z s þ R g ð26:33Þ i in ¼ V s 2R g ð26:34Þ

The total input impedance becomes the summation of R g , R s and can be expressed as follows, Z in ¼ R g þ R s . For high frequency condition, gate-to-source capacitance C gs is considered as short-circuited. Hence, by replacing, R g ¼ R g þ R s in Eq. 26.40, the maximum frequency of oscillation can be presented in the following Eq. 26.41. f max ¼ 1 2 f T 2πf T C gd R g þ R s þ R g þ R s r o ð26:41Þ 
 Subthreshold Swing The subthreshold swing is an important parameter which determines the power consumption of the device in the OFF state. The subthreshold swing also is a measure of how sharply the drain current changes with the change of gate voltage during switching from 0 V to threshold voltage. Subthreshold swing is measured in mV/decade. The mV amount of incremental gate voltage required to change in the drain current by one decade. Due to fundamental thermodynamics constrains, the subthreshold swing minimum value at room temperature has to be 60 mV/decade. It is desired that during switching from 0 V to the threshold voltage, V th , the drain current change should be more with minimum change of gate voltage. Therefore, the subthreshold swing value is desired to be as small as possible. The subthreshold current is considered as a leakage current, between the source and drain when the device is below the threshold voltage or in weak inversion region. The drain current I D of MOSFETs consists of drift and diffusion current components. In the weak inversion region (V GS < V th ), the current between the source and the drain is dominated by the diffusion current component. The subthreshold drain current is dominated by diffusion current and can be expressed by Eq. 26.42.  I off ¼ μ n C ox W L 2qe si N a p 2 Ψ S p kT q 2 n i N A 2 e q kT ⁎ V GS ÀV th ð Þ m 1 À e À q kT VDS ð26:42Þ where, Ψ S is the surface potential ¼ V GS -V th ð Þ m m ¼ 1 þ C dep C ox Body Effect Coefficient, γ ¼ 2qε si N a C ox ¼ Oxide Capacitance C dep ¼ Depletion Capacitance μ n is the mobility of electron ¼ 1400cm 2 /V.s μ p is the mobility of hole ¼ 470cm 2 /V.s Relative permitivity of Silicon ¼ 11.9 N a ¼ Substrate Doping n i ¼ Intrinsic carrier concentation ¼ 1.45 Â 10 16 m À3 at 300K kT q is called thermal voltage ¼ 26mv k ¼ Boltzmann constant ¼ 1.38 Â 10 À23 J/k T¼ Absolute temperature in K V th ¼ Threshold Voltage V gs ¼ Gate to Source Voltage V ds ¼ Drain to Source Voltage q is the charge of an electron ¼ 1.602 Â 10 À19 C ε 0 ¼ Permitivity of vacuum¼ 8.85 Â 10 À12 F/m Dielectric Constant of Si ¼ 11.8 Dielectric Constant of SiO 2 ¼ 3.9 It is evident from this Eq. (26.41) that to achieve low I off to minimize OFF-state leakage current, the channel length L has to be increased, which is against the device scaling. It is also evident from Eq. 26.41 that the increase of threshold voltage V th will decrease I off ; however, threshold voltage raise will degrade the device performance. Another parameter in this equation, substrate doping, N A can minimize I off as it is proportional to the OFF-state leakage current, but substrate need to be kept undoped to avoid nonuniform dopant distribution in sub-100 nm MOSFETs. High substrate doping will lead to increase in short-channel effects like impurity scattering. SS is a measure of the ability to turn off a device, with a value typically of 60-100 mV per order of magnitude in current change, normally expressed as 60-100 mV/decade. The lower the SS, the steeper the curve with V GS , and the leakage will be lower. Drain current versus gate voltage characteristics in the logarithmic scale shows the subthreshold characteristics in Fig.  26 .18. From the logarithmic graph it is evident that amount of current before the threshold voltage is varied from nanoampere to microampere range. Although the current is very small in amount for a single transistor, but considering the processor which consists of billions of transistors, the cumulative current becomes in several amperes. This current is considered as the leakage current as it is happening below the threshold voltage, and this leakage current will reduce the battery power of the portable gadget. Hence, the minimization of subthreshold swing is very important. It is evident from Eq. 26.42 that subthreshold swing is inversely proportional to the C ox . The subthreshold slope SS is considered as d log 10 I off ð Þ dV GS 
 À1 : Therefore, performing the partial differentiation on Eq. 26.41, the subthreshold slope SS becomes SS ¼ @ log 10 I off @V GS À1 ¼ 2:3 kT q 1 þ C dep C ox ð26:43Þ m ¼ 1 þ C dep C ox , varies from 1.1 to 1.4 and kT q ¼ 26mv, Hence, Subthreshold Swing SS (minimum) becomes 2.3 Â 1.1 Â 26 ≈ 65.78. Therefore, the subthreshold slope is always greater than (~60 mV/dec) at room temperature. The oxide capacitance C ox ¼ eA t ox , and it is evident from Eq. 26.2 that sharper subthreshold swing or subthreshold swing minimization is possible by the use of thinner gate oxide thickness t ox which causes larger C ox . Therefore, to attain improved subthreshold swing, the VLSI industry started to scale down the oxide thickness t ox . The shrink of oxide thickness leads to the gate tunneling current, which is another roadblock to minimize OFF-state leakage current. For MOS, a transistor built in SOI technology, the subthreshold swing is usually better than in bulk technology. In fact, the subthreshold swing of SOI devices can even reach the optimum value depending on whether their bulk is fully depleted or partially depleted  [18, 19, 23] .  
 Methods to Overcome SCE Reducing the Gate Oxide Thickness Different methods have been adopted to overcome SCE in the conventional MOSFET. Future bulk transistor scaling requires new solutions such as high-k gated dielectric materials and shallow, ultralow resistivity junctions, partially/fully depleted and multigate MOSFET structures need to be developed  [39] [40] [41] . In the MOSFET, the gate dielectric thickness t ox is the single most important device dimension to enable device scaling and has also been the most aggressively scaled one. It is evident that with the t ox scaling, oxide capacitance C ox increases. A thin gate dielectric increases capacitive coupling from the gate to the channel, thereby reducing the source/drain influence on the channel. A larger gate capacitance also leads to a larger inversion charge density, which results in increased drain current. The gate dielectric thickness has been reduced aggressively with the technology generation  [41] . 
 The High-K Oxide Solution Due to aggressive gate oxide scaling, gate dielectric becomes very thin, as illustrated in Fig.  26 .19, that quantum mechanical direct tunneling through the thin oxide results in significant gate leakage currents below ~20 Å. The Si-Si distance is about 0.314, and it seems impossible to further scale down the gate oxide beyond the interatomic distance; therefore, when gate oxide thickness reaches to 1.5 nm, the gate leakage currents become a huge concern. In the direct-tunneling regime encountered for oxides thinner than about 3 nm, the gate leakage current increases dramatically (~3Â for every 1 Å of thickness reduction). The gate leakage can increase standby power as well as compromise proper dynamic logic operation  [42] . Thinning of t ox causes problems like localized sites of nonuniform oxide growth (pinholes) occurring and can cause electrical shorts between the gate and substrate; dielectric strength of the thin oxide may permit oxide breakdown due to application of an electric field in excess of breakdown field and may cause permanent damage due to current flow through the oxide. Many people have proposed replacing the silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) with higher permittivity (high-k) gate dielectrics  [41, 42]  such as zirconia (ZrO 2 ), lanthanum oxide (La 2 O 3 ), or hafnium oxide (HfO 2 ). These enable high gate capacitance with physically thick insulators through which tunneling is low. The effective oxide thickness (EOT) of alternative higher-k gate dielectric maintain adequate gate control needed for scaling while providing a large physical barrier to gate oxide tunneling, thereby reducing gate leakage. It is evident from the equation below that with the increase of k SiO 2 , oxide thickness t SiO 2 can be increased to maintain same oxide capacitance. For the same oxide capacitance, with the change of dielectric material, k H (9) for Al 2 O 3 , the oxide thickness t H can be increased by 9 3:9 ffi 2:4times and oxide thickness becomes 2.4 times thinner than t SiO 2 thickness. Hence, gate control increases device become more scalable and gate tunneling current decreases. C g ¼ K SiO 2 ∈ 0 t SiO 2 ¼ K H ∈ 0 t H However, replacement of SiO 2 creates lots of problem in the device as there is a good match between Si and SiO 2 . Replacing it make the Si and other high-k oxide interface very rough and surface scattering increases, which leads to the decrease of carrier mobility. SiO 2 can be grown easily from Si, and therefore, there is a good lattice match between Si and SiO 2 . Hence, SiO 2 is at the heart of the transistor, and replacing it is like performing a heart transplant. Si-SiO 2 is so good that it will take more time to develop alternatives as silicon dioxide is an amazing material. 
 Supply Voltage Scaling Limitations To reduce the short-channel effects, supply voltage V cc reduction could be a possible solution as this voltage applied to the drain terminal affecting in reducing gate barrier reduction. On the other hand, reduction of the supply voltage or supply voltage scaling makes the overall transistor slower. If the gate resistance is considered as R and oxide capacitance C is represented and shown in Fig.  26 .20. Voltage across the capacitor V c (t) can be derived by the following equations derived from the general equation of resistive load capacitor. This is evident from Eq. 26.44 that capacitor charging time increases with the supply voltage reduction. Therefore, to reduce the SCE, supply voltage scaling or reduction is not at a possible solution. Rather, supply voltage scaling makes the transistor slower as to reach the threshold voltage or creating inversion charge or forming the channel region under the transistor gate will take more time.

Steady scaling down of CMOS technology has been the driving force of the realization of high-performance very large-scale integration (VLSI) systems  [9, 11, 17] . With the growth in the field of communication, use of high frequency has become mandatory as the lower bands are already occupied  [14] . The devices used in the field of communication should be capable of handling frequency up to several gigahertz. In addition to this, there exists market demands for low-power consuming battery-operated portable device. As device size scales  show the better SCE suppression, the improved drive current, the transconductance, the lower leakage current, and the superior scaling capability compared to the bulk CMOS devices  [24] . Multiple gates and source/drain underlap multi-gate MOSFETs enhance the electrostatic channel control, the reducing short-channel effects (SCE), and the drain-induced barrier lowering  [25] . U-DG NMOSFET has become popular device architecture in the recent days due to its increased immunity to SCEs and the reduced overlap and fringing capacitances  [27, 29] . Among the possible solutions to overcome the SCEs in conventional DG MOSFETs, underlap regions have been incorporated. However, these underlap regions result in extra ON resistance (R on ) in the device. This extra resistance reduces the ON current of the analog device and therefore the analog performance degrades significantly. The reduced ON current (I on ) and increased source/drain resistance  [17]  due to the extended underlap regions are major drawbacks of the conventional U-DG NMOSFETs. Previously, these problems have been addressed by optimizing the underlap lengths L un and by the use of high-k spacer material in U-DG NMOSFETs  [18] . Use of high-k spacers in U-DG NMOSFETs increase the ON current; however, for very high values of spacer dielectric, the intrinsic gain of the device reduces. In the underlap dual material gate (U-DMG) DG NMOSFET, the surface potential is characterized by a step function  [19] ; due to this potential profile, the drain voltage is screened, reducing the draininduced barrier lowering (DIBL). The step potential profile is achieved by the use of different gate materials. Higher work function material near the drain side lowers the DIBL, whereas lower work function material near the drain side increases ON current of the device. The underlap regions added some extra resistances in the device, which in turn lowered the ON current of the device. Therefore, the lower work function material in the drain side has been used here to increase the device current. The use of DMG in U-DG NMOSFET also increases the carrier transport efficiency  [10, 14]  and in turn increases I on of the device. To overcome the SCE and to reduce the DIBL in DG MOSFET, an underlap is introduced. However, the underlap structure in DG NMOSFETs increases the source-to-drain series resistance (R SD )  [12]  which results in lower ON current (I on ). As the symmetry underlap (SYM-UDL)  [12]  reduces the I on of the device, the asymmetry underlap (ASYM-UDL) is selected to reduce R SD with only the drain side underlap. The increase in R SD is minimized further by the use of high-k spacer material that enhances the fringing in the source/drain underlap region  [13] . For further I on improvement, the dual material gate (DMG) is considered  [11, 14, 15] . As the increased demands for the speed with low-power consumption is the primary requirement for system-onchip (SoC) applications, high I on is the key requirement to achieve the abovementioned objective. Therefore, the gate oxide thickness (t ox ) scaling is essential to increase the gate oxide capacitance (C ox ), which in turn increases the I on of the device since it is directly proportional to the C ox . However, on decreasing the t ox , gate quantum mechanical tunneling phenomenon comes into effect for atomically thin gates which leads to gate leakage currents  [16] [17] [18] . The oxide thickness of about 1 nm is an absolute necessity for proper control of gate tunneling  [19] . This problem is mitigated by replacing silicon dioxide with dielectrics with high permittivity (high-k) like HfO 2 and Al 2 O 3 as gate insulators  [20]  to increase physical gate height, keeping the EOT same. However, the presence of interface traps and high scattering at the high-k silicon junction causes a substantial decrease in the mobility of the carriers and hence in the I on as well  [23] . This problem is mitigated by the usage of a thin layer of oxide padding since the junction between silicon and its oxide is smooth having minimum interface traps and hence resulting in minimum scattering. This arrangement is known as gate stack (GS)  [12] . Moreover, the placing of high-k above the oxide padding also enhances the convergence of the electric field applied across the channel  [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . improving the reliability of photovoltaic (PV) components. The efficiency and light concentration of III-V multijunction solar cells can be highly leveraged to reduce the cost of high-concentration PV systems. So, at the forefront, we are trying to develop a high-efficiency III-V multijunction solar cell for space and high-concentrated terrestrial applications. However, tunnel interconnects play a vital role in designing a multijunction solar cell. This study investigates an InGaP/ GaAs tandem cell for the better pair of tunnel junction under technology computer-aided design (TCAD) environment. For this, a detailed study of different combinations of tunnel junctions (TJ) is carried out. For AlGaAs tunnel junction, peak voltage (V peak ) of the tunnel diode and tunneling resistance (R t ) are found to be 0.1553 V and À5.724e06, respectively. AlGaAs as tunnel junction gives the optimum results by reducing the series resistance of the cell. For the proposed cell, the maximum short circuit current density (J sc ) ¼ 12.41 mA/cm 2 , 
 Introduction The fabrication of high efficiency solar cell is a challenge among the solar cell manufacturers since the inception of PV technology. It is possible only by the development of multijunction (MJ) solar cell, which efficiently uses the solar spectrum  [1] . For MJ cells, high efficiency can be achieved through low-loss interconnect devices, which minimize the optical and electrical losses. In most of monolithic tandem cells, a highly doped tunnel junction (TJ) is used as the interconnect device  [2] . The key requirements for a tunnel junction are: (1) low optical absorption, (2) high peak current, and (3) low voltage drop  [4] [5] [6] . Presence of tunnel region in MJ cells exhibit high cell current and efficiency than single junction solar cells. So proper choice of material for tunnel junction is critical in order to achieve high efficiency  [20, 24, 26] . One can choose either low bandgap material or a high bandgap material or a blend of both to design the TJ. Selection of wide bandgap materials help the manufacturer to fabricate optically transparent tunnel junction. However, as the bandgap of the material increases, the attainable tunneling current decreases due to the increase in the potential barrier height of the junction  [3]  In this work, the design of an InGaP/GaAs dual junction (DJ) solar cell is proposed with different tunnel diodes using materials such as AlGaAs/AlGaAs and GaAs/GaAs analyzed via TCAD tool. Here we investigated the characteristics such as recombination and generation rate and J/V characteristic of AlGaAs/AlGaAs and GaAs/GaAs tunnel diodes which affect the performance of the tandem cell. In simulation, different models of TCAD are used such as recombination models like Shockley-Read-Hall recombination (SRH), auger, radiative, and tunneling models like band to band (nonlocal path), generation model like band-to-band generation of electron-hole pair (EHP), and bandgap narrowing. The nonlocal generation of electrons and holes are caused by direct and phonon-assisted bandto-band tunneling  [23] . The generation rate is obtained from the nonlocal path integration, also the electron and holes pairs are generated nonlocally at the ends of tunneling path. Bandgap narrowing concept is used here by the help of a table known as tableBGN. This table gives the value of bandgap narrowing as a function of donor and acceptor concentration or total concentration. The actual bandgap narrowing contribution for each concentration type is interpolated from the table, using a scheme that is piecewise linear in the logarithmic form of the concentration  [7] . In 2010, Leem et al. proposed an optimized model for DJ solar cell using different tunnel diodes  [28] . According to their findings, the current matching of the cell depends on the type of tunnel diode used in the structure. So, tunnel diode is an important device which needs a detailed analysis. Investigation of the proposed DJ cell revels that use of AlGaAs tunnel diode in the cell shows an increment in performance (21%) instead of GaAs tunnel diode. 
 Modeling Process Device Structure 
 Tunnel Junction With a narrow depletion width, the degenerated type p-n junction (commonly referred as TJ) allows a quantum tunneling mechanism, and properties like optical transparency and low resistance become a critical paradigm in the MJ cell design  [1] . TJs are supposed to be in reverse direction between the top and bottom cells so that during the time of illumination, it can operate in forward bias and electrons can easily tunnel through it. Quantum tunneling of EHPs through the barrier helps greatly in the carrier transport phenomena of TJs. The tunneling can be categorized into two subtypes such as: (i) B2B or direct tunneling and (ii) trap-assisted tunneling. Esaki discussed about the inter-band tunneling using B2B model, which also holds good for intrinsic materials  [21] . But the principle behind this B2B model is demonstrated by Kane-Swampson that explains the tunneling of electrons through a potential barrier  [7] . Kane suggested that B2B model is of two types, such as local and nonlocal B2B. For this work, we have considered the nonlocal B2B technique, where a spatial carrier transport phenomena is considered through the barrier  [21] . The recombination of EHPs at different loci in nonlocal B2B suggests that there is a real transport of carrier through the barrier. The nonlocal B2B tunneling model estimates the tunneling probability for an electron from position u to l by the use of Wenzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation.

In this study, we focused on AlGaAs tunnel junction. Depending on the mole fraction, AlGaAs behaves as direct/indirect bandgap material. For the composition x < 0.4, it behaves as direct band, and for other composition, it acts as indirect band material. In indirect mode, it provides an E g of 2.043 eV. In this study, the composition x of AlGaAs is considered as 0.6. With the properties like more resistant towards heat and radiations, the wide bandgap materials are suitable for optoelectronic applications (Scribd online library. Accessed July 2015)  [12] . Other benefit of using wide band TJ is that it can suitably achieve higher junction temperature and thinner drift regions  [14] . As a negative resistance device, it has the capability of high frequency switching, which is proportional to drift velocity  [10] . High drift velocity helps the charge in depletion region of the diode to be transported faster. So, the reverse recovery current is very small  [12] . Due to wide bandgap, it creates a thin depletion region and the electric field is present in this thin region. So, the generated EHPs can stay some more time before they reach the terminals to be collected as currents, which in turn enhances the V oc of the DJ cell. With higher thermal stability, in case of wide bandgap material, the conductivity reduces at the junction, which in turn reduces the thermal resistance (R th-jc ) at the junction. Therefore, it is true for wide bandgap devices that the produced heat can be transmitted to the case, heat sink, and then to the ambient region, which ultimately reduces the device operating temperature  [12] . This model is very helpful for space application. The recombination in indirect band AlGaAs involves two particles, viz., photon and phonon. The indirect band materials need two particles to influence an electron from valence band (VB) to conduction band (CB), which reduces the light absorption probability. That is why a thick layer of indirect band material is required to utilize the accessible spectrum in comparison to direct band material  [2] . Also, for indirect bandgap semiconductors, the value of absorption coefficient (α) varies from high to low. In high α region, high photon energy can only excite an electron directly from valence band to conduction band. Low α is the probability of absorption of a photon and a phonon. But in case of direct bandgap semiconductor, α is high, so is the absorption probability. Therefore, it involves only photon absorption. In this work, nonlocal band-to-band tunneling model is used, where the tunneling relies on the tunneling path and band edge profile of the tunnel diode. For the band edge profile calculation, Silvaco tool solves the transport equations and the Poisson equation  [7] . 
 Results and Discussion Recombination is a process in which EHP's dies out. Figure  27 .2 shows different types of recombination of GaAs and AlGaAs tunnel junction. From Fig.  27 .2, it is clearly visible that all sorts of recombination (SRH, auger, radiative, and total bandto-band) are low for AlGaAs tunnel junction as compared to the GaAs. As it is known that all type of recombination depends on the material parameter carrier lifetime  [8] . But report shows that a general tendency for Al x Ga 1-x As is that the carrier lifetime decreases with increase of x and aluminum content in the material. The carrier lifetime also depends on the epitaxial growth techniques  [9] . But recombination rate is lower in indirect bandgap material  [8] . Again, the minority carrier lifetime in Al x Ga 1-x As is a function of SRH recombination  [9] , as it is seen that SRH recombination is lower in case of AlGaAs. Therefore, the minority carrier lifetime of AlGaAs is greater than that of GaAs. Table  27 .1 shows the extracted data from the J/V curve of tunnel diode (Fig.  27 .3). Figure  27 .3 shows the variation of current density with respect to bias voltage of tunnel diode, in which J peak , V peak , J valley , and V valley are also shown. The V peak of AlGaAs tunnel diode is high as compared to GaAs. It is due to the higher bandgap of AlGaAs, where the space charge region width is also high. So, voltage across its junction helps to increase the peak voltage and reduces the peak current density. The valley voltage and current of AlGaAs is low, because the high drift velocity helps to move the charge very fast from space charge region. It also shows that AlGaAs tunnel diode is a negative resistance device; it has certain advantages like it produces power  [10]  and it increases the voltage across the device terminal, resulting decrease in electric current  [19] . Hence, it helps to increase the V oc of the tandem solar cell. Again, from the table it is shown that J valley is a very small negative value and can be neglected. This leads towards an ideal tunnel diode configuration, where different losses like recombination at surface is minimum  [11] . The generation of EHPs in direct and indirect bandgap materials is known as bandto-band generation. The graph in Fig.  27 .4 shows the band-to-band generation of GaAs. The photon absorbed by GaAs generates EHPs when the electron is excited from valence band to conduction band. But here the result shows that the electron is not excited all the way through the bandgap. The electron is getting trapped in the midway and only a hole is created  [22] . This is why the generation of hole is greater in case of GaAs. From here, it is concluded that GaAs tunnel diode is not properly utilizing the absorbed photon energy. For AlGaAs, the band-to-band generation found to be zero from the simulation. As discussed above, it is only happening when the thickness of material is in the order of 100-300 μm. But here we are using only 25 nm thick device so it is not absorbing the photon. Hence, the EHP generation is zero  [2] . 
 Efficiency Comparison of Tandem Solar Cell for Different Tunnel Junctions Researchers and developers have keen interest on III-V group semiconductors to be used in MJ solar cells due to their higher conversion efficiency based on performance evaluation and sensitiveness towards different radiations  [1] . The efficiency of the solar cell mainly depends on the J sc and V oc of the solar cell. The current density is proportional to the solar radiation and inversely to the cell area  (Jain et al. 2014 ). As the concentration increases, the efficiency also increases till the series resistance or cell heating property starts to limit the performance  (Jain et al. 2014 ). From Table  27 .2, it is confirmed that all of the above discussed problem can be solved by putting AlGaAs TJ in between the top and bottom cell under same radiation and chip area. Here also the performance increases by 20.93% (≈21%). We can validate the above by looking in to the external quantum efficiency (EQE), internal quantum efficiency (IQE), and J/V curve of the cell. EQE is the probability of finding an electron in an external circuit for each incident photon of wavelength (λ) from the total incident spectrum  [15] . It is an important parameter for calculation of J sc in MJ solar cell  [13] . J sc ¼ λ2 λ1 qϕ λ ð ÞEQE λ ð Þdλ ð27:5Þ where J sc is short circuit current density, λ is wavelength, ϕ(λ) is photon flux of the corresponding incident light, and q is the elementary charge. Figure  27 .5 shows the EQE of InGaP/GaAs DJ solar cell as a function of wavelength for AlGaAs and GaAs tunnel diodes under AM1.5G illumination. For bottom cell, AlGaAs tunnel diode shows higher EQE as compared to GaAs, because the higher wavelength spectrum are not absorbed by wide bandgap tunnel diode  [25, 27] . From the graph, it is also clear that the top cell with AlGaAs tunnel diode  shows improved EQE as compared to GaAs, because it slows down the recombination process  [27] . In tandem solar cell, IQE analysis is used to find out minority carrier lifetime, diffusion length, and surface recombination velocity of the top and bottom surface of the cell. We can calculate IQE from EQE by using the bellow relation: IQE ¼ EQE 1 À R λ ð Þ À T λ ð Þ ¼ ΔJsc qΔϕ λ ð Þ 1 À R λ ð Þ À T λ ð Þ f g ð27:6Þ where ΔJ sc is the increment in short circuit current generated by a solar cell for incident incremental photon flux of Δϕ(λ) at wavelength λ, and R(λ) and T(λ) are reflectance and transmittance of solar cell at wavelength λ. Figure  27 .6 shows the IQE of top and bottom cell with respect to the wavelength. The bottom cell with AlGaAs tunnel diode shows better response, because the carrier generated at the bottom cell is able to travel through the junction for charge separation, i.e., high diffusion length of the generated carrier  [8] . Increment in IQE also suggests that the interface recombination has been reduced  [16, 27] . The peak value of IQE for AlGaAs TJ reflects in increment of J sc and helps in current matching between top and bottom cell  [17] . Low IQE in case of GaAs TJ indicates that the active layer of the solar cell is not properly utilizing the photons and absorption loss is high  [18] . Table  27 .2 shows the important parameters like J sc , V oc , maximum power point voltage (V mpp ), fill factor (FF), and efficiency extracted from model. Use of AlGaAs tunnel diode over GaAs increases J sc by an amount of 1.42 mA/cm 2 , V oc increases by an amount of 0.147 V, V mpp increases by an amount of 0.16 V, FF increases by an amount of 0.56, and efficiency increases by an amount of 4.75%. Figure  27 .7 shows the J/V curve of the proposed model. It is clearly visible that the parameters like J sc and V oc are high in case of AlGaAs tunnel diode and that increases the FF, V mpp , and efficiency of the cell. The performance of the cell is increased by 21%.  
 Conclusions In this work, a DJ InGaP/GaAs solar cell is simulated in which the property of tunnel junctions is fully described. It is found that in case of AlGaAs TJ, the conversion efficiency of the cell increases from 22.69% to 27.44% under AM1.5G illumination, keeping the chip area constant. Use of AlGaAs TJ minimizes the series resistance and improves V oc , J sc , and FF of DJ solar cell. Hence, tunnel junction plays a vital role in the increment of conversion efficiency of multijunction solar cell. In spite of such advantages, this technology is still hindered by numerous challenges. The most predominant limitation is the device instability caused due to hysteresis in its J-V characteristics, leading to ambiguous efficiency estimation during actual performance. Extensive research is going on the study and elimination of this problem. The origin of hysteresis in perovskite solar cells is attributed to four main reasonscapacitive effects, ferroelectric polarization, ion migration, and charge trapping. Modeling of hysteresis in perovskite solar cells is one way to reduce this ambiguity in efficiency determination by bringing 
 Introduction In the recent years, great focus is being bestowed on clean and renewable energy resources due to overutilization of fossil fuels and its negative impact on our environment. Renewable energy resources on the other hand are nonpolluting and dependable. Heavy infrastructural requirement needed for its generation was once considered as its greatest disadvantage. Moreover, the technology needed for its production was not as advanced as it is in the present. This has changed greatly in the twentieth century with all nations recognizing the need for such resources. Furthermore, it has led to allocation of huge grants and funds for its development and commercialization. The renewable energy technology that has benefitted largely from this scenario is the photovoltaic (PV) technology. Nowadays, a lot of research is going on in the domain of PV technology. The firstgeneration silicon (Si) solar panels are still the most accessible commercial PV technology, with the second-generation thin film technologies being a close second  [1] . The third-generation PV technologies that include dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), organic solar cells (OSCs), and perovskite solar cells (PSCs), to name a few, are still in its development phase  [2] . Many problems are yet to be solved before the third-generation solar cell technologies can take on the commercial market of PV cells. The most focused upon third-generation PV technology is the PSC because of its single junction efficiencies almost reaching the Si solar cell efficiency and also due to other added advantages such as low-cost solution processing, flexibility, portability, and bandgap tuning. 
 Perovskite Solar Cells PSCs rocketed into the PV stage during 2012-2014 and became the focus of research groups earlier devoted to DSSCs and OSCs. The first ever PSC was fabricated by Miyasaka in 2009 over a structure of DSSC  [3] . The computed efficiency was only 3.8% and the presence of liquid electrolyte made it very unstable. Since then, much development has gone into PSCs, and this revolutionary technology is currently at the verge of replacing other PV technologies in the near future. Miyasaka received the Clarivate Citation Laureates for his work in 2017. In spite of many advantages, PSCs are still held back by numerous challenges impeding its performance in the commercial market. These limitations include device instability due to hysteresis in its current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics, shorter lifetime, and toxicity due to the presence of Pb  [4] . 
 Hysteresis in PSCs The most significant among the limitations mentioned above is the anomalous hysteresis observed in the J-V characteristics of PSCs. When the scan direction is from short circuit to open circuit, it is called forward scan, and when the scan direction is reversed, i.e., from open circuit to short circuit, it is called reverse scan. Hysteresis refers to the variation occurring in the J-V curve, while the voltage is swept in the forward and reverse directions as shown in Fig.  28 .1  [5] . This hysteresis phenomena can lead to ambiguous estimation of device efficiency, thereby challenging its reliability during actual performance. The following mechanisms are found to govern the hysteresis phenomenon in perovskite solar cells  [6] . • Ferroelectric polarization • Ion migration • Charge trapping • Capacitive effects Modeling of J-V characteristics along with its hysteresis is an important research domain in PSCs, which can help reduce the ambiguity associated with determination of its operating efficiency.  
 Modeling the Hysteresis of PSCs Different approaches are suggested in literature for modeling the hysteresis of PSCs. Some of the models are numerical  [7] [8] [9] [10] , while the others are analytical  [11] [12] [13] . A few equivalent circuit models (ECMs) have also been proposed for the same  [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . The equivalent circuit-based approach for modeling the J-V characteristics of HPSCs is derived from the ECM of a conventional solar cell. 
 ECM of a Conventional Solar Cell The ECM of a typical solar cell is shown in Fig.  28 .2. The equation for the ECM of a solar cell including losses  [26]  is given by I ¼ I ph À I 0 e VþIRs ηV T À 1 À V þ IR s R sh ð28: 1Þ where I 0 is the reverse saturation current, ῃ is the ideality factor of the diode, V T is the thermal equivalent voltage, and I ph is the photogenerated current. Here, R s represents the internal resistance offered by the cell, and R sh is a parameter to show the leakage current  [26] . 
 ECMs for PSCs Unlike a conventional solar cell, the PSCs exhibit hysteresis phenomenon. Hence, a simple ECM as shown in Fig.  28 .2 is insufficient to reflect the same. Required modifications are to be made in the ECM of a typical solar cell to incorporate the effect of hysteresis. In the subsection below, a study of those ECMs are given in detail. As mentioned above, these ECMs were developed from the reasons behind the origin of hysteresis. There are many issues that needed to be addressed before such ECMs were developed. But the most notable approach among such ECMs is the Fig.  28 .2 ECM of a typical solar cell including losses  [26]  introduction of charging elements such as either a capacitor or an inductor to explain the hysteresis phenomena. Dynamic Electrical Model G. A. Nemnes et al. proposed a dynamic electrical model (DEM) to explain the hysteresis of PSCs  [18] . In this model, the authors took into consideration the nonlinear polarization effects, which is one of the reasons behind the origin of hysteresis in PSCs. It includes a capacitor to account for the slow process governing the time evolution of nonlinear polarization effects as shown in Fig.  28.3 . With normal hysteresis, the current generated during reverse scan is greater than the current generated during its corresponding forward scan. During the reverse scan, the cell behaves like a capacitor, releasing charge in the external circuit, and hence, an excess current is obtained. This behavior is referred to as normal hysteresis (NH). An anomaly to this behavior occurs when the forward scan graph shows excess current when compared to its reverse counterpart. This is termed as inverted hysteresis (IH) and is attributed to charge extraction barriers. To emulate this, a pre-poling of voltage in the opposite direction of the scan can be done on the PSC before the scanning commences. This is also shown in Fig.  28. 3. Here, the capacitor was introduced to represent both the linear and nonlinear capacitive effects occurring while performing the forward and reverse scans of the cell. The measured current I in the Fig.  V pol < 0 (IH) induce opposite polarization orientations  [18]  where I d is the diode current, I sh accounts for recombination, and I c ¼ I c (l) þ I c (nl) with typically negligible linear component, I c (l) due to the small geometrical capacitance C 0 . However, depending on the pre-poling conditions, I c (nl) can reach magnitudes similar to the measured current (Fig.  28.4 ). The primary assumption in DEM is that the slow process governing the time evolution of the nonlinear polarization P nl can be described by a specific relaxation time τ. Since τ is typically of the order of seconds, DEM can be used for explaining ion migration and accumulation at the interfaces resulting in a surface polarization. The time-dependent J-V characteristics are determined by the coupled differential equations: ÀR s C 0 @I @t ¼ I s e q VþIRs ð Þ ηk B T À 1 þ R s R sh þ 1 I þ V R sh þ C 0 @V @t þ Α @P nl @t À I ph ð28:3Þ @P nl @t ¼ P nl,1 U c t ð Þ ð ÞÀP nl t ð Þ τ ð28:4Þ with initial conditions I(t ¼ 0) ¼ I 0 and P nl (t ¼ 0) ¼ P 0 , which determines the NH or IH behavior. The current density J is defined as the ratio between the current intensity I and the device active area A. The elements of the circuit are: the series resistance R s , the shunt resistance R sh , the diode ideality factor ῃ, the diode saturation current I s , the photogenerated current I ph , and the geometric capacitance C 0 . In contrast to the standard model with a constant capacitance, the time dependence of the nonlinear polarization P nl obeys Eq. ((28.4) with a constant relaxation time τ. But the equilibrium polarization P nl,1 ¼ (U c /V oc )P 1 depends on the voltage on the nonlinear capacitor, U c ¼ V þ IR s , where V is the external applied bias. The constant polarization P 1 corresponds to U c ¼ V oc in the steady state. The relaxation time τ accounts for the decay of the initial polarization P 0 and also for the evolution of the polarization when the applied bias is changed. 
 Modeling J-V Hysteresis by Voltage Poling An extension of the DEM was suggested by D. V. Anghel et al.  [20] , where the capacitance was replaced by a subcircuit model which accounts for the nonlinearity occurring in the J-V graph due to hysteresis. The elements of the circuit are the current source representing the photocurrent I ph , the diode, with the current I d , the shunt resistance R sh , with the current I sh , the model box, with the current I c , the series resistance R s , with the external current I, and the external voltage source of electrical voltage V. The current through the shunt resistance is I sh ¼ U c /R sh and U c V þ IR s . Eq. ((28.4) given above is modified as @P nl @t ¼ À P nl t ð Þ À P nl,1 U c t ð Þ ½ τ ð28:5Þ where τ is the relaxation time, P nl,1 (U c /V oc )P 1 , V oc is the open circuit voltage, and P 1 is a system dependent quantity. The main assumption of DEM is that the internal polarization of the PSC, denoted by P nl , during the measurement performed in the (0,V oc ) bias interval strives to the steady-state bias-dependent value within a relaxation timescale t of the order of seconds, which corresponds to a constant, large capacitance in this bias range. Furthermore, the initial polarization P 0 P nl (t ¼ 0), which is set in the bias pre-poling phase prior to the actual measurement, is considered as an input parameter. DEM is further developed by explicating the nonlinear behavior of the polarization into a capacitance-voltage dependence. This has the benefit of introducing the poling conditions (P 0 ) directly through experimentally available quantities, like the poling voltage V pol , taking the assumption that the steady state is achieved during the preconditioning phase. It is shown that the capacitance has a significant superlinear increase beyond V in order to obtain systematically the different features of the hysteretic effects here (Fig.  28 .5). 
 Equivalent Circuit Representation of Hysteresis Considering Interface Charge Accumulation In this model, K. Seki proposed an equivalent circuit representation based on interface charge accumulation  [21] . The internal electric field that is associated with the movement of cations or anions in the perovskite material is also considered to be related to the hysteresis. In this work, a mechanism based on the electric field produced by the accumulated charges in the charge transport layer is considered. This mechanism could also be applied in other situations where charge accumulation occurs within the charge generation layer. In this case, the accumulated charges at the interface can be ions. This is shown schematically in Fig.  28. 6. An additional resistor-capacitor (R-C) unit is inserted into the circuit, as shown in Fig.  28 .7. The additional R-C circuit represents the voltage reduction that occurs through charge accumulation at the interfaces. The source of this voltage reduction may be the screening of the electric fields by the accumulated charges.   [18] . The C in DEM is replaced by C nl  [20]  The hysteresis that occurs because of charge accumulation is distinguishable from the hysteresis that occurs due to ferroelectric polarization reversal. If the ferroelectric polarization reversal occurs quickly, the hysteresis will then disappear using a small amplitude of the voltage scan. However, if the dielectric relaxation is slow, the induced surface charge in the dielectric causes hysteresis similar to that which occurs because of charge accumulation. ECM with Double Heterojunctions for Fitting J-V Curves of Planar Heterojunction PSCs P. Liao et al. proposed another equivalent circuit model in which double heterojunctions were used to simulate the J-V curves of planar heterojunction PSCs  [22] . The structure of the PSC under consideration is given in Fig.  28 .8a. The proposed equivalent circuit includes double heterojunctions in series to simulate the current-voltage characteristic of P-I-N planar structure PSCs. This method theoretically solves the dilemma of the parameter diode ideality factor being larger than 2 from an ideal single heterojunction equivalent circuit, which usually is in the range from 1 to 2. The diode ideality factor reflects PN junction quality, which influences the recombination at electron transport layer/perovskite and perovskite/ hole transport layer interfaces.  Therefore, two PN junctions in series are incorporated for explaining planar heterojunction PSCs, rather than a single PN junction. Equation ((28.6) is applied according to the equivalent circuit of double PN junction as shown in Fig.  28 .8b. V 1 þ V 2 ¼ V þ JR s ð28:6Þ According to the characteristics of the series circuit, the current through the double PN junction should be identical. J 01 e qV 1 m 1 kT À 1 ¼ J 02 e qV 2 m 2 kT À 1 ð28:7Þ where m 1 , V 1 , J 01 , m 2 , V 2 , and J 02 are diode ideality factor, voltage, and reverse saturation current of ETL/perovskite and perovskite/HTL, respectively. From the above, the following can be derived. V 1 m 1 ¼ V 2 m 2 ¼ V þ JR s m 1 þ m 2 ð28:8Þ Surface Boundary-Induced Capacitance Model for Origin of Hysteresis in I-V Curves of PSCs In the model proposed by L. Cojocaru et al.  [23] , the origin of J-V hysteresis has been related to the capacitance created at the interfaces. The authors propose that an equivalent circuit model with a series of double diodes, capacitors, shunt resistances, and single series resistance produces simulated I-V curves with large hysteresis matching the experimentally observed curves. The electrical capacitances generated by defects due to the lattice mismatch at the ETL/perovskite and HTL/perovskite interface are found to be responsible for the hysteresis occurring in PSCs. The charge trapping/detrapping and/or charge accumulation caused by the lattice mismatch or voids at this interface act as capacitors. The lattice mismatch or voids present at the ETL/perovskite interface create high electrical capacitance and the other interface with less defects exhibits low capacitance. A double diode equivalent circuit model including the interfacial capacitive components can be used to emulate the hysteresis effect. Here, carrier accumulation at the interface is stated as the prominent reason behind the occurrence of hysteresis. An equivalent circuit model as shown in Fig.  28 .10 composed of two series connected diodes, two capacitors, two shunt resistances, and a series resistance is proposed to replicate the hysteresis of the experimental I-V curves. Equivalent Circuit Model with Inductance for Inverted Planar Structure PSCs Another model by L. Cojocaru et al.  [24]  uses an equivalent circuit with an inductance to simulate the hysteresis effect. Here, the inductance-based model was used to simulate IH, where the forward scan characteristics show a slightly higher efficiency than its corresponding reverse scan characteristics. The structure shown in Fig.  28 .11a is used for generating the I-V characteristics to model hysteresis effect. The two semiconductors with different energy levels form a junction or a diode. A similar junction forms when a metal with a high work function is in contact with an n-type semiconductor with a lower work function, which is known as a Schottky junction. The electron injection from CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 to PCBM is possible due to the suitable difference of the conduction band edge of the PCBM that forms the diode. Hence, two interfaces in the given device structure (Fig.  28 .11b), PEDOT:PSS/CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 and CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 /PCBM, can be considered as simple diodes while the PCBM (semiconductor)/Al(Ca) (metal) interface may have another Schottky barrier diode with opposite direction. When the semiconductor is in contact with a metal, band bending occurs at the interface. The authors claim that hysteresis most likely originated from the interfacial contact between these layers. The ECM for the above structure is schematically represented in Fig.  28 .12. The combination of the electrical parts consisting of resistance (R sh2 ), capacitance (C 1 ), and/or inductance (L 1 ) can represent the Schottky diode as represented in Fig.  28 .12. 
 Coupled Ionic-Electronic Equivalent Circuit to Describe Photovoltage Profile in Perovskite Solar Cells In this work by F. Ebadi et al.  [25] , a transient photovoltage rise and decay measurements is employed to investigate the origin of slow unsymmetrical rise and decay profiles in single and triple cation perovskite solar cells. Drastic changes in photovoltage decay profile were observed upon insertion of BrÀ, Cs+, and FA+ ions into perovskite structures. The activation energy for ionic defects was measured and an equivalent circuit model was proposed containing both electrical and ionic components to explain the changes. To understand and analyze the physical processes quantitatively, an equivalent circuit to model the photovoltage rise and decay has been proposed which accounts both electronic and ionic processes. As illustrated in Fig.  28 .13a, two parallel parts Fig.  28 .12 Equivalent circuit model for simulation of the I-V curves for inverted p-PSC  [24]  have been considered in the proposed circuit: one for ionic process and the other represents the equivalent elements relating to common electronic processes. The schematics for the related elements has been demonstrated in Fig.  28 .13b. In the electronic branch which is correlated to the electronic contribution of photogenerated carriers, R rec refers to back transfer resistance for recombination of electrons in TiO 2 , C bulk represents the bulk capacitance of perovskite and all types of electrical charge storage in perovskite solar cell including geometrical, chemical, and electronic contact capacitances have been considered in this element. R t corresponds to carrier transport resistance. In the ionic branch, R i,bulk represents the ionic transport resistance of perovskite material and C acc is the capacitance formed as a result of ion accumulation at the interface of electron and hole transport material and perovskite material. R i,acc refers to the resistivity against the accumulated ions at the interface to return back into the bulk of film. A diode is used in parallel with R i,acc which represents unsymmetrical charging and discharging of the interface, which leads to easy trapping of ionic charges at the interface and more difficult detrapping in the bulk. Based on the experimental results and the values of electronic and ionic components extracted from the proposed equivalent circuit, it is concluded that there is some coupled electronic and ionic processes in perovskite solar cells which changes the photovoltage rise and decay profile through the change in perovskite composition. The effect associated with ion migration in MAPbI 3 perovskite and redistribution of electric field in active layer was described by Bisquert et al.  [16] . Here, this phenomenon is illustrated based on the values related to electronic and ionic elements. The abovementioned processes happen as the open circuit transient profile is measured upon turning on and off the light in Fig.  28 .14. At equilibrium, the Fermi level of the perovskite, electron transport layer (ETL), and hole transport layer (HTL) are the same, generating an internal electric field in Fig.  28 .14a inside the perovskite layer. Cations and/or anions drift along the electric field to shield the field resulting in accumulation of anions at the interface of ETL and perovskite film while cations accumulate at the interface of HTL and perovskite material as shown in Fig.  28 .14b. Upon incidence of light, TiO 2 becomes the reservoir of electrons and in the other side SPIRO is full of holes, so there is a change in the direction of internal   [25]  electric field in perovskite layer; in this condition, anions migrate to HTL interface and cations move back towards ETL until the internal electric field is shielded once more as in Fig.  28 .14c. During quasi-stable situation in the open circuit condition under light, an accumulation of cations and anions will happen at the interface of perovskite with ETL and HTL, respectively, in Fig.  28 .14d. In such condition, the sum of built-in potential and electrostatic potential yields the achieved photovoltage of solar cell. When the light is turned off, anions and cations should de-accumulate, respectively, from HTL and ETL interfaces, as depicted in Fig.  28 .14e. A potential reason for unsymmetrical behavior of photovoltage rise and decay can be the accumulation of ions with different signs in the beginning of the process of turning on and off the light. It means that in the equilibrium condition in dark, negative ions accumulate near ETL and positive ions accumulate close to HTL, while under semi-stable condition in dark, the reverse phenomenon happens. When the photovoltage is stabilized, there is an accumulation of ions at the interfaces which results in formation of ionic double layer and energy band bending. After turning the light off in the first step, the electrons in TiO 2 recombine with holes in perovskite   [25]  layer. However, the decay of remaining photovoltage is dependent on the depletion of internal ionic double layer, since it forms a potential barrier restraining the electrons and holes from moving back to perovskite material and recombination. The results indicate that the ionic-based capacitance is not the only reason for slow response of perovskite solar cell but the coupled electronic and ionic components also influence this behavior. Also, the accumulation of ion defects with different signs in dark and under light at the interface of perovskite and HTL and ETL leads to drastic unsymmetrical rise and decay profile of perovskite solar cells. 
 Conclusion The models explained in detail in the above section give a better understanding about incorporating hysteresis occurring in PSCs into its corresponding ECMs. The physics behind the reasons for occurrence of hysteresis were analyzed thoroughly before development of the ECMs. Hence, the readers get a better interpretation on the physics behind PSCs and further the possibilities of development of more accurate ECMs in the future. Many ECMs can yet be further developed by incorporating all the reasons behind the origin of hysteresis thereby reducing its unpredictability. 
 Introduction The increasing emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) from fossil fuel-based power generation systems contributes in global warming. The world is now focused in renewable energy to fight the climate change. In order to curb the CO 2 emission, the demand of non-fossil fuel energy sources is growing every year. Solar energy, wind energy, biomass energy, etc., are among them. The renewable energy has the potential to deliver large part of energy requirement. Especially the photovoltaic cell module and wind turbine-based sources are growing fast day by day and increasing their contribution in the energy generation and supply chain. The cost of the solar module in terms of dollar per watt ($/Wp) ratio has now gone below 1$/Wp, and improvement in the power conversion ratio will further reduce the cost ratio. Earth-abundant material like silicon  (Si)  with less complex structure is now able to provide the efficiency of 22% and above. The ease of availability of Si has led the development of Si-based PV cells. Currently, 90% of PV market is captured by Si (monocrystalline, multi-crystalline, thin film, etc.) based solar cell. The available solar spectrum ranges from nearly 300 nm to 3500 nm. The Si-based solar cell, which has bandgap of 1.08-1.12 eV, utilizes bandgap of 600-1200 nm range. These cells can achieve efficiency of 29.8% according to the SQ limit  [1, 2] . In single junction Si solar cell, the highly efficient tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) technology has reached 23.55% conversion efficiency with current density of 41.44 mA/cm 2  [3] . The n-type Cz wafer with rear heterojunction stripe contacts in hybrid silicon has predicted 25.8% efficiency  [4] . The p-type monocrystalline module was recorded with highest efficiency of 20.60% and 22.8% using passivated emitter rear contact (PERC)  [5, 6] . Nickle oxide is another material used for carrier transport and selective contact in heterojunction solar cell  [7] . The Si-based tunnel junction in TOPCon technology also provide good surface passivation quality and low transport losses  [8] [9] [10] . Simulation studies have shown 27.4% efficiency for c-Si solar cell with low surface recombination velocity (SRV) of 1000 V/cm  [11, 12] . Also, the 200 μm thick single junction c-Si solar cell has achieved efficiency of 27% using Ta 2 O 5 as tunneling oxide  [13, 14] . The combination of III-V compound material with the silicon has the potential to cross the Shockley-Quiesser limit of 30% efficiency. But, the lattice mismatch of 4% produces threading dislocations (TDs). Due to this unwanted formed TDs, material quality is reduced. This process introduces recombination centers, in which minority carriers are recombined and reduces the overall carrier lifetime (τ) of the carriers, and eventually the short circuit current (I sc ) and open circuit voltage V oc  [15, 16] . This leads to performance degradation of the solar cell. In order to reduce the threading dislocation density (TDD), several approaches have been performed like making thicker base layer, thermal annealing process, inserting graded buffers, maintaining proper thermal growth temperature (T growth ), and insertion of strained layer supper lattices  [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Using abovementioned techniques in tandem cell structure a top cell of compound material above the Si bottom cell, which has higher bandgap than 1.12 eV, somehow reduces thermalization losses and makes the tandem cell design more efficient. The modeling of these kind of integrated solar cell has predicted the efficiency of solar cell in the range of 33-37%  [23] [24] [25] . The theoretical efficiency limit of 45% is predicted by the theoretical model  [26] , and the TOPCon technology with quantum well model in III-V compound and silicon dual junction cell structure showed 41.98% efficiency, which is very close to the theoretical limit  [27] . In this chapter, the focus is on the improvement of the performance parameter of single junction silicon solar cell with the help of highly doped passivation layer. The passivation is provided in the bottom layers, so that it transports one type of minority carriers and improves the open circuit voltage. The surface recombination velocity is assumed low, so as to reduce the recombination at the contact area. The optical analysis and electrical characterizations are carried by the Silvaco ATLAS TCAD simulation tool. The AM1.5G spectrum provides 1000 W/m 2 or 100 mW/cm 2 of solar irradiation power to illuminate the solar cell. 
 Design and Modeling of Passivated Silicon Solar Cell Device Design and Solar Illumination The designed single junction passivated c-silicon solar cell is 200 μm thick n-type wafer-based solar cell, where the p-n junction is formed by providing a 300 nm thick p-type window layer. The doping of the window layer is kept high. The passivation layer is provided at the bottom of the cell, so that it will reduce the flow of minority carriers at the rear contact area. Almost 2% of losses occur in the contact region due to the recombination process; therefore, improved passivation is desirable. The bottom contact of the cell is made with the silver material, so that it helps in reflection of the unutilized spectrum. The single junction c-Si cell structure is shown in Fig.  29 .1. Figure  29 .2 shows the AM1.5G spectrum used to provide the solar irradiation to the photovoltaic cell. Most of the power of the spectrum is found in the 400-1300 nm range of optical wavelength. The silicon material has the bandgap of 1.12 eV, which is very suitable to absorb the solar spectrum in the range of 600-1100 nm of optical wavelength.

 Results and Discussions Photon Absorption and Recombination The incoming solar power is incident on the silicon cell. The absorption of the photon energy results in the generation of electron-hole pair. Also, some of the electrons are recombined with the holes due to recombination process. The photogeneration, photon absorption, and recombination rate of the c-    
 P-N Junction and the Electric Field Since the p-n junction is formed near the window and base region and base and passivation region, the junction is therefore formed in the contact region of the two layers. Due to this junction, a barrier region is formed at the junction which consists of immobile ions and the barrier potential is formed. This is the same phenomenon that governs the p-n junction diode theory. Now to cross the barrier, the photogenerated electrons requires minimum barrier potential, so that they can cross this junction. This is provided to the generated electrons by the incident solar power, by which the electron gains the energy and moves upward in the electron transport layer (ETL). Due to this crossing of the electrons through the barrier, an electric field can be seen near the junction are of the    
 Electron Current Density Figure  29 .9 shows the distribution of electron current density through the cell region after the application of the solar irradiation. The absorption of photon energy causes electron-hole pair generation and flow of majority carrier. This generation and flow of electron is high in the absorption layer. This current density reduces with increasing the diffusion length through the device structure. 
 Current-Voltage Characteristics and Maximum Power The designed passivated silicon solar cell is modeled for both simple p-n junction kind of structure (i.e., without passivation layer) and with passivation layer. Simple p-n junction silicon cell generates current density of J sc ¼ 39.12 mA/cm 2 , V oc ¼ Fig.  29 .8 Tunneling near the highly doped passivated region 512 mV, and has fill factor of (FF) ¼ 79.80%. This results in the efficiency of only 15.12%. The theoretical limit of single junction silicon cell is about 30% and the obtained result is far below (actually half) of the limit. To enhance the efficiency of the cell, passivation layer is introduced in the rear side of the cell.  Due to the passivation layer at the bottom region, the open circuit voltage improves to V oc ¼ 711.77 mV. This also enhances the fill factor to (FF ¼ 82.46%) with unchanged current density of J sc ¼ 39.20 mA/cm 2 . Due to the open circuit voltage and fill factor improvement, the efficiency of the cell jumps from η ¼ 15.12% to η ¼ 21.98%. Figure  29 .10 shows the comparison of the current-voltage characteristics of simple silicon and passivated silicon solar cell. Here, we can clearly observe that due to the added passivation mechanism, the open circuit voltage (V oc ) of the cell is improved by about 38% and efficiency by 45%. The performance comparison of the two cell is given in Table  29 .1. Figure  29 .11 shows the maximum power delivery curve for the passivated silicon solar cell. It generates maximum power of P max ¼ 23.012 mW/cm 2 . 
 External and Internal Quantum Efficiency (EQE and IQE) Finally, the internal and external quantum efficiency of the passivated silicon cell is shown in Fig.  29 .12. The maximum internal and external quantum efficiency of about 85% is found in the optical wavelength about 550 nm. Due to the passivation   
 Conclusion The crystalline-silicon solar cell is analyzed in both forms, as a simple p-n junction cell structure and as a passivated silicon solar cell. The focus was on the improvement of the open circuit voltage, which is achieved by passivation layer. It improves V oc from 512 mV to 711.77 mV. Also, the fill factor is improved from 79.80% to 82.46%. The combination of improvement in the two parameter results in the improvement of efficiency from 15.12% to 21.98%. The designed passivated silicon cell is analyzed by using optical and electrical characterization and performance. The spectral response, photogeneration, absorption and recombination, tunneling, etc., are also briefly discussed to elaborate more about the solar cell.  
 Introduction For ever-shrinking feature length of today's modern FET architectures, issues emanating from utmost device and process based concerns typically projected on conventional n-MOSFET, need to be addressed and better understood from intensely probed device physics based analysis. As the distance or spacing between source and drain is reduced, even with self-aligned gate technology, the depletion region width at the source side and drain side is wider, because more positive voltage on the drain imparts more charge sharing by gate which is standardly known as threshold voltage roll-off. The best method to control threshold voltage roll-off without raising the substrate doping to reduce these depletion region width extensions near source and drain junction is developing a robust ultrashallow junction technology at source and drain. Ultrashallow junction, when its depth is within 5 nm, shows minimum curvilinear profile at the source and drain junction termination region at the interface between gate dielectric and substrate, consequently making the spreading resistance, a feature or curved junction profile, more reduced and controllable as we already have high contact resistance though channel resistance can be used for ultrashort device scale. The major problem of ultrashallow junction technology is its thickness or depth which is within 5 nm from the contact interface and will therefore raise the sheet resistance (ohm/square) of the FET structure. Ultrashallow junction is also required for higher resolution of contact probing where due to depth reduction, current crowding region near the probe placement is less dense and more penetrative and hence, proper measurement value with high resolution can be extracted. section "Role of Super Steep (SS) Retrograde Doping and Ultrashallow Junction Technology in Scaling Related Reduction of Short Channel Effects" of this chapter will discuss on different techniques for forming precise ultrashallow junction technology also with all dopants activation when self-aligned gate technology is used. Single ion implantation technique is used for proper placement of dopant atoms in the substrate so that it can combat a potent reliability issue random dopant fluctuation that varies threshold voltage intra-die and inter-die after final fabrication stage of millions of transistors on the die is also crucial for aggressively scaled devices and natural ion implantation technology with stringent control over straggle and channeling are also important from the perspective of channel dopant profiling technologies from the surface of the channel toward the depth into the substrate involving (i) low-high, (ii) high-low, and (iii) super steep retrograde doping profile and these doping profiling and their gradient are precisely obtained by robust ion implantation techniques which will be hinted upon. For today's ultrashallow feature length MOSFET, super steep retrograde doping profile has a host of advantages. First, the doping profile is created with a moderately low value of 10 15 /cm 3 at the interface and within 4-5 nm, this value is steeply and continuously extended to a peak value of 10 21 /cm 3 within 5 nm depth from the channel interface into the substrate and then quickly within another 5 nm, the profile is smoothly attenuated from its peak value to merge with the substrate doping value which for modern FETs lies within 10 16 /cm 3 . By super steep (SS) retrograde doping which can be done in three stages near the source, underneath the gate, and near the drain, the maximum depletion width is controlled to be few nm, by the high degenerate peak value and SS retrograde doping aids in making negligible threshold voltage roll-off, and imparts higher carrier mobility at the surface since the surface base doping is lower assisting in less ionized impurity scattering. SS retrograde doping will also prevent extension of source and drain region depletion width to essentially merge for very minutely spaced source and drain regions causing punch through current overriding the drain current and complete loss of FET functionality. Three stage distributed SS retrograde doping profile will prevent the source and drain region depletion width near the surface to be wider and essentially these regions will lie in close proximity of source and drain edge and hence the underneath nm region under the gate will remain in place and unaffected. So, this channel profiling technology can be used in modern FET architectures like double gate, Fin-FET, ultrathin body SOI, ferroelectric FET, drift region of tunnel FET, and gate all around nanowire FET with reduce nanowire pore radius. This highly pertinent content will appear at section "Single Ion Implantation (SII) Technique to Implant Ordered Dopants in the Substrate, Stringent and Precise Ion Implantation Technology and Ultrafast Annealing Techniques for Dopant Activation" of the chapter. With millions of transistors fabricated on a die, usually the standby leakage power consumption concern emanated from how lower the subthreshold leakage current can be with every process node. But as inversion charge is forming and gate is positively biased for n-FET structure, electrons tunnel to the gate contact through the ultrathin gate dielectric and give rise to tunneling gate leakage current which has a much steeper rise than subthreshold leakage current, since it is present from near threshold condition biasing of the FET into inversion regime biasing of the FET where enough inversion charge carrier is available to tunnel from both source and drain side (where the electrons also have high kinetic energy) and gate voltage is also raised, giving significant rise of gate tunneling leakage current component. This will impact the targeted I on /I off ratio of the roadmap where with increase of Ion, there may be more increase of I off and the ratio may fall below 10 6 as desired by the roadmap for logic devices. So, minimizing the tunneling gate leakage current is important and some methods will be discussed in section "Tunneling Gate Leakage Current Reduction in Si-Based Advanced FET Architectures" of this chapter. Source to drain direct tunneling at low voltage level on gate and drain is also a concern for aggressively scaled FETs as their channel length approaches less than 10 nm. When the channel length is less than 10 nm and there is voltage on the gate and drain, the gate to source barrier voltage can be low enough for the channel voltage profile V c near the source, which quickly rises to a peak within a fraction of some nm from source edge and then steeply falls due to the reverse biased V c potential drop between gate and drain region. As the V gs barrier is reduced and the channel voltage falls off more rapidly, electrons with lower energy and lesser than peak V gs region can now directly tunnel through the reduced tunneling width defined from the edge of the point of V c top to the V c at the beginning of drain edge. This tunneling width therefore can be greatly reduced with more voltage on the gate and drain, as for this V gs can be more lowered and the steeper decline portion of V c with positive voltage on the drain will make this spacing or tunneling width further reduced for efficient source to drain tunneling current and more reduction of subthreshold slope at T ¼ 300 K from 60 mV/decade to even lower value, source to drain direct tunneling current is considered to be the limiting factor as this current can be substantial even when the transistor is biased at the subthreshold region. So, in this section "Reduction of Source to Drain Direct Tunneling Current for Ultrascaled FETs," ways to minimize the source to drain direct tunneling current will be discussed. Issues related to degenerate doping or doping above 10 18 /cm 3 are also an area of grave concern for ultrascaled n-FETs, specially for all kinds of junctionless FET architectures for which substrate doping is in the range 10 19 /cm 3 to 10 20 /cm 3 . Although there is incomplete ionization observed up to 80% of the original doping in silicon substrate for both n-type dopants and p-type dopants for doping in the ranges between 10 17 /cm 3 and 10 19/ /cm 3 , near 10 20 /cm 3 to 10 21 /cm 3 , ionization quickly rises to 100%. But with degenerate doping of the substrate with silicon being considered here, both the density of states (DOS) effective mass of electron and hole for silicon at T ¼ 300 K and conductivity effective mass of electron and hole in silicon at T ¼ 300 K increase sharply nonlinearly due to degenerate doping dependent conduction band minima nonparabolicity factor and valence band maxima nonparabolicity factor. Therefore, the effective density of states in the conduction band N c and valence band N v also undergo alterations and increase due to these degenerate doping related physical effects. Fermi-Dirac integral based Fermi energy level position with respect to conduction band edge for n-type silicon at T ¼ 300 K and valence band edge with respect to p-type silicon at T ¼ 300 K also undergo modifications due to these effects. The major problem or handicap in forming an analytical equation for DOS effective mass of electron as a function of doping up to 10 21 /cm 3 and effective mass of hole as a function doping up to same value in silicon at T ¼ 300 K cannot be precisely defined due to the reason that sporadic and scattered values are experimentally extracted for DOS effective mass of electron at T ¼ 300 K for silicon near 10 20 /cm 3 , whereas to date no experimental data are available for DOS effective mass of hole in silicon at T ¼ 300 K near 10 20 /cm 3 so that an analytical equation of DOS effective mass variation for hole in silicon can be formulated for silicon at T ¼ 300 K as a function of doping to high degenerate value. Degeneracy of doping values affects the valence band related DOS effective mass extraction of hole in silicon at T ¼ 300 K more difficult as there is light hole mass, heavy hole mass, and a split-off band in the valence band fourfold degeneracy but since for n-MOSFET the substrate is p-type, the modeling data here should be more on hand so that precise transport related modeling and simulation can be conducted. So, in this section "Modeling Issues Related to Degenerate Doping," we will touch on some key discrepancies that need to be fitted into modeling results when degenerate doping of the substrate is considered. Atomic layer doping or (ALD) is a versatile layer-by-layer atomically thin deposition control technique that can be used for atomically thin stacking of layers on wafer, for source and drain alloyed salicided contact deposition, gate metal deposition and gate dielectric deposition for all FETs, and for all gate dielectric materials at T ¼ 300 K in silicon. In section "Using Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) Technique for Atomically Thin Layers Deposition on Substrate, Wafer Stacking, and High-K Dielectric and Metal Deposition in Gate, Source, and Drain Contacts," the author will describe the precision and control of ALD technique that has eliminated a whole number of concerns like interface defects from interfacial smoothness and quality, shallow border traps, and defects in the gate dielectric and latent substrate defects in the substrate when atomically thin stacking of layers are involved and wafer stacking simultaneously can be achieved through this technique. From today's high volume manufacturing (HVM) concern, high-NA EUV lithography has become a standard for FET architectures fabrication and a key factor in this fabrication is the resist thickness, which is already lowered, that needs to etched after exposure for pattern transfer of the die where critical dimension (CD) needs to be extremely accurate, line edge roughness needs to be as small as possible, line width variation needs to be as small as possible, and since after exposure and development the resist thickness remaining to be etched is within 10 nm, a new versatile etching technology atomic layer etching (ALE) must be used. In this section "Atomic Layer Etching (ALE) for Lithography Based Etching of Pattern," ALE technique and its precision and control in etching resist in place of deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) will be discussed. The subsection will also discuss on some of the potent annealing technologies like flash annealing, as well as laser annealing in place of rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at an elevated temperature of 400 C for quick dopant activation as we need to maximize the ionization as per all activated dopants using these techniques. Concluding remarks will follow the section "Atomic Layer Etching (ALE) for Lithography Based Etching of Pattern" where the importance of these discussion topics will be stressed and underscored, particularly the 2D scaling length optimization for all FET architectures that ensure more gate to channel integrity from vertical field rather than the 2D lateral field penetration from drain laterally toward the source from some depth away from channel interface that are also responsible for drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL) of gate to source junction lowering. To minimize the 2D scaling length as small as possible, the device parameters will be identified with their controlled engineered values to reduce this 2D scaling length. 
 Role of Super Steep (SS) Retrograde Doping and Ultrashallow Junction Technology in Scaling Related Reduction of Short Channel Effects Before in the section "Role of Super Steep (SS) Retrograde Doping and Ultrashallow Junction Technology in Scaling Related Reduction of Short Channel Effects," the author of this chapter discusses the role of super steep (SS) retrograde doping in scaling reduction of short channel effects  [1] , first we need to consider another potential form of doping engineering method close to source junction and that is halo doping divided into thin halo or pocket of P ++ to P + doping layer that raises the reverse biased voltage V bi close to source junction edge at the channel surface and as a result pushes gate to source barrier V gs higher. Benefits of halo implant close to source is thus (1) much reduced subthreshold leakage current, (2) possibly gate tunneling leakage current can be reduced also close from source at the channel surface, as halo or pockets will reduce the available inversion carriers needed for tunneling through the ultrathin gate dielectric to the gate contact, and (3) it also may reduce the source to drain direct tunneling current as the barrier V gs is increased at the source, also since channel close to source has a halo of higher P (acceptor) doping than the substrate, its conductivity mass in the transport direction is raised and that will hinder the source to drain tunneling probability where the exponential factor has a negative transport directed tunneling mass. But then, why SS retrograde doping is more effective than pocket or halo at the source junction. First of all, the drive current that comes out of the drain contact is dependent on carrier injection velocity from the source and with halo doping or channel potential barrier, this source injection velocity is hindered and less inversion charge is injected from source to channel for the same gate voltage without the halo doping integrated to the source junction. SS retrograde doping makes the surface almost intrinsically doped but raises the doping to very high peak value within 5 nm, hence super steep and then falls off also very steeply to the base substrate doping value. As a result, source injection velocity can be increased due to lower surface doping close to the source junction that comes out of reduced ionized impurity scattering. Secondly, the maximum depletion width can be set to a nominal small value by the very high retrograded peak value of SS retrograde doping and thin body devices like double gate thin body FET, thin body fully depleted silicon on insulator FET (FDSOI FET), and extremely thin (body) SOI FET can be designed with this profiling technique where for thin body to be depleted, the depletion width has to be narrower and that is what SS retrograde doping provides. Thirdly, the lateral penetrative field away from the channel interface from the drain voltage is effectively blocked to interact with reduction of reverse biased built in voltage V bi at the source and consequent reduction of gate to source barrier and cause high enough subthreshold thermionic emission over the source, an effect of drain induced barrier lowering that happens close to subthreshold to threshold bias of FET. Fourthly, due to three stage SS retrograde doping, source and depletion regions cannot merge even though channel length is shorter and cause punchthrough related short circuit current increase over the drive current and also causing the FET to be nonfunctional. Within 5 nm, since the doping is graded to be highly degenerate, the channel effective mass for hole is also increased as a result of this high doping just underneath the channel interface and it will again reduce source to drain direct tunneling current through reduction of exponential factor where the effective mass is negatively incorporated. This is the fourth advantage of using SS retrograde doping and the most obvious reason retrograde doping was used is to stem threshold voltage roll-off at reduced node and that is obvious as source and drain depletion regions are further away from depletion region under the self-aligned gate and negligible charge sharing takes place which suppresses the threshold voltage roll-off. Therefore, SS retrograde doping should be incorporated in all FET devices as doping engineering method particularly the gate all around nanowire FET, ferroelectric FET, and the drift region of the tunnel FET. A figure is shown below where the author shows both halo implant and SS retrograde doping profile from channel to the bulk contact of the substrate vertically. In the figure, only source and drain junctions are shown and gate dielectric and gate metal and contacts are omitted. In addition, ultrashallow junction of the order of 10 nm will be required to avoid the curvilinear profile at source and drain terminated junctions that add spreading resistance to contact resistance and retard the flow of electrons from source edge to the channel. Since source and drain junction region are doped of the order of 10 21 / cm 3 , with such thin junction depth, activation of 100% dopants to reduce contact resistivity and spreading resistivity is a drastic task and cannot be done by Pearson based ion implantation technique. Monolayer doping (MLD) by (1) the formation of self-assembled monolayers of dopant containing molecules on the surface of crystalline Si followed by rapid thermal spike annealing ensures a shallow junction of the order of 5 nm. Information on monolayer doping technique can be found from these references  [2]  (Figs.  30  Controlling the electrical properties of higher performance semiconductor devices toward the nanometer scale will require one-by-one controlled doping of single dopant atoms  [3] . In single ion implantation (SII) technique different from conventional ion implantation technology, single ions are extracted by chopping a focused ion beam (FIB) using a small aperture and high-frequency beam deflection and the number of implanted dopant ions is controlled one by one by detecting secondary electrons emitted from a target upon a single ion incidence. The single ion beam induced charge imaging that has been developed for single ion microprobe technology has been useful for single ion detection according to this reference. There are fewer device to device intra-die and inter-die fluctuations in threshold voltage with ordered array of position and number of dopants than simply ion implantation based random and sparsely distributed dopants. This is a very advantageous outlook from random dopant fluctuations and random telegraph noise based device reliability assessment where failure statistics are earmarked. For ion implantation avoiding channeling effect, LATID (low angle tilted implanted dose) ion implantation technology is used though channeling is also dependent on the substrate orientation direction of silicon. Other effective ion implantation process is direct current plasma immersion ion implantation technique  [4]  being applied to SOI devices. For degenerate doping and stringent doping variation stochasticity, both the dose needs to be highly peaked and straggle needs to be very narrow of the implanted dopants from the ion implantation source. Laser annealing and laser flash annealing  [5, 6]  are subsequently employed for annealing of defects and faster dopant activation than rapid thermal annealing (RTA) process requiring an elevated temperature where dopant activation may not be always 100% in both sources, drain junction and in the substrate. Tunneling gate leakage current increases with a much higher slope than subthreshold leakage current as feature length is aggressively scaled. This is due to the reason that from threshold to inversion, large carrier density is available at channel interface and through ultrathin dielectric depending on barrier potential of conduction band to dielectric, electrons may surmount the barrier and get attracted by the positively charged gate potential. For SiO 2 dielectric, this barrier potential for electrons in the conduction band of silicon at T ¼ 300 K is 3.1 eV and transverse mass is 0.40 m o where m o is free electron mass. Higher k or permittivity dielectric such as HfO 2 with dielectric permittivity between 18 and 25 works well to subdue this gate tunneling leakage current but high-k dielectrics have lower bandgap than SiO 2 , and as a result the barrier potential for silicon conduction band decreases for most high-k materials compromising the benefit of higher permittivity and may still generate high gate tunneling leakage current comparable to SiO 2 . The tunneling related transport mass is negatively incorporated in the exponential factor that determine the tunneling gate leakage current density in analytical equation format  [7] . Higher tunneling mass will reduce this current density through exponential factor reduction. Higher tunneling mass can be obtained by SS retrograde doping and also by halo doping where high doping increases the substrate's transport related conductivity mass through doping dependent nonparabolicity increase. Also, for thin body degenerately doped n-FET structures such as double gate FET and gate all around nanowire FET with nanopore dimension being reduced, bandgap narrowing decreases the conduction band edge with respect to valence band edge taken as a reference. As a result, the barrier potential from conduction band edge to dielectric top potential increases to a greater value than 3.1 eV for Si and SiO 2 dielectric bands. So, both these factors reduce gate tunneling leakage current substantially through higher rate of exponential factor reduction. Also, for thin body and higher masses, most electrons will reside in the ground state and few will be elevated to split sub-bands separated by greater spacing. Low bandgap higher transport directed tunneling mass III-V materials such as InAs can be grown on p-substrate by MBE or ALD technique for n-FET which can provide the same advantage to reduce the gate tunneling leakage current and at the same time providing higher mobility channel for improving drive current although there will be slight discontinuity or spike in channel potential V c near source due to InAs and Si bandgap difference  [8] . 
 Reduction of Source to Drain Direct Tunneling Current for Ultrascaled FETs As source and drain are separated by only few nm, the gate to source potential barrier is smaller and becomes less steep while it falls much steeper at the gate to drain region due to positive drain contact making the separation region within this channel potential turning into a tunneling width that low energy electrons from source can tunnel through and reach the drain contact for subthreshold to threshold condition and this limits the average subthreshold slope to be slightly higher than the modeled minimum value at T ¼ 300 K for advanced FET architectures where subthreshold slope such as for Tunnel FET structures can be within 30 mV/decade. Since the tunneling width cannot be reduced, one way to reduce the source to drain direct tunneling is through raising the source to channel potential near source edge by pocket or halo implant and also decreasing the V ds or drain to source voltage difference by biasing the source initially from off to subthreshold, slightly positive, so electrons will not easily eject from the source edge and also V ds value is now lesser. These two factors coupled with transport related heavier effective mass in the channel can reduce source to drain direct tunneling current. SS retrograde channel doping continuously applied from channel surface to a few nm depth into substrate between source and drain contact volume can also be effective in reducing source to drain tunneling by achieving transport directed heavier conductivity mass value for electrons in silicon at T ¼ 300 K. 
 Modeling Issues Related to Degenerate Doping The degenerate substrate doping changes the density of states (DOS) effective mass for electron and hole in silicon at T ¼ 300 K and conductivity effective mass for electron and hole in silicon for T ¼ 300 K. Also, there should be strict reference of DOS and conductivity effective masses in silicon starting from T ¼ 4 K and then establishing a temperature related dispersion relationship to calculate their value at T ¼ 300 K. At degenerate doping, we use Fermi-Dirac integral for supposing n-type substrate assuming 100% ionization for doping 10 20 /cm 3 and above, but this factor is equal to n o /N c where n o is ionized free carrier density at T ¼ 300 K for n-type silicon and N c is effective density of states. Since the DOS electron effective mass increase at a nonlinear rate N c also rises sharply nonlinearly and the ratio increasingly becomes lesser as doping is increased and Fermi-Dirac integral decreases sharply from typical Maxwell-Boltzmann curve. Now to compute N c at T ¼ 300 K, are we using its value at T ¼ 4 K and then using temperature related equation to find its value at T ¼ 300 K and also finding a way to model sharp increase of this value at T ¼ 300 K for degenerate donor doping for n-type substrate? Some references quote  
 Atomic Layer Etching (ALE) for Lithography Based Etching of Pattern In high-NA EUV lithography, the resist is very thin and after exposure, there are only few nm left for etching and deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) will not be suitable for near-vertical edge critical dimension pattern and, therefore, atomic layer etching (ALE) is used which is the subtractive replacement for ALD. Through employing ALE, thin resist of few nm can be etched and near-vertical and conformal etch pattern can be established, so that critical dimension CD value has a minute standard deviation intra-die and die to die and line edge roughness rms (root mean squared) and line width rms are also smallest with ALE. It is a native form of etching rather than a reactive form of etching and that is why ALE is as versatile a technique as ALD. 
 Concluding Remarks In this chapter, some new scaling issues have been brought in focus for researchers who devise aggressively scaled FET architectures. Possible remedies are also suggested. One feature that all FET architectures from 3D to 2D to 1D dimensionality case should deliver is the scaling length based device optimization where the scaling length has to be as small as possible to enable gate to channel integrity better than drain induced subsurface field penetration into the source causing DIBL and also at drain for off condition or negative potential on gate, gate induced drain leakage (GIDL) enhancement. The scaling length gets better with top, bottom, side gates, or gate all around cylindrical wrapping and also for thin body and low substrate doping ensuring volume inversion, inversion charge centroid away from the surface, therefore less surface roughness scattering related mobility reduction and for intrinsic doping, enabling ballistic transport for FET when FET channel length is smaller than mean time between scatterings of an electron with a channel dopant. The authors believe that the suggestions and guidelines given in this chapter will be very much useful for FET architecture scaling optimization focused device engineering professionals. Some key reference values are given for interested readers  [9] [10] [11] [12] . 
 Introduction Low-power electronics utilize the least amount of energy possible to perform their intended function.  
 Overview of Traditional Transistors Any electronic device relies on the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor. They switch electrical impulses in digital logic circuits. A MOSFET has a metal gate, an oxide layer to impede electron mobility, and a semiconductor channel. The MOSFET can switch or amplify because its gate voltage controls channel current. Conventional transistors, also called metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, are the most fundamental components of electronic devices. Digital logic circuits' most important component can switch or boost electrical signals. MOSFETs have a metal gate, an oxide layer that blocks electrons, and a semiconductor channel. MOSFETs can be switches or amplifiers since the gate voltage controls channel currents. Another limitation of traditional MOSFETs is their subthreshold leakage current. The current that circulates through the MOSFET's channel when it is in the OFF state is known as subthreshold leakage current. This current is caused by the thermally generated carriers in the semiconductor channel and can be a significant contributor to overall power consumption, especially in low-power devices  [1] [2] [3] . Scientists have created new MOSFET materials and architectures to increase performance and power consumption. Metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors use high-k metal-gate materials (MOSFETs). High-k metal-gate materials instead of oxide insulating layers lower gate-to-channel capacitance. Switching loss and subthreshold leakage current are reduced through capacitance reduction. Instead of a horizontal channel, Fin-FETs have a narrow semiconductor fin flowing vertically. Flat MOSFET channels. Fin layout reduces gate-to-channel capacitance and improves electrostatic channel control. Reduced subthreshold leakage current increases power dissipation. In conclusion, switching loss and leakage current below the threshold limit low-power MOSFETs. Scientists have found techniques to reduce MOSFET power consumption. They use Fin-FETs and high-k metal-gate materials. 
 Basics of Tunneling Field-Effect Transistors Unlike the CMOS transistor, the newer TFET transistor has discrete source and drain doping. Unlike CMOS transistors, it releases less static when turned off. Nano-and microtechnologies are using TFETs more. Memory cells and noncritical logic circuits may use TFETs due to their low leakage. CMOS and BJTs regulate current flow by switching ON and OFF using energy. When the transistor is active, the bulk material substrate must form a channel for electrons to travel from source to drain. The proper gate bias, electrons in the conduction band, and holes in the lower-energy valence band permit electron flow. Energy helps electrons enter the conduction band. The energy barrier decrease depends on the voltage needed to turn a transistor on and off. Technology is focusing the semiconductor industry on voltage scaling. Another important topic is CMOS transistor static leakage current. A transistor's channel conducts current even when shut off. This subthreshold leakage current flows without the threshold voltage. GaN TFETs have a subthreshold slope of 30 mV/decade, compared to 60 for MOSFETs. MOSFETs leak current; hence, various circuit designs are needed, especially for low-voltage devices. TFETs look like CMOS transistors, but their source and drain dopants are different  [3] [4] [5] . Figure  31 .1 shows TFET subthreshold slope. In MOSFET, electrons and holes follow the valence or conduction band from source to drain. An ideal gate bias superposes the intrinsic region's valence band and the source's conduction band. Electrons move through the gadget and generate current. Tunneling is caused by conduction and valence band alignment  [4] . Adding a voltage to the gate increases or decreases the overlap between the two bands, turning the transistor on or off. Another difference between TFETs and MOSFETs is the current flow direction. MOSFETs allow current to flow from source to drain and drain to source. Nevertheless, TFETs limit current to one direction. With TFETs, current flows from drain to source. TFETs were first made from silicon and germanium. CMOS driving current could not be matched with a lower supply voltage. III-V materials were used to make homo-and heterojunction TFETs with a lower and more direct tunnel barrier. With homojunction TFETs, the source, channel, and drain are integrated into one device. Heterojunction TFET electrons cannot reach the tunnel because the source and channel are different semiconductors. The water supply is a different substance than the drain and channel. Water's origin, path, and destination can be made of different materials. Type-I heterojunctions use indiumphosphorous as the source and indium-gallium-arsenic as the channel and drain. Type-III heterojunction TFETs can use gallium-antimony and indium-arsenic sources, channels, and drains.  current density and substantial subthreshold swing (SS). This means the gadgets may not be able to meet ultralow-power consumption requirements  [5] . 
 Overview of TFET Structure 
 Energy Band Diagram Band diagrams show how TFET energy bands align at the source, channel, and drain in the OFF state. In OFF mode, V DS is positive and V GS is zero. The channel depletes, preventing water from entering the drain from its source. In the OFF state, TFET energy band diagrams have three sections: source, channel, and drain. The source's p-doped Fermi level is usually lower than the channel and drains. The channel's high Fermi level is due to natural or negligible doping. The source-channel p-n junction creates a vacuum. The depletion region prevents power from reaching the load. Drain voltage determines depletion region size (V DS ). V DS increases the depletion zone and current flow barrier. Few electrons reach the channel through the source-channel p-n junction. Its conductive band has few free electrons despite its p-type symmetry. Since the switch is off, little current flows. Because n-type sources have many free electrons in their conduction bands, MOSFETs have a greater OFF-state current. Figure  31 .4 shows the TFET in an "OFF" state when V GS is zero and V DS is greater than zero. Charge carriers in the channel's conduction band will now move toward the drain. The conduction band has few free electrons because the TFET's source is p-type. MOSFETs have n-type sources. The conduction band will have more free electrons, increasing the OFF-state current. Thermionic emission over the potential barrier at the source-channel junction lets some electrons enter the channel. MOSFETs have higher OFF-state currents than TFETs  [5] [6] [7] . The band diagram of an ON-state TFET can be found by applying a gate voltage V GS and analyzing the source, channel, and drain energy levels. Silicon-based TFETs go ON when the gate voltage (V GS ) passes 0.3 V. At the threshold voltage, the channel's energy band aligns with the input. At this V GS , the source's valence band matches the channel's conduction band. The source's valence band electrons may enter the channel's conduction band. Hence, it allows electricity to flow. Electrons from the source's valence band must enter the p-type source's conduction band. Figure  31 .5 shows that increased gate voltage V GS shifts the channel's energy bands away from the power supply. Figure  31 .5 shows that the source's valence band and the channel's conduction band coincide at a certain V GS . Without energy, the channel cannot absorb electrons from the source's valence band. When the source's valence band matches the channel's conduction band, electrons can tunnel over the bandgap. When the source and channel valence bands are in phase, the TFET turns on.  TFETs have opposing sources and drain doping. Because the channel's conduction band is not in the source's valence band, the device's current flows slowly while off. We can lower the tunneling width and boost source tunneling-enabled early states by increasing gate bias. Hence, the current rises rapidly  [9, 10] . Due to fewer starting states contributing to the source valence band, gate bias reduces the current rise. When the gate bias is near the drain potential, pinning reduces the current increase further. Also, in the bias zone. The ambipolar current of a TFET at a negative bias is symmetrical. The current changes depending on the gate bias due to tunneling the source and drain channels. Figure  31 .7 shows the transfer characteristics (I D -V GS ) of n-channel TFET for different values of V GS and different dimensions of the source pocket  [11, 12] . Figure  31 .8 shows the transfer characteristics (I D -V GS ) of n-channel TFET for different dimensions of the source pocket. These plots match because the source and drain doping are mirror images. Ambipolar current is more sensitive to drain voltage than ON-state current, according to transfer characteristics. When the gate voltage is low and the drain voltage is high, drain energy bands are narrower than channel bands. This increases ambipolar current and channel drain tunneling. At a negative gate voltage, the ambipolar current varies substantially with the drain voltage. Let us see how the drain voltage affects the ON-state current. Since channel potential is constant, source-channel tunneling is unaffected by drain voltage (V GS ¼V DS ). Hence, the ON-state current before pinning is unaffected by drain voltage changes if the gate voltage remains unchanged. The drain potential pinches the channel potential and traps it at the drain potential when V GS > V DS . When pins are added, increasing drain voltage narrows the channel's energy bands in proportion to the source voltage. In TFET, drain voltage raises source valence band energy levels. More electrons can tunnel from source to channel. These energies increase the tunneling length between the source and channel, but the tunneling mechanism remains unaltered. However, at lower channel energy bands, pinned sources and channels have shorter tunneling lengths. After the pinning transition, drain voltage changes affect the ON current more than the ambipolar current. As drain voltage rises, ambipolar tunneling states grow, but their tunneling distance decreases. Pinning in the ON-state increases the number of electrons that can tunnel over and their tunneling length. This makes the ON-state current less sensitive to drain voltage than the ambipolar current. As drain    [13]  voltage rises, transfer characteristics minimum shifts right. Figure  31 .9 shows the transfer characteristics (I D -V GS ) of n-channel TFET for different dielectric materials. 
 Subthreshold Swing (SS) The subthreshold swing (SS) is the gate-source voltage change needed to change the drain current by 10. This shows the steep subthreshold zone. A smaller subthreshold swing lets low-power TFETs operate at lower gate-source voltages. TFETs are best for scientific research despite their higher subthreshold swing (SS). Thermionic injection limits MOSFETs to 60 mV/dec SS. Tunneling allows TFETs to achieve SS levels below this limit. Subthreshold swing changes when current flow varies. MOSFETs allow carriers to traverse the channel, allowing subthreshold current to flow. Subthreshold swing (SS) determines low-power TFET switching frequency and ON/OFF time. Decreased subthreshold swing reduces power consumption and increases switching speeds. Smaller subthreshold swings have steeper transfer characteristics and larger ON-OFF ratios. TFET subthreshold swings depend on source-channel tunneling. The subthreshold swing depends on the material's bandgap, the source's band alignment, and the channel's electric field. Material bandgap affects subthreshold swing. Bandgap narrowing enhances tunneling current and minimizes subthreshold swing. Low-power TFET research has focused on III-V compounds and 2D materials with narrower bandgaps. The source-channel band alignment affects the subthreshold swing. The tunneling current increases and the subthreshold swing decreases when the source and channel are closer. Heterojunction TFETs' two semiconductors for source and channel allow this. Channel electric field impacts subthreshold swing. Electric fields shorten Fig.  31 .9 The transfer characteristics (I D -V GS ) of n-channel TFET for different dielectric materials  [13]  tunneling distances and increase tunneling currents. Doping profiles modify channel electric field strength, changing the device's shape. 
 Output Characteristics TFET output characteristics are shown by the drain current (I D ) and drain-source voltage (V DS ) at different gate-source voltages (V GS ). How well the device manages to drain current using gate voltage and controls the current-voltage link determines its effectiveness. Once the gate potential crosses that barrier, TFETs lock the channel potential at the drain potential. Channel and drain potentials rise together. Hence, current surges. The channel potential shifts away from the drain potential and towards the gate potential as drain bias increases. This generates a steady current. This sample values all output attributes. In the saturation area (V GS > V T ), the gatesource voltage dictates the drain current. Use the output properties to calculate the device's maximum drain current and transconductance (g m ). A device with a greater transconductance may modulate its drain current with a proper gate voltage, reducing power consumption. TFETs describe the behavior of a device below its threshold and how gate voltage affects drain current. Low subthreshold swing and high transconductance TFETs consume less power and perform better. The drain current remains constant regardless of TFET channel length. Saturation area output resistance is initially much higher. Figure  31 .10 shows n-channel TFET's output characteristics (I D ÀV DS ) for various V GS values; it indicates that drain voltage does not affect channel potential in the saturation area (V DS > V GS ). This is because source-channel tunneling does not impact drain current. TFET outputs have a greater saturation voltage than MOSFETs. TFETs take longer to saturate, making them inferior in low-voltage analog applications. The tunneling field-effect transistor (TFET) may be a low-power device due to its low subthreshold swing, ON-state current, OFF-state leakage, power-delay product, and temperature dependency. They operate at lower voltages and use less power than MOSFETs  [12] . TFETs' band-to-band tunneling generates current more efficiently than MOSFETs' thermionic emission. TFETs lower ON-state current and OFF-state leakage. TFETs' reduced power-delay-product (PDP) makes them, even more, energy efficient than MOSFETs. TFETs have less temperature dependence than MOSFETs. Their performance is less temperature-sensitive  [14] [15] [16] . 
 Design and Analysis of TFET Digital Circuits This section discusses TFET-based fundamental digital building block circuit-level benchmarking. Starting with inverter logic gates, we develop TFET digital circuits and focus on how TFETs affect essential building blocks. 
 Full Adder Digital systems rely on full adders. A custom test bed transiently simulated TFET and Fin-FET single-bit full-adder solutions. To simulate driving signals and loads, the tested full adder was arranged in a structure of full adders and inverters. Postprocessing delays and energy characteristics offer figures of merit for ripple-carry adders with more than two bits. Pull-up and pull-down networks have similar mirror structures. In the carry circuit, three p-type transistors are reduced to two, and in the summing circuit, four to three. Asymmetric current conduction in TFETs causes n-type and p-type devices to create positive and negative V DS in complementary logic circuits. This arrangement prevents forward biasing at n-and p-type TFET p-i-n junctions. When V DD is low, TFET adders outperform Fin-FETs. Hence, TFET systems outperform Fin-FETs with V DD less than 400 mV. TFET implementation outperforms Fin-FET design by 3.5% due to its decreased propagation time. TFET circuits can also run at higher clock frequencies with less V DD . Static and dynamic energy affects the circuit's energy consumption.  Figures 31.11 and 31 .12 illustrate the full-adder circuit static energy and dynamic energy consumption comparison for TFET and Fin-FET. Speed makes TFETs useful in full-adder circuits. The adder circuit can operate at a greater frequency because TFETs have a smaller subthreshold swing than MOSFETs. This is beneficial in highspeed applications that require speed and power. TFETs in full-adder circuits also improve circuit architecture. TFETs in full-adder circuits can increase transistor density and circuit size. TFETs offer promise, but research and development are still in their infancy, therefore the technology has not yet reached its full potential. Before digital circuits use TFETs, reliability, scalability, and cost must be addressed. TFETs may work well in entire adder circuits for low-power, high-speed applications. Before they may be used widely, significant concerns must be resolved. 
 6T SRAM Cell Processors employ SRAM cells as on-chip caching due to their rapid read/write rates. These cells can occupy a computer's processor. Two inverters and two access transistors store and retrieve data in the 6T SRAM cell. The TFET SRAM cell must be studied to understand the pros and cons of TFET application in digital circuits and its one-way conduction. Figure  31 .13 depicts SRAM structure energy consumption designed using TFET and Fin-FET.   
 Ring Oscillators The graph depicts the relationship between energy and Tosc for various VDD values in the region of 200-600 mV for both TFET and Fin-FET ring oscillators, which is relevant for time-relaxed applications. Figure  31 .14 illustrates the ring oscillator circuit energy consumption comparison between TFET and Fin-FET. We see a huge increase in Tosc at extremely low VDD, say around 200 mV. The energy savings per cycle for a given Tosc is smaller for TFET than it is for Fin-FET. As this is the case, this is the only frequency range where TFETs would be preferable to Fin-FETs. Target applications are ultralow-voltage circuits, like those in Internet of Things (IoT) end-nodes, which exchange very low-power dissipation for poor speed, thanks to the low SS of TFETs, which makes them useful in the subthreshold region.    [17]  made with TFET-based transducers. The relationship between current and voltage for the transconductor was much more linear for device B than for device A. To lower the amount of intermodulation distortion, it is best for the transconductor and amplifier circuits to have high linearity. 
 Design Consideration and Optimization of TFETS Double-Gate Structure Adding a second gate to single-gate TFETs increases electrostatic control and I ON, double-gate (DG) TFET layout does this. DG-TFETs are more helpful than singlegate ones due to their lower threshold voltage and higher transconductance. By choosing the right gate dielectric, DG TFETs can have low threshold voltage roll-off, high I ON , and low I OFF . DG TFETs' vertical layout further decreases short-channel effects (SCE). Figure  31 .17 shows the double gate (DG)-TFET structure. 6T TFET SRAM designs outperform 7T designs and have a higher noise margin. The graphic shows DG TFET with a 6T SRAM design. CMOS-based SRAM leaks more than TFET-based. Gate stack design can evaluate the analog performance of TFET devices, which are frequently used in digital applications. TFETs can replace analog circuitry. 
 Dual Material/Triple Material Gates Dual material gates (DMG)/triple material gates (TMG) and gate work function increase I ON and SS (subthreshold swing) in TFETs. These tools also lessen DIBL effects. Figure  31 .18 depicts the dual material gate TFET structure. The tunnel and Fig.  31 .  16  Transconductor circuit current-voltage relationship  [18]  auxiliary entrances are near production and collection facilities, respectively. Siliconbased DG TFETs have a lower ION due to an indirect bandgap and less tunneling. Nevertheless, the silicon-germanium (Si-Ge)'s low bandgap could improve this  [18] . Adjusting the mole fraction improves low-SS Si1-xGex TFETs (x). Small bandgap materials minimize the tunneling barrier, improving carrier tunneling. To boost ON current, Si-based p-TFETs use InGaAs, which has a shorter bandgap  [18, 19] . An asymmetric gate oxide DG TFET with a high-k dielectric and a low-k material separates the source and drain. Air (k ¼ 1) can replace the low oxide material (SiO 2 ) on the drain side of the device to raise the cut-off frequency and solve the high gatedrain capacitance issue. ideal for low-power digital applications  [18, 19] . Figure  31 .12 shows asymmetric gate oxide DG TFET fabrication. 
 Asymmetric Structure 
 Stacked Structure The construction of a stacked model TFET is shown in Fig.  31 .20; it is made up of two layers of material that are stacked on top of one another in a layered fashion. The top layer and the bottom layer are both made of semiconductors, but the layer at the top has a wider bandgap than the layer at the bottom  [20] . Because of the effect that the layered structure has on tunneling probability, the electrostatics as well as the average subthreshold swing have been significantly enhanced.  
 Source Pocket The average subthreshold swing and the I ON that result from a source pocket are both larger. Moreover, the tunneling breadth is significantly reduced due to a local minimum on the EC curve near the tunneling junction. The outcome is a big improvement in both the DC and analog/RF figures of merit. Because of this, low-power users will benefit more from its use. Figure  31 .21 illustrates the TFET with GaSb source pocket structure. 
 GAA Structure The basic gate-all-around (GAA) TFET structure is shown in Fig.  31 .22. Multi-gate architectures, including the double-gate, asymmetry-gate, and gate-all-around (GAA) structures, have been utilized to decrease the number of SCEs. This is  accomplished by enhancing gate control. The vertical GAA-TFET is becoming increasingly popular among these structures as a result of its excellent electrostatic performance in low-power and high-speed applications, its high level of integration in three dimensions (3D), and its compatibility with the CMOS technology that is already in use. With a cylindrical GAA architecture, one might anticipate an improvement in the electrostatic control that is exercised over the channel region by the gate. While evaluating the performance of a channel, one of the most important factors to consider is its diameter  [21] [22] [23] .  
 Other Structures 
 Features of TFETS in Modern Electronics Low-power applications benefit from TFETs' low-voltage operation. Quantum tunneling affects TFET current flow. Their subthreshold swing (SS) is much lower than typical FETs. TFETs can function at lower voltages with excellent current control  [22] . Wearables, portable devices, and IoT applications can save a lot of energy  [24, 25] . TFETs' low "OFF" leakage current makes them useful in low-power applications. Conventional FETs allow a small current to flow even when the gate voltage is ground. Hence, energy consumption may be high. TFETs can minimize power consumption by reducing leakage current. 
 Future Trends • Materials and fabrication: Scientists and engineers are discovering novel materials and fabrication methods to boost TFET performance. To improve TFET SS, researchers are studying germanium semiconductors and 3D printing. • Device architectures: New device architectures are being developed to improve TFET scalability and incorporation into electronic systems. This includes researching vertical TFETs, which can make devices smaller and more efficient. • TFET performance improvement: Several studies are underway. This requires lower contact resistance, faster switching, and higher OFF current. For low-power applications, TFETs appear promising. TFETs are currently under development and cannot be bought. But, if TFET research continues, they may be used in low-power applications including IoT, wearables, and portable electronics. 
 Conclusion Modern electronics could benefit from low-power tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs). Low-power applications like IoT, wearable tech, and portable electronics benefit from their ability to work at low voltages and leak little current when turned off. Researchers are exploring new device topologies, materials, and production procedures to scale up and integrate TFETs into electrical systems. Performance, switching speed, OFF-state current, and contact resistance will improve. TFETs are still developing, but they are likely to change low-power electronics soon. TFETs could boost electronic efficiency and reduce energy use in low-power devices. To scale and integrate TFETs into electrical systems, scientists are inventing new device topologies and production methods. TFET efficiency is being improved with 3D printing and vertically oriented TFET production. In low-power applications, OFF-state current is being increased to reduce power consumption. Researchers are investigating new materials and manufacturing methods to lower the OFF current. To lower contact resistance and increase OFF-state current, germanium semiconductors and new manufacturing methods are needed. To conclude, TFETs offer great potential as low-power FET alternatives in modern electronics. Before widespread use in low-power applications, various difficulties must be rectified. Nonetheless, industry research and development are ongoing, so these concerns will be rectified and TFETs will be important in low-power electronic devices. TFET research could reduce power requirements for numerous low-power applications, making devices more energy efficient. maximum possible initiation velocity at the source end where the channel L is assumed to just about to start. The device engineering focus on these devices is to bring down the subthreshold slope of these devices to the room temperature limit of 60 mV/decade and is limited by minimum gate to source barrier thermionic emission. In order to achieve subthreshold slope in the vicinity of 20 mV/decade to 30 mV/decade alternative carrier transport mechanism needed to be evolved and hence the concept of tunneling field effect device has been devised providing steeper slope amenable to faster logic switching and transitions and at the same time consuming lower switching current during these transitions. As the name reveals, tunnel field effect devices utilize tunneling of electrons from a reverse biased P + -N + junctions where due to reverse bias the junction profile is very steep and its width is very narrow. When the top gate overlaps this P + -N + junction area, minority electrons in P + material can tunnel through the very narrow width of the reverse biased junctions formed there and these electrons that are subject to similar electron density in an n type drift region can be collected by the heavily doped n + drain side. Tunneling is more sensitive to width of the reverse biased energy profile of the P + -N + junction rather than height or energy gap between Ec level and E v level of the two sides of the P + -N + junction. For tunnel FETs as discussed in this chapter, the subthreshold slope factor SS has a different expression as per Alan Seabaugh et al.'s paper  [1]  and is effectively tailorable with its defining parameters to reduce subthreshold slope less than 60 mV/decade. Since the mechanism is through tunneling, tunneling-induced electron drift velocity tends to two to three orders of magnitude lower than thermionic emission or over-the-barrier induced drift velocity. Therefore, different I on enhancement engineering techniques are employed in the source sided junction like strained Si-Ge layer or extra pocket implant and recently vertical staggered heterojunction tunnel FET has shown promise to close the gap between I on provided by conventional MOSFET based devices and tunneling field effect devices. Particularly, tunneling probability from source as calculated from 3D tunneling current in  [1]  has strong modeling requirement of tunneling mass which is in the negative exponential factor of the tunneling probability equation in  [1] . Therefore, if tunneling mass decreases as less than value of 1, tunnel current can increase substantially but almost all TFET papers to date in their design through TCAD do not effectively cite the value of tunneling mass and its reduction with band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) induced energy band steepness at the source through various source junction based tunneling engineering. Due to steep slope characteristics of tunnel FET, I off is very low and these types of devices are most ideal for subthreshold or near-threshold ultralow power logic switches where conventional MOSFETs and their other derivatives are inefficient. In this chapter, tunnel FET overview, its structural design, and performance enhancement method will be discussed and frequently happening notorious ambipolar transport that reduces the I on and enhances I off will be discussed with methods developed in literature. We first start with pivotal tunneling FET design and modeling with Alan Seabaugh et al's classic paper on tunnel FET  [1] . The physics of operation of tunnel FET is exquisitely narrated by the authors of the above reference paper where for an ultrathin body sub-10 nm semiconductor transistor with p + -n + abrupt junction, a tenth of voltage bias at the drain making p + -n + junction reverse biased with steepest energy profile induces large Zener or BTBT tunneling from p + valence band to n + conduction band. With a gate aligned to the p + -n + junction and a metal work function selected to fully deplete the channel when the device threshold voltage is adjusted to operate in enhancement mode or normally off state, application of positive gate voltage favors the Zener tunneling by control of tunneling window as stated earlier and the saturation current extractable from this device is set by the maximum value of BTBT injection. With an intrinsic channel associated and adjacent to steep p + -n + source junction, these BTBT injected carriers travel with faster effective mobility enabled by vertical field reduction accompanied by BTBT efficiency than the usually reduced mobility observed in conventional n-MOSFET with doping induced Coulomb scattering and vertical field induced mobility reduction. The authors of this paper further state that unlike the MOSFET, the n-type TFET and p-type TFET devices can be potentially designed to carry the same current if they use the same tunneling junction, therefore equal gate widths give equal on-currents and symmetric layouts are possible. The authors of this referenced paper then illustrated through a highly precise figure based on measured n-channel and p-channel TFET drain current per micron gate width versus gate to source voltage V gs at a fixed V ds for 32 nm node CMOS on projected state-of-the-art developments with TFETs against CMOS technology. The authors then embark on nicely enunciating the TFET analytic theory to elaborate on Zener tunneling also known as band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) and the primary transport mechanism in tunnel transistors. Zener tunneling current is determined by integrating the product of charge flux and the tunneling probability from the energy states on the p + side to those on the n + side where the tunneling probability is calculated by applying the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation to the triangular potential at the p + -n + junction. The authors systematically developed analytical equations first for Zener tunneling, then 1D Zener tunneling, Zener tunneling versus material and dimensionality where tunneling current per unit width as a function of internal field for Si, Ge, InAs, InSb, and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) lateral tunnel junction are compared using material properties such as energy gap and tunneling mass. Illustrated in these figures, the authors also showed through simulation the benefits in going from bulk 3D to 1D nanowire (NW) tunneling device taking the case of Si and Ge. The very important subthreshold swing is discussed next in their paper by the authors. From the defined tunneling current relationship as a function maximum electric field at the p ¼ -n + junction, the derivative of this tunneling current value with respect to gate-to-source voltage V gs can be utilized to determine an expression for the TFET subthreshold swing. Next the authors of this referenced paper systematically shed light on the design considerations and trade-offs for TFETs with an overview of the geometrical considerations from the perspectives of dependences on supply voltage, gate electrostatics, source doping, and mechanisms limiting off-current. Next, in this chapter, the author turns to another classic review on tunnel FET "Tunneling Field Effect Transistors: Prospects and Challenges" by Ian A. Young et al.  [2] . As the authors discuss in this paper, silicon's large indirect band gap and large carrier mass mean drive current for silicon TFET are very low. But due to the availability of high-quality materials together with years of know-how, Si and Si:Ge TFETs have been studied the most. III-V materials for TFETs attracted attention such as InAs with some of them offering lower band direct band gap and lower tunneling effective mass. Eventually broken band gap vertical III-V heterojunction TFETS have shown the highest drive current attainable. The authors in this paper provide a comprehensive analysis and review of GaSb/InAs TFET for gate length of 13 nm that has been successfully manufactured by Intel where these researchers are professionally engaged. GaSb/InAs heterojunction tunnel FET's I on is larger than silicon MOSFET for L G ¼ 13 nm up to a gate bias of 0.6 V. When measuring I off of GaSb/InAs TFET, the authors observed that TFET off current shows strong V ds bias susceptibility. Even with 10 nm drain underlap and low drain doping, heterojunction TFET's I off increases sharply as the drain voltage increased beyond 0.3 V. Whereas heterojunction TFET can support I off < 10 pA/μm at V ds ¼ 0.3 V, the lowest I off achievable at V ds ¼ 0.5 V is 1 nA/μm. Another advantage emerging from GaSb/InAs heterojunction tunnel FET is its lower gate capacitance than Si MOSFET due to the low density of states (DOS) of InAs conduction band. This is advantageous for lowering dynamic power and circuit delay although from inversion channel carrier density view point, lower gate capacitance means lower gate to channel coupling and loss of inversion charge density. When device parameter variations are considered, TFETs are affected more from random dopant fluctuations (RDF) at its source to channel junction since it modifies the tunneling transmission area shape or its width and height. It should be mentioned here that only for a limited range of gate to source junction overlap voltage, energy states at the P + side and N + side are aligned so that electrons tunnel from valence band state of P + region to the conduction band state of N + region. Next, the authors discuss important subthreshold slope (SS) variability and its degradation by defects and traps positioned near the source or adjacent to source to channel region. III-V materials are more prone to nonuniformities in their crystal structure such as vacancies or interstitials, interface states, and charged ionized or unionized impurities coming out of dopants implanted as part of the desired structure. The main consequence of these nonuniformities is to add extra electron/hole states inside the ideal band gap weakening the energy filtering which the TFET uses to achieve steep SS. Defects can be modeled by introducing trap states into the existing band structure and allowing transport through these states having trap lateral size and energy spectrum varying with the defect type. The TFET is more susceptible to trap induced degradation than the MOSFET, if the location and energy of the traps are assumed closer to N-TFET's worst case point such as inside the channel with the energy levels 0.1-0.2 eV below the conduction band. However, this issue is not limited to TFET, the same trap-induced tunneling (TAT) process would cause the leakage issues in the MOSFET through the GIDL (gate induced drain leakage) process when the traps are extended along the channel drain junction of the transistor. GIDL and band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) current are important components of reverse bias leakage current for TFETs when V gs < 0. If the body doping is very high in the substrate, severe band bending happens near source to substrate p-n junction near the surface and generate BTBT current which may be an issue for MOSFET but surely an issue for TFET where both p and n region doping at the source junction is very high  [3] . Thus the specific energy and location of distribution of the traps inside the energy gap for fabricated experimental devices will impact the level of SS degradation in the TFET and MOSFET I-V characteristics. The authors infer that the main reason for SS degradation is the trap assisted tunneling which is more prominent in materials like III-V other than silicon possessing high bulk and interface defects. The experimental realization of TFET's significant advantage of SS over MOSFET is highly dependent on progress in the quality of these novel materials and their minimum defect density enabled crystal growth. Another nonideality concern is the density of states (DOS) extending into the band gap (band tail) due to high doping density. This effect is due to the nonhomogeneous distribution of the doping atoms creating different local potentials when compared with homogeneous doping condition. When statistically modeled over large areas, this effect can be described as an exponential decay of DOS into the band gap. Since the TFETs considered for future technology nodes have very small cross-sections (5 nm nanowire), the averaging effect is not valid. A more appropriate approach is to consider this issue as a part of source doping variation and study its effect on I off variation. Through a 3 σ variation of random dopant induced source doping variation, it is found its effect is not as critical as 3 σ induced V T variation on I off , implying high doping induced band tails are not critical from off state leakage current performance of TFET. Again, the authors stress the point that to subdue the effect of band tails due to high doping of source p-n junctions, high-quality epitaxial layer where the dopants are at interstitial positions should be ensured during fabrication and thermal annealing treatment but defect degeneration due to heavy dopant implant or low-quality epi growth is expected to bring the same SS degradation problems that resulted out of traps in these devices  [4] . Other sources of recombination/generation mechanisms (SRH) mostly happening with in direct band gap materials are also source of leakage and are more compounded at elevated temperatures and strongly depend on material quality. With regard to scaling requirements of these n-TFET design, the authors noted that the TFETs with narrow band gap and longer channel length, ambipolar transmission is the main source of SS degradation and high I off . However, in short gate length TFETs, the shorter tunneling path between source and drain aggravates direct source to drain tunneling leakage while the increased bandgap due to confinement reduces the ambipolar leakage problem  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Unlike in the MOSFET, gate oxide scaling does not improve short channel effects in TFETs significantly instead body thickness scaling is the most important parameter. Compared to MOSFET built with double gate structure and nanowire (NW) structure which almost have similar drive current for low gate to source voltage V gs up to 0.5 V, significant upshift in heterojuction TFET built with nanowire is observed compared to double gate heterojunction TFET implying nanowire radius or body thickness scaling is important metric here for heterojunction TFET I on . An illustrative figure is taken and adapted by the author of this chapter for content representation that points to this discussion (Fig.  32 .1): The authors in  [2]  project that the body thickness requirement is much tighter for TFET than MOSFET with 3 nm NW recommended for L g ¼ 9 nm. The authors also observe importantly that as L G scales, two-dimensional semiconductors with intrinsically superior electrostatics may benefit the performance of the TFETs. For enhancing the I on of TFET, the author of this e-book discusses another reference article "Drive Current Boosting of N-Type Tunnel FET with Strained SiGe Layer at Source" by Santanu Mahapatra et al.  [10] . In their paper, the authors propose that the enhancement in I on is achieved by introducing a thin strained SiGe layer on top of the silicon source and the drive current I on increases exponentially with the Ge mole fraction. For a tunnel FET, the I on is proportional to the electron/ hole transmission probability T(E) in the BTBT mechanism which is given by T E ð Þ ¼ exp À 4 2 m ⁎ p E 3 2 G 3 e j j ℏ E G þΔφ ð Þ e si e ox t ox t si Δφ, where m ⁎ is the tunneling effective mass, e the electron charge, E g is the band gap of semiconductor material, Δφ is the energy range over which tunneling takes place, ε si and ε ox are the permittivity of silicon and oxide respectively, t ox is the gate dielectric thickness, and t si is the TFET body thickness. Profiling the source to channel p-n junction energy profile to increase the Δφ and decreasing the E g are the two most viable option to increase T(E). When the body thickness t si is decreased considering lower nm NW radius, the sub-bands in the conduction band have a wider separation, so an electron from an energy state in the valence band on P + region has a misaligned state on the N + side reducing Δφ and T(E) is decreased. Also when ε ox is increased and t ox is decreased, C ox or oxide capacitance is increased creating more inversion charge in the n À drift region and decreasing the reverse bias through decreased channel potential in the depletion region of P + -N + junction at the source. As a result, the energy band becomes less steeper, tunneling width widens, and tunneling rate of electrons reduces decreasing T(E). Finally, when ε si is increased, the reverse bias width is increased analogous to reverse bias controlled more steeper energy profile in the P + -N + junction at the source contributing to more tunneling rate and increased T(E). A note on tunneling effective mass m ⁎ from the equation infers that the tunneling mass contributes to faster tunneling rate by increasing mobility of tunneling electrons. But generally, when m ⁎ is low, density of states (DOS) in the conduction band is low and sub-band energy separation in conduction band is wider. Both of these factors should reduce tunneling rate but it looks like it more contributes to tunneling mobility, The authors introduced a thin SiGe layer on top of Si source material and varied E G to tune to maximizing T(E) by varying Ge mole fraction. The device performance is more sensitive to degenerate doping at the source and the abruptness of its junction profile. In the device simulation model, degeneracy induced band gap narrowing model and exact Fermi-Dirac statistics are used by the authors. Also nonlocal tunneling criterion is used which causes the electrons to be generated at the end of the tunneling path as implied by the tunneling physics. The band gap at the source end reduces as the Ge mole fraction is increased. This results in a reduction of tunneling band gap E G and increase in T(E). The authors also found through their simulation that there is negligible change in tunneling width and height with increase of V ds . Additionally, this increase in I on leads to a reduction of average subthreshold swing since the device threshold voltage now falls in the steeper region of the curve. The authors through their simulation recorded an I on ¼ 580 μA/μm, I off ¼ 0.52 fA/μm, and average SS of 13 mV/decade is obtained for a Ge mole fraction of 0.7 with V dd ¼ 1.2 V. The authors also found through simulation that tunneling of carriers mostly happen at the surface level and BTBT generation is found to be within maximum to about 20 nm thickness of SiGe layer. Any additional increase of SiGe layer beyond 20 nm contributes to the I off of the device. Increasing Ge mole fraction within this 20 nm thickness of SiGe layer increases the T(E) and I on. . The authors further explained the reasons behind placing the strained SiGe layer on top of Si material. First, the active area is located only at the source channel junction and the drain voltage V ds does not have any impact on BTBT tunneling at the source junction. Adding strained SiGe layer on drain would add strain to the channel from both sides and may be a cause of either increase of mobility or decrease of it as a combined effect. The effect of strain in the silicon channel away from the source junction is not considered. After closely probing this article where the authors provided the transmittance T(E), the tunneling mass m ⁎ should be variable with increasing Ge mole fraction of the SiGe layer on top of Si source and with strained SiGe layer and both these engineering modifications of the TFET's source configuration should decrease m ⁎ considerably (m ⁎ decreases with increasing Ge mole fraction in SiGe layer) and further increase T(E). The authors of this paper seemed to overlook this modeling requirement of m ⁎ of top SiGe layer which is strained and whose Ge mole fraction is varied up to 0.7. For an n-TFET structure, the carrier density that is available for tunneling is n 2 i eff N A where N A is degenerately doped acceptors in P + material of source junction. N A doping even though degenerate must be such that n 2 i eff increases considerably in 10th power owing to more intense band gap narrowing effect on Ge mole fraction reduced Si band gap E G so that the minority electron density available for tunneling is increased up to almost 10 11 /cm 3 or more for a N A doping of 10 20 /cm 3 . It should be also noted that the top Si:Ge layer's strain on Si P + material increases with Ge mole fraction and additionally reduces band gap E G of silicon P + material and this should further lift ni,eff value and the minority electron concentration from the above stated value beneficial for overall tunneling current. The drift region adjacent to N + material should be quite intrinsically doped to match the overall tunneling electron density that emerges out of N + material of the source junction. Intrinsically doped n-drift region will also invert with low enough gate voltage and moderate C ox as high C ox is detrimental to T(E) shown before in the analysis. The drain which is N + should be biased with high V R so that the energy band profile of the source junction becomes sufficiently steep and its width narrow paving the path for interband tunneling in some heterojunction III-V TFET structure. Intrinsic drift region will ensure negligible voltage drop in the n-drift region and most reverse bias voltage will appear at the P + -N + source junction. The reference list shows some other excellent papers on tunneling based transport and current analysis  [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . The author of this chapter considers the value of tunneling mass as reported in  [1]  must be calibrated with respect to other transport conductivity masses in silicon for electron having value less than unity of free electron mass and all the references used here should provide this value in a table and its numerical relationship equation when source based engineering like pockets and strains are involved. So far, the author has not found any TFET based reference article quoting the tunneling mass and its computing equation as BTBT changes the energy barrier steepness at source. Lower tunneling mass can significantly boost the tunneling current mentioned in key reference papers with relation to this chapter. 
 Method of Calculating the Tunneling Mass from BTBT Generation Rate From the very relevant reference paper  [20] , there is a way to calculate the tunneling mass or reduced mass due to two-dimensional confinement highly steep energy band profile; Kane's nonlocal BTBT tunneling rate based current available with synopsis TCAD platform is used here to show how this tunneling mass can be extracted from spatially variant electric field steepness with maximum tunneling probability from P+ valence band to N+ conduction band electron tunneling in the case of an n-tunneling FET. From the Eq. (32.1) ξ ¼ À qN A e x, where x defines the spatial dimension related to the electric field profile width locally, taking almost intrinsic drift region, the reverse biased current of an p-i-n tunnel FET is: I ¼ A qV R ξ E 1=2 G exp ÀB E 3=2 G ξ ð32:1Þ This current can be fitted to within 5% with any TFET based structure of p-i-n nature. In this equation, V R is the applied reverse bias between drain and source of tunneling FET and E G is the band gap of the material at T ¼ 300 K. For tunneling mass or reduced mass as defined in this paper  [20] , we can further arrange the Eq. (32.2) into Eq. (32.3): ln I A qV R ξ E 1=2 G ¼ ÀB E 3=2 G ξ ð32: 2Þ Now, this is a line of type y ¼ m 1/x type where y is ln I A qV R ξ E 1=2 G , m ¼ -B E G 3/2 and x ¼ ξ. This curve can be divided into (i) low ξ where the nature of (32.3) is linear, (ii) mid ξ where point to point slope variation is minimal, and (iii) high ξ where asymptotic slope is an inverse line. We already know I, V R , ξ, and E G in the above equation and dividing the (32.3) into three zones allow us to extract A and B from the slope characteristics done numerically. Now these different A and B values can be plotted as a function of ξ and at the same time the originally referred A and B values A ¼ q 2 m 1=2 r 18 πℏ 2 and B ¼ πm 1=2 r 2 ℏ q ð32:3Þ can be checked and m r value now can be extracted using this procedure as a function of ξ which is spatially varying and approximated by the maximum electric field approximation (MEFA) method. So far, the method elaborated here with the assistance of reference  [20]  has not been reported in any literature to date to calculate the tunneling mass or reduced tunneling mass m r as described in this chapter. 
 Introduction With the aggressive downscaling of complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) field-effect transistors (FETs), integrated circuits have historically been able to meet the ever-increasing demands for miniaturization, operational speed, cost reduction, and a variety of functionalities  [1] . However, due to the high static power dissipation of modern CMOS, further downscaling is extremely challenging  [2] [3] . As a result of the larger leakage current and the higher supply voltage that are present in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), the power dissipation is high. It is a consequence of short-channel effects (SCEs) in such nanoscale MOSFETs that the higher leakage current occurs. These effects can be minimized to some extent with innovative device designs  [3] [4] . Furthermore, a higher supply voltage is needed to maintain a high drive current and, therefore, a higher operating speed. The OFF-state to ON-state transition of MOSFETs must be as fast as possible to scale down the supply voltage without degrading their performance, i.e., its subthreshold swing (SS) should be as small as possible  [5] . At room temperature, the fundamental limit of a MOSFET's minimum subthreshold swing (SS) is 60 mV per decade, which for practical nanoscale MOSFETs is significantly higher  [6] . In order to overcome these limitations, alternative FET devices with extremely small subthreshold swings have been explored. A new alternative to nanoscale MOSFETs has emerged in the form of tunneling field-effect transistors (TFETs). Because of their unique carrier injection mechanism, TFETs achieve subthreshold swing (SS) of less than 60 mV per decade using band-to-band tunneling (BTBT). Additionally, TFETs are effectively immune to device downscaling, and their nanoscale dimensions can retain minimal leakage current. The present chapter focuses on the basic introduction of tunneling field-effect transistors (TFETs), their types, and recent applications in various fields  [6] . 
 Introduction to Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors (TFETs) A tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) is a type of transistor that operates based on the principle of quantum tunneling of charge carriers across a narrow bandgap material. Unlike conventional field-effect transistors (FETs), TFETs use tunneling rather than thermionic emission to transport charge carriers through the device. It is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that occurs when charge carriers tunnel through a potential barrier due to their wave nature at small dimensions. A charge particle that encounters a potential barrier of height with energy greater than the particle's own reflects or tunnels through it. Tunneling probability is determined by the potential barrier height, width, shape, and tunneling mass of the charge carrier  [7, 8] . In the incident and transmitted regions, the wave vector of the charge carrier is real, but in the tunneling region, it is imaginary. There is an exponential decay of the wave function's amplitude in the tunneling region caused by the imaginary wave vector. This reduces the probability of transmission. Many areas of tunneling of charge carriers are well understood, including tunneling of electrons across oxides and tunnel diodes. Tunneling phenomena in TFET, or tunnel FETs (tunnel fieldeffect transistors), refer to the process by which electrons are able to tunnel through a thin insulating barrier, known as the tunnel junction, in a semiconductor device  [9] [10] [11] . The TFET has a p-i-n junction, where the intrinsic (i) region is a very narrow bandgap material, typically made of III-Vor IV-IV semiconductors. The p-type and n-type regions are formed on either side of the intrinsic region, forming a heterojunction. The gate electrode is placed on top of the intrinsic region, separated from the channel by a thin insulating layer. When a voltage is applied to the gate, an electric field is formed across the intrinsic region, which induces tunneling of the charge carriers from the valence band of the p-type region to the conduction band of the n-type region through the narrow bandgap intrinsic region  [10] . This results in a significant change in the current flowing through the device, which can be used to control the device output. TFETs operate by using quantum tunneling, a phenomenon in which particles can pass through a barrier that they would normally not have enough energy to overcome. One of the main advantages of TFETs is their ability to operate at lower voltages and power than traditional FETs, due to the ability of electrons to tunnel through the barrier with minimal energy loss  [12] . This makes them promising candidates for low-power electronics applications. However, the performance of TFETs is highly dependent on the properties of the tunnel junction, including its thickness, doping concentration, and material composition. Designing and optimizing these properties is an ongoing area of research in order to improve the performance of TFETs and unlock their full potential for low-power electronics  [11] [12] [13] . 
 Types of Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors (TFETs) There are several different structures of tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) that have been studied and developed over the years  [14] [15] . (a) Homojunction TFET: In this structure, both the source and drain are made of the same material, typically silicon. The gate voltage is applied across a p-n junction between the source and drain. Homojunction TFETs have been studied different materials, creating a heterojunction. For example, a heterojunction TFET could be made by combining silicon with a material such as germanium or III-V compounds. The gate voltage is applied across the heterojunction. Heterojunction TFETs have been shown to have improved performance compared to homojunction TFETs, particularly in terms of their ON/OFF current ratio. Heterojunction tunnel field-effect transistors (HTFETs) are a type of transistor that utilize the tunneling effect to achieve high-performance and low-power consumption. HTFETs consist of two or more different semiconductor materials (heterojunctions) that are joined together to form a junction. These junctions are designed to have a narrow bandgap, which allows electrons to tunnel through the barrier and flow between the different materials  [16] . This tunneling effect results in a steep turn-on characteristic and a high ON/OFF current ratio, making HTFETs ideal for low-power applications. The operation of HTFETs is based on the gate control of the tunneling current. When a voltage is applied to the gate, it modifies the band structure of the junction and controls the tunneling probability. By adjusting the gate voltage, the HTFET can be turned on and off, allowing for the control of the current flow. HTFETs have several advantages over traditional transistors, including high-speed performance, low-power consumption, and high reliability. They are also well-suited for use in applications such as ultralow-power circuits, digital logic, and energy harvesting devices. Heterostructure TFETs have several advantages over traditional transistors, such as a lower voltage operation, reduced leakage current, and improved ON/OFF current ratio. They are also less susceptible to short-channel effects, which can limit the performance of traditional transistors as their size decreases. 
 Fabrication of Heterojunction Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors (HTFETs) Heterojunction Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors (HTFETs) are electronic devices that use a tunneling current to turn the transistor on and off. The fabrication process for HTFETs typically involves several key steps: Substrate preparation: The first step in TFET fabrication is the preparation of a suitable substrate, typically made of silicon or other semiconductor materials. The substrate is cleaned and prepared for deposition of the various layers required for the device  [17] [18] [19] . Figure  33 .3 shows the various steps involved in the fabrication of heterojunction tunnel field-effect transistors. Epitaxial growth: Next, a layer of material with a different bandgap from the substrate is grown epitaxially on top of the substrate. This layer is typically made of a III-V semiconductor material, such as indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs), and is designed to form the channel of the HTFET. Various layers are deposited onto the substrate using techniques such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or physical vapor deposition (PVD). The layers typically include a gate oxide layer, a gate electrode layer, a source/drain layer, and a tunnel junction layer. Gate deposition: A gate dielectric layer, such as silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ), is then deposited on top of the channel layer. The gate material, typically a metal such as titanium or tungsten, is then deposited on top of the dielectric layer. Lithography: A process called lithography is then used to define the gate structure. This involves depositing a layer of photoresist on top of the gate material, patterning the photoresist using a mask, and etching the gate material using the patterned photoresist as a mask. Ohmic contact deposition: Finally, ohmic contacts are deposited on top of the source and drain regions. These contacts typically consist of a layer of metal, such as nickel or gold, that is annealed to form a low-resistance contact with the semiconductor material. Once these steps are complete, the device is tested to ensure that it meets the required specifications for its intended application. 
 Application of Heterostructure Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors Heterostructure tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) have a number of potential applications in various fields. Here are some examples.  
 Low-Power Electronics Heterostructure TFETs have the potential to replace traditional MOSFETs (metaloxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors) in low-power electronics such as mobile devices, wearables, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices. They can operate at lower voltages, reducing power consumption and extending battery life. HTFETs operate on the principle of quantum tunneling, which allows for electrons to tunnel through a barrier that would normally be impenetrable. One of the key advantages of HTFETs is their low power consumption. This is because they require very low voltage to operate, which reduces the amount of power needed to switch the transistor on and off. HTFETs can also operate at high frequencies, making them suitable for use in high-speed applications. HTFETs can be used in a variety of low-power electronics applications, including  [20] [21] : (a) Energy-efficient microprocessors: HTFETs can be used in the design of microprocessors that require less power to operate, which can help to extend battery life in portable devices such as smartphones and tablets. (b) Low-power sensors: HTFETs can be used in the design of sensors that require very low power to operate, such as environmental sensors that are used in remote locations or in places where power is limited. (c) Power amplifiers: HTFETs can be used in the design of power amplifiers that require low power to operate, such as those used in wireless communication systems. Overall, the low-power consumption and high-frequency operation of HTFETs make them a promising technology for use in a wide range of low-power electronics applications. 
 High-Frequency Electronics Heterostructure TFETs have the potential to operate at higher frequencies than traditional transistors due to their reduced capacitance and faster switching speed. This makes them suitable for applications in high-speed data communication systems and wireless networks. HTFETs can operate at very high frequencies, which makes them suitable for use in a variety of high-frequency applications. Here are some high-frequency electronics applications of HTFETs  [22] [23] : (a) High-frequency amplifiers: HTFETs can be used in the design of highfrequency amplifiers that are used in a range of applications such as wireless communication systems, radar systems, and high-speed data communication systems. HTFETs are capable of operating at frequencies in the terahertz range, which makes them well-suited for use in these applications.  
 Biosensors Heterostructure TFETs can be used as biosensors due to their high sensitivity and low noise characteristics. They can detect small changes in the concentration of biomolecules, making them useful for medical diagnostics and drug development  [24] . 
 Energy Harvesting Heterostructure TFETs can be used in energy harvesting applications to convert waste heat into usable electricity. This can be useful in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and power generation  [25] . 
 Quantum Computing Heterostructure TFETs have the potential to be used in quantum computing applications due to their ability to operate at very low temperatures and their potential for single-electron operation. 
 Conclusion Heterostructure TFETs have the potential to revolutionize various industries by offering low-power, high-speed, and high-sensitivity devices that can operate at lower voltages than traditional transistors. TFETs are a promising technology that can provide low-power solutions for a wide range of applications, including digital logic circuits, memory, and sensors. However, further research and development are needed to optimize their performance and improve their scalability for mass production. Despite their benefits, HTFETs are still a relatively new technology and face several challenges, including material compatibility and device fabrication issues. However, ongoing research is focused on addressing these challenges and further improving the performance of HTFETs for a range of applications. TFETs have some challenges that need to be overcome, such as low on-state currents, sensitivity to fabrication process variations, and limited device scalability. Understanding   
 Abstract Because of its resistance to random dopant fluctuations (RDFs) and lack of need for high thermal budgets and costly annealing techniques, the doping-less tunnel field-effect transistor (DL-TFET) is regarded as a developing TFET structure. Yet, temperature sensitivity is a key factor to consider when predicting a device's dependability since, when employed in a system, the bandgap of semiconductor material (E g ) varies as a result of temperature fluctuations. Thus, the effect of temperature changes (240-360 K) is examined in this work with regard to the linearity and RF/analog characteristics of a HJ (heterojunction), double gate (DG), doping-less (DL) TFET, throughout. Analysis of RF/analog and DC parameters like: I D À V G characteristics, I D À V D characteristics, g mtransconductance, g doutput conductance, f Tcutoff frequency, TGFtransconductance generation factor, and TFPtransconductance frequency product has been carried out using ATLAS simulation tool while taking the effect of temperature fluctuations. Also, temperature changes are taken into consideration 
 Introduction Throughout the previous two decades, CMOS technology has been in competition with TFET as a viable replacement at the nanoscale regime. TFET, however, has inferior high-frequency characteristics, low ON-state current (I ON ), and ambipolarity  [1] . To address the aforementioned TFET problems, a number of approaches have been published in the literature  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Nonetheless, TFET continues to experience fabrication-related problems such as RDFs, the need for a complicated thermal budget, and high-temperature annealing procedures  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Therefore, a doping-free TFET is described in Ref.  [13] , where p + and n + areas are induced on drain and source electrode by application of the proper work function. This overcomes the aforementioned obstacles. Nevertheless, Si-based doping-less TFET faces the same issue of meager ION as Si-TFET. Hence, numerous approaches have been described in the literature  [14] [15] [16]  to further improve the performance of DLTFET. In this regard, the authors in Ref.  [17]  had presented a Si/Ge HJ-DG-DL-TFET, in which I ON is increased by employing a Si/Ge HJ and I ON /I OFF is boosted by employing a high-k dielectric HfO 2 . The HJ-DG-DLTFET is explored by the authors across various temperature since TFETs are sensitive to temperature changes, which may impair device performance  [18] . The TFET is only minimally dependent on temperature, according to the original research  [19] . Nevertheless, the E g in the tunneling current for TFET  [20]  given as I D in Eq.  (34.1)  is what causes the TFET's temperature dependency. I D ¼ exp À4 2m ⁎ E g ⁎1:5 3eℏ E g ⁎ þ Δφ ϵ sem t ox t sem ϵ ox ð34: 1Þ where meffective mass of the carrier, ccharge on the carrier, ħreduced Planck's' constant, t ox and ϵ ox are the oxide thickness and permittivity, respectively, Δφ is the energy range across which tunneling may occur, and ϵ sem and t sem are the permittivity and thickness of the semiconductor material, respectively. Moreover, temperature has an impact on semiconductor materials' energy bandgap  [21]  and is defined by Eq. (34.2): E g T ð Þ ¼ E g 0 ð Þ À αT 2 β þ T ð34:2Þ where T represents the absolute temperature in kelvin, α and β stand for the material characteristics, and E g (0) is the energy bandgap at zero kelvin. The E g narrows and the I D rises as temperature rises  [22] . Temperature influences hence clearly in the OFF state (I OFF ), but its influence on the I ON at high V G is rather little. Band-to-band tunneling (BTBT), which has little reliance on temperature in the ON state, and SRH recombination  [23]  at low V gs , which is dominating in the OFF state, are in conflict with one other in terms of temperature influence. Also, it is necessary to assess how temperature affects HJ-DG-DLTFETs since (i) the bandgap of semiconductor materials (E g ) is temperature-dependent and (ii) higher chip densities result in higher heat dissipation, which raises the chip's operating temperature. Hence, higher operating temperature affects the operation and reliability of the on-chip system, and the device's suitability to operate well in extreme circumstances in terms of temperature has to be explored  [24] . Moreover, the examination of linearity and RF/analog figure of merits for various temperature is required because to the growing usage of transistors in different electronic controllers used in a variety of industries, including avionics and geothermal facilities  [25]  (Table  34 .1). In this research, the analog/RF performance metrics g m , g d , C gg , f T , TGF, and TFP are used to assess the dependability of the HJ-DG-DLTFET under temperaturerelated conditions and linearity parameters like VIP 2 , VIP 3 , IIP 3 , and IMD 3 . The organization of the work presented in this chapter is as follows: Section "Methodology" provides the description of the device's schematic and simulation methodology. DC performance, RF/AC parameters, and linearity parameters are discussed and evaluated in section "Results and Discussion." The conclusion is given in section "Conclusion."  
 Methodology Following the IRDS  [26] , the 2D schematic of the HJ-DG-DLTFET is presented in Fig.  34 .1. The channel length (L CH ) of the device is 50 nm, the source/drain length (L S/D ) is 100 nm, body thickness (T Si ) is 10 nm (less than Debye's length), the HfO 2 oxide layer thickness (T ox ) is 5 nm, and HfO 2 oxide layer length (L ox ) is 25 nm. Source spacer (L GS ) and drain spacer (L GD ) are 3 nm and 15 nm, respectively. Platinum electrode having work function of 5.93 eV and hafnium electrode having work function of 3.9 eV are used for P + source and N + drain region simultaneously  [13, 27] . Lower bandgap Si 1Àx Ge x is used as the source material in the proposed structure having the molar fraction of Ge (x) ¼ 0.5 to get improved I ON  [28, 29] . The dual gate metals are aluminum (M1 ¼ 3.8 eV) towards source and tin (M2 ¼ 4.3 eV) towards drain side for reduced ambipolarity. By taking into account 10 nm thickness of silicon body, quantum effects may be ignored. The proposed device is simulated using SILVACO ATLAS TCAD tool  [30] . 
 Results and Discussion This section examines the effects of temperature on the HJ-DG-DLTFET at various temperature for a number of device characteristics. Since SRH recombination predominates at low gate voltages, the TFET exhibits a significant variation with temperature in the subthreshold region of I D À V G characteristics, illustrative of an exponential relationship with temperature  [31]  as expressed in Eq.  (34.3) . R SRH ¼ pn À n i 2 r p n þ n i exp E Trap kT L þ r N p þ n i exp ÀE Trap kT L ð34: 3Þ where T L is for the lattice temperature in degrees Kelvin, while r p and r N stand for the holes and electrons lifetimes, respectively. E TRAP stands for the difference between the trap energy and intrinsic Fermi level. Low gate voltages' exponential temperature dependency of SRH recombination causes severe OFF-state current characteristics deterioration at high temperature, whereas the BTBT in the ON state, the most important current component for TFETs, predominates at high gate voltages. The effect of temperature fluctuations on the transfer and output curve of the HJ-DG-DLTFET is shown in Fig.  34 .2. In contrast to variation in I OFF , it can be shown that I ON is modified less. Drive current in the ON state is mostly BTBT-dependent rather than temperature-dependent. Nonetheless, OFF state displays significant fluctuations because the concentration of minority carriers increases exponentially with temperature  [32] . To obtain a faster switching rate, the device's I ON /I OFF ratio should be high. I ON and I OFF ought to be high and low, respectively, to achieve that. When temperature rises, I ON experiences minimal change; however, I OFF experiences a large change, which lowers current ratio as depicted in Fig.  34 .3a. As a result, at lower temperature, the current ratio is larger than on the upper side. Steeper SS and lower V TH are desirable to achieve a high-speed performance, which results in a huge fan-out and reduced power consumption. SS increases with For analog/RF and linearity applications, g m is a significant design constraint that determines the device's gain according to Eq.  (34.4) . g m ¼ @I D @V G ð34: 4Þ The increase in current drivability at high gate voltages is what causes g m to grow with V G , as illustrated in Fig.  34 .4a. Moreover, g m rises with temperature as drive current rises as a result of a narrowing bandgap with rising temperature  [33] . Additionally, greater g m is needed since it will improve the translation of input voltage to output current and results in greater cutoff frequency. The output conductance varies for different drain voltages at a constant gate voltage of 1.5 V as seen in Fig.  34 .4b. It is formulated as given in Eq. (34.5):  As can be observed in Fig.  34 .5a, which plots the C gg as a function temperature, changes in total capacitance are minimal at higher V gs . Yet, when temperature is altered from 240 K to 360 K, the quantity of C gg increases in the weak inversion zone. Figure  34 .5b shows the dependence of f T which is evaluated as in Eq. (34.6) on temperature. f T ¼ g m 2πC gg ð34:6Þ It can be seen that f T improves noticeably as the value of temperature rises from 240 K to 360 K. When temperature is adjusted from 240 K to 360 K, gm increases but C gg experiences negligible changes, which raises the f T value. One of the crucial analog factors from the perspective of a circuit is the TGF ¼ g m /I D , and in Fig.  34 .6a, TGF is depicted for the fluctuation in temperature. Although TGF changes are negligible at higher V gs , it is seen that TGF is varied significantly when temperature is increased from 240 K to 360 K at the weak inversion region. Figure  34 .6b shows the TFP ¼ (g m /I D ) Â fc which can also be de fined as (TFP ¼ TGF Â fc) as a function of temperature, and it can be seen that TFP improves significantly as temperature escalates from 240 K to 360 K. Increased values in TGF and f T when temperature is escalated are the cause of this better TFP behavior. 
 Temperature Dependence on Linearity Parameters Device with reduced noise, a high SNR, and maximal linearity performance while using less power is required in the current environment. V gs and V ds are checked for linear relationships using linearity analysis; however, current is saturated owing to charge carrier mobility, and g m decreases. We thus use the second-order and thirdorder derivative of I D to V gs , also known as g m2 and g m3 , to better comprehend the device's nonlinear behavior. g m2 ¼ @ 2 I D @ 2 V G ð34: 7Þ g m3 ¼ @ 3 I D @ 3 V G ð34: 8Þ To keep the device's behavior linear, the g m2 and g m3 should be maintained at a minimum. A balanced modulator could be used to lessen the distortion resulting from g m2 . Therefore, circuit distortion is mainly caused by g m3 . The temperature fluctuation on g m2 and g m3 is shown in Fig.  34 .7a, b. It can be seen from the results that g m2 and g m3 rise with temperature because a rise in temperature causes a high BTBT, which improves current drivability. Nevertheless, the flattening of g m2 and g m3 is related to device linearity, and therefore, their amplitude must be minimal. Therefore, linear properties deteriorate due to the increase in g m2 and g m3 with temperature. Due to g m decrease at higher V gs , the g m3 is discovered to be negative at high gate voltages. The VIP 2 response to applied V gs at various temperature is shown in Fig.  34 .8a. As defined in Eq. (34.9), VIP 2  [34]  is the extrapolated input voltage when the second-order harmonic voltage equals to the fundamental input voltage. VIP 2 ¼ 4 Â g m g m2 ð34:9Þ VIP 3 ¼ 24 Â g m g m3 ð34: 10Þ It is shown that, in line with the trend of g m2 , the peak value of VIP 2 rises with temperature at higher V gs . It has previously been mentioned that nonlinearity should be removed by minimizing the value of g m2 . Hence, a greater VIP 2 amplitude is sought to confirm a distortion-free output signal. The VIP 3 response at various temperature is shown in Fig.  34 .8b. The extrapolated input voltage known as VIP 3  [34]  is the third-order harmonic voltage equals the fundamental voltage and is evaluated as in Eq. (34.10). IIP 3 ¼ 2 3 Â g m g m3 Â R S ð34: 11Þ The IIP 3 response to gate voltage at various temperature is shown in Fig.  34 .9a. IIP 3 is expressed as in Eq.  (34.11) . It can be concluded that IIP 3 exhibits significant fluctuations with temperature escalation at low V gs ; however, these variations vanish at higher V gs . The IMD 3 response to various temperature is shown in Fig.  34 .9b. To improve system linearity and reduce signal distortion, IMD 3 must be minimal  [35] . There is a significant variation in IMD 3 for low V gs , and it rises with rising temperature from 240 K to 360 K. IMD 3 ¼ 4:5 ⁎ VIP 2 3 ⁎ g m3 2 ⁎ R s ð34:12Þ 
 Conclusion This study reported a simulation-based exploration on RF/analog and linearity FoMs in HJ-DG-DLTFET by increasing temperature from 240 K to 360 K with steps of 30 K. The simulation's findings indicate that the device bias affects how much the device rely on temperature. The predominance of SRH recombination at lower V gs , which has exponential dependency on temperature, causes temperature influence to be significant below the threshold area, while BTBT phenomenon predominates beyond the threshold regime which exhibits a moderate temperature dependency and therefore, slightly affects drain current. Using important FoMs such as C gg , g m , g d , f T , and TFP to analyze RF/AC performance, we discovered that these parameters increased with an increase in temperature. Moreover, we looked qualitatively at the linearity behavior of HJ-DG-DLTFET with respect to temperature for several FoMs, including g m2 , g m3 , VIP 2 , VIP 3 , IIP 3 , and IMD 3 .

 Introduction The advancement in methods and systems for detection of biomolecules essential to human health, agriculture, and the environment has received significant attention during the past few decades  [1] [2] [3] [4] . The primary prerequisite for detecting biomolecule is a highly sensitive, selective, quick, reliable, and compact sensing system. A biosensor and an appropriate readout unit are the two main components of a biosensing system. A biosensor typically consists of transducer and bio-recognition components. The bioreceptor and biotarget interact during the bio-recognition process. A transducer transforms the biotarget-bioreceptor interaction into a quantifiable output signal proportional to the interaction. The label-based and label-free detection of the target analyte is the basis for the characterization of many types of biosensors  [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Label-free electrochemical biosensors in particular are very appealing since they have the potential to perform real-time electrical detection while using less power. Along with being scalable, light, sensitive, and affordable, these electrochemical biosensors also permit the assimilation of sensor and measurement systems on the same chip  [15] . Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology is viewed as the best option among the alternatives for on-chip integration because of its scalability, affordability, robustness, maturity, and ease of production  [10, 15] . The scalability provided by CMOS technology is extremely fascinating because it allows for the easy integration of nanoelectronics and biology by making the size scale of nanostructures equivalent to biomolecules. Proteins, nucleic acids, tiny molecules, and viruses are just a few of the biological entities that CMOScompatible biosensors can identify  [10] . This chapter discusses the transistor-based biosensor's current state, its components, detecting methods, and electrical characterization for label-free detection. 
 Biosensor As reported by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), a biosensor is an autonomous consolidated device which provides precise analytical data whenever a biological specimen is chosen to take in direct spatial interaction with a transduction element using a biological recognition element (bioreceptor)  [5] . Alternatively put, a biosensor is used to determine the presence of biological samples (like human samples, food samples, environmental samples, biomolecules, proteins, DNA, etc.) by transforming its engagement with the analyte into a specific and measurable output signal  [6] . 
 Elements of a Biosensing System A typical biosensing system, as shown in Fig.  35 .1, comprises of three main parts, as discussed below  [7] [8] [9] . Bioreceptor, which is the component of bio-recognition, binds to the target molecule directly and serves as the location for a particular biological event  [10] . Antigens, antibodies, amino acids, bacteria, organelles, and proteins are a few examples of bioreceptors. Transducer generates a comparable output response from the analyte-bioreceptor interaction. The output signal might be mechanical, optical, thermal, electrical, etc., based on the transduction method  [5] . Readout Unit is made up of signaling amplifiers, processors, filters, and display units, to identify the signal from the transducer  [10, 11, 5, 9] . This device's  
 Techniques for Detection Based on the detection methods, biosensors may be generally divided into two groups. 
 Labeled Detection 2. Label-Free Detection A label is an external element that is chemically or momentarily linked to the target analyte for bio-recognition  [6, 13, 14] . The precise characteristics of the label will determine the analyte it is detected. The labeled detection approach is shown in Fig.  35 .3a, in which the main bioreceptor (primary antibody) binds the target analyte (antigen), and the target analyte is then detected using the secondary bioreceptor. This technique reduces false positives since it gives twofold confirmation of the analyte's existence. However, because of the strict requirements of labeling and purification procedures, labeled detections are not suited for real-time sensing The most used method for detecting biological molecules is label-free detection. Label-free detection does not need a secondary entity during biorecognition, in contrast to labeled detection  [15, 16] . Figure  35 .3b illustrates label-free detection, which bypasses the drawbacks of labeled detection techniques by using the main antibody to directly detect the antigen. Optical, mass spectrometric, acoustic wave, and electrochemical biosensors are a few biosensors with label-free detections. This chapter is mainly concerned with the label-free electrochemical sensor, which is covered in the section below. Also for the detecting procedure, it is expected that the environment is dry, as the studies carried out in dry circumstances indicated a wider variation in the I D and higher sensitivity. Biosensors are used widely in applications today, including biomolecular analysis, medical diagnosis, medication development, process and quality assurance, etc., as seen in Fig.  35 .4. The worldwide market for electrochemical biosensors is foreseen to expand by compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.0% from 2022 to 2030  [18] . Figure  35 .5 displays the revenue as a proportion of the global biosensor  
 Performance Metrics for Biosensors Specific performance criteria are necessary to assess the performance of biosensor. These performance indicators also make it possible to compare different biosensors. The following list includes some of the crucial performance indicators for tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET)-based electrochemical biosensors. 1. Sensitivity: It is the lowest concentration of analyte which biosensor can detect  [19] [20] [21] . Biosensor is necessary in a variety of applications to confirm the existence of remnants of analytes in a sample at analyte concentrations as low as fg/ml. For instance, prostate cancer is linked to blood levels of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 4 ng/ml, for which physicians recommend biopsy procedures  [22] . Correspondingly, sensitivity is thought to be a key characteristic of a biosensor. 2. Selectivity: It is the ability to identify a particular analyte in a sample that contains various mixtures and contaminants  [11, 20] . The association of an antigen and an antibody is the finest illustration of selectivity. 3. Stability: It refers to how susceptible biosensor is to disturbances within and outside of it. A sensor under measurement may experience a drift in its output signals as a result of these disruptions. This may result in a compromise with precision and accuracy  [23, 24] . 4. Reproducibility: It is the ability to provide the same results under similar testing conditions. When a sample is tested more than once, accuracy refers to the sensor's capacity to offer mean value closer to real value while the capacity of a sensor to consistently provide the same results is known as precision  [25] . 5. Linearity: It is the property that demonstrates the accuracy of the measured response to a straight line for a set of measurements with various analyte  This chapter focuses on the research and analysis of label-free electrochemical biosensors based on dielectric-modulated TFETs, in which the interaction of biomolecules with TFETs is transformed into observable changes in the electrical parameters threshold voltage, drain current, etc. 
 Types of Sensing Mechanism in Biosensors Open Gate/Ion-Sensitive Gate Mechanism The current CMOS technologies are very reliable, well-tuned, and capable of significant scaling and operation at low power, creating a suitable technology for portable sensing devices. The ion-sensitive FET (ISFET), developed in the 1970s for pH monitoring (H + ion concentration), was the initial electric FET sensor for sensing charged molecules  [29] . The metal gate electrode in a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) is changed by a series of dielectric layer, electrolyte, and reference electrode in an ISFET, which is one physical difference from a MOS. As illustrated in Fig.  35 .7a, it essentially comprises of silicon substrate with two n-doped areas (source and drain) segregated by a brief channel enclosed by the gate dielectric layer that serves as sensing layer. The idea behind how ISFET-based sensors work is that the supply of positive gate potential, which is produced upon detecting the precise ion concentration, modulates the drain current. It is possible to translate changes in drain current into changes in ion concentration. It is evident that an ISFET combines an amplifier and a sensing surface into a single component to produce an output with a high current and low impedance value. Although the ISFET biosensor has high sensitivity for charged biomolecules, it is not appropriate for neutral species. The DM-FET biosensor, which uses cavities in the gate oxide as biomolecule sensing sites, was developed to address this shortcoming of ISFET biosensors.  
 Dielectric Modulation Mechanism The idea of using cavity as the biosensing material in a DMFET has received a lot of interest due to its quick response, reduced price, and real-time sensing capabilities. The cavity in biosensors is the space, measured in nanometers, that is created in the midst of two electrodes, the gate and gate oxide. The biosensing devices may be split into planar and vertical devices based on cavity formation. Devices made utilizing methods like lithography that have a planar cavity (i.e., electrodes are separated horizontally) are unable to offer high throughput. On the other hand, devices with vertical cavities that were created using wet etching or thin-film deposition methods (i.e., electrodes that were vertically positioned) are frequently favored due to their excellent sensitivity and controllable thickness. The electrical characteristics of the device like drain current (I D ) and threshold voltage (V TH ) change when biomolecules are put into the created cavity because they enhance the gate capacitance in comparison to the empty cavity (air), as shown in Fig.  35 .7b. Nanogap-embedded dielectric modulated FETs were fabricated, functionalized, and utilized to detect the influenza virus, DNA, and biotin  [11, 30, 31] . 
 Extended Gate Mechanism Extended gate FET is the most universal BioFET design, resembling both the coated wire and the traditional ISFET  [48] . The simplicity of separating wet and dry areas, which makes sensing easier, is one of these structures' main benefits. In such systems, just the segregated off-chip sensing pad is dipped in the solution since the sensing regions extend off the chip. This simplifies not just the device construction process but also, perhaps more crucially, the functionalization stages that follow, which may now be separately created from the transduction device. Even if the scalability is sufficient for a few in situ measurements, the connections between the electrical and sensing pads cannot be produced using printed circuit board (PCB) technologies as tidily as with a general CMOS process. According to reports, EG-BioFETs are used to measure extracellular K + concentration, BHV-1 antibodies, pH, ELISA (electrical enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and more  [32] [33] [34] [35] .  
 MOSFET Innovation for Biosensing Applications Due to its high sensitivity, less power consumption, compatibility with CMOS technology, and ease of fabrication, metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) has demonstrated potential uses for label-free electrical detection of molecules with the fast development in nano-bioelectronics. The effective dielectric value and electrical charge on the gate of a MOS device is altered by the incorporation of molecules inside cavity or electrolyte in gate region, ensuing a variation in electrical behavior of device. Both charged and neutral biomolecules may be detected by MOSFET-based biosensors. 
 MOSFET-Based Electrical Biomolecule Detection Below is a description of the generalized strategy used for detection of biomolecules employing MOSFET 1. A bioreceptor that binds specifically the target biomolecule is functionalized on the top surface of the MOSFET (ideally the gate oxide) (biotarget). 2. The electrical characteristics of the MOSFET, such as electric potential, channel electron concentrations, conduction current, etc., are altered by the interaction of the biotarget with the bioreceptor. These electrical property variations resemble the modifications brought on by the introduction of an external V gs . 3. After a biomolecule binds to a bioreceptor, the MOSFET's electrical conductivity changes to a certain extent, which may be utilized to detect the biomolecules. 4. A large platform for the simultaneous detection of many biomolecules may be provided by the integration of a matrix of FETs functionalized using various surface receptors. 
 TFET-Based Label-Free Biosensor FET-based biosensors were first used for the sensing of biomolecules, because they allow label-free detection, have lower price, allow on-chip integration, and are compatible with a variety of biomolecules. But the inability to recognize charged biomolecules is the drawback of FET biosensors. This drawback was addressed by MOSFET-based biosensors, because they can detect both neutral and charged biomolecules. However, the issue was that at room temperature, subthreshold swing (SS) is restricted to 60 mV/decade and miniaturization causes a number of SCEs. It is found that TFET-based biosensors are the best-suited substitute for MOSFETs because of lower I OFF , more resistant to short channel effects, and SS < 60 mV/dec. Therefore, this chapter focuses on the research and analysis of label-free electrochemical biosensors based on dielectric-modulated tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs), in which the interaction of biomolecules with TFETs is transformed into an observable variation in electrical parameters like threshold voltage V TH , drain current I D , I ON /I OFF ratio, etc. 
 TFET Basic Principle of Operation This section discusses tunnel FETs (TFETs), their operation, and the criteria for sub-60 mV/decade steepness. TFETs have a similar device structure to MOSFETs. The source region's doping makes the biggest difference. In the source-channel-drain regions of an N-type MOSFET, n-i-n doping is present. An N-type TFET, however, possesses p-i-n doping. Although MOSFETs and TFETs have similar device structures, they operate on totally different principles. The gate of a MOSFET regulates the thermionic potential barrier and turns the component ON or OFF. The thermally produced carriers are dispersed according to the Boltzmann distribution at the source area, and the resultant current may be written as follows:  when a positive drain voltage (V DS > 0) is provided. The band-to-band tunneling current (I BTBT ) in tunneling transistors is highly dependent on the carrier's interband tunneling transmission probability. The Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin (WKB) approximation may be used to compute this barrier and can be used to estimate it using a triangular potential  [36, 14] . I Thermionic ≌ exp V GS ηV T ð35 I BTBT / T WKB Tunneling ¼ exp À 4λE 3 2 g 2m ⁎ p 3qħ Δφ þ E g ð35: 2Þ where m ⁎ is the effective tunneling mass, E g is the bandgap, and △ϕ is the energy window where tunneling is feasible and λ is screened tunnel length given by λ ¼ ϵ s ϵ ox t s t ox ð35:3Þ The energy bands of the channel are pushed up during the negative gate voltage (V GS < 0), which causes an overlap between the channel's and the drain's VB and CB and a small tunneling barrier at the D/C junction. By using the same BTBT method, the positive voltage at the drain pulls electrons from the source via the channel. This trait is known as ambipolarity, and the current acquired with a negative V GS is known as ambipolar current (I AMB ) since the device conducts for both gate polarities as shown in Fig.  35 .9c. Although TFETs are seen to be promising options for low-power operations, a noticeable decline in the device's performance is seen as a result of the ambipolar effect. The tunneling barrier at the D/C junction can be expanded to reduce ambipolarity by having asymmetric doping concentration of source and drain profile. Additionally, adding an underlap at the D/C junction may help to reduce ambipolar conduction  [37] [38] [39] . A MOSFET's subthreshold swing (SS) is constrained by the diffusion current, and in an ideal device, the minimal swing is given as which, at room temperature (300 K), is around 60 mV/dec. Since the conduction mechanism is determined by BTBT process instead of creation of an inversion channel, a TFET does not face the same physical restriction. The subthreshold slope for a TFET may be written in terms of (V GS ) as starting from Hurkx's BTBT model  [40] , which is used in Silvaco Atlas. SS TFET ¼ V 2 gs 5:75 V gs þ Const mV=dec ð35: 5Þ where the specifications of the device and the material determine the constant. Since TFETs, unlike MOSFETs, do not have a bound on SS, therefore, V DD in TFETs can theoretically be lower than 0.5 V, which would minimize power consumption. A comparison of the TFET's transfer properties and those of various MOSFET device architectures is presented in Fig.  35 .10. It is seen that TFET has a better subthreshold swing (SS) than MOSFETs. However, compared to the ITRS requirements, the I ON associated with TFETs is much lower. 
 Operation of Dielectric Modulated TFET-Based Biosensor The gate dielectric area has to immobilize the biomolecules. A cavity in the dielectric layer is needed in order to do this. The target biomolecules are intended to occupy and immobilize in the structure's cavity area. The cavity was made in the oxide layer underneath the gate electrode. The device sees a change in the oxide's dielectric constant once the biomolecules are stabilized because of their dielectric value. The modification in the dielectric constant (k) in the device's gate dielectric area is known as "dielectric modulation" in TFET devices. The effective coupling between the gate Fig.  35 .  10  The comparison and analysis between TFETs, MOSFETs, and other semiconductor devices  [41]  and oxide layer changes due to the change in dielectric constant in such a manner that the channel's energy bands begin to bend. This leads to a shift in the effective tunneling length, which causes the drain current to drift. The primary benefit of DM TFET is its ability to identify both charged and neutral biomolecules (Fig.  35.11) . Charge Plasma TFET Label-Free Biosensor Source and drain areas are developed utilizing charge plasma approach of virtual doping, which frees the device from the traditional high-temperature ion implantation procedure of doping. By using work function engineering, large charge carrier densities are concurrently induced in source and drain areas, giving resistance to fluctuations in process temperature voltage (PVT). The proposed device's production process difficulty and thermal budget are greatly reduced via virtual doping. RDFs may cause unpredictable V TH changes in a variety of devices especially when generated commercially on a big scale. According to the virtual doping charge plasma idea, the S/D electrode material must be selected such that ϕ source > χ Si þ E g 2q ð35:6Þ ϕ drain < χ Si þ E g 2q ð35:7Þ where Φ S/D , Φ Si , and E g represent the respective work functions of the S/D electrode, silicon, and energy bandgap, respectively. Additionally, device layer thickness should not be greater than the Debye length L D .  when using a control gate and polarity gate with an appropriate work function over intrinsic silicon to create the p-i-n structure. To allow dielectric modulation, a cavity is created below the control gate for the immobilization of biomolecules. The device's performance is improved by the junction's absence due to the elimination of problems such as RDFs. L D ¼ ϵ Si Â V T q Â N ð35 Singh et al.  [43]  for the first time proposed the charge plasma approach to creating a DM junctionless TFET biosensor. The achievable abruptness at the source-channel junction determines a TFET's performance. Since silicon's solubility limit prevents further doping and makes abrupt junction profiles difficult to construct, therefore, the development of abruptness at the junction is solved more simply by the charge plasma formation approach. This approach helps in lowering the complexity and expense of nanoscale device fabrication. By depositing platinum (work function ¼ 5.93 eV) and hafnium (work function ¼ 3.9 eV) materials over the silicon body, respectively, the p + source and n + drain areas of the DM-JLTFET are formed. Anand et al.  [44]  reported a charge plasma-based DLDGTFET (doping-less double gate tunnel FET) biosensor for the identification of biomolecules. In order to elude physical doping and lower the cost of the annealing process, the charge plasma approach is employed in DLDGTFET to produce source (p + ) and drain (n + ) regions across the silicon body  [12] . This eliminates abrupt junctions between the S/C and D/C regions, significantly simplifying the DLDGTFET fabrication process. Mahalamxi et al.  [45]  for the first time utilized the bipolar nature of TFET for the identification of biomolecules. Detection of biomolecules is done in both the ON and ambipolar states. Cavities at both tunneling junctions allow for the simultaneous detection of many biomolecule types. Gate work function engineering has been used to reduce I OFF while higher I ON is achieved using a high-k gate dielectric. Patil et al.  [46]  reported a charge plasma TFET-based biosensor having cavity on the source. Cavity is created on the source area close to the tunneling junction so as to combat solid solubility limit. It will also enhance the carrier concentration within channel. The reported sensor is capable of efficiently sensing charged as well as neutral biomolecules. When a biomolecule is immobilized in a nanogap, the oxide capacitance C ox changes, and the electrical characteristics are affected. Kumar et al.  [47]  presented a biosensor for the label-free detection of biomolecules based on dual channel trench gate TFET (DM-DCTGTFET). Two channels are formed on every side of gate as a consequence of the gate's vertical placement in a trench. The simultaneous conductivity of two channels increases the current. When compared to the latest TFET-based biosensors that have been reported, the structure exhibits far higher voltage and current sensitivity. 
 Conclusion The remarkable benefits and varied uses of biosensors in real-time applications above traditional assays emphasize the practical potential of biosensors. The development of efficient and profitable biosensors may be facilitated by selecting the detection approach and selecting one of the several immobilization strategies based on the nature and characteristics of the sensor surface. The development of tunnel field-effect transistor-based biosensors is presented in this chapter. This chapter emphasizes the use of MOSFET in the realization of label-free electrochemical biosensors, starting with the principles of a biosensor through the advancements and trends in biosensors. The idea and application of ISFET and DM-FET are also explored, along with a thorough survey of the literature on charge plasma TFET biosensors. It explains the fundamental operation of a lateral tunneling-based TFET biosensor. 
 Introduction Continuous complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) scaling controls and sustains the innovations that are possible in CMOS technology and guaranteeing high functionality, high device drive, and low power consumptionthree key elements for the advancement of electronics. But scaling, though enhancing the device performance, leads to undesirable SCE effects, with predominant device degrading effects like threshold voltage changes, drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL), subthreshold leakage current, decrease of subthreshold slope, increase in OFF current, etc. In addition, downscaling of device dimensions leads to a reduction in voltage level and the gate oxide thickness. This roots to an increase in static power consumption, which ultimately affects the circuit operation. Though tremendous benefits of downscaling like high packing density, low power consumption, higher switching speed cannot be denied, keen focus must be thrown on suppressing SCEs through novel device architectures. 
 Work Function Engineering In a semiconductor fabrication, work function engineering is a technique used to modify the work function of a material. Work function is the minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from a material and is a crucial parameter in determining the electrical properties of a semiconductor device. Work function engineering is used to improve the performance of semiconductor devices by modifying the work function of the materials used in their construction. Metal gate engineering is one technique of work function engineering which involves the use of a metal gate electrode instead of a traditional polysilicon gate electrode in FET devices. The metal gate electrode can be chosen to have a work function that is better suited to the semiconductor material used in the device, resulting in improved device efficiency and reduced power consumption. The work function Φ is defined as the energy difference between the Fermi energy and the vacuum level. Work function is a property of a material, which is defined as the minimum quantity of energy which is required to remove an electron to infinity from the surface of a given solid. The work function is sensitive to the doping level at the surface of the semiconductor. Since the doping at the surface can also be controlled by electric fields, the work function of a semiconductor is also sensitive to the electric field in the vacuum, where electrical conductivity (EC) is taken at the surface. Figure  36 .1 shows the plot of electron energy levels against position in a goldvacuum-aluminum system. The two metals are in complete thermodynamic equilibrium, but the vacuum electrostatic potential ϕ is not flat due to a difference in work function. The work function is important in the theory of thermionic emission, where thermal fluctuations provide enough energy to "evaporate" electrons out of a hot material (called the "emitter") into the vacuum. The work function of platinum is the highest while it is the lowest for cesium. The work function for platinum is 5.65 eV. The work function for cesium is 2.14 eV. Different metals have different values of work function because of difference in their electronegativity. 
 Twin Material Surrounding Gate Tunnel FET (TMSGTFET) for Diminished SCEs Device Structure The quantum tunneling barrier of TFETs draws attention. When you switch on the gadget, the carriers tunnel through the barrier, causing current to flow from source to drain. The presence of the barrier during the OFF condition keeps the OFF current extremely low in the femtoampere range, which is much lower than the OFF current in conventional MOSFETs. The quantum tunneling barrier of TFETs draws attention. When you switch on the gadget, the carriers tunnel through the barrier, causing  
 Analytical Modeling of Surface Potential Because of the suggested structure's cylindrical symmetry, a cylindrical coordinate system with a radial direction r and a horizontal direction z is adopted. Because of the symmetry of the device construction, the potential and electric field exhibit no changes with regard to the angle along the radial direction. As a result, a two-dimensional analysis is enough  [3, 6, 7]  for simulating the suggested structure. Using the parabolic approximation approach, the surface potential, lateral electric field, vertical electric field, and drain current of a dual material surrounding gate TFET are calculated analytically. The equations for surface potential for three regions are obtained by solving the second-order differential equations.  ϕ s1 z ð Þ ¼ C 1 e λx þ D 1 e Àλx þ P 1 λ 2 , 0 z L 1 ϕ s2 z ð Þ ¼ C 2 e λx þ D 2 e Àλx þ P 2 λ 2 , L 1 z L 1 þ L 2 
 Analytical Modeling of Electric Field The electric field in a TFET is required for both the device's functioning and reliability. This gadget has two electric field components: lateral electric field (Ez) and vertical electric field (Ve) (Er). Both components contribute to today's generation. The gate voltage induces electric field and produces two components. The vertical electric field and hence the entire electric field are adjusted as a result of work function engineering. As a result, the device's performance has significantly enhanced. The electric field distribution is obtained by differentiating the surface potential obtained and the lateral electric field (Ez) may be: E z1 ¼ @ϕ s1 r, z ð Þ @z ¼ λ C 1 e λZ À D 1 e ÀλZ þ ψ G1 E z2 ¼ @ϕ s2 r, z ð Þ @z ¼ λ C 2 e λ ZÀL 1 ð Þ À D 2 e Àλ ZÀL 1 ð Þ þ ψ G2 
 Analytical Modeling of Drain Current The drain current I d is based on electron band-to-band tunneling and is calculated by integrating the band-to-band generation rate G btbt over the volume of the device. I d ¼ q G btbt dv Figure  36 .3 depicts the computed and simulated surface potential profiles of the suggested structure for V gs ¼ 0.1 V, 0.2 V, and 0.3 V. The potential changes near and across connections, but it is almost constant in the silicon body's center. The potential profile of the TMSGTFET changes in two steps along the channel, revealing the decreased drain control over the channel. As shown in the image, the shortchannel effects are significantly decreased in the TMSGTFET. Furthermore, the simulated findings correlate well with the computed values. Figure  36 .4 depicts the fluctuation of the surface potential profile throughout the channel for different L1:L2 ratios with V ds ¼ 0.1 V and V gs ¼ 0.1 V. The step profile shifts proportionately to changes in the length ratio. The computed findings correlate well with the simulated outcomes. Figure  36 .5 depicts the computed and simulated lateral electric field distribution for various gate voltage levels. The electric field is critical to the device's operation and dependability. When the device is turned on, the fluctuations in potential are focused around the tunneling junction, resulting in the peak electric field at this location. The lateral electric field distribution is influenced by the drain-to-source bias. Increases in V ds create a significant increase in the lateral electric field, reducing drain control over the channel  [8] [9] [10] . The agreement between the analytical and simulated findings is excellent. Figure  36 .6 depicts the changes in vertical field distribution as the drain-to-source bias varies. The figure clearly shows that high drain voltage has no effect on the source field under gate material M1 with a low work function. At the drain end, the peak electric field is also minimal. This can be interpreted as less heat carrier effect at the drain end. The simulation results confirm the suggested model's validity. The vertical electric field distribution along the channel length for various gate biases is shown in Fig.  36 .7. The gate bias has a significant effect on the potential in the silicon body, increasing the field across the tunneling junction. The vertical electric field component (Er) determines tunneling likelihood and hence drive current  [8] [9] [10] [11] . The gate-to-source voltage adds to the device's vertical electric field. As the voltage supplied to the gate rises, a strong vertical electric field is created at the source-channel junction. The graphic depicts a higher peak at the tunneling junction. As a result, the highest vertical electric field is always present at the tunneling junction, resulting in the shortest tunneling barrier width between the source and the intrinsic channel. This results in a higher ON current. However, because their levels at the junction edge are virtually identical, both components of the electric field (Ez and Er) contribute to current production. Figure  36 .8 depicts the computed and simulated drain current values for various gate biases with V ds ¼ 0.6 V, 0.8 V, and 1.0 V. The energy bands in the intrinsic area are pushed down by the positive gate voltage, and tunneling occurs between the valence band of the p þ region and the conduction band of the intrinsic region. An extremely strong electric field is formed, resulting in a high I ON . For negative gate voltages, the device functions as a p-type TFET. The energy bands in the intrinsic area beneath the gate are lifted, and band-to-band tunneling occurs between the intrinsic region's valence band and the n þ region's conduction band. The output characteristics of the twin material SGTFET are shown in Fig.  36 .9 for V gs ¼ 0.8 V, 1.0 V, and 1.2 V. When V ds is raised, a higher drain voltage occurs at the tunneling junction, causing the barrier to fall. The channel resistance rises, and the drain potential has no effect on the tunneling barrier width on the source side. As a result, the drain current becomes saturated. Furthermore, the choice of relatively low work function material on the source side narrows the tunneling width, which enhances the ON current. The model's predictions are in perfect accord with the simulation findings.

 Analytical Modeling of Electric Field The electric field of the tunnel FET is playing a vital role to both the operation and reliability of the device. In this device, there are two electric fields, namely lateral electric field and vertical electric field. The gate voltage-induced vertical field and the drain voltage-induced lateral field contribute the overall electric field. Due to work function engineering, the vertical electric field is altered and subsequently the overall electric field  [5, [11] [12] [13] . Hence, the device performance is considerably improved. Figure  36 .11 shows both calculated surface potential profile and simulated surface potential profile of the proposed structure in comparison with the dual material surrounding gate TFET with V ds ¼ 0.1 V and V gs ¼ 0.3 V. The potential varies near or across the junctions, but it is constant in the middle of the silicon body. There are two-step changes in the potential profile of TMSGTFET along the channel at the interface of metal M1 and M2, and M2 and M3, which reveals the reduced drain control over the channel. The short-channel effects are thus suppressed more noticeably than the DMSGTFET as evident from the figure. Figure  36 .12 shows the variation of surface potential profile for various ratios of L1:L2:L3 along the channel with V ds ¼ 0.1 V and V gs ¼ 0.3 V. There is a shift in the step profile proportionally to the changes in the length ratio, at the interface of metal M1 and M2, and M2 and M3. The potential changes near or across the junctions and constant in the middle of the silicon body. A good agreement is seen between the calculated results.  junction, resulting in the shortest tunneling barrier width between the source and the intrinsic channel. This results in a higher ON current. However, because their levels at the junction edge are comparable, both components of the electric field (Ez and Er) contribute to current production. The comparative findings for twin material and triple material surrounding gate tunnel FETs are depicted. Figure  36 .16 depicts the vertical field distribution of the proposed structure for various gate oxide thickness values (t ox ). The graphic shows how lowering the thickness of the gate oxide can enhance the vertical electric field. However, t ox scaling has a physical limit for desirable properties.   
 Channel Engineering The channel region is the area between the source and drain regions of a transistor, and it is responsible for the control of current flow through the device. Channel engineering is used to enhance the device performance by modifying the properties of channel region by introducing the impurities into the channel region or by changing the composition of the channel region. One common technique is halo doping that is adding impurities such as boron or phosphorous can increase or decrease the conductivity of the channel region depending on the type of impurity and the concentration used. Another technique used is strain engineering. It involves applying mechanical stress to the channel region to modify its electrical properties. This is done by growing the semiconductor material on a substrate with a different lattice constant or by depositing a layer of material on top of the channel region that is under tension or compression. 
 Dual Material Surrounding Gate Tunnel FET with Halo Doping Device Structure The cross-sectional view of the twin material surrounding gate TFET with halo doping is represented in Fig.  36 .20. The dual material surrounding gate TFET is made up of two gate materials with distinct work functions. Halo doping is used for Figure  36 .21 depicts the surface potential distributions of twin material SGTFET with halo, SGTFET with halo and triple material SGTFET at various gate-to-source voltages V gs along the channel. It is evident that when the gate-to-source bias voltage increases, the potential in the source region rises noticeably, reducing short-channel effects and significantly improving current driving performance  [18] [19] [20] . The height of the steps will rise as the halo doping and thickness of the oxide and silicon layers increase. As a result, it is inferred that the gate-to-source bias voltage has a significant influence on the tunneling generation rate at the source, and that step shaping of the potential profile affects channel drain control. Figure  36 .22 depicts the predicted and simulated lateral electric field distribution of an H-DMSGTFET for various gate voltage levels. The electric field is critical to the device's operation and dependability. The lateral electric field distribution is influenced by the drain-to-source bias. Increases in V ds create a significant increase in the lateral electric field, reducing drain control over the channel. In addition, the figure demonstrates a drop in the electric field around the halo border in HDMSGTFET when compared to H-SGTFET and DMSGTFET. This guarantees that the carrier acceleration in H-DMSGTFET is enhanced. As a result, current driving capability is enhanced. Furthermore, the electric field peak near the drain end of the twin material SGTFET with halo doping is smaller than that of the DMSGTFET and H-SGTFET, ensuring greater suppression of hot carrier effects.  The vertical electric field distribution of a twin material SGTFET with halo for varied gate-to-source bias voltages is shown in Fig.  36 .23. The gate-to-source voltage adds to the device's vertical electric field. As the voltage supplied to the gate rises, a strong vertical electric field is created at the source-channel junction  [21] [22] [23] . As a result, the tunneling junction has the greatest vertical electric field. The strong electric field causes the tunneling barrier width between the source and the intrinsic channel to be as small as possible, resulting in increased drain current. Furthermore, the peak electric field is low at the drain end, indicating a reduced hot carrier effect at the drain end. The comparison findings suggest that H-DMSGTFET performs better. The transfer characteristics of the proposed device twin material SGTFET with halo doping are shown in Fig.  36 .24. The figure shows that leakage current is greatly reduced in the suggested structure, indicating that SCE is suppressed. The energy bands in the intrinsic area are pushed down by the positive gate voltage, and tunneling occurs between the valence band of the p þ region and the conduction band of the intrinsic region. An extremely strong electric field is formed, resulting in a high I ON . Figure  36 .25 depicts the I d versus V ds characteristics of DMSGTFET for V gs ¼ 0.8 V, 1.0 V, and 1.2 V. The barrier is lowered when V ds increases. The channel resistance rises, resulting in drain current saturation  [24] [25] [26] . The model's predictions are in perfect accord with the simulation findings. The comparison results ensure that the proposed structure has better drain characteristics.  With the halo-doped triple material gate structure, the model is divided into four regions: region 1 with a halo implant inserted in gate material M1, region 2 with a halo implant inserted in gate material M1, region 3 with a halo implant inserted in gate material M2, and region 4 with a halo implant inserted in gate material M3. Analytical modeling is carried out by examining several equations for four areas. The charge carriers' and fixed oxide charges' effects on the channel area are neglected  [27] [28] [29] [30] . The potential profile is assumed to be parabolic along the z-axis, and the two-dimensional cylindrical coordinates are used. The potential distribution Poisson's equation is given by, 1 r @ @r r@ϕ j r, z ð Þ @r þ @ 2 ϕ j r, z ð Þ @Z 2 ¼ qN A e si L jÀ1 z L j , 0 r t si 2 , j ¼ 1, 2, 3, 4 where ε si is the silicon pillar's dielectric constant,  N 1 ¼ N h and N 2 ¼ N 3 ¼ N 4 ¼ N c , L 0 ¼ 0, L 1 ¼ L h , L 2 ¼ L À L ch , L 4 ¼ L, ϕ j r, z ð Þ ¼ C j0 z ð Þ þ C j1 z ð Þr þ C j2 z ð Þr 2 where C jo (z), C j1 (z), and C j2 (z) are the arbitrary coefficients which is function of z only.

 Analytical Modeling of Electric Field The charge carrier transport velocity along the channel can be calculated using electric field distribution.

 Analytical Modeling of Drain Current An astonishing feature of TFETs is its built-in tunnel barrier. TFET is a semiconductor device in which the gate controls the source-drain current through modulation of BTBT. The electron tunneling from source region to intrinsic channel region is based on generation rate G btbt . There are various models available in TCAD simulator to simulate the BTBT tunneling. In this work, Kane's model is used to estimate the BTB generation rate by considering both the lateral and vertical electric field distributions into account. The average value of electric field depends on the tunneling path. The lateral electric field is assumed to be nonuniform along the junction of source and channel. G btbt ¼ A kane E j j 2 E g exp À B kane E 3 2 g E j j The electric field intensity E is expressed as E j j ¼ E 2 r þ E 2 zj ; j ¼ 1, 2, 3, 4 A kane ¼ 3.5 Â 10 21 m À1 /2 V À5 /2 S À1 and B kane ¼ 22.5 Â 10 6 V/cm are default Kane's model parameters. The drain current I ds is derived using Kane's model after being modeled on electron BTB tunneling. This model includes factors such as electron barrier tunneling, hole barrier tunneling, electron density, and hole density. Lastly, I ds is calculated by integrating the tunneling generation rate G btbt over the dimensions of the H-SGTMTFET structure. I ds ¼ q G btbt dV The proposed halo-doped device comprises three gate materials with dissimilar work functions as well as halo doping. Using the generated analytical models, the performance of the TMSGTFET with halo is assessed in terms of potential distribution at the surface, lateral direction electric field or electric field (lateral), vertical direction electric field distribution, and drain current. To model the device characteristics, a two-dimensional device simulator (TCAD Sentaurus) is utilized. For TCAD simulation of the device, the Shockley-Read-Hall carrier recombination, concentration-and field-dependent mobility model, and Boltzmann statistics were used  [31] . Kane's model is used to compute BTBT current. The application of halo doping, together with the different work functions of the gate materials, induces greater band bending at the source side, resulting in a shorter tunneling route. The work function on the source side is purposely designed to be the lowest (ϕ M1 ) value and the greatest (ϕ M3 ) value. This results in an appropriate barrier that can be adjusted by the gate applied bias. The greater work function at the drain side commences the filtering action and considerably reduces the DIBL impact. The source (S) and channel area interface has commenced effective tunneling, and the drive current has been improved. The researched TMSGTFET with halo has better electrical properties than its rivals. The model is initially tested using a 90-nm channel length. Figure  36 .27 depicts the effect of different halo lengths (10 nm, 15 nm, and 20 nm) on the surface potential profile of the device with V ds ¼ 0.2 V and V gs ¼ 0.2 V. When stirring from source side to channel, the potential at the surface increases at a much faster pace. The figure also shows that the potential at the surface moves in the step form in comparison to the change along the length of the halo-doped region alone. As compared to a standard TFET device, the halo border of the innovative device has As a result, current driving capability has been significantly boosted. The smaller electric peak at the drain region end of a TMSGTFET with halo can be interpreted as significant hot carrier suppression and low SCEs. The analytical results match the simulated outcomes quite closely. Figure  36 .29 compares the vertical electric field profiles of H-TMSGTFET and TMSGTFET for varied gate-to-source bias voltages. The enhanced electric field at the source side results in greater carrier transport velocity in the channel, as shown in the figure. Due to the existence of a counter-doped halo, the electric field distributions at the tunneling occurred junction for H-SGTMTFET deviate significantly, as shown in the figure. The tunneling barrier between the source and channel (intrinsic area) is lowered, leading to fast electron acceleration and increased drain current. Also, the suggested model's peak electric field distribution is lower at the drain end. This can be seen as more suppression of the hot carrier effect that happened at the drain end. The better performance of H-TMSGTFET is confirmed by comparison data. Simulation is also used to validate the modeled outcomes. In Fig.  36 .30, the I d versus V ds characteristics of the suggested advanced structure of TFET are presented for V gs ¼ 0.6 V to 1.2 V in 0.2 V increments. The drain current saturates when the    grows noticeably when the work function at the source side ϕ M1 diminishes. Because there is no band cover or band overlap on the source area side, I OFF is projected to be relatively low. As shown in the figure, the suggested structure greatly reduces leakage current in the region of 10 À12 A/μm À 10 À14 A/μm and improves ON current (10 À4 A/μm), indicating suppression of SCE. The selection of gate material work functions is critical in enhancing band overlap. As a result, ϕ M1 and ϕ M3 may be changed for improved ON current. This finding demonstrates that I ON current improves by three orders of magnitude as compared to surrounding gate TFET due to careful setup of unlike gate material work functions and a strongly doped halo area around the channel's source end. The drain induced barrier lowering is an undersirable phenomenon that refers to a decrease in TFET threshold voltage with higher drain voltages and may be represented as ΔV th ¼ ΔV ds . In Fig.  36 .32, the DIBL effect is presented for various halo doping profile values, where ΔV th ¼ V th j V ds min À V th j V ds max . The picture clearly illustrates that, due to the combined effects of halo and work function tailored around gate, H-SGTMTFET suppresses DIBL better than MOSFETs. A higher amount of doping may cause the device's leakage current to increase. As a result, the HALO doping concentration must be tuned to increase device performance. Ge Pocket-Doped TMSG-TFET-SiO 2 /HfO 2 Stacked Gate Oxide Structure for Enhanced Drain Current for Low-Power Applications All-silicon TFETs often have low ON currents, which is a downside due to the high resistance of the tunnel barrier. They are also unable to meet the requirements of current technology, which is a severe limitation in circuit applications. To address these drawbacks, we suggest a novel device structure in this study that combines the appealing qualities of surrounding gate, pocket doping, and Ge source. Pocket doping in TFETs increases channel carrier density, which results in increased drain current. The tunneling area is increased by using a multi-gate construction. In order to improve the ON current, a reduced band gap material is employed, as well as a stacked gate oxide with high-k dielectrics, in this new construction. We employed germanium as the source material and silicon in the channel and drain structures. 
 Device Structure Integrating channel engineering and gate engineering, Fig.  36 .33 depicts a two-dimensional device structure of a Ge pocket-doped TMSGTFET with a SiO 2 /HfO 2 stacked gate oxide. The p þ and n þ areas are the heavily doped source and drain regions, respectively. The channel material, which is a weakly doped n-type material, is the intrinsic material. The total length is L, which is subdivided into L 1 , L 2 , and L 3 with three distinct work functions. L 1 is the halo-doped zone at the source, with a doping concentration N h of 1 Â 10 24 cm À3 . The work functions utilized in the device structures ϕ m1 , ϕ m2 , and ϕ m3 are 4.4 eV, 4.95 eV, and 5.23 V, respectively. The intrinsic area is doped to increase carrier mobility, with a doping concentration N C ¼ 4 Â 10 16 cm À3 . The substrate has a thickness of 10 nm. The halo doping concentration must be greater than the intrinsic concentration of the channel (N h > N c ). The source doping concentration is 1 Â 10 20 cm À3 and the drain doping  .37 illustrate the lateral, transverse, and total electric fields for various V gs over varied channel lengths with a fixed V ds of 0.1 v. The peaks in the above figures clearly illustrate electron transmission. The electrical field is anticipated to be greater at the source-channel interface and less so at the drainchannel interface. The electric field is at its strongest near the source-channel interface, which increases the likelihood of tunneling and aids in electron transmission from the source to the drain. Similarly, the electric field at the drain-channel interface is minimal, which inhibits electron transport in the opposite direction, resulting in an efficient decrease in ambipolar current.    The reverse tunneling current is restricted in our study because of the broader band gap material employed in the drain-channel interface (Si-Si), and the work function of metal 3 is high in comparison to others, resulting in a reduction in reverse leakage current. As depicted in the graph, the drain current is increased while the ambipolar reduction is decreased. 
 Simulation Results of Device Parameters Figure  36 .40 depicts the current densities at various channel lengths. The movement of charge carriers is caused by the drift of electrons and holes. In this figure, the drain bias (V ds ) is set to 1 volt, and the highest peak current density at V gs ¼ 1 volt is calculated to be 6.25 1006 A/m. The cutoff frequencies (fT) for various gate biases are shown in Fig.  36 .41. The cutoff frequency is larger than 11 times at V gs ¼ 1.2 v and V ds ¼ 0.8 v. This is accomplished in large part by lowering Miller capacitance and increasing transconductance of the device. The cutoff frequency is calculated for the unity current gain using fT ¼ gm/2. (Cgg).The existence of a source side tunneling barrier enhances the Miller capacitance effect. The cutoff frequency significantly improves. This significantly improves the device's switching behavior, resulting in larger ON The gate-drain capacitance of the Ge-based pocket-doped TMSGTFET for various gate biases is shown in Figs.  36.42, 36.43, and 36.44 . This impact was seen for three distinct V ds values: 0.2 v, 0.5 v, and 0.8 v. Before inversion, the gate capacitance consists of low gate voltage parasitic capacitance. If the gate-to-source voltage rises, the inversion layer forms beneath the dielectric gate and forms toward drain to source for a given drain voltage. Figure  36 .8c clearly shows that beyond V gs ¼ 0.5 v, drain-gate capacitance is suppressed, but total gate capacitance (Cgg) is nothing more than a fusion of source-gate capacitance (Cgs) and drain-gate capacitance (Cgg) (Cgd). The intrinsic delay is restricted because to the increased ON current and decreased overall gate capacitance. Figure  36 .45 depicts the output conductance curve as the drain bias (V ds ) increases for various gate biases ranging from 0.5 v to 0.9 v. The output conductance is the ratio of the ON current to the total current (I d ). Change the drain bias (V ds ) by maintaining a constant gate bias for a set duration. For V gs ¼ 0.9 v, the peak value is 0.0006, and from 0.55 v, it becomes zero. Similarly the maximum values are reached at 2.5e-5 and 0.9e-5 for V gs ¼ 0.7 v and V gs ¼ 0.5 v, respectively, also reach zero at 0.3 v and 0.15 v. Figure  36 .46 depicts the transconductance curve for various gate biases by raising the drain bias (V ds ) from 0.2 v to 0.8 v. When V gs ¼ 1.2 v and V ds ¼ 0.8 v, the resultant transconductance is 9.5e-5. This is owing to current conductivity in the    
 Prospective Extent and Conclusion In this book chapter, we elucidate the concept of work function engineering and channel engineering implemented in a surrounding gate tunnel FET, giving rise to innovative device structures with enhanced device performance. Literature reports confirm TFETs have several merits such as low OFF-state current (I OFF ), low subthreshold swing (SS), and low power consumption compared with the conventional metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). The motive of this chapter is to showcase the tremendous features of tunnel FETs which are now seen as green transistors meeting the requirements of low-power device designs explain the basic device operation of TFET with mathematical models. Silicon  (Si) , germanium (Ge), and silicon-germanium (SiGe) materials-based TFET devices are discussed. Further, a comparison of various TFET devices considering their geometry and material selection is performed. In the later sections, various designs, device configurations, and operations of Si TFET, Ge TFET, and SiGe TFET are analyzed, followed by the design. Right now, a lot of research has been investigated on TFETS. TFETs are widely used for applications in automotive, industrial, and communications systems, particularly as switching devices in electronic control units, and as power converters in modern electric vehicles. However, TFET has two critical drawbacks such as low ON-current level and ambipolar behaviors. The innovative TFET structures reported in this chapter have proved to overcome the abovementioned disadvantages. The aforesaid meritorious characteristics of TFET devices provide them a verge over conventional MOSFET for high-speed and low-power applications. In addition, in recent years, in the field of healthcare, TFET-based biosensors have been extensively explored as an alternative to micro/ nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS)-based chemical/biological sensors. Compared to MEMS/NEMS sensors, TFET-based sensors hold advantages like better integration with CMOS process flow, simplicity of fabrication, relatively mechanical stability, to mention a few. This exposition encompasses examples of TFET devices with various configurations of TFET and will undoubtedly help out in further research of TFETs for numerous applications. 
 Introduction In the modern era, consumer electronic devices like wearable smartphones, smartwatches, and tablet PCs require minimization of active as well as static power dissipation by scaling down the supply voltage below 0.5 V. To scale down the leakage current (I OFF ) and supply voltage (V DD ), it became necessary for the device designer to explore new device structures that can offer the subthreshold swing (SS) lower than 60 mV/dec. Conventional MOS devices, which work on the principle of thermionic injection of carriers from source to channel, do not offer sufficient design space for fulfilling the current requirements of low-power applications. To this purpose the scientific community has explored the different type of field-effect transistor (FET) structures known as nanowire gate-all-around (GAA) MOSFETs, FinFETs, nanosheet FET (NSFET), impact ionization FETs (I-MOSFET), tunnel FET (TFET), and negative capacitance FET (NCFET) were demonstrated by various groups. Among these devices, only I-MOSFET, TFET, and NCFET have capabilities to offer lower SS than 60 mV/dec  [1] [2] [3] . However, it is evident that the I-MOSFET requires very high voltage to operate, while TFETs have a lower ON-current (as shown in Fig.  37 .1) due to the tunneling phenomena and its compatibility issues also problametic for the use of these both devices in low applications. The ferroelectric FET (FeFETs) is one of the most prominent emerging device, its unique feature like voltage amplification makes it suitable for ultralowvoltage operation. The steep slope is achieved by the negative capacitance offered by the ferroelectric oxide based on the gate stack. This property is being actively explored to overcome the fundamental limit (60 mV/dec) of the subthreshold swing of conventional MOSFETs  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Subthreshold swing (SS) is defined as the inverse slope of the log 10 I D versus V GS curve. 
 SS ¼ @ log 10 I D ð Þ @V GS À1 ð37:1Þ Since only carriers with kinetic energy greater than the barrier can be injected into the channel, the current in this situation can be written in the form of diode current. I D ¼ I 0 e qψ 0 =k B T À 1 ð37:2Þ From Eq. 37.2 we can write, n À1 ¼ @ log 10 I D ð Þ @ψ 0 ¼ q log 10 e k B T . At room temperature, n turns out to be 60 mV/dec. By simple series capacitor formula, we can write m À1 ¼ @ψ 0 @V GS ¼ 1 þ C S C ox À1 , where C ox is the oxide capacitance, and C S is the semiconductor channel capacitance. Subthreshold swing is then given by SS ¼ m Â n ¼ 60 mV=dec 1 þ C S C ox ð37:3Þ Since capacitances are always positive, m > 1, which implies SS > 60 mV/dec. 
 Amplification Property of NCFET It is possible for a ferroelectric NC transistor to make the: • Subthreshold swings lower than the theoretical limit of 60 mV/dec, which is the main concern of reducing operating voltage V DD and device dimensions for future technology nodes. • The FE materials have a preexisting polarization state in the absence of an external electric field. This property of FE material is used to overcome the fundamental limit of the MOS device • Conventional MOS technology. It can retain the polarization state even in the absence of an electric field. The FE layer used within the gate stack of the MOS device in place of the ordinary oxide layer will internally amplify the voltage, which will allow to operate the MOS device at low voltages, ensuring a considerable amount of power saving. The NCFET has the ferroelectric (FE) layer within the gate as shown in Fig.  37 .2. It internally amplifies the voltage and allows the NCFET to operate at a lower voltage. It will preserve the device's performance with considerable energy savings. The NCFET is like a conventional MOS device with added voltage amplification capabilities  [9] . To understand the amplification capability of FE material, the following capacitance network of the MOS device is considered. Herein the C f is the capacitance induced in the FE layer, while C ox is oxide capacitance. Now the amplification factor (β) can be expressed by the voltage divider rule  [10]   β ¼ @V int @V g ¼ C FE C FE þ C int ð Þ ð37: 4Þ From Eq. 37.4, the negative capacitance (C FE ) provided by the ferroelectric layer leads to β > 1 and the SS will be reduced. The subthreshold slope of FET devices is defined by, SS ¼ @V g @Ψ s @Ψ s @ log I ds ð Þ ð37: 5Þ The underlying mechanism for sub-60 mV/dec operation of an NCFET is the passive amplification of the gate voltage at the inference between the ferroelectric gate oxide and the semiconductor channel. Using (37.4), we have the subthreshold swing of an NCFET is SS NC ¼ @ log I ds @V g À1 ¼ @V int @ log I ds Â @V g @V int ¼ SS β ð37: 6Þ From Eq. 37.6, in the sub-threshold region, due to the negative capacitance effect by the ferroelectric materials leads to β > 1 and it will reduce the SS.  
 Stabilized and Nonstabilized NCFET For low-power device, it is indispensable that the transistor has the identical threshold voltage for both ON and OFF state. The two curves represented in blue (Fig.  37 .3a) and red (Fig.  37 .3b) correspond forward and reverse sweep, respectively. These curves show variation in the threshold voltages, which is due to the hysteresis property of the ferroelectric layer. The difference between these two threshold voltages is referred to as the Memory Window of the device. Figure  37 .4 shows the energy (U) versus charge (Q) plots of three difference cases: (i) Dielectric capacitor (ii) Ferroelectric capacitor (iii) The "dielectric + ferroelectric" capacitor (which is composed as the series connection of the ferroelectric and dielectric capacitor, as shown in Fig.  37 .2) When two capacitors (associated to dielectric and ferroelectric materials) are connected in series, the red-colored energy versus charge curve is introduced (see in Fig.  37 .4a, b), which is said to be the capacitance unmatching (or nonstabilized) state, showing two energy minimum points. While in case of matched (or stabilized) state it is one energy minimum point. The capacitance-matched state in NCFET offers no hysteresis (i.e., hysteresis window ~0 V). To achieve the stable state for NCFET by capacitance matching, there exist two important rules to satisfy modular conditions: 1. The thickness of the ferroelectric layer must be decreased until the stable condition is satisfied. This is in line with the continuous scaling of semiconductor devices. In the near future, it is necessary to design the optimal ferroelectric capacitor in terms of the CMOS-compatible material and/or its thickness, and thereafter, the sub-60 mV/dec steep switching and hysteresis-free NCFET can be implemented  [13, 14] . 2. The capacitance of the baseline device (Cint) can be appropriately controlled for hysteresis-free operation. In this case, the device parameters that can be adjusted would be varied depending on the device architecture of the baseline device. Since there is a trade-off between the subthreshold slope and hysteresis window, it should be considered that the reduction of the hysteresis window would degrade the device's performance  [15] . 
 Negative Capacitance Tunneling Field-Effect Transistors The non-hysteric NC-TFET have improved I ON , transconductance (g m ), and subthreshold swing (SS) by means of NC. It has been evidenced that the negative capacitance can be efficiently utilized to significantly enhance the ON-current and transconductance of TFETs in the overdrive region while it improves the subthreshold swing of MOSFETs. A matching condition is proposed and satisfied between the ferroelectric and MOS capacitors for the non-hysteretic operation of negative capacitance transistors  [12] . Note that the SS of conventional MOS devices is limited to 60 mV/dec at room temperature, due to the Boltzmann distribution of electron energy. This is the fundamental obstacle for the lowering of the supply voltage and hence the total power consumption. Therefore, the tunnel FETs are proposed, in which the quantum mechanical band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) is used to inject the charge into the channel, rather the thermionic injection. However, it has observed that achieving sub-60 mV/dec experimentally is extremely challenging for TFET device. Therefore, the scientific community employs the concept of negative capacitance of ferroelectrics to the tunnel device as a performance booster  [13]  (Fig.  37 .5). The current conduction in tunnel FET is based on the transmission probability (T WKB ), which can be approximated as  [6]  T WKB % exp À 4λ 2m ⁎ p E 3 g 3qh E g þ Δϕ ð37:7Þ where m ⁎ , E g , and λ are the effective mass, bandgap, and screening tunneling length, respectively. The λ describes the spatial extent of the transition region at the source channel. In a TFET, keeping drain voltage constant and increasing the gate voltage will inflect the surface potential. This will further increase the energy Δϕ (difference between conduction band of source and valance band of drain) due to the reduction in the screening length. The subthreshold swing of a TFET can be calculated as  [14] : SS ¼ @V g @ log 10 I d ð Þ ¼ ln 10 ð Þ @V d V d @V g þ E þ b ð Þ=E 2 @E @V g À1 ð37:8Þ where symbols have their usual meanings.  
 Voltage Pinning At the interface of FE material and metal interface, the built-in voltage is formed due to the depolarization field. This built-in potential is attributed to the space charge at the interface. This effect in NC-TFET will further effectively reduce the I OFF by blocking the source tunneling when the device is in OFF state. For lower value of gate voltage V G , the internal voltage of NC-TFET is monopolized by the depolarization voltage (V dipole , due to the FE dipole electric field). The surface potential (ψ S ) is given by  [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , ψ S ¼ C ox C dip þ C ox V int ð37:9Þ where C ox and C dip are the oxide and device capacitance, respectively. From Eq. (37.9), for C ox > > C dip , the ψ S is approximately equal to the V int (i.e., ψ S ≈ V int ), which means that the ψ S is also pinned at negative voltage value as shown in Fig.  37 .6. Increasing the gate voltage, from negative to positive value, the ψ S and V int will remain pinned at negative voltage value up to certain value of externally applied gate voltage. This certain value of V G is used to overcome the depolarization field of ferroelectric materials. This effect is used to reduce the I OFF in NC-TFET, where the tunneling junction is highly sensitive to the transverse electric field which control the reverse bias tunneling junction in sublet ways. The relation between V gate and V int is distinctively described in the following two regions: (i) the voltage pinning region, where V int is quasi-constant, because of the dipole's polarization and the depolarization field of the ferroelectric, and (ii) the bias range where the depolarization field is overcome by the applied gate bias (positive, in our case), which results in the following relationship  [12] :  V int ¼ V G 1 þ C ox C FE C ox þC FE Â 1 C FE ð37:10Þ with the NC condition fulfilled, C FE < 0, and a high differential amplification effect is observed when the denominator of Eq. (37.10) is close to zero. 
 Future Scope The negative capacitance field-effect transistor (NCFET) is one of the most promising device, with expectation to overcome the bottleneck issues of semiconductor industry. This FET device internally amplifies the voltage, allowing to operate at a lower voltage. The lower subthreshold swing and better switching capability of NCTFET makes it capable to design low power-efficient nonvolatile energyharvesting processors. The unique feature which makes these devices suitable for ultralow-power operation is the steep slope achieved by negative capacitance of the ferroelectric oxide-based gate stack. This device has several advantages over traditional metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) and is a promising technology for the next generation of integrated circuit nodes as shown in Fig.  37 .7. 
 Introduction Tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) are one among the most promising steep-slope transistors to overcome the voltage scaling issues of metal-oxide semiconductor fieldeffect transistors (MOSFETs)  [1] . The extremely low leakage current is another significant attraction of TFETs  [2] . Even though it performs MOSFET in these aspects, the ON current is much lower than MOSFET. This limits the applications of TFETs. Various studies have been carried out so far to boost ON current without compromising the OFF current and subthreshold swing (SS). A consolidated overview of various topologies aiming higher ON current is included by M.J. Kumar et al.  [2] . Double gate (DG) configuration is preferred over single gate (SG) due to its superior gate control and ON current  [2, 3] . Bandgap-engineered TFETs which have low energy bandgap material on the source side than the channel to reduce tunneling width and providing higher tunneling probability are widely studied  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Dielectric engineered TFETs are explored to overcome weak gate coupling induced by conventional low-k gate oxide material (SiO 2 ) under scaling scenario. Some of the widely used substitutes of SiO 2 are high-k materials like HfO 2 , hetero-gated HfO 2 -SiO 2  [8] , and stacked HfO 2 /SiO 2  [3, 5, 6]  structures. Stacked configuration avoids the lattice mismatch issues caused by the direct integration of HfO 2 on silicon  [5] . The most recent method to enhance drain current is by incorporating a ferroelectric (FE) layer in its negative capacitance (NC)  [9] [10] [11] . Because of the NC property of the FE layer, the interface potential is augmented in this configuration. It also reduces the SS of the transistor. M.H. Lee et al.  [12]  experimentally demonstrated negative capacitance tunnel field-effect transistor (NC TFET) and established that the NC TFETs are capable of voltage amplification. Some of the analytical models related to different NC TFET topologies are there in the literature  [3, [13] [14] [15] . Jiang et al.  [14]  proposed an accurate model for gate-all-around (GAA) NC TFET. An accurate model for NC DG TFET is proposed by H. Xu  [15] , which includes the effect of mobile carriers and the effect of various FE materials. In our previous work  [3] , the drain current of NC DG HJ TFET with dielectric stacking is modeled using tangent line approximation (TLA)  [4, 5]  method. It also includes a study on SS for various FE thicknesses. A. Kamaei et al.  [16]  and  [19]  presented experimental work on NC TFET. In this work, dielectric stacked NC DG HJ TFET is compared to conventional DG HJ TFET with dielectric stacking to investigate the performance enhancement attributes of NC layer on TFET. The chapter is structured as follows. Section "Device Structure and Numerical Simulation" discusses the device topology and numerical simulation. Section "Model Development" covers model development, while section "Results and Discussions" validates the model.   38 .1. In order to reduce the complexity, origin is located at the midpoint of the source-channel junction. The vertical direction is taken as the y-axis, and the horizontal direction is taken as the x-axis, with origin located at the midpoint of the channel. 
 Device Structure and Numerical Simulation The flowchart illustrating the simulation procedure is shown in Fig.  38. 3. After simulating the baseline DG HJ TFET, the surface potential is derived for various gate voltages to calculate the channel charge density, Q. To solve the LK equation, the charge across the FE layer is estimated using the relation that holds when two capacitors are connected in series: the charge across them will be equal.  V FE ¼ α FE Q þ β FE Q 3 ð38:1Þ V DS ¼ V G ¼ 1 V Equation (38.1)  [3]  relates the voltage drop across NC layer and V FE to charge density at steady-state condition. α FE and β FE are the LK parameters that are related to the coercive field, E c , remnant polarization, P r, and t FE of the FE layer. α FE ¼ À 3 3 p 2 E c t fe =P r , β FE ¼ 3 3 p 2 E c t fe =P 3 r ð38:2Þ V G ¼ V FE þ V MIS ð38:3Þ As shown in Eq. (38.2), gate voltage of the proposed structure can be written in terms of V FE and V MIS . V FE will be negative for an NC material, and according to Eq. (38.2), the voltage input for the base TFET is greater than the gate voltage of the NC TFET. As a consequence, the capability of voltage amplification may be properly evaluated.   used to represent the intrinsic channel with channel potential, Ψ x, y ð Þ, is expressed as @ 2 Ψ x, y ð Þ @x 2 þ @ 2 Ψ x, y ð Þ @y 2 ¼ q ϵ II n iII exp Ψ x, y ð ÞÀV V t ð38:4Þ in which q is the elementary charge, V is the quasi-Fermi potential of the electron, V t is the thermal voltage, II is the relative permittivity of channel material, and n II is the intrinsic concentration of channel.

 Results and Discussions As described in section "Device Structure and Numerical Simulation," the surface potential and drain current models are validated against numerical-TCAD simulation results. Silvaco Atlas TCAD is used to simulate the basic n-type DG HJ TFET with HfO 2 /SiO 2 stack. The dynamic nonlocal tunneling model, Auger, SRH recombination models, and BGN model are considered for simulation process. The thicknessspecific FE parameters of Si:HfO 2 , P r and E c are 10.75 C/cm 2 and 1.15 MV/cm, respectively, for a thickness of 5 nm  [3] . The baseline TFET has no ferroelectric layer. Hence, the conventional TFET used for comparative purposes is the same as the baseline TFET. Direct BTBT is observed in InAs-Si HJ  [3, 20] . The G btbt of the NC TFET and its non-NC counterpart at V DS ¼ V G ¼ 1 V is illustrated in Fig.  38 .5. The energy band alignment will be more for the NC-based structure since the effective V G is higher. As a result, compared to conventional TFET, the probability of tunneling improves. The drain current distribution with respect to V G varying from 0 V to 1 V and V DS ¼ 1 V for the proposed TFET and conventional TFET in linear scale and logarithmic scale is depicted in Figs.  38 .6 and 38.7, respectively. Drain current is improved in the proposed TFET compared to the conventional TFET because the tunneling width is narrowed. The reduction of tunneling width is due to an increase in the electric field. Because of the TLA technique, the model and simulation match perfectly. The ON-OFF current ratio is also improved. From Fig.  38 .7, it is observed that the SS of the NC-based proposed device is improved by a factor of voltage amplification factor, A v . The relationship between SS of the proposed NC TFET S NC TFET and A v is given by  V DS ¼ 1 V S NCTFET ¼ S TFET A v ð38:16Þ in which S TFET is the SS of the conventional TFET. A v for the proposed TFET is 1.1194, and S TFET is 63.5 mV/decade. The SS of the presented device is reduced to 56.726 mV/decade when the FE layer is in its NC mode. Table  38 .2 shows the values of A v and SS for various FE thickness. As the FE thickness increases, A v increases and S NC TFET decreases. However, the increased FE thickness leads to aspect ratio issues and capacitance matching problems that cause hysteresis. Figure  38 .8 shows the output characteristics of the proposed TFET and conventional TFET for V DS varying from 0 V to 1.2 V and V G ¼ 1 V. The saturation current is more in NC HJ TFET than conventional TFET, but the saturation is delayed due to increase in the drain saturation voltage. Introducing dual material gate (DMG) which has low work function at the tunneling gate and high work function at the auxiliary   
 Conclusion This chapter compares NC DG HJ TFETs to conventional DG HJ TFETs to investigate the voltage augmentation and SS reduction capabilities of the NC layer. Based on the TLA approach, an accurate analytical model for the two structures is provided. The proposed NC TFET has a higher drain current than conventional TFETs. The SS can be further can be further lowered by increasing the thickness of the FE layer. For the past few years, conventional device scaling has been the main design paradigm for MOS devices. This aggressive scaling would ultimately come to an end due to the inability to completely eliminate the heat generated by MOSFET transistors. Power dissipation would be significantly decreased if FETs could run at lower voltages rather than having an excessively high on-current. In that attempt, the lower voltage requirement might be met if the conventional gate oxide were to be replaced with a new stack that provides a usable negative capacitance (NC). When looking into the gate of a MOSFET, a negative capacitor has the ability to raise the total capacitance above that of a traditional MOS device. As a result, less voltage than would otherwise be necessary to produce the same amount of charge in the channel. It is known that ferroelectric materials can produce an effective NC within a certain polarization range. 
 Keywords 
 Negative Capacitance • Ferroelectric material • Steep SS • CMOS This chapter provides an overview of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) scaling and the growing power constraint caused by the physical restrictions on metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) switches. It has been noted that the development of compact swing switches can help with the issue of increasing power loss. The methods that have so far been developed to achieve a subthreshold swing below the MOSFET thermal limit of 60 mV/decade are described. The operation of negative capacitance transistors, one of the most significant steep slope switch possibilities, will next be illustrated in this chapter. The idea of negative capacitance (NC) roots on the use of ferroelectric (FE) materials whose S-shape polarization/electric field characteristic forms a non-stable negative capacitance region. It is explained that ferroelectric materials can offer an effective negative capacitance in a specific operating range by utilizing the general theory of ferroelectrics and the Landau model approach. The subthreshold swing of conventional transistors can be decreased by making use of ferroelectric materials' negative capacitance area. This chapter's main objective is the investigation of negative capacitance devices. The remainder of this chapter compares ferroelectric materials and examines how well they might work with CMOS technology. 
 The CMOS Power Dissipation Bottleneck: Electronics at the Decision Point One of the most advanced technologies in recent years was microelectronics. The development of microelectronics is responsible for the success of every developed industry that has an impact on people's daily lives. The transistor, created in 1947 by W. Shockley, J. Bardeen, and W. Brattain, served as the catalyst for everything  [1] . It was simply the start of a protracted journey toward contemporary electronics and integrated circuits. In terms of performance and productivity, silicon technology has improved exponentially over the previous few decades, as Moore predicted in 1965  [2] . He predicted that the quantity of transistors in a semiconductor integrated circuit will double every 2 years. Later, Dennard's scaling principles  [3]  helped integrated circuit (IC) makers execute Moore's law successfully by adding an increase in clock speed with each successive technological node. However, the trend of rising frequency gradually stopped in the middle of the 2000s, despite the fact that the transistor's size is continuously scaled down, as illustrated in Fig.  39 .1. The Moore's law-based scaling did not encounter any significant challenges until transistor sizes entered the sub-100 nm zone. The power usage rises exponentially as transistor density is increased. The issue first emerged as a result of technological advancements and the pursuit of faster computations, which led to higher frequencies. The majority of the power used was lost during transistor switching. As a result, the power consumption increases exponentially as transistor density increases as in Fig.  39 .2. The inability to remove the heat produced by transistors is expected to cause the aggressive scaling to finally stop. Circuit designers have done advancements in architecture, using parallel processing and more cores per processing unit, to address this lack of scale as given in. Power dissipation has become more of a serious issue since Dennard scaling stopped, endangering the advancement of digital logic performance  [5] . The results of the Dennard's scaling rules are enumerated in Table  39 .1 taken from Ref.  [3] . The minimal feature size was predicted to decrease 0.7 times with each   [4]  successive generation of technology. The dissipated power really stays constant when the scaling rules are applied, although the frequency, f, rises by K. The difficulties associated with voltage scaling make Dennard's scaling rules less effective below the 65 nm CMOS technology node than they once were. The voltage scaling is crucial to CMOS scaling for a variety of reasons, including reliability, reducing transistor power, and preserving consistent power density. During scaling of V t , Dennard ignored the impact of the transistor's sub-thermal leakage on the chip's overall power usage. However, after years of scaling, V t has been scaled to the extent that the leakage current has greatly increased. Thus, scaling of V t and the operating voltage further is not achievable. The lowering of the overdrive voltage (V ov ¼ V DD À V t ) is the principal effect of supply voltage scaling without an adequately scaled threshold voltage. This causes a decreased ON current in the saturation region of the device which decline transistor's performance and dynamic speed Cg ⁎ v DD I ON as shown in Fig.  39. 3. Slowing down the supply voltage scaling is the first step in resolving this problem and delivering an appropriate performance/overdrive. The power density stays constant when the supply voltage and device size are scaled perfectly. This implies that the power required for the purpose of driving the chip and generating heat as a result of the transistors are constant. But power density rises while V DD does not

Total power density is sum of static (I leak Â V DD ) and the dynamic power (f Â C L Â V 2 DD ) of the device. Scaling down the threshold voltage is a second option to get a sufficiently high overdrive rather than maintaining a high V DD . When compared to dynamic power, the static power increases more quickly, which can be attributed to a physical restriction in MOSFET switches, and scaling of V t is the primary cause of it. For a switch to work correctly, its current characteristics should be steep, and subthreshold swing (SS) is a measure of the steepness of drain current characteristics. SS is amount of gate voltage Changed for a decade change in current. The Boltzmann distribution of charge carriers, however, essentially limits SS and prevents it from being lowered below 60 mV/decade at ambient temperature. The stochastic distribution of electrons in the semiconductor is the underlying cause of this issue. A MOSFET's gate and channel are capacitively connected, and the gate populates the channel by altering the surface potential φ s  [8] . The relationship between the inversion charge density and subthreshold source-drain current is exp(q φ s /K B T), where q is the electron charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. A Boltzmann distribution can often be used to simulate the Fermi-Dirac distribution. At ambient temperature, a factor of 10 increase in drain current needs 60 mV gate voltage, when the gate has perfect electrostatic control over the channel. Consequently, the operating voltage must be maintained constant to maintain a specific ratio of ON current to OFF current. The Boltzmann tyranny is the name given to this restriction of 60 mV/decade on subthreshold slope. It is now widely accepted that this constraint cannot be addressed without adding new physics to the mechanics of transistor operation. As a result, there has been a need for "reinventing the transistor" across the industry  [9] . 
 Steep Subthreshold Devices Several steep switching devices are proposed to give a sub-thermal swing in order to circumvent the so-called "Boltzmann Tyranny." In order to change the subthreshold slope of transistors, either the manner of carrier injection must be changed from diffusion-based to tunneling-based mechanisms or the nonlinearity must be steepened using an amplifier. The promising steep slope switches among alternate architectures are nano-electromechanical FETs (NEMFETs)  [10] , tunneling fieldeffect transistors (TFETs)  [11] , impact ionization MOSFETs  [12] , and negative capacitance MOSFETs (NC-FETs)  [13] . 
 Nano-electromechanical FETs (NEMFETs) Devices combining MEMS with solid-state principles, such as suspended-gate (SG) MOSFETs or nano-electromechanical (NEM) FETs, were made possible by the functional confluence of silicon CMOS and MEMS technology as shown in Fig.  39 .4. The airspace that exists between gate and channel causes the transistor's OFF current to be at its lowest feasible level when the gate voltage is set to 0 V. By applying a voltage to the gate, a combination electromechanical process happens: As the channel inverts, the gate vertically diverts and rises to channel capacitance. As a result, in the subthreshold regime, the inversion charge exhibits a super-exponential dependence on gate voltage. When the equilibrium between the mechanical elasticity and the electric field is no longer met when the gate approaches the channel, the gate collapses and adheres to substrate. As an outcome, the drain current abruptly rises.  
 Drawbacks The primary disadvantage of these switches is the requirement for a high pull-in voltage (tens of volts). Due to the extra force needed to remove the sticking energy and detach the gate from the substrate, the suspended-gate MOSFET switch also experiences hysteresis of the drain current. 
 Impact Ionization MOSFETs It was discovered that the impact ionization-related breakdown has a gain mechanism that satisfies all the requirements. A post-breakdown mode (voltages higher than the breakdown voltage) p-n junction diode is utilized in this FET as given in Fig.  39 .5. An I-MOSFET is exceptionally quick since its delay is proportional to the logarithm of the desired gain. So its SS becomes less than 60 mV/dec. 
 Drawbacks Impact ionization MOSFETs longevity reliability is their main area of contention. Hot carriers must be present at large densities to cause an avalanche breakdown, which jeopardizes reliability. After some time, hot electrons can become trapped in the oxide, changing the threshold voltage. 
 Tunnel FETs In order to achieve a steep subthreshold swing, tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs)  [16]  use quantum mechanical band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) of electrons from the source to the channel, which lowers SS below 60 mV/decade. Tunnel FETs (TFETs) are reverse-biased gated p-i-n diodes where the ON-state current is produced via band-to-band tunneling carrier injection. This is in contrast to CMOS technology where the transport current is based on the thermionic emission of carriers overcoming the potential barrier. Additionally, a single Fig.  39 .5 Schematic and characteristics of an I-MOSFET  [15]  TFET can be utilized in either p or n-mode operation. Tunneling takes place at the N + -I junction for a P-TFET mode and at the P + -I junction for an N-TFET configuration as given in Fig.  39 .6. Energy band diagram demonstrates that lowering the tunneling length results in a sharper band bending at the junction while raising the gate voltage drains the channel's energy. 
 Ferroelectric FET An addition of ferroelectric material to a traditional FET's gate stack gives a way of obtaining SS values below 60 mV/decade  [17] . This FET may be able to change the electrostatic gating while maintaining the transport method to increase the transistor's surface potential beyond what is normally feasible. The fundamental idea behind this type of active gating is based on the capability to move the ferroelectric material by adding a series capacitance; one can transform a device's local energy minimum into a nonequilibrium state where its capacitance (dQ/dV) is negative. Before moving towards the negative capacitance, first discuss about the ferroelectric materials and its physics behind the negative capacitance of ferroelectrics.  
 Ferroelectric Materials and Devices: History Ferroelectric materials, because of their non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, have two stable polarization states that can alternate between them when an applied electric field is present. Ferroelectric materials are a desirable alternative for nonvolatile memory due to their field-driven switchable polarization process  [18] . In 1920, J. Valasek discovered ferroelectricity in potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate, also known as "Rochelle salt"  [19] . The early barium titanate era is characterized by the discovery of ferroelectricity in barium titanate BaTiO 3 (BTO) between  1940 and 1950 , which allowed for its application in ferroelectric capacitors and sensors  [20] . Additionally, the ferroelectric industry flourished between 1950 and 1960, a time when numerous new ferroelectric materials were found. The most significant of these is lead-zirconium titanate, Pb[Zr x Ti 1x ]O 3 (PZT), which resembles BTO in terms of perovskite structure  [21] . On the other hand, the combination of Zr-and Ti-based oxides provides flexibility and has favorable ferroelectric properties, particularly at the morphotropic phase border between the tetragonal and rhombohedral ferroelectric phases  [21] . The ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) was subsequently suggested by D. Buck for memory applications  [22] . On the other hand, when the number of read and write cycles rises in FeFET, the PZT becomes fatigued, resulting in a decline in switchable polarization. The fatigue issue was therefore addressed in the 1990s by the development of layered perovskites with oxide interlayers, such as strontium bismuth tantalate Sr 2 Bi 2 TaO 9 (SBT)  [23] . Nevertheless, weakly bound oxygen in the crystal structure of materials like PZT and SBT find difficulties in integration with CMOS  [24] . After that, a ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ), based on the concept of switchable tunneling current across a thin ferroelectric layer, was created as an alternate memory solution in 2000s  [25] . Furthermore, in 2008, when a negative capacitance field-effect transistor (NCFET) was presented, then rising a need of CMOS compatible ferroelectric material. Intriguingly, the field of ferroelectric devices and its applications was revived in 2011  [26]  by the discovery of ferroelectricity in CMOS-compatible silicon-doped hafnium oxide material. A further CMOS-compatible material was added to the list in 2019 when the researchers successfully developed aluminum scandium nitride Al 1-x Sc x N (AlScN) to industrial standards  [27] . 
 Ferroelectricity and Its Physics To be considered ferroelectric, a substance must satisfy two requirements. It must first be a piezoelectric material that can exhibit two or more stable polarization states when there is not an electric field. It must also be able to change between these states by supplying a enough electric field  [28] . Figure  39 .7 shows a sample of BaTiO 3 , the first strong ferroelectric to be discovered. Below 130 C, BaTiO 3 has a tetragonal structure. The symmetry was broken by the Ti ion's displacement between two distinct states. These atomic alterations are followed by a little tetragonal relaxation of the unit cell, which causes a constant polarization known as remnant polarization (P r ). The thermodynamic properties of ferroelectrics at phase transition temperatures are explained by the phenomenological Landau theory of ferroelectronics  [29] . 
 Landau's Theory Based on symmetry considerations, the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory (also known as Landau's theory) can offer a realistic explanation of a system's behavior close to a phase transition. A phenomenological description of the macroscopic properties is defined by the Landau theory  [46] . Generally, some variables can be used to establish the thermodynamic state of an equilibrium system. The basic premise of ferroelectric thermodynamics is that a ferroelectric's free energy G may be described as a function of ten different factors. The dependent variables' free energy is really expanded by the Landau theory in powers, with known coefficients that may be modeled by experiments. As a macroscopic model, the Landau theory should be noted to be insufficient to explain the microscopic physics underlying the phase transition. For the ferroelectric material, Q-V characteristic according to L-K model is defined as in Ref.  [31]  and E (electric field) of the device is written as: E ¼ 2αQ fe þ 4βQ 3 fe þ 6γQ 5 fe þ ρ dP dt ð39: 1Þ Here, α, β, and γ are constants (Landau parameters), and Q fe is charge across the ferroelectric layer. Further more, ρ dP dt becomes negligible for a quasi-static analysis, and the relation for V fe (voltage across ferroelectric layer) is found as: V fe ¼ 2αt f Q fe þ 4βt f Q 3 f e þ 6γt f Q 5 fe ð39:2Þ Here, t fe is the thickness across the ferroelectric layer. Ferroelectric materials have the capacity to switch from one polarization state to another by applied electric field stronger than the coercive field Ec (i.e., one of the double-well minima). This switchability results in a hysteretic relationship between polarization and electric field in ferroelectrics, as shown in Fig.  39 .8. 
 Preisach Model The macroscopic link between the applied electric field and the polarization is likewise provided by the Preisach model, which is also very nonlinear. Hysteresis in magnetic materials has been successfully studied using the Preisach model  [32] . In the same manner as magnetic materials exhibit hysteresis and field history dependency, ferroelectric materials, which are the electric equivalent of magnetic materials, do as well. A macroscopic system called a Preisach hysteresis is made up of a superposition of rectangular hysteresis loops in each of its simple hysteresis units. 
 Integration of Ferroelectric in Field-Effect Transistors Ferroelectric Field-Effect Transistor For memory applications, ferroelectric integration into field-effect transistors was first proposed in 1952  [7] . By utilizing ferroelectric materials as a dielectric layer, the ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) varies from regular field-effect transistors (FETs). Through the residual polarization of the FE material found in the FeFET gate stack, the charge concentration in the channel is kept constant even in the absence of applied gate voltage. When V g sweeps from positive to negative bias, the ferroelectric polarization aligns upward. As a result, the ferroelectric material's polarization charges induce the negative carrier concentration to form in the channel, similarly An FeFET has hysteretic I-V characteristics, and hysteresis width represents MW (memory window), which is related to the ferroelectric material's E c as in Fig.  39 .10. As a result, while the stored data remains nonvolatile, a nondestructive readout operation may be carried out by sensing the drain-source current using the intrinsic gain of the transistor. 
 Negative Capacitance Field-Effect Transistor At ambient temperature, a phenomenon known as "Boltzmann Tyranny" of sub-60 mV/decade SS can be overcome by a new device dubbed a negative capacitance FET (NCFET), which  Salahuddin     does this by making use of the "negative capacitance" phenomena of ferroelectric materials. Figure  39 .11 depicts the schematic layout of an NCFET, which has a ferroelectric material in the MOSFET gate stack and a buffer/interfacial oxide separating it from the transistor channel. The complete gate stack can be viewed of as an in-series arrangement of capacitors as each layer can be defined as a single capacitor. The existence of the middle metal layer between the two dielectrics makes this possible. The creation of the dead layer at the electrode interface has been disregarded in our calculations since the ferroelectric layer has been held up as the ideal  [33] . The formation of the dead layer significantly alters the ferroelectric capacitor's dielectric response. The formation of a domain structure in ferroelectric films is triggered by the existence of the dead layer; hence, the ferroelectric layer's dielectric response will differ from what is predicted by the capacitor model. With respect to the equivalent circuit of Fig.  39 .11, overall NCFET voltage is approximated as: V g ¼ V FE þ V OX þ φ S ð39:3Þ where V g is the gate voltage, V fe and V OX are the voltage drop over ferroelectric and linear dielectrics, and φ S is the silicon surface potential. As SS expression of NCFET is written as: SS ¼ @V g @ log 10 I d ¼ @V g @V int @φ S @V int @φ S @ log 10 I d ¼ 1 @φ S A V :n@ log 10 I d ð39:4Þ where body factor (n) is written as @V int @φ s ¼ 1 n , and @V g @V int ¼ A V is the gain of transistor. Since n is always less than one and A V is equal to one, SS is always greater than one in a traditional transistor (no ferroelectric). However, in the NCFET, the FE can display a NC state (subject to some restrictions, as we will explore momentarily), which in turn results in a voltage amplification effect at the ferroelectric oxide border, i.e., A V increases to larger than one. This factor helps to reduce the effects of the n factor, which in turn helps to reduce the SS. SS can be reduced even beyond the Boltzmann limit if A V is considerably bigger than n. Contrary to ordinary positive permittivity dielectrics, the ferroelectric is in the NC or negative permittivity state, which causes the electric field to become oppositely oriented with regard to its In other words, if V g > 0, the potential at the interface rises above the applied gate potential. As a result, NC can also be used to raise the channel current. In contrast, the depolarizing field will point downward for V g ¼ 0, suggesting a probable decline. Short channel NCFETs can leverage this effect to reduce subthreshold leakage. 
 Negative Capacitance Stabilization Another way to describe capacitance is as the inverse curvature of energy. As an illustration, consider a linear dielectric capacitance with charge Q that stores energy as Q 2 ¼ 2C; the capacitance value, C, is given by the inverse curvature of this parabolic energy well (as shown in Fig.  39 .12). Such a capacitor stabilizes in the lowest energy state, or at Q ¼ 0, for zero external field (E). However, a negative capacitance would result in an unstable equilibrium condition, an inverted parabola with a maximum of energy at Q ¼ 0. In reality, ferroelectric materials' double well free energy profile, as in Fig.  39 .12, does exhibit such a negative curvature. At E ¼ 0, the ferroelectric would always be stable in one of the energy well minima, blocking access to the NC state's energy maximum. A method to stabilize the FE in the NC state was also suggested in the 2008  [13]  by adding a positive capacitance (C DE ) in series with the ferroelectric C FE , making the system's overall capacitance (C TOT ) positive. Energy-wise, it suggests that the curvature of the ferroelectric-dielectric system's total energy (the sum of its constituent energies) has a minimum at Q ¼ 0 for E ¼ 0. As seen in Fig.  39 .12, this is only conceivable if the dielectric energy curvature is sufficiently positive to counterbalance the negative ferroelectric energy curvature. Ferroelectric oxide in series in the NC state of an NCFET is stabilized by the dielectric capacitance, which in an NCFET is the sum capacitance of the interfacial oxide and semiconductor areas. A key aspect of C FE going negative is that C TOT would grow to be larger than C DE , which is the opposite of what would happen if two positive capacitances were combined in series. This is typically utilized as one of the signatures in tests to locate the NC.  
 Experimental Investigation of Negative Capacitance In ferroelectric materials, the NC phenomenon's applicability and the concept of NCFET have both been empirically examined by numerous research groups over the past 10 years. For these experiments, a variety of ferroelectric materials have been employed, including organic polymer ferroelectric P(VDF x TrFE 1Àx ) and traditional perovskite materials BaTiO 3 and xTi 1Àx O 3 . However, doped HfO 2 ferroelectrics like Hf x Zr 1Àx O 2 and Hf x Al 1Àx O 2 have just been identified, and they represent a revolutionary class of materials. These materials are compatible with the CMOS process and are currently being extensively investigated for use in ferroelectric memory and NCFET applications  [34] . An NC effect has been demonstrated in a number of ferroelectric-dielectric stack experiments also found an increase in stack capacitance with increasing ferroelectric thickness, which as we will demonstrate is consistent with the Landau theory  [35, 36] . Numerous investigations  [17, 37]  have also reported that inserting a ferroelectric layer to the FETs' gate stack increases gate capacitance. A true S-shaped curve has recently been retrieved for the first time using pulsed charge-voltage measurements  [38] , which is comparable to the curve predicted using Landau theory in Fig.  39.8(b) . By coupling a resistance to the ferroelectric, NC zones have also been seen in transient studies  [39, 40] . In these research, when a step voltage was applied across the ferroelectric-resistance system, the ferroelectric charge rose while the voltage drop across the ferroelectric decreased. However, some studies have suggested that the origin of this transient NC may be the domain-assisted switching in the ferroelectric with domain nucleation and growth rather of an intrinsic influence as expected by the static thermodynamic theory  [41] . The ultimate objective of the NC is to integrate a ferroelectric material in a FET to provide steep switching and other related advantages. In fact, demonstrating sub-60 mV/decade characteristics in NCFET was one of the earlier experimental works  [42] . Numerous studies have shown that NCFETs have steep switching characteristics in a variety of MOSFET designs, including planar FETs  [37, 43] , FinFETs  [44, 45] , FDSOI  [46, 47] , and gate all around (GAAs)  [48, 49] , following the finding of ferroelectricity in doped HfO 2 . For sub-10 nm technology nodes, several of these have demonstrated the ability to achieve the NC benefits with ferroelectric less than 2 nm. A ferroelectric layer was recently combined with 14 nm FinFET technology by GlobalFoundries to demonstrate NC-FinFET manufacture  [50] . Other studies  [51] [52] [53]  have also shown NCFETs with 2D channel materials, which can offer even more mobility advantages over silicon channel. As we will demonstrate in the chapters that follow, NCFETs have experimentally illustrated to display larger ON current and enhanced short-channel effects advantages in addition to steep switching. These results are consistent with the Landau theory. In a ring oscillator experiment, the NCFETs were also demonstrated to offer speed improvements over traditional FETs. The introduction of NCFETs has also been proven to enhance inverter gain, device cutoff frequency, and SRAM noise margin  [54] . 
 Reliability Issues of NCFETs After talking about the broad idea for NCFETs and Landau FETs, we discuss the topic of NCFET reliability problems. As the reliability issues have not been formally measured yet, we will focus on the current understanding of NCFET reliability issues relative to independently MOSFET reliability issues. 
 Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) For conventional MOSFETs, NBTI is a significant reliability issue. NBTI appears to be suppressed by NCFET as a result of two counteracting effects: First, the internal potential of the transistor is altered by the threshold voltage shift brought on by interface traps, which alters the voltage amplification. Second, the voltage amplification range is altered by the charge balancing requirement. These two effects, when paired with parasitic gate-to-drain capacitance, are anticipated to prevent NBTI deterioration in contemporary multi-gate FETs  [55, 56] . 
 Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB) Increased internal potential leads to larger fields in the oxide layer between the ferroelectric and semiconductor, which could jeopardize the dependability of the TDDB if driving current is increased through voltage amplification. Instead, it is preferable to properly scale the voltage and build the NCFET so that the TDDB resilience and interface field stay unaltered  [50] . 
 Gate Leakage The system can become unstable and lose the SS improvement, if the NC in the NCFET is discharged by a finite current. However, it has been claimed that NCFETs continue to show steep-switching behavior for fast enough gate voltage intervals, i.e., higher than time required for all of the capacitors to discharged leakage current  [57] . 
 Flicker Noise This noise causes changes in drain current by changes in the quantity of traps and in mobile. Due to improved effective gate capacitance, NCFETs greatly minimize flicker noise, with a move towards scaling of the current power spectrum with increasing ferroelectric thickness  [58] . 
 Conclusion Here, we gave a full description of the device physics that underlie NCFETs, highlighting their huge potential to compete with MOSFETs in certain situations when low power consumption is essential. The key benefit of NCFET is that the device's fundamental architecture does not need to be redesigned. Only a ferroelectric material with the gate stack needs to be inserted. Therefore, we only need to alter a handful of the processing stages that are utilized for ordinary FETs, not the production machine itself. It is conceivable to alter the overall situation of microprocessor architectures if the semiconductor manufacturing sectors can take use of the negative capacitance regime of ferroelectric materials. Numerous advantages would result from this, including a decrease in power consumption and dissipation, a small voltage drop in the channel, a smaller transistor leakage current, etc. As a result, this would extend device lifespan, decrease data center power consumption, decrease heat generation, and lower the energy needed for cooling mechanisms. It would also improve the ratio of ON-state to OFF-state current. It would be possible to reduce electricity costs in this way. This shows that it has cumulatively advantageous effects on all aspects of electronics and electricity, and consequently the costs. The performance characteristics of NCFET are still being improved by researchers to the best of their abilities. In order to further reduce the minimum subthreshold slope of the device and maximize its benefits, researchers are also experimenting with new ferroelectric materials (both organic and inorganic types) that are stable over a wide range of variation in the operation parameters. As a result, this device appears to hold great promise for both the field of science and the semiconductor device production sector in the next years. 
 Introduction Ferroelectric negative capacitance (NC) n-FET provides scalable operation of Moore's law based advanced device architecture with advantages of (i) steep slope or very low subthreshold slope much lower than thermodynamic limit in silicon at T ¼ 300 K which is 60 mV/decade, (ii) high drive or on current due to high remanent polarization (μC/cm 2 ), (iii) internal voltage amplification due to negative capacitance based polarization effect out of both high remanent polarization and high dielectric permittivity with complex or polar type. As a result of which, for the same gate voltage and threshold voltage, more inversion carriers are present in the channel, (iii) new ferroelectric material has been discovered like Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 or (HZO) which is scalable in ultrathin dielectric form being amenable to atomic layer based deposition (ALD) technique and has moderately high remanent polarization and good coercive field, so very stable when internal voltage amplification occurs which can be higher than scaled node supply voltage, (iv) being a steep slope device like tunnel FET, ferroelectric NC n-FET device also shows low I off as the remanent polarization can be swiftly turned off at gate voltages near 0 V, (v) as a consequent of this, very high I on /I off > 10 6 is possible and (vi) internal voltage amplification effect, steep slope, all these also are beneficial from the perspectives of 2D scaling length or gate to channel integrity. HZO based ferroelectric dielectric can be readily adapted for use in gateall-around (GAA) nanowire architecture, nanosheet architecture, all are currently in 2-3 nm node feature size and also for complementary FET architecture which may be required to implement when feature size goes to 1 nm. Other then HZO which has been recently discovered, there are other ferroelectric dielectric materials like PbZrTiO 3 (PZT) and BaTiO 3 and BiFeO 3 . Most of these have high remanent polarization and good high dielectric constant for employing negative capacitance effect on the subthreshold slope (SS) but they do require minimum deposition thickness greater than 10 nm. So with thickness approaching as high as 30 nm, ALD type deposition is not possible for these dielectric, therefore nonstoichiometry based defects may be present in these dielectrics that may enhance polar optical phonon scattering, alloy scattering, and piezoelectric scattering. Very recently, AlxSc 1-x N ferroelectric material has been processed but again due to its high coercive field and large thickness, III-V materials like wide bandgap GaN ferroelectric NC n-FET can be devised with this dielectric for high voltage power applications, mixed signal and wireless, and other RF and analog applications. Of all the ferroelectric dielectric materials that have been experimentally characterized for NC n-FET performance for supply voltages within 1.2 V, HZO based NC n-FET structure has found the best transfer characteristics in both maximum drain current I ds and minimum supply voltage V ds (drain to source) and V gs (gate to source). There are some references where HZO may be used in GAA nanowire FET and a reference paper in this connection will be discussed and HZO can also be used in nanosheet stacked gate architecture and a reference paper will be also discussed for this purpose. This chapter is divided into various subsections by specific cutting-edge literature survey based analysis from references. In subsection 1, reference paper discussed will be "Negative Capacitance Transistors" where the authors first describe the method to derive the S curve in a ferroelectric (FE) material from fundamental principles and then associate the negative capacitance (NC) region in the S curve to a physically definable configuration of dipoles in the crystal structure. As this reference paper succinctly concludes that the design of a NC transistor is essentially an exercise of stabilizing the FE material in the NC region of the S curve using the semiconductor capacitance as a series capacitor. In subsection 2, the author of this chapter discusses another classic paper as a literature survey analysis "Ferroelectric Field Effect Transistors: Progress and Perspective." In this paper, ferroelectric NC FETs built using PZT and HZO will be discussed. Although various papers seem to use ferroelectric FET as FE-FET transistor, actually when we say ferroelectric n-FET, its Ids-Vgs characteristics show a hysteretic behavior but when the correct way terming as per the usual dielectric stacking is applied, the correct terminology is ferroelectric negative capacitance (NC) n-FET which has a continuous I ds ÀV gs curve for V gs ! 0 V and I ds ÀV ds curve for steps of V gs value as we see in all other FET architectures without any presence of hysteresis loop that is purely comes out of ferroelectricity and anti-ferroelectricity and used for ferroelectric (FE) random access memory (RAM) applications where these hysteretic FE-FET devices are used. In subsection 3, an excellent topical review on "Recent Developments in Negative Capacitance Gate-All-Around Field Effect Transistors: A Review" will be discussed in detail. According to the authors of this paper to be analyzed in subsection 3 of this chapter, NC-GAA-FET can combine the advantages of both GAA n-FET and NC FE n-FET and is most promising for ultralow power consumption devices with supply voltage scalability and promises to sustain Moore's law with better conformed roadmap values for 2-3 nm feature size where currently GAA n-FET architecture is being used. In Susection 4, the author of this chapter discusses another excellent paper for literature survey based analysis "Ultrathin Sub-5-nm Hf 1-x Zr x O 2 for a Stacked Gate-all-Around Nanowire Ferroelectric FET With Internal Metal Gate." The study was conducted using a sub 5 nm thickness HZO and a seed layer to fabricate a gate-all-around nanowire (NW), a FE FET using a metal-ferroelectric-metal-insulator-semiconductor (MFMIS) structure and a double layer (DL) of channel. For a 3 mA/μm drive current requirement by the IRDS roadmap, a 5 nm gate width of GAA architecture gives a total current of 15 μA and this device of the paper is capable of producing close to 11 μA as a function of high gate over drive but the I ds ÀV ds characteristics of this MFMIS structure gives maximum saturation drain current <1 mA/micron at high enough gate voltage and also its subthreshold slope seems to be lower than 60 mV/decade at a moderate off current and highly fluctuating. So both these subsections show that 3 mA/micron drive current and SS in the range 40 mV/decade is a challenge still for all NC FE-FET structure to achieve. A better stabilization of subthreshold slope in the vicinity of 20 mV/decade will be discussed in the paper in subsection 5 and the paper is titled "An Anti-Ferroelectric Gated Landau Transistor to Achieve Sub-60 mV/dec for Low Voltage and High Speed." In this article, the authors demonstrate a NC Landau FE FET integrated with 10 nm HfO 2 based integration anti-ferroelectric (AFE) and ferroelectric (FE) hetero stack with subthreshold slope in the vicinity of 20 mV/decade even though considering ratio of FE dielectric thickness over AFE dielectric thickness increases. The paper also shows drive current 10 mA/micron within 0.2 V but these are purely transport based simulation studies and are not confirmed by actual manufactured tested data. In concluding remarks, the author of this chapter presents another paper as reference for readers where instead of HZO, HfO 2 material is used with possibility of drain current reaching 10 mA/micron within 1 V of gate voltage and we probably need to make the efficiencies better extractable from HZO based NC FE FET as much as has been referenced in this paper with Hf O 2 , to be discussed in the concluding remarks. Reference of Al x Sc 1-x N for wide bandgap GaN NC FE FET will be also discussed in concluding remarks where this device may be used in high voltage, high power, and RF applications. 
 Subsection 1 Literature Survey: Negative Capacitance Transistors  [1]  As the authors describe that the basic inspiration for using a ferroelectric (FE) material for transistor comes from the realization that internal dipole interaction in an FE material can be exploited for magnification of vertical electric field through its thickness. By exploiting ferroelectricity, it might be possible to reduce energy dissipation by N À1 times how fast N number of dipoles are switched in a FE material. In an FE FET when FE material is used as an insulator on top of a silicon channel, the overall electrostatics picture can be described by a series combination of two capacitors, (1) the FE capacitor C FE and (2) another capacitance C s that take into account the semiconductor capacitance. Following the series combinations of the two capacitors, there are two boundary conditions, (i) Q FE ¼ Q s and (ii) V g ¼ V FE þ ψ s . Comparing a 45 nm conventional n-MOSFET with this C FE series induced structure, current voltage characteristics is much steeper in the subthreshold region for the latter structure. This means for a given speed of operation, the energy dissipated by FE dielectric-silicon channel FET will dissipate much lower energy per transition compared to a conventional transistor at the same node. Condensing information listed in this article further we need three equations to characterize and understand the negative capacitance (NC) effect. First, Q s ¼ C s (V g À V FE ), then Q FE ¼ ε o E FE þ P ¼ C s (V g À V FE ) ¼ Q s Finally, P ¼ C s V g À C s 1 þ 1 e r t s t FE V BE The plot of P versus V BE represents a S shaped curve and the load line plotted by taking the two points P ¼ 0 and V BE ¼ 0 conditions. The slope of the load line is ÀC s 1 þ 1 e r t s t FE and the intercept point on the NC regime of S curve where P ¼ 0 is V BE ¼ V g 1þ 1 er ts t FE when polarization P is plotted in Y axis and V BE in the X axis. Therefore, if the load line is such that it intercepts negative slope region of the polarization S curve, then we obtain a self-consistent solution of the nonlinear electrostatic problems of the two capacitors in series where @P @E BE becomes negative. If we look at the capacitance C FE in this negative S region at any point intersected by the load line C FE ¼ e o t FE 1 þ @P @E BE e o and @P @E BE < 0, C FE is negative at these intersected points. Considering the overall extent of the load line on the S curve, it intersects S at multiple points showing hysteresis kind of behavior. The voltage amplification factor  [1, 10]  coming out of gate voltage induced surface potential change with respect to V g , we see that @ψ s V g ¼ C FE j j C FE j jÀC s > 1; this amplification of surface potential or vertical gate field induces more inversion charge in the channel for the same gate and threshold voltage, steepening the curve and this is the correct NC FE FET biasing condition, the other points of the load line simply represent C FE values that turn the FET into a hysteretic FE FET. Then the authors go on to discuss the microscopic origin of the S curve and this is simply ferroelectric, anti-ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and pyro-electric properties of the ferroelectric material to be considered in detail with microscopic domain walls. The author of this chapter excludes further discussion of these properties as it has been noted no matter how steep the S curve and polarization is, the thickness required for most ferroelectric and anti-ferroelectric material are very high and greater than 10 nm, which makes manufacturing a problem as with other FET architectures we can always use ultrathin even high-K with ALD deposition. So, dielectrics need to be evolved so that their defined thickness at the supply voltage of operation, even considering internal voltage amplification, stays within 5-6 nm. Due to series addition of FE material and its increased thickness, depolarization field arises due to decreased gate to channel coupling. Earlier through the load line we detected the P ¼ 0 point and on the force displacement diagram, we would like to bias the PÀV BE curve along with load line in such a way that stability may be ensured in the vicinity of unperturbed forcedisplacement curve. If we increase the electric field to increase the polarization from this point, then for the FE material, the net polarizing field will still be larger than the net depolarizing field. In other words, the material will exhibit enhanced polarization boosting the electric field at the FE-dielectric interface. When the FE is stabilized in the static state of negative capacitance by a series dielectric, the total capacitance is expected to be larger than the dielectric capacitance itself. This can be easily seen from the equation, C total ¼ C FE j jC DE C FE j jÀCDE with |C FE | > C DE ; this is the condition for actual NC FE FET with minimal hysteresis. It was demonstrated the ferroelectric dielectric heterostructure like STO-PZT, due to PZT's negative C FE , gives higher C total value than capacitance value of STO itself. Another important point the authors mentioned in this article is obtaining a sub-60 mV/decade subthreshold swing, the thermodynamic limit at T ¼ 300 K, has often been considered synonymous with exhibiting a NC effect. It is mostly the capacitance matching effect of metal-ferroelectric-insulator-silicon (MFIS) structure. If one desires to have a truly NC type behavior of FE FET with no hysteresis, due to matched capacitance, the subthreshold swing will not improve too much from 60 mV/decade that we can achieve by TFET structure or tunnel FET structure but TFETs cannot provide large on current like NC FE FET and, therefore, even a 40 mV/decade but on current close to the roadmap value makes the NC FE FET a competent FET architecture that can be integrated with cylindrical GAA nanowire/ nanosheet stacked gate architecture and even for next emergent complementary FET or (C-FET) architecture. From scaling length perspective, negative capacitance, internal voltage amplification, thin body, and low body doping all are advantageous to control the short channel effects (SCE) much better in NC FE FET compared to other FETs where only GAA nanowire FET and nanosheet stacked gate architecture show similar competitive performance. 
 Subsection 2 Literature Survey on "Ferroelectric Field Effect Transistors: Progress and Perspective"  [2]  In general, the ferroelectric properties of a material originate from its non-centrosymmetric structure. The polarization phenomenon of representative ferroelectric materials like PbZrTiO 3 (PZT), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and hafniumzirconium oxide (HZO) is due to the displacement of constituent atoms in the structure where the polarization direction is determined from actual position of the displaced atoms and its intensity varies depending on the specific phase state or external condition of the material. PZT is a solid solution composed of Zr/Ti elements satisfying the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) condition and has ferroelectric properties due to the displacement of Zr and Ti elements within the perovskite structure. PVDF maintains polarization due to the potential difference between H and F ions on a lattice structure in which molecules with dipoles are arranged in parallel in one direction. HZO is affected by the doping condition or mole fraction of Zr, the tensile strength due to the lattice mismatch of neighboring substrates or electrodes, an example can be W-HZO-W (MIM) capacitor with very good P-E curve (good p values and wide coercive field) and the thickness of the film. The displacement changes its polarization value in the lattice of oxygen atoms. A variant of FE FET is FE-S FET or ferroelectric semiconductor FET which has been developed recently where ferroelectric material is also semiconducting in nature and hence has a semiconductor layer. Unlike conventional FE FET where depolarization loss as described in subsection 1 is a stability problem from FET's operating point perspective, presence of underlying semiconductor layer, additional mobile charge screening, reduces the depolarization field of FE FET since polarization also happens in the semiconductor through the adjacent FE material, as a result variation of subthreshold slope can be minimized as the stable operation regime can be extended. FE-S FET can use 2D materials as the semiconducting underlayer such as In 2 Se 3 and SnS as a semiconductor channel layer and 2D materials have ferroelectric characteristics in a specific direction (in plane and out of plane) depending on the orientation of the structure and the type of atoms. Furthermore, if FE materials are introduced in FE-S FET both in FE layer and the semiconductor layer, a FE 2 FET can be fabricated with large remanent polarization and a small coercive field having almost no hysteresis can be suitable for ultrasteep slope low voltage high drive current FET for logic applications with ultrafast switching. In general, for FET performance evaluation, output curve (Ids-Vds), and transfer curve (Ids-Vgs) are used to obtain all benchmark parameters that roadmap performance metrics list as required for each node, but for FE FET, additional analyses like memory window, retention, and endurance should be measured for memory performance benchmarking and additionally synaptic performance which may be useful for NVM in neuromorphic computing can be done. The hysteresis window of P (polarization)-E (coercive field) may change due to traps or charge present in the FE-DE interface, which hinders the movement of electrons through the channel layer in an n type FE FET. This phenomenon generally disturbs the P-E characteristics of the hysteresis curve and may also cause stability problem discussed earlier maintaining a very good low subthreshold slope (SS). The P-E curve of mica/CFO/ SRO/PZTstructure with bending radius 6 nm and varied bending cycles produced a 2 P r value of almost 200 μC/cm 2 for a coercive voltage range of 6 V approximately. The thickness of the PZT layer used in ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM) is a whopping 70 nm. In the process of high integration of the circuit and the transition from a planar structure to a vertical structure, PZT shows limitations due to leakage currents due to high defect density out of larger deposition thickness and electrical breakdown due to low bandgap (3-4 eV). In particular, when using ALD deposition for PZT film, larger atomic radius Pb is highly volatile making it difficult to deposit a thin film with correct stoichiometric structure. Oxygen, which has a relatively weak bon strength, decreases the reliability of PZT based devices. Doping previously used high-k material HfO 2 with ZrO 2 , HZO dielectric is synthesized which is a orthorhombic phase and maintains noncentrosymmetric structure at room temperature and shows ferroelectric properties at room temperature. Hf0.5 Zr 0.5 O2 HZO structure with capability of deposition thickness < 5 nm still delivers a remanent polarization value of 40 μC/cm 2 and high coercive field similar like PZT. HZO's real advantage comes from its atomically thin deposition thickness enabled by ALD and low latent defects or interfacial defects between FE-DE interface. HZO can form an orthorhombic phase under tensile strain by top and bottom metal electrode (MIM devices) and also due to the lattice mismatch between HZO and substrate. External stress can derive higher ferroelectric properties at lower temperatures and thinner thickness than PZT which HZO is capable of providing. As the thickness of HZO increases, a monoclinic phase is formed, resulting in weakened ferroelectric properties. When the thickness exceeds 20 nm, polarization of HZO decreases sharply and this can be overcome using Al 2 O 3 as an interlayer. HZO FE FET on 2D materials also show interesting promise and in the following subsection HZO can be postulated a FE dielectric material for cylindrical GAA nanowire FET. 
 Subsection 3 Literature Survey Analysis on "Recent Developments in Negative Capacitance Gate-All-Around Field Effect Transistors: A Review"  [3]  According to this paper combination of using a suitable FE material as gate dielectric that achieves simultaneously high polarization value at T ¼ 300 K and high coercive field extent also at T ¼ 300 K as a NC effect on cylindrical GAA nanowire FET can develop NC-GAA-FE FET structure that combines all the benefit of NC FE FET as we discussed in previous section along with benefits of cylindrical GAA nanowire FET that we knew from industry usage from last 3-4 years. The authors discuss an important point that polycrystalline mixed phases can be present in FE material layer affecting multidomain switching issues  [9]  including polarization incoherency and NC nonstability. With channel length further shrinking, traprelated leakage and domain wall pinning lead to the influence of gate stack traps with thickness scaling being non-negligible. The authors further observed that ferroelectric materials based on Zr doped HfO 2 or HZO film are compatible with atomically grown ultrathin layers, thermally stable, high Curie temperature, higher dielectric permittivity, and wide bandgap to suppress leakage current. Metal-ferroelectricmetal-insuslator-semiconductor (MFMIS) with internal metal gate, nanosheet, and capacitance matching all methods can be applied to NC-GAA-FE FET fabrication with stable operation, negligible hysteresis, lower subthreshold slope in the 40 mV/decade, and high drive current close to 11 microampere (roadmap value of 15 microampere) as has been calculated for a double channel stacked nanosheet HZO NC FE FET that will be discussed in the following subsection. 
 Subsection 4 Literature survey on "Ultrathin Sub-5-nm Hf 1-x Zr x O 2 for a Stacked Gate-all-Around Nanowire Ferroelectric FET with Internal Metal Gate"  [4]  This device when formed in MFMIS structure dual channel architecture, it is compatible with roadmap drive current which is 3 mA/micron with 5 micron gate width resulting in 15 microampere current and the experimental device shows large current almost 11 microampere values at 2 V, obviously from supply voltage perspective a little too high voltage value as today's 2-3 nm devices are operated within 1 V supply voltage. Another problem with this device is its subthreshold slope varies and even with MFMIS structure which should have made it stable for two orders of I off rise from minimum I off value which can be due to the trapping effects or poor annealing conditions after ALD deposition. Other than SS variability, the device is good to use from today's perspective for 2-3 nm process generation logic FET architectures. 
 Subsection 5 In subsection 5, the author of this chapter wants to show a totally transport based simulation on paper titled "An Anti-Ferroelectric Gated Landau Transistor to Achieve Sub-60 mV/dec Switching at Low Voltage and High Speed"  [5] . As the authors rightly observed that an ideal subthreshold slope or steep switching occurs in a very limited regime of subthreshold operation, Landau switches based on anti-ferroelectric (AFE) and FE stack layer can ensure a relatively stable NC effect of FE FET enabling steeper subthreshold slope whose variation is still within 30 mV/dec for the entire subthreshold operation of the device. High I on is achieved by a hysteresis free NC FE FET operation with strong inversion with supply voltage less than 0.5 V but obviously with transport based simulation but not experimentally computed. Through simulation, the authors showed that optimizing the ratio of AFE thickness/FE thickness, even a 10 nm stack, enables SS less than 20 mV/decade and drive current of the order of 10 mA/micron at a supply voltage of 0.2 V which is three times higher than roadmap value of 3 mA/micron for 2-3 nm feature length. A metal layer can be inserted between AFE layer and underlying FE layer for homogenization of surface potential variation which improves gate to channel integrity and scaling length from the perspective of high I on , high channel inversion charge yet minimal increase of SS. So, there is opportunity for industry professionals to survey Landau switches with AFE/FE stacked layer NC FE FET integrated with GAA and nanosheet architecture. 
 Concluding Remarks Before we conclude this chapter, the author would like to discuss another paper that is different from the paper discussed in subsection 5 and that it does not require Landau transistor with AFE material and similar like the drive current discussed in subsection 5, this paper also using ferroelectric HfO 2 gate insulator on silicon substrate other than HZO achieves a drain current of 10 mA/micron at a voltage close to 1 V but with very low remanent polarization of 10 μC/cm 2 with very high coercive field value close to 1 MV/cm. The paper is titled "On Device Design for Steep-Slope Negative Capacitance Field Effect Transistor Operating at Sub-0.2 V Supply Voltage with Ferroelectric HfO 2 Thin Film"  [6] . The authors performed an energy efficient NCFET simulation with a ferroelectric HfO 2 gate insulator by tuning its material properties, based upon physics based numerical simulations and experimental data like subsection 3 and 4 are missing here. By clearly optimizing the polarization S curve and load line technique, the NC region in the S curve is almost a linear shape like appearance, generally not found in experimentally fabricated structures due to trapped charge effects induced depolarization effect and domain wall effect, which brings back the curved portion in the NC regime and in order that simulated polarization S curve can be also observed experimentally, metal-HfO 2 interfacial region has to be seamlessly integrated and should have minimum density of interface which states related defects which is possible with ALD based HfO 2 deposition on silicon as we noticed before with HZO as well. The challenge for NC FE FET is still lower I on than roadmap value at a supply voltage <1 V and its stable operation with the variation in subthreshold slope generally observed in experimentally fabricated devices even with much lower I off window. GAA FET and nanosheet FET integrated with NC FET can provide the scaling length based optimization but drive current can be still below the roadmap value but the difference will be a small fraction. Landau transistor with AFE/FE stack can surely be tried with GAA and nanosheet architecture with HZO chosen for FE material in these devices. Finally, another material Al x Sc 1-x N has been developed as a new group of FE material  [7]  with high remanent polarization, dielectric strength, and high coercive field. But because of its minimum thickness crossing 10 nm, sputtering based solution process is used for its deposition in wide bandgap substrate like GaN  [8]  for high power, high voltage, and RF applications. Capacitance matching technique applied to MFMIS structure may enhance subthreshold slope a bit but will give better NC FE FET behavior and should be used for GAA and nanosheet based FET integration with NC FE FET (Figs.  40 .  1 and 40.2) .  
 Introduction Parallel computation is a key enabling technology for the future of artificial intelligence (AI) and the semiconductor industry. With the increasing demand for processing power and data storage for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, the semiconductor industry is facing a critical need for new computing architectures that can handle these demanding workloads  [1] . Parallel computation involves splitting a computational task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks, which can be executed simultaneously by multiple processing units compared to traditional sequential computation, as the sub-tasks can be executed in parallel, leveraging the power of multiple processing units. Parallel computation has a significant advantageous such as speedup in processing time  [2] . One of the major challenges facing the semiconductor industries is the exponential increase in data volume and complexity, driven by the growth of artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. This requires not only fast processing times but also large amounts of memory and storage, as well as efficient communication between processing units. Parallel computation can address these requirements by leveraging the power of multiple processing units and providing a more efficient way to manage the growing data and computational demands in industries  [3] . One of the major key technologies for driving parallel computation is the use of graphical processing units (GPUs), which have specialized processors and used for graphics rendering and scientific simulations  [4] . Therefore, the GPUs have become increasingly popular for AI (artificial intelligence) and machine learning workloads because it has high processing power, large memory capacity, and parallel computing capabilities, which can perform many computations in parallel, making them well-suited for the highly computational and data-intensive workloads involved in AI and machine learning  [5] . Many companies and researchers are now using GPUs to accelerate their AI and machine learning workflows, which has led to the development of specialized hardware and software solutions including Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) platforms. Where, CUDA is used for AI and machine learning workloads, as well as in scientific computing, data analytics, and other fields that require high performance of computing. Such types of platforms have a set of libraries, tools, and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow developers to write high-performance GPU-accelerated based applications  [6] . Recently, the semiconductor industry is also exploring parallel computing technologies such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), which are programmable and custom-designed chips that can be configured to perform specific tasks and applicationspecific integrated circuits (ASICs). In addition, the semiconductor industry is also investing in new hardware architectures that can support parallel computation, including hybrid systems that combine traditional CPU-based architectures with GPUs, FPGAs, or ASICs, and neuromorphic computing systems, which are inspired by the structural and function of the human brain  [4] [5] [6] . Therefore, the future of parallel computation and its impact on the semiconductor industries are to be significant, with the growing demand for processing power and data storage for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. The semiconductor industry will play a critical role in driving the development and adoption of these new technologies, which will enable the continued growth and innovation of the AI and machine learning markets  [7] . In conclusion, the parallel computation is a crucial technology for the future of artificial intelligence and the semiconductor industry. The semiconductor industry is working to develop new computing architectures and technologies that can support the demanding requirements of AI and machine learning, and is investing in the development of new hardware architectures that can support parallel computation. The future of parallel computation holds great promise for the continued growth and innovation of the AI and machine learning markets, and the semiconductor industry will play a critical role in driving this growth. 
 History of Artificial Intelligence Figure  41 .1 shows the schematic diagram for history of artificial intelligence. In the mid-twentieth century, the concept of artificial intelligence has been introduced, when researchers began to explore the possibility of creating machines that could simulate human intelligence  [8] . The term "artificial intelligence" was coined in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, a gathering of researchers from different fields who came together to explore the potential of machine intelligence. Some of the key milestones in the history of AI include:  
 Types of Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science and engineering that deals with the creation of intelligent machines that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence  [9] . There are two types of AI including "NARROW or WEAK" and "GENERAL or STRONG." Figure  41 .2 shows the schematic diagram for different types of AI. This includes tasks such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, learning from experience, making decisions, and solving problems, whereas the narrow AI is designed to perform image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), or playing games. But the narrow AI types are limited to a specific domain  [8, 9] . On the other hand, general AI is capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can do, with the ability to learn and reason like humans. The AI technologies have significant benefits in semiconductor industries such as improving efficiency and productivity, reducing errors, and enabling new capabilities, privacy, and security  [10] .  • Machine learning: This is a type of AI that involves using statistical models to analyze data and make predictions or decisions. Machine learning can be supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised, depending on the type of training data used. • Natural language processing (NLP): This is a type of AI that involves processing and understanding human language. NLP is used in applications such as virtual personal assistants, chatbots, and language translation. • Neural networks: A neural network is a type of machine learning algorithm that is loosely modeled after the structure and function of the human brain. Neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that process input data and generate output. In a neural network, each neuron receives input from other neurons or from external sources, processes that input, and generates output that is passed on to other neurons or to the final output layer. There are several types of neural networks, including feed-forward networks, convolutional networks, and recurrent networks, etc. • Robotics: This is a type of AI that involves creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks without human intervention. Robotics is used in applications such as manufacturing, healthcare, and space exploration. • Expert systems: This is a type of AI that uses knowledge and rules to make decisions and solve problems. Expert systems are used in applications such as diagnosis and decision-making in medicine and finance. • Fuzzy logic: The fuzzy logic is a type of mathematical logic that allows for reasoning with uncertain or imprecise information. Unlike traditional Boolean logic, where a statement is either true or false, fuzzy logic allows for partial truth values, where a statement can be true to a certain degree, or "fuzzy." 
 Classifications of AI 
 Working of Artificial Intelligence To work with the artificial intelligence (AI), by taking in data as input, processing it using algorithms and models, and producing output that can be used to perform specific tasks  [12] . This process typically involves several steps, including: • Algorithm selection: Depending on the task, different algorithms and models may be selected to process the data and generate output. • Data collection: AI requires large amounts of data to learn and make predictions. This data may come from various sources such as sensors, social media, customer interactions, or other data feeds. • Data preparation: Once the data is collected, it needs to be preprocessed and cleaned to remove any noise or errors that could affect the performance of the AI system. • Training: The AI system is trained on a subset of the data to learn patterns and relationships that can be used to make predictions or perform tasks. • Testing and validation: Once the AI system has been trained, then testing should be done and validated to ensure that it is accurate and performs well on new data. • Monitoring: All the AI systems need to be monitored to ensure that they are performing as expected. This may involve tracking performance metrics, detecting errors or anomalies. 
 Services of Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized many industries and has become an essential part of our daily lives  [11] [12] [13] . Some services of artificial intelligence have been discussed below: • Personal Assistants: AI-powered personal assistants such as Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and Google Assistant can help users perform a variety of tasks, including setting reminders, making phone calls, and playing music. • Image Recognition: AI can be used for image recognition in applications such as facial recognition, object recognition, and character recognition. • Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP is a subset of AI that focuses on analyzing, understanding, and generating human language. NLP is used in many applications such as chatbots, language translation, and sentiment analysis.  
 Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) The future of artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to bring about many significant changes in the way to interact or work with technology  [14] . Some potential trends and developments in AI include: • Improved decision-making: AI will continue to get better at processing and analyzing large amounts of data, providing businesses and governments with valuable insights for decision-making. • Expansion of AI into new industries and applications: AI is already being used in many industries, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. As the technology continues to mature, it is likely to find new applications in areas such as education, retail, and agriculture. • Continued growth in machine learning and deep learning: As more data becomes available and computing power continues to increase, machine learning and deep learning are likely to become even more sophisticated and powerful. • Continued development of autonomous systems: AI is likely to play an increasingly important role in the development of autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars and drones, which have the potential to transform transportation and logistics. • More personalized experiences: AI will be increasingly used to personalize experiences for consumers, such as personalized product recommendations, customized advertising, and tailored health and wellness plans. • Advancements in robotics: AI will continue to drive advancements in robotics, making robots more capable of performing a wider range of tasks and interacting with humans in more natural ways. • Breakthroughs in healthcare: AI will be increasingly used to develop new medical treatments and therapies, as well as to improve diagnostics and disease prevention. • Ethical considerations: As AI becomes more pervasive, there will be increasing discussions and debates around the ethical and social implications of AI, including issues related to bias, privacy, and the impact on jobs. 
 Future of Artificial Intelligence in Semiconductor Industry Figure  41 .4 shows the various applications of AI in semiconductor industries. The semiconductor industry is a rapidly evolving field that has been experiencing significant growth over the past few decades  [15] [16] [17] . As technology continues to advance, the demand for semiconductor devices is expected to increase, making it a vital component in many industries, including consumer electronics, automotive, and healthcare. One of the main drivers of the semiconductor industry's future is the ongoing digital transformation of various sectors. This transformation has been fueled by the development of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and 5G networks. The proliferation of these technologies will create a need for new semiconductor devices, including sensors, processors, and memory devices, which will drive the growth of the semiconductor industry  [17] . Another factor driving the future of the semiconductor industry is the need for more advanced manufacturing processes. As the industry progresses, the manufacturing processes used to produce semiconductor devices will need to become more precise and efficient, enabling manufacturers to produce more advanced and complex devices. Furthermore, the increasing demand for renewable energy sources, such as solar panels, is expected to drive the growth of the semiconductor industry  [18] . Solar panels are made up of a series of semiconductor materials, including silicon, and as the demand for renewable energy continues to increase, so will the need for these materials. Some potential ways in which AI could impact the semiconductor industry in the future are discussed below  [19] [20] [21] : • Process automation: The AI can be used to automize the design of semiconductor chips, making them faster, more efficient, and more reliable. This could lead to significant improvements in performance and power consumption. • Product and development: The AI can be used to improve testing, quality control of semiconductor chips, detecting defects, and identifying areas for improvement in products, which enables the development in industries of semiconductors. • Manufacturing: AI can also be used to develop autonomous robots that can perform tasks such as assembly and inspection in semiconductor manufacturing plants. • Edge computing: AI-powered chips can enable edge computing, which allows data to be processed locally on the device instead of being sent to a centralized server. This can improve the speed and efficiency of many applications such as autonomous vehicles and smart homes. 
 Conclusion To conclude the present work, the parallel computation is a powerful approach for performing complex computations and solving large-scale problems. The parallel computation breaks the task into smaller, independent sub-tasks that can be executed simultaneously; it can significantly reduce the time required to complete a computation, improve scalability, and enable new applications that would be impractical or impossible with sequential computing. The parallel computation can be implemented using a variety of hardware architectures, including multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators such as FPGAs and ASICs. Parallel computation offers many benefits, which becomes increasingly important and the demand for processing power continues to grow and the complexity of the problems that need to be solved increases. 
 Introduction Today almost all low price consumer electronic devices like phones, laptops, gaming devices, etc., are associated with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. A limited advantage is supported by silicon device scaling in power amplifiers (PAs), because still gallium arsenide-(GaAs) based technology is used commercially in most power amplifiers  [1] . But CMOS technology has more additional features compared to GaAs like integration of full system-on-chip (SoC), minimum cost, etc. Due to the compactness in the chip, by CMOS technology, a minimal circuit power dissipation and less manufacturing price is achieved today. Thus, CMOS-based power amplifier nowadays become the most demanding one to face a low-power and low-cost approach for modern wireless devices. The modulation schemes like M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) with M takes the value of 16, 64, and 128 are most common for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), and Long-Term Evolution (LTE). Also, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is employed mostly to attain a high data rate. These modulation schemes lead the signals to have high peak-toaverage power ratio (PAPR). In such a situation in order to possess the satisfied linearity, back-off region operation is needed in power amplifiers, since the efficiency and average power of the PA are degraded in the back-off region. This is a major bottleneck for designing highly efficient power amplifier to extend the battery life of handheld devices. In 4G standards, with the help of large bandwidth allocation, twice the network capacity can be offered. Further, with the use of orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), it supports improved spectral efficiency and data rates. Power amplifiers are generally derived by using heavily doped trivalent or pentavalent semiconductor materials due to its behavior of high linearity and breakdown voltage. Such power amplifiers use a metal layer at the back side as a ground plane to provide a through hole to obtain a high-quality ground level. Power amplifiers are normally connected at the last stage of wireless transmitting chain. They are classified, according to the operating state, as linear and switching. Most widely adopted one is linear power amplifiers. They can be categorized as Class A, Class B, Class AB, and Class C based on the conducting angle of the transistor and differentiated in terms of the efficiency. Practically, Class AB power amplifiers have a good compromise between linearity and efficiency compared to other type of amplifiers. Even though OFDMA usage in 4G standards enhances the capacity and performance, it imposes some constraints of the radio frequency (RF) power amplifier design. The challenges arise toward linearity requirements in the form of minimal normalized root mean square error and adjacent channel power. In order to cope up with these challenges, the RF power amplifiers must possess a low average power than its saturated level. However, it affects the efficiency and battery life of the system. The most needed one in recent wireless communication systems is maximized peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Nevertheless, with high PAPR, the efficiency of the power amplifier is greatly reduced because of the back-off operation. In such conditions, many techniques have been developed to address this problem. Some of them include Doherty, outphasing, envelope elimination and restoration (EER), envelope tracking (ET), etc. The transmitter with EER technique is sensitive when compared to the ET transmitter for the time mismatch between the envelope and phase of the signal. Therefore, a high-efficient ET transmitter is preferred in the base station. In ET technique, the envelope of the modulated signal depends on the supply voltage of the PA. In this work, a common-drain (CD) power amplifier for LTE application is proposed at 1.85 GHz using a 0.18-μm CMOS. The envelope tracking (ET) technique is one of the supply voltage modulation schemes, which is used for enhancing the PAs' efficiency. The simulated results show that the proposed CMOS PA with ET has high efficiency and linear performance. 
 Literature Survey A CMOS power amplifier with boost-up efficiency is proposed by N Goswami et al.  [2] , where a stacked Positive MOS (PMOS), Negative MOS (NMOS) and transformer cascade structure are considered. This amplifier, operating at a frequency of 2.4 GHz, addressed the demands like high power-added efficiency (PAE) and low-cost alternative for modern wireless systems. The PAPR is normally high in 4G WiMAX standard rather than 3G cellular standard. Also, the average power amplifier output power requirements in WiMAX is 23 dBm, which is much higher compared to WiFi, where it is 15-18 dBm. To address this problem, Chowdhury D [3] demonstrated a two-stage monolithic-integrated CMOS power amplifier using 90-nm CMOS technology. They achieved an average power in the range of 22.7 dBm and 18 dBm for the average output power and low power mode, respectively. A cascade topology-based PA is designed for Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) streaming applications using 0.18 μm CMOS process by G.  Indumathi and S. Keerthana [4] . An integrated transformer-based Doherty power amplifier, which operates at 2.4 GHz WLAN, achieves the PAE of 24.7% by employing pre-distortion technique is proposed by Kayumasut et al.  [5] . Another transformer-based inputmatched common-drain CMOS power amplifier is demonstrated by Basaligheh et al.  [6]  using 0.13 μm CMOS technology. They achieved the PAE of 36% at saturation point and 25% at 1 dB compression point. An integrated CMOS power amplifier with supply modulator, which operates at two different modes of operation like envelope tracking and average power tracking, is discussed by Ham J et al.  [7] . Using 0.18 μm CMOS technology for 16 QAM uplink LTE signal, the proposed power amplifier supports 45.5% PAE. Similarly, a class E power amplifier is demonstrated by J.S. Walling et al.  [8] , with envelope elimination and restoration mode of operation, where they considered 64 QAM, OFDM signal and achieved an average efficiency of 22.6%. An integrated common-drain topology-based power amplifier with envelope tracking for boosting the efficiency is presented by Zaveri et al.  [9]  and in that design, they achieved the PAE of 30%. Some research works are carried out on an optimized envelope tracking method for the enhancement of PAE. They include (i) Doherty power amplifier with 38.6% PAE by J. Choi et al.  [10] ; (ii) a high-voltage Bipolar CMOS-Diffused MOS (BCD) monolithic envelope amplifier with the overall drain efficiency of 72% applicable for micro-base-station RF PA applications by M. Kwak et al.  [11] ; and (iii) an integrated envelope amplifier with on-chip linearizer using 0.18 μm CMOS technology with the attainment of 33/28% PAE by W.Y. Kim et al.  [12] . For LTE handset mobile terminals, a highly efficient power amplifier is proposed by M. Hassan et al.  [13] , used 0.15 μm CMOS technology, and achieved an overall efficiency of 43%. D. Kim et al.  [14] , proposed an envelope-tracked power amplifier by considering sweep tracking with minimal crest factor to achieve the improved PAE. An SiGe envelope tracking cascade power amplifier is developed by Y. Li et al.  [15] , to achieve the requirement of WiMAX/LTE applications. For 5G radio applications, a frequency reconfigurable power amplifier using 65 nm CMOS process is demonstrated by S. N Ali et al.  [16] . The authors presented a mm-wave power amplifier with PAE of 42.6%. M.K. Alghamdi et al.  [17]  proposed a spurious-free switching buck converter with a delta sigma modulator for handy electronic devices with good noise sensitivity and improved efficiency. J. Yoo et al.  [18]  developed a power amplifier for IEEE 802.11n WLAN signal using 180 nm SOI CMOS process. J. Kim  [19] , proposed a power amplifier using 180 nm CMOS process to operate at 847 MHz with an average PAE of 34.6%. N. Rostomyan et al.  [20]  presented a symmetric Doherty power amplifier using 45 nm CMOS SOC at 28 GHz with PAE of 28%. A different design architectures of CMOS power amplifiers working at 2.4 GHz ISM band applications by A S Bhuiyan et al.  [21] . A CMOS power amplifier, applicable for LTE MTC communication, is proposed by X Fan et al.  [22]  with the attainment of 25% PAE at 1 dB compression point. 
 Traditional Power Amplifier The most common field effect transistor (FET) amplifier topologies are common source and common drain. Out of these two topologies, common-drain power amplifier possesses lesser voltage gain compared to the common source power amplifier. So that common source amplifier supports very low linearity performance compared to the other one. Normally, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) has less power consumption capability compared to FET and bipolar junction transistors. Based on these two observations, the proposed design work considers common-drain configuration for the amplifier implementation using CMOS technology. Radio frequency (RF) signals are considered as the input which in turn is carried by alternating current source. Generally, RF input operates in the band of frequencies between 3 KHz and 300 GHz. Out of the time varying components, inductors are used for blocking AC and capacitors are employed for direct current (DC) blocking. Damage in capacitor may be observed due to high current flow if it is directly connected across AC source. In order to limit such flow, inductors or resistors are required. Similarly, the bond wire, which is used for interconnecting the electronic components, can also limit the current flow. The bond wire also has the capability to improve the efficiency of the power amplifiers. There are three types of bond wires namely T shaped, π shaped, and Wire/Ribbon shaped. For high frequency circuits, T-shaped bond wire is suited for best matching. 
 Envelope Tracking Conventional RF amplifier operates with a constant supply in an efficient manner only at the compression state. To ensure the amplifier to operate at every instances with peak efficiency, there is a need for sustained adjustment of the power supply given to the amplifier. One such technique is envelope tracking, which not only improves the amplifier efficiency but also reduces the heat dissipation. Thus, this technique is found to be suited for applications like smart phones to enhance the battery life. Figure  42 .1 shows the concept of envelope tracking approach. The envelope shaper is employed here to enhance the linearity performance of the power amplifier, thus enhances the efficiency, and in turn reduces the burden of the supply modulator. The output of the envelope shaper is shown in Fig.  42. 2. The switching supply modulator is employed here to traject the envelope of the signal. The respective block is elaborately shown under Fig.  42 .3. The strategy followed here is pulse width modulation (PWM). That PWM signals are given to switching pair transistors, which in turn produces envelope-shaped signals. The non-overlapping clock generator is employed to reduce the power consumption dynamically. The compensation network, which is connected to the negative feedback of an amplifier, is used for overcoming the overshoot problems. For noise reduction, off-chip filter is used. 
 Envelope Tracking-based CMOS Power Amplifier The proposed common-drain topology-based CMOS power amplifier supports good linearity and low ripple leakage of the supply voltage at the switching side. For LTE applications, the PA should possess high linearity and efficiency. In  A supply modulator implementation is considered as a switching regulator for improving the efficiency of the PA. The power dissipation is minimized by using the non-overlapping clock generator. The envelope signal is passed to the PA through the off-chip filter having L 0 ¼ 80 nH and C 0 ¼ 10 nF. The pulse width modulation (PWM) is used for switching scheme  [12] . The supply modulator is stabilized by implementing the compensation network. Figure  42 .5 shows the schematic of compensation network and off-chip filters architecture. As seen in Fig.  42 .6, the output of the triangular generator is compared with the error output of an amplifier and the resultant PWM signal is applied to the switching pair transistors M n and M p . The transistors M 1 and M 2 are acting as the current sources and the capacitor of 1.8 pF is used for charging and discharging the current. To enhance the efficiency and linearity of the PA, the envelope shaping method is applied to the RF input signal. The output of the envelope shaper is connected to the supply modulator. In order to improve it, an envelope tracking technique is employed and the respective result is shown in Fig.  42 .8. The achieved efficiency is about 62.629%. By comparing both the results, nearly 17% improvement is achieved by applying envelope tracking technique compared to traditional method of power amplifier design. The combined results is shown in Fig.  42 .9. From the results, propitiously it is observed that 90.176% efficiency at the frequency of 1.55 GHz. Table  42 .1 shows the parameters considered for the design and the achieved efficiency. The proposed simulated results of ET PA are compared with the performances discussed under literatures is tabulated in Table  42 .2. The proposed power amplifier design with envelope tracking approach using T bond wire interconnections, the achieved PAE is higher compared to other literature survey works. Therefore, the proposed power amplifier is very well suited for LTE band of applications. 
 Conclusion In wireless communication systems, power amplifier is one of the predominant components to transmit the signal without loss. Normally, power amplifier is employed to transduce the DC power into radio frequency power. A fully integrated high-efficient CMOS PA is proposed using 0.18 μm CMOS technology. To enhance  the linearity performance of the power amplifier, common-drain CMOS configuration is employed for the design. By implementing the envelope tracking technique and a T-bond wire for interconnecting of the components, the PAE of the proposed power amplifier is improved by a notable value of about 62.629% which nearly 17% improvement over to the power amplifier design without envelope tracking, where the PAE is only 45.084%. Thus, the proposed power amplifier can be very well suited for temperature and power monitoring in LTE applications. This work can be extended further in future by focusing toward the reduction of computational complexity and chip size.  
 Introduction The detection of invisible substances proved to be hard to get detected by raw eyes, thus the biomolecules can be detected by devices that have very small feature sizes. The device needs to be compact and able to provide an expected level of sensitivity, particularly to a biomolecule of nanoscale in size. The electrical nanogap devices have proven to be helpful in detected very small quantities of biomolecules. The biomolecule's specific reaction to the electrical signals like capacitance, resistance, or field effect has proven nanoscale devices to be efficient in detecting characteristics of biomolecules. Thus, the device-based biosensor became an interesting area of research  [1] , and the FET-based biosensor has proved to be efficient due to its compatibility with the CMOS technology, mass production, miniaturization, cost-effective, and label-free detection process  [1] . The principle of FET-based sensors is obtained from ion-sensitive FET, and it is because the electrical property of biomolecules will change concerning the presence of charged molecules between the gate dielectric and ionic solution  [2] . Though ISFET proved its worth, it lacks in detecting noncharged biomolecules. A new concept of dielectric-modulated FET then emerged where a cavity is carved in the dielectric material of MOSFET to immobilize the biomolecules inside it and bring change in the effective coupling between the channel and the gate. The presence, absence, and properties of biomolecules brings changes in the electrical parameters of the FET that is used for calculating the sensitivity and the label-free detection of neutral and charged biomolecules  [3, 4] . With many emerging devices, tunnel-FET proved to eliminate the bottleneck of 60 mV/dec Boltzmann limit. It proved to be an efficient replacement and thereby a dielectric-modulated tunnel FET (DM-TFET) based presented to show higher sensitivity in  [5, 6] . In this chapter, we will try to reflect on the advantage of tunnel-FET-based biosensors over the years in research and development. 
 Tunnel-FET Biosensor (Year of Introduction: 2012) Tunnel FET for the first time was introduced as a biosensor with the principle of dielectric modulation for applications of charged and neutral biomolecules  [6] . They simulated and compared the double-gate architecture of both  MOSFET and TFET  for enhanced sensitivity. The structure here was motivated by the inclusion of gate oxide which will act as a sacrificial layer for cavity formation and a novel high-k etch technique that prevented interface traps and dielectric edge damage. Air is replaced by the biomolecules in the nanogap cavity with a dielectric material with a dielectric constant greater than 1 for a range of biomolecules. Fixed oxide charges were introduced in the dielectric layer for analysis of the effect of charged biomolecules. They were successfully able to derive an analytical model for surface potential using 2D Poisson's equation. They showed TFET-based biosensor having a very low leakage current of around 10 À17 A/μm. The comparison between MOSFET and TFET response to dielectric variation showed a large increment in ON current of TFET by a factor of 5, 7, and 10 for K ¼ 5, 7, and 20 in comparison to only 2.2, 2.6, and 3 times for MOSFET. They found that TFET has proved to be highly sensitive for different range of dielectric constants, and the effect of change in dielectric was found to be less dominant for high charge value. In addition to comparison to MOSFET and TFET biosensor, they also presented a comparison between p-n-p-n structure and p-i-n structure; the sensitivity of p-n-p-n is found to be higher than p-i-n structure due to the existence of heavily doped n þ pocket region which is responsible for screening out the effect of charges, and when the width of the pocket region is increased, the impact of gate charges and voltage are further reduced. They concluded that p-n-p-n TFET biosensor can be proved to be efficient in comparison to the MOSFET biosensor in terms of ON current, steep SS, and low OFF current. At around the same time,  Sarkar and Banerjee [7, 8]  also presented a TFET biosensor intending to enhance sensitivity at low concentration and reduce its detection time. Though there were many initial concerns about the low ON current of TFET, it has significantly improved when biomolecules were attached to the surface of the sensor, tunneling barrier between channel and source is reduced. They validated the supremacy of TFET biosensors over conventional biosensors through extensive numerical simulations as well as analytical solutions to provide complete physical insight. They developed a model based on two principal parts wherein the first part they modeled the oxide surface potential considering the kinetics of biomolecules and capture by the receptors. In the next part, change in tunneling current was modeled for the attachment or detachment of the biomolecules. They evaluated TFET biosensor with conventional FET biosensor, and it was observed that TFETs performed well in lowering the SS by the bandgap of the semiconductor causing Fermi-tail cutting. The effect of gating on the semiconductor channel by the charged biomolecules was able to produce a higher change in current due to smaller SS than conventional FET biosensor for the same surface potential that was developed due to attachment of the biomolecules. Their proposal showed TFET biosensor led to an increase in sensitivity, improvement in response time, and low concentration detection of biomolecules enabling the prevention of biological accidents or attacks, and thus TFET biosensor paved the way for it in biosensing applications. Narang et al.  [9]  in the same year presented work on dielectric-modulated TFET biosensor for label-free detection and validated its performance with analytical modeling. In this work, they studied the charge effect at different dielectric constants (k) where earlier work on FET biosensors considered the impact of a biomolecule's charge and dielectric constant independently. The analytical framework they developed in Ref.  [6]  extended to incorporate the effect of the charge along with neutral biomolecules. The impact of both dielectric constant and charge on sensitivity parameters was successfully shown and verified through an analytical framework developed for label-free detection of neutral and charged biomolecules. The work was successful in establishing TFET biosensor as a promising replacement of FET biosensor for fast highly sensitive biomedical diagnostic tools as low current is observed in the absence of biomolecules and high sensitivity is observed for both charges and dielectric constant. 
 Tunnel-FET Biosensor: Evolution and Progress The introduction of the TFET biosensor opens a new domain of research to explore its viability in biosensing applications. The dielectric-modulated tunnel FET (DMTFET) structure  [6] [7] [8] [9]  can detect both the charged and neutral biomolecules and shown higher sensitivity compared to conventional FET biosensors. The higher sensitivity of the device implies it has a slower response time that it needs minimum time to sense the lowest detectable change in the biological species concentration. The evolution and progress are presented year-wise in the section to present a complete conceptual idea of the TFET biosensor. 
 2014 The concern in the DMTFET structure was the gate-fringing field due to the nanogap cavity region which affected the response time for the change in the drain current. Kanungo et al.  [10]  worked on analyzing the relation between the fringing field and the sensitivity of the biosensor. Here, they explored silicon-germanium source-based TFET biosensor. They observed that increase in germanium concentration at the source resulted in degradation in the sensitivity for neutral and charged biomolecules detection even though it increases ON-state current. They concluded through simulated results that sensitivity primarily depends on gate-induced fringing field encroachment at the source region of DMTFET. 
 2015 Kanungo et al.  [11]  presented comparative work on short-gate TFET and full-gate TFET dielectrically modulated structure for biosensing applications. They investigated the impact of the structures to understand the effect of biomolecules charge density variation and dielectric constant and by analyzing the BTBT variation, change of tunneling length, and energy-band profile. The study has enlightened the effect of biomolecules conjugation on their electrostatic response. They observed short gate in comparison to full gate structure shows significant sensitivity improvement of almost seven times under appropriate biasing conditions. The reason for the improvement is the dependence of biomolecules conjugation over gate-to-channel coupling. This makes the DMTFET biosensor to have sensitivity improvement and care needs to be explored for achieving higher sensitivity using new techniques of gate engineering in the DMTEFTs. The superior performance of short gate TFET biosensors is further explored by Kanungo et al.  [12]  for a complete understanding of the gate-engineered DMTFETs. They introduced a short gate insulator with less DMTFET structure and performed a comparative analysis with short gate DMTFET in terms of drain current sensitivity, BTBT, and threshold voltage shifts. They observed that insulator less structure eliminated the undesirable gating effect and thus sensitivity significantly improves in comparison to DMTFETs. The effect of ambipolar current has shown significant degradation on TFETs and has significantly impacted its performance. The previously mentioned works did not address the said limitations. Abdi and Jagadesh Kumar  [13]  addressed the ambipolarity issues with the structure having overlapping gate onto drain which widens channel-drain potential barrier for the negative gate voltages. In their work, they explored the gate-on-drain TFET as a label-free biosensor by introducing a nanogap beneath the overlapping gate-on-drain. They immobilized biomolecules into the nanogap having different dielectric constants which widens the width of the tunneling barrier at the channel-drain interface for negative gate voltages varying the ambipolar current. This ambipolar current is reduced further when the nanogap's dielectric constant is increased due to the increase of the capacitance of the overlap gate-on-drain nanogap depleting the drain region below the nanogap widening the tunneling barrier width. This establishes a theory that ambipolar current changes significantly for change in the dielectric constant than with charge density of the biomolecules in the nanogap. Hence, the proposed structure is a good candidate for detecting immobilized biomolecules by measuring the changes in the ambipolar current due to the dielectric constant along with the charge of the biomolecules. 
 2016 The introduction of the TFET biosensor opened a new domain of research for device enthusiast researchers. The quest for structural improvement of TFET biosensor motivated Gupta et al.  [14]  to the introduction of the gate-all-around structure. They developed a structure where the concept of heterojunction at the interface of regions source and channel to increase the tunneling is used and thus presented heterojunction gate-all-around tunnel FET (HJGAATFET) label-free biosensor for electrical detection of neutral and charged biomolecules. In this work, they have considered threshold voltage as the sensing parameter to detect when charge and neutral biomolecules are immobilized in the cavity. They observe threshold voltage varies by 0.77 V for APTES (neutral), 0.157 V for negatively charged, and 0.202 V for positively charged biomolecules; also, increase of dielectric constant causes an increase in the sensitivity parameter 360 mV for uricase (k ¼ 1.54) and 762 mV APTES (k ¼ 3.57) in comparison to the absence of biomolecules in the cavity. The structure showed good sensitivity, leakage current increases (decrease) for positively (negatively) charged biomolecules, and threshold voltage varied increasingly for both types of charged biomolecules, establishing it as a potential candidate for biosensing application. In 2016, Maradan et al.  [15]  introduces hetero-gate dielectrically modulated TFET (HGDM-TFET) having two different gate work functions for biosensing applications to minimize the effect of the drain bias on the tunneling junction and thus we can have high drain bias for attaining requisite drain currents and improved sensitivity than the conventional DMTFET. They observed that drain current sensitivity is zero for lower gate voltages where maximum sensitivity occurring at 1.4 V for different charge densities and sensitivity increase early for lower charge densities. There is negligible effect on the electric field at tunneling junction of HGDM-TFET in comparison to conventional TFET biosensor. The tunneling rate of it increases significantly for higher drain bias establishing it as and device which can achieve better sensitivities at all ranges of drain bias voltages. Also, they studied the variation of work function on sensitivity and found that the control gate work function of 4.7 eV is better than the rest for better ON current. The device showed to improve the sensitivity of around 2500 percentage than the conventional DMTFET biosensor. In the year 2016, Kanungo et al.  [16]  worked to provide in-depth insight on DMTEFT sensitivity-current optimization and proposed a better choice among structural and material improvement. They simulated both the n þ pocket-doped channel and the SiGe source and investigated their comparative performance on sensing performance. At different pocket doping and Ge compositions, the comparative effect on energy-band profile, tunneling, and barrier shape is investigated for variation in sensitvity and threshold voltage shifts. Along with it, they also analyzed the relative effect of trap-assisted tunneling on sensing performance of SiGe-source/ n +-pocket DMTFET. They determined that BTBT increases in DMTFET due to reduction of tunneling length caused by an increase of energy band bending for an increase in the conjugation of biomolecules. Among the SiGe source and n þ pocket for DMTFET, the former reduces both the source energy bandgap and the tunneling length where the latter primarily reduces only the tunneling length. BTBT rate was also found to increase for all the different Ge compositions and pocket doping due to a reduction in the tunneling length for the increase in biomolecules conjugation. Thus, the incorporation of SiGe source was found to be better in sensitivity performance in comparison to the pocket-doped structure, giving an order of improvement for a wide range of samples, whereas pocket doping structure led to sensitivity degradation for the same amount of sensitivity improvement. The SiGe-source DMTFET shall maintain 30% of Ge composition for sensitivity current optimization and maximum sensitivity shall have 10% of Ge composition. 
 2017 The potential of TFET biosensor got enhanced when Singh et al.  [17]  presented a charge-plasma concept to reduce fabrication cost and complexity for implementing dielectric-modulated junctionless TFET for biosensing label-free detection. Here, n þ drain and p þ source regions are formed by metal work function electrodes, and biomolecules are accumulated by creating nanogaps within the dielectric. They analyzed the energy band diagram for ON-state condition (V gs ¼ 1.5 V and V ds ¼ 0.5 V) for different dielectric constants (k) and observed that there is increase in band bending due to the reduction in the barrier width for the increase in the dielectric constants. When biomolecules (k > 1) are present, ON current and tunneling rate increase due to the reduction in the barrier width, whereas the increase in negative charge density in the nanogap results in the reduction in the width of the barrier leading to ON current and tunneling rate reduction. The current attain for the presented structure is lower for the air cavity (k ¼ 1) and significantly improves for the presence of biomolecules (k > 1). They also verified the improved sensitivity by analyzing the structure for various dielectric constants and charge density. The DM-JLTFET can sense the charge in the cavity. The important sense metric transconductance-to-current-ratio for TFET biosensor is proposed and analyzed by Dwivedi et al.  [18] . They focused their work on the below threshold region of operation where there is an exponential dependence of drain current on the applied gate voltage. They analyzed it for transconductance to a current ratio (g m /I ds ) as it can sense the values in the subthreshold region for the presence of biomolecules in the cavity at low power. The presence and absence of biomolecules are verified by observing the current which will be low for the absence of biomolecules due to the controllability of the weak gate on the tunneling junction and higher for the presence of biomolecules due to a rise in the capacitance between the gate and the channel. They analyzed g m /I ds for three different neutral biomolecules which showed improvement in it for the increase in dielectric values. This indicates that the presented TFET biosensor turns on at a lower voltage for the presence of biomolecules than for its absence. It was found that the presence of biomolecules modulated the width of the energy barrier and thereby we have subthreshold swing least for APTES (k ¼ 3.57) in comparison to streptavidin and biotin which is reflected in the shift of g m /I ds value, which was observed to be maximum concerning a device with an empty cavity. APTES shows the ratio of the drain current in the presence and absence of biomolecules at g m /I ds ¼ 10 V À1 is found to be maximum. This ratio shows an increase for an increase in dielectric which is 4.226 Â 10 3 for streptavidin (k ¼ 2.1), 2.9 Â 10 4 for biotin (k ¼ 2.63), and 2.8 Â 10 5 for APTES. This establishes it as a parameter for selectivity and detection of the presence and absence of biomolecules. Verma et al.  [19, 20]  worked on exploring the concept of dual metal gate TFET in biosensing application as dual gate TFET has shown abrupt doping profile junction and high ON current. In their work, they compared single-and dual-metal DMTFETs to explore their potential to obtain higher sensitivity using their abrupt doping profiles for biosensing applications. They explored the energy band diagram of single and dual metal SG-DMTFETs with different dielectric constants and charge density. It presented under the nanogap cavity, immobilization of bio-molecules which enhances band bending in the channel region, resulting in the decrease (increase) in barrier width for positive (increase) charge density. Both devices' surface potential steeply rises for the rise in dielectric constant and increase/decrease in the cavity region for increase/decrease of flat band voltage due to increase of negative/positive charge linked with the biomolecules in the cavity. It is found that drain current of the single gate structure is lower than that of the DG structure due to reduction of tunneling barrier from dual work function presence in DG, where the gate work function toward source end is lower than the drain end work function, thereby source-channel interface gate controllability is improved. I ds sensitivity is found to be increasing with rise in the value of dielectric constant, and it decreases/ increases for negative/positive charge density that are linked with the biomolecules. In comparison to single gate structure, it shows higher improvement in dual metal single gate structures with bias. The relative sensitivity of dual metal structures is higher than others due to enhanced conjugation effect on gate-channel coupling, thus establishing the major role of gate material engineering for the sensitivity of the biosensor. Verma et al.  [21]  presented a novel DMTFET structure based on the concept of vertical tunneling. Vertical TFET has tunneling in lateral as well as vertical direction and showed improved performance as compared with lateral TFET. In the source region, they have considered an additional front gate n þ pocket layer having gate-source overlap, thus presenting a dual metal short gate vertical DMTFET (V-DMTFET) which is compared to a dual metal short gate lateral DMTFET (L-DMTFET). The front gate is doped to make it reside on the top surface of the device in the source region, forming a high-density pocket that creates two p-n junctions providing a path for the charge carrier to simultaneously travel in two directions, resulting in a rise in ON current and fall in SS. The overlapping of the gate in the source region also adds for enhancement of ON current as it provides increased electrostatic control on the channel region. The structure's energy band profile was compared for Y-position for both ON and OFF state with various dielectric constant and X-position under ON-state conditions with different charge density and dielectric constant. They observed that in the OFF state, there is no band alignment, but in ON state, there is band alignment allowing charge carriers to tunnel through the junction because of immobilization of charge carriers in the cavity increasing capacitive behavior with increasing dielectric constant for Y-position. Similarly for X-position for increasing dielectric constant. Moreover, for X-position, barrier width decreases as we increase the positive charge biomolecules as they induce electrons in the channel region, and for a rise in negative charge biomolecules, barrier width is reduced due to induction of holes. They observed similar variation for the lateral electric field also, where they obtained peak of an electric field at source/channel junction for lateral and source/pocket junction for vertical due to enhancement of electric field in abrupt doping profile in source/pocket region. The sensitivity analysis for both the device showed that on increasing the dielectric constant in the nanogap cavity, positive charge density I ds increases, which are higher in case of vertical DMTFET. SS sensitivity analysis also establishes vertical DMTEFT as a better biosensor than the lateral obtaining better for 0.5 Ge composition. The low ON-current concern of TFET is addressed in various literature; narrow bandgap III-V-based TFET is one such solution that helps in increasing ON current because of its smaller bandgap, low carrier effective mass, and small tunneling width. The concept is used in presenting staggered heterojunction-based tunnel FET-based biosensor with a surrounding gate which is studied for its sensitivity. The presented structure shows an increase in potential profile due to an increase of dielectric constant and results in a decrease in the width of the barrier due to a change in effective capacitance in the gate bias. The tunneling barrier depends majorly on the permittivity of the biomolecules which reduces for an increase in permittivity presenting a change in current. SS senses the absence or presence of biomolecules reducing itself more for later. It has successfully detected biomolecules even for low concentrations  [21] . For increasing ON/OFF current ratio, an induced dielectricmodulated TFET biosensor was proposed by Kalra et al.  [22]  where the dielectric constant property is utilized to electrostatically induce source and drain regions in the silicon nanowire (NW). The immobilized biomolecules in the source and drain nanogap regions of different dielectric constant can be sensed in addition to dielectric modulation in the gated nanogaps enabling device better performance in detecting biological events. The proposed device also can detect both positive and negative gate voltages for tunneling at source/channel and drain/channel, respectively, which makes it suitable to detect and eliminate false-positive signals. The dual metal concept was further analyzed by Noor et al.  [23]  due to its ability to raise the electrical characteristics for the detection of biomolecules in functionalized cavity regions. They have an etched gate insulator to produce two separate nanocavity regions as a site for biomolecules sensing. They found that for the increase of dielectric constant of biomolecules, tunneling bandwidth at source-body junction decreases which increases the electric field at the junction and thereby tunneling current obtaining maximum current sensitivity at a low drain bias of 0.4 V and gate bias of 1.5 V. Shafi et al.  [24]  worked on combining the concept of charge plasma with DMTFET to obtain a new architecture of biosensors. The concept of charge plasma is utilized as a device to prevent it from random dopant fluctuations (RDF) due to doping-less mechanism of generating source and drain regions which reduces the potential variation caused by temperature variation, thereby making its sensing ability constant for the range of temperature variation. To implement charge plasma, the P+ source and N+ drain regions are formed by electrodes having different work functions than the silicon, and the thickness of bulk silicon is kept less than Debye's length. Here source and a drain regions are formed by platinum and hafnium electrodes. The thickness of bulk silicon is kept at 10 nm. Further tunneling process is aided by introducing SiGe source having 0.5 Ge composition. They observed maximum tunneling probability at low gate voltages and showed the reduced ambipolar effect. The comparative study of full gate dielectrically modulated electrically doped TFET (FGDM-EDTFET) and short gate dielectric-modulated TFET (SGDM-EDTFET) is studied for biosensing applications is presented in Ref.  [25] . An introduction of nanogap cavity is done in both the devices to detect the charge and neutral biomolecules. Here potential at polarity gates induces carriers, and barrier width is controlled by the control gate. They found that SGDM-EDTFET performs better in terms of sensitivity than FGDM-EDTFET. The increase in biomolecules immobilization in the cavity region causes the gate-channel coupling to increase and also gives better response time at different bias conditions for various charge density and dielectric constant. The electrically doped mechanism to introduce source and drain region made the proposed device gain immunity against RDFs, thereby reducing fabrication complexity and higher thermal budget. The advantage of the electrically doped mechanism is explored in Ref.  [26]  for sensing and electrical characteristics. 
 2018 In the work presented in Ref.  [27] , they studied the sensitivity of the double gate bio-TFET by considering the dimensions of source and drain underlap structures and their impact processes. The detection is based on the change in permittivity of the biomaterial in the region of underlap between the gate/source and the gate/drain. They observed that the sensitivity rises by three times the magnitude when underlap in the drain is changed from 5 to 25 nm due to an increase of biomaterial cover over the drain and thus affecting the ambipolar drain current. Analyzation of sensitivity was then carried out for different silicon thickness keeping the underlap length constant at 15 nm, and best results were obtained for thinner silicon film due to lowering of tunneling length. The increasing gate oxide thickness reduces the ambipolar current because of smaller channel potential contributing to lower BTBT current at the drain with respect to the channel. Thicker oxide proves to provide better sensitivity, and the best was obtained for 3 nm. Among the source and drain underlap, the source underlap provides better sensitivity in the bio-TFET. They continued their work further and analyzed the effect of the thickness of channel silicon and permittivity of biological material on n-type TFET biosensors  [28] . Shafi et al.  [29]  presented virtually doped SiGe tunnel FET with higher sensitivity in biosensing applications. They used the charge plasma concept in the SiGe source which lowers the energy bandgap near the source, decreasing the tunneling path and increasing the tunneling rate and thus ON current. Here the absence of steep doping profiles makes it to eliminate RDFs and fabrication limitations. Inside the cavity, the sensitivity is studied concerning the biomolecules orientation, and CP-TFET was found to perform better than conventional DGTEFT. The threshold voltage and drain current sensitivity of CP-TFET was found to be 1.9 times and 1.6 times more than conventional DG-TFET. Also, g m /I ds were found to be 28% higher than the conventional TFET on confining the biomolecules near the source/channel tunneling junction and prove to be more sensitive near the source/channel interface. Wadhwa et al.  [30]  presented a charge plasma-based dielectric-modulated junctionless TFET (CPB DM-JLTFET) biosensor for the label-free detection of biomolecules. A region of gate cavity is designed for the immobilization of biomolecules, and the electrical parameter changes when biomolecules bond with the sensing area. Here, the drain and source region of the proposed structure is induced on the ultrathin silicon film. The source is of the platinum electrode and the drain side is of hafnium electrode creating electron and hole in drain and source side, respectively. The channel is divided into two parts, gate overlap region and gate underlap region (cavity). They analyzed the variation for detection of biomolecules which is found to increase concerning the rise in dielectric constant. Surface potential sensitivity increases for the presence of positively charged biomolecules and decrease in the presence of negatively charged biomolecules in the gate underlap region. It happens due to an increase in band bending, leading to a reduction in barrier width for positively charged biomolecules. There is a reduction of ON-state current for the length of the cavity as gate capacitance diminishes with the increase of length. The ON-OFF current ratio was also observed to increase for an increase in dielectric constant because of the reduction of barrier width between the conduction band of the channel and the valence band of the source. Thus, they establish CPB DM-JLTFET with a simpler fabrication process as a device exhibiting superior performance, and it attains maximum sensitivity if proper cavity length and thickness is chosen for biosensing applications. In the work presented in Ref.  [31] , the authors introduced a circular gate TFET biosensor exploring the benefit of circular gate architecture to reduce the ambipolar current enhancing ON-OFF current ratio due to increased influence of the gate for gate-drain underlap architecture. They analyzed it for various factors affecting the sensitivity and found that CG TFET with a channel length of 40 nm presented significant sensitivity, and larger sensitivity is achieved for full-filled cavity condition. 
 2019 In the work presented in Ref.  [32] , GaSb in the source region and InAs in the channel-drain region are used from broken gap configuration at source and channel junction. The valence band electron of GaSb sees low barrier height and thus electrons can tunnel toward the conduction band of InAs at zero voltage at the InAs side. As biosensors need to have very low threshold voltage for the detection of biomolecules at low concentrations which is achieved at the cost of leakage current. The heterojunction gate-all-around DMTFET is investigated for sensitivity parameters. The presence of biomolecules is simulated considering an airbox in the simulation and changing the dielectric constant from unity to higher dielectric constant corresponding to neutral biomolecules. The charged biomolecules are simulated considering positive and negative fixed charge at the InAs-SiO 2 interface of the device where the airbox is filled with the corresponding dielectric constant of charged biomolecules. The biomolecules are immobilized into the cavity after it is dipped into the biomolecule's solution for 4-6 h. They verified the result after careful modeling of sensitivity parameters using Poisson's equation. The GAA TFET presented good sensitivity for neutral as well as charged biomolecules. Also, the leakage current increases for positively charged biomolecules and vice versa for the negatively charged biomolecules. The charged plasma-based TFET biosensor is explored in Ref.  [33]  for the detection of biomolecules for eliminating RDFs. The need for physical doping is eliminated with the help of the charge plasma technique to induce source and drain regions over the silicon body and thus reducing the cost of the fabrication process. This abrupt junction around the source-channel and drain-channel is eliminated by applying metal work functions at the source and drain side simplifying the fabrication process. The cavities are introduced at the top and bottom regions of the device toward the source sides underneath the gates, which helps in detecting biomolecules concerning the electrical response. In the work, double gate metals are used for enhanced gate controllability and high k dielectric is used for achieving high ON current. The changes in the dielectric value lead to an increase of drain current which is proportional to sensitivity, the device can detect even any moderate changes in dielectric constant, and also the variation in charges is sufficiently detected for increase/decrease for negative/positive charged biomolecules regarding neutral biomolecules. The leakage current stays constant due to the introduction of high-k dielectric making DLDGTFET a potential structure for biosensing applications. Another interesting work is presented in Ref.  [34]  where a dual-pocket (DP) heterostructure DMTFET (DP-DM-HTFET) biosensor is introduced and then its efficacy is compared with a single-pocket (SP) DM-HTFET and other TFET biosensors. In the structure, back and front gate n þ pocket is introduced to exist in the bottom and top surfaces of the device in the source region near to source/channel interface and ON current get improved by overlapping gates in the source zone. DP HTFET has both vertical and lateral tunneling which are reshaped by etching a portion of the oxide layer to form DP-DM-HTFET. They observed that the proposed structure gave better drain current due to the presence of dual pocket in addition to the presence of vertical and lateral tunneling which majorly contribute to its enhanced performance in comparison to others. They also studied the structures for 25%, 50%, and 100% filled cavities and found that the sensitivity parameter is increased with the percentage of filling factor, and they achieved a maximum for the full-filled cavity. Threshold voltage sensitivity is improved by 107.1% (50.5%) for DP(SP) and ON-current sensitivity by 191.2% (68.8%) for DP(SP) because of the introduction of pockets, vertical and lateral tunneling which enhances BTBT thus establishing its efficacy for biosensing application. A complete assessment of sensitivity for pocket thickness, pocket length, pocket doping, gate work function, and thickness of gate oxide layer is performed when APTES and BIOTIN are present to perceive the streptavidin inside the cavity. In the work presented in Ref.  [35] , a silicon TFET with a circular gate (CG) and a silicon heterojunction (HJ) TFET with a uniform gate were studied. In the work, the CGTFET has a fully extended gate from source-channel to channel-drain interface for sensing, and HJTFET has bandgap modulating material at its tunneling junction for achieving higher tunneling probability and ON current. CGTFET biosensor is formed by etching a semicircular window which is filled with Al 2 O 3 which is used to form the nanogap for biosensing applications. In HJTFET, SiGe is used as source material with a 0.3 Ge composition. The nanogap is created by a dielectric which acts as an immobilizing layer for the biomolecules. They got maximum sensitivity for the case of negatively charged biomolecules for filled nanogaps as 3.99 Â 10 4 (3.169 Â 10 3 ), 8.09 Â 10 5 (4.35 Â 10 4 ), 1.45 Â 10 7 (6.645 Â 10 6 ), and 5.23 Â 10 7 (2.387 Â 10 6 ), at charge concentration of À10 11 cm À2 for k ¼ 5, 7, 10, and 12 for CG TFET (HJ TFET), respectively, and for positively charged biomolecules, 4.94 Â 10 5 (9.313 Â 10 3 ), 4.95 Â 10 6 (9.29 Â 10 4 ), 4.62 Â 10 7 (1.66 Â 10 6 ), and 1.31 Â 10 8 (3.382 Â 10 6 ) at charge concentration of +10 12 cm À2 for k ¼ 5, 7, 10, and 12 for CG TFET (HJ TFET), respectively. They also observed better sensitivity for CGTFET biosensor than MOSFET by 4(5), 5  (6) , 6(7), 7(8) order of magnitude for negative (positive) charged biomolecules for k ¼ 5, 7, 10, and 12, respectively. 
 2020 In the work presented in Ref.  [36] , a novel device architecture is proposed based on the concept of nanotubes. Core-shell junctionless nanotube tunnel field-effect transistor (CP-JL-NTTFET) has a simple process of fabrication, and it is cost-effective. Here, charge plasma concept is used in creation of shell gate and core source metal. The nanotube structure gains popularity because of its thin and hollow cylindrical structure which leads to high drain current, better electrostatic control of gate over the channel, low leakage current, and good scaling down properties. The stray charges and quantum effects generated inside the tube are reduced by introducing a core gate inside the hollow gate. An introduction of a cavity is done between the core source metal and the source region to introduce biological molecules for biosensing applications. The detection of biomolecules is done by observing the variation in the electrical characteristics with the introduction of charged and neutral biomolecules. They found that it gives the optimum value of drain current, average SS, and ON-OFF current ratio. It achieved high sensitivity for even 50% filling of the cavity region for different neutral and charged biomolecules. Saha et al.  [37]  proposed a split-gate (SG) TFET where top and bottom gates are separated, and it had an abrupt change in the channel thickness across the drain and the source side. In order to bind the biomolecules for detection over the underlap channel, a thin coating of silicon dioxide is used. The split-gate of the device is similar to a double gate structure divided into four gates with the underlap opening of the gate for cavity formation to interact with the biomolecules. To enhance the gate control, a channel with higher width across the source side is chosen, and at the drain end, thin channel helps reducing reverse leakage current. The structure can give improved SS and ON current. An analytical model is developed using two-dimensional Poisson's equation for sensing parameters to validate the results obtained from simulation. They studied the impact of charge density and the dielectric constant of biomolecules on sensing parameters obtaining maximum sensitivity for a filled cavity with k ¼ 20. SGTFET biosensor is presented as a potential candidate for biosensing applications in comparison to conventional TFET biosensors. In the work presented in Ref.  [38] , the SiGe source is buried increasing the overlap region between the SiGe source and the Si-channel; as a result, drain current tends to increase because of the increase in tunneling area between source-channel junction. The presented structure is also able to eliminate ambipolarity as the source and drain region are asymmetric and heterostructure. They used different work functions for gate over the cavity, and the gate oxide is chosen to ensure the effective tunneling of the carrier after biomolecules accumulation and high drain current sensitivity. In the subthreshold region, g m /I ds sensing parameter is investigated. The obtained a maximum drain current sensitivity of 2.6 Â 10 5 and ON/OFF sensitivity of 4.96 Â 10 6 for cavity length of 20 nm. Bhattacharya et al. proposed GaAsSb/InGaAs heterojunction TFET in Ref.  [39]  and used it for biosensing application as dielectric-modulated (DM) dual-sided doping-less (DL) GaAs 0.5 Sb 0.5 /In 0.53 Ga 0.47 As heterojunction (HJ) tunnel FET (DM-DDL-HTFET)-based label-free biosensor architecture having hetero-gatedielectric (HGD) is presented in Ref.  [40] . In the structure, a virtual pocket of N+ type with altering N e is realized through L SC variation. The structure is optimized for mole fraction and energy bandgap. Noise characteristics and steric hindrance are also investigated for biosensing functions. Wangkheirakpam et al.  [41]  proposed n þ pocket-doped vertical TFET (VTFET)based nanogap-embedded biosensor (VB), and the results are compared with DGTFET biosensor to analyze the effect of charged and neutral biomolecules The gate is divided into two parts having different work functions near the source and drain end. The SiGe pocket doping is used for the source-channel junction having a 0.3 Ge composition. Due to its lower bandgap than silicon causes increased tunneling at the source-channel junction, in addition, it also exhibits vertical tunneling alongside lateral tunneling contributing to the enhancement of ON current. Nanogaps are created by etching the gate oxide and thus enabling captures of biomolecules. They showed an optimum sensitivity of 1.56 Â 10 6 (1.05 Â 10 2 ) is obtained for VB (DGTFET biosensor) for filled neutral biomolecules for k ¼ 12. VB shows higher sensitivity than the DGTFET biosensor due to the existence of vertical and lateral tunneling. They again proposed another structure based on nanogap embedded N+ pocket-doped vertical TFET-based biosensor exploring the advantage of the heterojunction, dual metal gate, double gate, and tunneling in both directions. The capture areas of the biomolecules are increased by opening nanogap on both sides of fixed dielectric material. They also presented an analytical model to validate the simulation results for both charge and neutral biomolecules. The structure is compared with conventional biosensors and found to show promising sensitivity for label-free biosensing due to its lower power consumption and higher sensitivity  [42] . In the article  [44] , DM gate is combined with the hetero-gate configuration of TFET to present double-hetero-gated-dielectric-modulated TFET (DHGDM-TFET) for enhanced ON current, low SS, low OFF current, and lower power consumption. The gate metal work function consists of silver and chromium, and the cavity is formed by etching out the chromium at the source side above the high-K dielectric. The sensing performance of the structure is examined in terms of different sensing parameters for 5, 10, and 16 nm cavity length, respectively, and among them, 10 nm cavity length gives optimized results for error-free identification of different biomolecules. The sensor is compared with high-k and SiO 2 only devices which established the presented structure improvement in terms of different sensitivity parameters.  Kumar et al. in  Ref.  [45]  explored the biosensing ability of dual-channel trench gate TFET (DCTGTFET) for achieving high ON current. The gate of the structure is in the trench having a work function of 4.2 eV. Both the source regions are placed symmetrically on either side of the gate, and along the gate, trench of thickness 5 nm channel is extended vertically. The cavities are created on both on the either side of the gate. The structural parameter is optimized to obtain maximum drain current sensitivity for cavity thickness variation from 5 to 9 nm to investigate its impact on the sensing performance. On application of gate voltage, two channels are formed in the DMDCTGTFET carrying drain current from drain to source contacts in parallel for a constant drain voltage; this enhances the drain current, and high sensitivity is obtained from dielectric modulation of both cavities by biomolecules. The impact of dielectric constant, cavity thickness, and charge of biomolecules on the performance parameters are analyzed and found that with the increase of cavity width, the voltage sensitivity increases while the current sensitivity decreases. The proposed structure achieved maximum ON-OFF current sensitivity of 7 Â 10 12 and threshold voltage sensitivity of 5.2 V at k ¼ 12. The doping-less TFET devices suffer from the problem of high threshold voltage and the presence of abrupt junction at scale-down dimension. Though many biosensors have been presented using doping-less TFET devices, therefore, it needs to address the problem of scaling, low voltage operability, leakage current, and high sensitivity. In the paper presented in Ref.  [46] , a charge plasma (CP)-based dopingless vertical nanowire TFET proposes to enhance sensing parameters for biosensing applications. Also, the hetero-material technique is used for enhancing the drain current of the device because of its ability to increase BTBT probability due to its low bandgap. It is found that Si and SiGe source-based devices need to be operated at a gate voltage of 1 V, and InSb, InAs, and Ge-Sn hetero-material is used at source to be operated at 0.4 V of gate voltage and 0.2 V of drain voltage to obtain the same device characteristics as with higher operating voltage. It is also better at sensing gas adsorption in comparison to the source electrode as the implementation of charge plasma is done through higher work function metal. The device showed better ON-current sensitivity for the gas sensor of about 28.3%, for a biosensor of about 80%, and for a light sensor of 200%. Mahalaxmi with different research groups proposed dual-metal-gate double cavity charge plasma TFET (DMG-DC-CPTFET)  [47]  and double-metal-gate dual-cavity dielectrically modulated-TFET (DMG-DC-DMTFET)  [48]  biosensor. In Ref.  [47] , at both the tunneling junctions, cavities are formed which at equivalent current levels results in simultaneous sensing of two different kinds of biomolecules. In this structure, with the help of dual-gate maximum ON current of 1.12 Â 10 À5 A/μm and the OFF current of 2.4 Â 10 À18 A/μm is obtained where the maximum ON-OFF current ratio of 7.785 Â 10 11 is obtained for gelatin (k ¼ 12) with SS of 16.4 mV/dec and thus higher sensitivity is said to achieve. The structure is insensitive to RDF as the charge plasma concept is used for source and drain formation. Where in Ref.  [48]  cavities are considered at both the tunneling junctions, the presented structure can detect biomolecules even for negative gate bias due to ambipolarity. The maximum ON current for the case of SiGe as source material is 9.68 Â 10 À6 A/μm, and for k ¼ 24, sensitivity obtained is 6.23 Â 10 9 at a gate voltage of 1 V at ON state and 2.04 Â 10 9 at a gate voltage of À0.8 V for the ambipolar state. 
 2021 Priyanka et al.  [49]  proposed dielectric-modulated n-channel TFET independent of positions for label-free detection of DNA. The flexibility to place the biomolecules inside the nanogap region for the proposed design is provided by the positionindependent property, and therefore, it allows biomolecules to be present at both the drain and source side of the nanogap. The suspended bridge shape of nanogap allows flexible positioning and movement of the biomolecules freely for dielectric modulation. The important features of the structure includes the capacity to provide better sensitivity with higher ON current at lower gate voltage, and biomolecules orientation is considered to be important along with charge density and dielectric constant in sensing metric. The n-channel TFET and IMFET with the property of position independence are investigated for DNA label-free detection. The shift in threshold voltage is evaluated for change in dielectric constant, charge density, and DNA biomolecules tilt angle which showed sufficient sensitivity with the cost of high gate voltage. Also, n-channel TFET shows superior sensitivity of about two times of IMFET for negative charge density of À0.1 Â 10 12 cm À2 . Mahalaxmi et al.  [50]  presented a source charge plasma TFET biosensor with a label-free cavity where the cavity is created on the source side close to the tunneling junction for overcoming the solubility of solid and improving the channel region concentration. Both charged and neutral biomolecules can be sensed which is reflected in the electrical characteristics of the device. The cavities are formed by etching out the dielectric under the source electrode resulting doping profile that are sharp at the tunneling junction. It has obtained SS of 21.7 mV/dec, the peak current of 5.5 Â 10 À6 A/μm, and an electric field of 1.64 Â 10 6 V/cm at k ¼ 12 along with an ON-OFF current ratio of 8.09 Â 10 11 . The device has achieved maximum sensitivity of 1.73 Â 10 10 . In Ref.  [51] , a novel TFET biosensor is presented to combine the advantages of the doped-pocket channel and the SiGe source, respectively. The sensitivity in detection and identification of biomolecules have been increased by using a double-gate setup. Its SiGe source and doped pocket enhance the BTBT generation rate, which reduces tunneling length, increases the channel conduction, and thereby improves the sensing performance. Mukhopadhyay et al. in Ref.  [52]  proposed a dual-material extended gate heterostructure (III-V) TFET (SC-DM-EG-HTFET) with a single cavity-based DM labelfree biosensor. Hetero-structure TFET is a promising candidate in terms of providing flexibility in controlling depletion width at the junction, BTBT tunneling, subthreshold swing (SS), carrier effective mass, leakage, and driving current. The source of the device comprises of InGaAs material with a gallium mole fraction of 0.2 where lower effective mass and lower bandgap provides improvement in rate of tunneling and a high ON current. The Si-channel along with the Si-drain region is chosen for controlling leakage current and creates a band bending that is sharp near the source-channel junction, which increases the electric field at the junction. A comparative performance study of DC-DM HTFET, SC-DM-EG HTFET, and SC-DM HTFET biosensor tells that SC-DM-EG HTFET biosensor provides a better sensitivity, ON current, ION/IOFF ratio, and SS. The sensitivity of these devices has been examined in the presence of both negatively and positively charged biomolecules, and a maximum sensitivity of 1.7 Â 10 8 for positively charge biomolecules is observed for SC-DM-EG HTFET, 1.18 Â 10 8 for SC-DM-HTFET, and 5 Â 10 6 for DC-DM HTFET. Dwivedi along with different research groups worked on TFET biosensors wherein  [53]  a new method of transient response on DMTFET biosensor is investigated. In this approach, the drain current takes a certain settling time and reaches a stable state from the transient state, the values of which depend on the BTBT rate magnitude in TFET. Therefore, the presence of biomolecules having high dielectric constant and charge density results in higher BTBT due to narrowing of tunneling width at the junction which enables drain current to reach the final value at a shorter time and vice versa for low dielectric constant and charge density. This represents different response times which signify that a particular biomolecule has a particular value of settling time. They obtained a high variation in drain current between APTES and biotin or biotin to streptavidin and biomolecules to air. It was noticed that the relative difference in drain currents between two different biomolecules increases with positive back gate bias; hence, selectivity was improved to ~10 times for charged as well as neutral biomolecules. In Ref.  [54] , a p-type underlap structure TFET with an electrolyte/watery environment is evaluated by simulation. The results are then compared with the inversion mode device. The sensitivity of the voltage is greater by three times of the Nernst limit along with current sensitivity higher than one decade per pH is obtained. The TFET has a much greater sensitivity than the inversion mode device. This high sensitivity allows the TFET biosensor to be used even when fewer samples of biomolecules are present and is a very good candidate for biosensing in the watery/electrolyte medium. In Ref.  [55] , integration of SiNW FET and SiNW TFET biosensors are done with CMOS circuits using the top-down approach. Fabricated FET and TFET sensors are used in the realization of multiplexed sensing in single biosensor devices. They observed the changes in saturation and GIDL currents in the FET sensors after the attachment of GBP-Al/Anti-AI and SBP-H1N1/Anti-H1N1 with the gold to detect the biomolecules. 
 Discussion In Figs.  43.1, 43.2, 43.3, and 43.4 , the chapter has been summarized for four different electrical sensing parameters for biomolecules concerning the year of introduction to current. Figure  43 .1 represents the ON current which shows how fast a biomolecule can be detected by the device, and it is observed that very little variation for different structural TFET biosens is observed. We saw the highest ON current was observed in Ref.  [38]  and the lowest in Ref.  [41] , and Fig.  43 .2 represents the ON-OFF sensing parameter which is obtained to be highest in Ref.  [45]  and the lowest in Ref.  [42, 43] . In Fig.  43 .3, another important sensing parameter subthreshold swing is shown which is in the range from 10 to 80 mV/dec for all the TFET biosensors mentioned in this chapter. This is an important sensing parameter to detect the types of biomolecules and their charge density. We saw the lowest SS in Ref.  [52]  of around 15.7 mV/dec and the highest in Ref.  [55]  of around 71 mV/dec. The threshold voltage is the most important sensing parameter as it represents at what lower voltage level biomolecules can be detected by the device. It is shown in Fig.  43 .4 the threshold voltage sensing parameter, and it can be seen that the lowest threshold voltage is obtained in Refs  [37] [38] [39] 44] ., establishing its efficiency for biosensing applications. In Fig.  43 .5, we have shown the percentage of work done in biosensors using the concept of horizontal and vertical scaling where we can see that among the two, horizontal tunneling schemes have been exploring more than the vertical scaling. 
 Conclusions The chapter has successfully presented in detail the growth of TFET biosensors for biosensing applications from the year 2012 to 2021. It has shown immense potential in comparison to the FET biosensor in the detection of biomolecules, determination of types of biomolecules, charge density variation, response time, and settling time. The introduction of charge plasma and doping-less mechanisms to form TFET biosensors has eliminated RDFs, simplified fabrication, and reduces cost. The TFET biosensor detection ability has been further enhanced by combining the concept of the vertical and lateral tunnel to form TFET biosensor which showed improved tunneling current and thus resulted in enhanced sensitivity of the device for detection of biomolecules. There is a lot of scope of research still exists to explore the full capability of TFET for its immense advantage in reducing SS due to its BTBT mechanism for conduction of current in the field of determining new sensing parameter; also, we need more research work on nanowire and nanotube structures based TFET biosensor. The exploration will be incomplete without its complete validation through mathematical models. To conclude, we can state that TFET has presented itself till now in a decade of its investigation as a promising candidate for biosensing application to provide accurate and reliable results.  
 Noise Behavior and Reliability Analysis of Epitaxial Layer 
 Abstract In this study, the noise analysis of epitaxial layer encapsulated tunnel FET (ETLTFET) is carried out in the presence of interface trap charges, considering the device is subjected to various modifications in the source material (such as Si, SiGe, and Ge) and temperature. When compared to source materials comprised exclusively of Si or Ge, it has been found that device employing SiGe source material is less susceptible to noise. The statement above is supported by the observation of normalized S id versus drain current, which evidently shows the enhanced electrostatic coupling and lower impact of noise in the SiGe sourcebased ETLTFET. The value of the drain current noise power spectral density (S id ) at an operating frequency of 100 Hz has been determined to be 8.07 Â 10 À26 A 2 /Hz for the device using a SiGe source. Finally, the temperature analysis on the noise performance demonstrates that the influence of temperature on S id is apparent at low gate bias due to the existence of prominent trap-assisted tunnelling (TAT) and Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) mechanisms. The findings also revealed that at lower 
 Introduction In recent years, various novel ideas and alternative strategies have been put out to overcome metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) constraints, with tunnel field effect transistor (FETs) showing encouraging results  [1] [2] [3] . While the operation of a conventional MOSFET is based on drift-diffusion, the operation of a TFET is based on gate-controlled band-to-band tunneling (BTBT). This lowers the subthreshold slope below 60 mV/decade and breaks through the drift-diffusion subthreshold slope (SS) barrier, reducing short channel effects (SCEs), and lowering the power dissipation  [4, 5] . Among many TFET architectures, since the TFET based on vertical BTBT performs better than the lateral BTBT, it has been extensively researched  [6] [7] [8] [9] . Parallel electric field TFET (PETFET) and synthetic electric field TFET (SETFET) are a few vertical BTBT-based TFETs that showed better device characteristics in terms of SS and I ON  [10] . By adding an epitaxial layer on both sides of the fin, epitaxial layer-based TFET (ETLTFET) was developed to further increase the tunneling efficiency  [11] . ETLTFET exhibits a sub-60 mV/decade subthreshold slope and a considerably greater switching ratio. SiGe was used as source material in ETLTFET in order to increase the BTBT conduction even further while preserving its low I OFF  [12] . Additionally, a straightforward electrical I-V characterization could not adequately capture the complex events happening at the junctions, such as those between oxide and substrate. To better understand traps and their impacts, current research is focused on reliability analysis in terms of trap charges, temperature, and noise. Noise is generated due to trap charges and scattering phenomena, causing random fluctuations of the carrier in nanoscale devices  [13] . Noise analysis can be thought of as a technology quality metric because it also offers insight into the material parameters to examine a number of non-idealities  [14] . There have been studies on flicker noise  [15] , low-frequency noise of TFET  [16, 17] , and the impact of temperature on noise  [18] , but a thorough investigation of noise is still required. The reciprocal relationship of the low-frequency noise sources makes it difficult to achieve optimal design performance at scaled technology nodes. The performance of the analog, as well as the circuit, is degraded by this inverse relationship. Studying the noise power spectral density (S id ), as a result, turns out to be a useful technique for device characterization, especially for the impact of traps in nano-devices  [19] . An early analysis of the DC and analog performance of ETLTFET with SiGe source has been explored in  [12, 20] . Concerning the epitaxial layer-based TFETs, their behavior in the presence of noise has remained unexplored. A wide investigation of the effect of noise-induced by traps is necessary to confirm the usability of ETLTFET as a prevalent device. Thus, this study attempts to expand the investigation to the noise behavior of ETLTFETs with Si, Ge, and SiGe source in the presence of interface trap charge. To analyze the impact of noise on the device, different noise sources, including generation recombination (G-R), flicker (1/f ), and diffusion noise, are also included. Finally, the impact of device noise has been studied for varying temperature environments. The device design and simulation setup of ETLTFET are presented in section "Computational Details". In section "Result and Discussion", we present the simulation results and a thorough discussion on the noise performance. Finally, we conclude the study in section "Conclusion". Noise, are enabled in the simulator's physics section for considering noise in this investigation. 
 Computational Details The 3D structures of ETLTFET used in this study are shown in Fig.  44 .1. The device is a fin-based structure encapsulated with an epitaxial layer. All the device design parameters used for the simulation are listed in Table  44 .1. The 3D simulation has been performed using the Synopsys Sentaurus technology computer aided design (TCAD) tool  [21] . Various models used for simulation are doping-dependent Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) model, field-dependent mobility model, Philips unified mobility model (Phu-Mob), and bandgap narrowing model. The Si and Ge SRH carrier lifetime parameters were taken from  [22] . In order to accurately establish trap-assisted tunnelling (TAT) near heterojunction, the  simulation also includes a dynamic non-local path model  [23] . Utilizing the dynamic non-local BTBT model, the results of the ETLTFET device were validated with the experimental data found in  [24] . Close resemble of data sets, as shown in Fig.  44 .2, validate the considered models. The BTBT model is used to consider the phononassisted tunneling mechanism. It may be noted that strain was not considered in the simulation. But, τ max , a parameter from Scharfetter's relationship, was explicitly adjusted to closely resemble the experimental result. The complete list of adjusted model parameters is reported in  [20] . To consider the quantization effect, the modified local density approximation (MLDA) model was used. The parameters of SiGe were calculated via interpolation using the parameter values provided for  Si and Ge.  At the interface between the epitaxial layer and the oxide (Si/HfO 2 ), a Gaussian distribution of acceptor-type trap charges with a peak concentration of 1 Â 10 13 cm À3 is added for the trap analysis. Although trap charges depend on bandgap energy and its distribution, it is discovered that the mid-gap trap density and low distribution typically dominate the trap current  [12] . Hence, Energy sig of 0.1 eV and energy mid of 0 eV have been taken into consideration for trap charges with Gaussian distribution. Different noise models, including generation recombination (G-R), flicker, and diffusion    
 Result and Discussion The impact of several noise components and temperature on noise current power spectral densities (S id ) is explored in this section. Investigations into the impact of source material variation on S id have been done in the presence of interface trap charges. Investigations have been conducted for three instances of source materials, namely, silicon  (Si) , silicon germanium (SiGe), and Germanium (Ge). To determine how the device will respond to noise, normalized S id is also calculated for each of the three instances listed above. While considering silicon germanium as the source material, an optimized mole fraction of 0.5 is used in this investigation, which is taken from our previous study  [12] . 
 Impact of Interface Traps on Device Characteristics The impact of interface traps on the device characteristics has been examined by incorporating traps at the oxide/epitaxial layer interface in ETLTFET. Acceptor traps with Gaussian distribution is used for the investigation. Donor traps are excluded from the study due to their insignificant effect on the device performance  [12] . The presence of an acceptor, that is, negative interface trap charge, increases the flat band voltage and thereby reduces the effective gate voltage at the tunneling junction  [25] . As a result, when negative trap charges are present, the junction's electric field is reduced and the drain current suffers. A comparison of the I ON , V th , and I ON /I OFF of ETLTFET in the presence and absence of interface traps for the aforementioned three source materials are listed in Table  44 .2. It is observed that the electrical characteristics are significantly affected by the negative trap charges, which is attributed to the reduction in effective gate voltage. On-state current decreases and V th increases due to the presence of acceptor trap charge for all three scenarios. 
 Impact on Drain Current Noise Spectral Density (S id ) On the basis of the aforementioned three scenarios of source material, the computed S id for the device is shown in Fig.  44 .3. It is to be noted that S id shows an increasing  V GS ¼ V turn-on þ V DS . Here, V DS ¼ 0.5 V and V turn-on represents V GS corresponding to I DS ¼ 50 pA  [12]  Source material trend with V GS for all the three source scenarios. S id for G-R and flicker noises shows a positive slope with V GS due to the increased carrier fluctuation at higher gate voltage. I ON (A) V th ( As V GS is increased, the surface carrier concentration increases. This increase in free carrier reduces the trapping time constant as given by the McWorter model  [26] : τ y ð Þ ¼ e α y c N s þ N t ð Þ ð44:1Þ Here τ( y) is the distribution in trapping time constant along with the oxide thickness ( y), α is the McWorter tunneling constant, c is the capture coefficient, and N s and N t are the surface carrier concentration and trap concentration, respectively. Reduced time constant leads to an increase in the trapping and de-trapping of the charge carriers, which increases the number fluctuation causing fluctuation in the drain current. Mathematically also S id is directly proportional to the drain current and hence with increasing I DS with V GS , S id also increases. Moreover, at a very high V GS , diffusion current dominates the conduction, where BTBT carriers from the source diffuse through the channel to the drain. This enhances the diffusion noise at high gate bias. The computed net S id comprising all the three noise sources is shown in Fig.  44 .4a. The noise power spectral density from the source made of SiGe material is found lowest. However, due to the narrow band gap, the instance of a source constructed entirely of Ge exhibits the highest level of noise when compared to the other two material compositions. Figure  44 .4b, showing the transfer characteristics, also illustrates the similar behavior of noise for various source materials. This is due to the direct relation of noise spectral densities with the drain current as indicated in Eq. (  44 .2). The plots of S id also alter similarly, as shown by Eq. (44.2)  [27] . S id ¼ I d 2 kT ð Þ 2 SS 2 S vg ¼ g m 2 S vgfb ð44: 2Þ where g m stands for transconductance, SS is subthreshold swing, the flat band voltage power spectral density (PSD) is denoted by S vgfb , T is temperature, and k stands for Boltzmann constant. An essential characteristic employed by MOSFETs to pinpoint the source of the noise behavior is the normalized S id (S id /I DS 2 ). The fact that S id /I 2 rolls off with a rise in IDS for each of the situations under consideration shows that carrier number fluctuations are the cause of the noise. The normalized S id and (g m /I DS ) 2 versus I DS for the three situations stated previously are shown in Fig.  44 .4. It is clear from Fig.  44 .5a that, apart from at a few current values, the proportionality between normalized S id and (g m /I DS ) 2 for Si sources does not hold across the whole range of drain current. Similar to this, in Fig.  44 .5c, the normalized S id and (g m /I DS ) 2 values for the Ge source appear to be proportional at higher drain current but do not hold true at lower drain current. For both Si and Ge source-based ETLTFET the normalized noise shows the tendency to grow at low current values rather than leveling off as it does for (g m /I D ) 2 . This suggests that flicker noise predominates in these device cases  [31] , whereas, the lower impact of noise in the case of SiGe source-based ETLTFET can be explained in Fig.  44 .5b, where the proportionality is witnessed for the full current range. In the previous section, it is observed that the device with SiGe source material has better noise performance than the other two conditions. As a result, the impact of changing temperature on the SiGe source-based device is examined in this section. The influence of temperature on the transfer characteristics of the ETLTFET with SiGe source is depicted in Fig.  44 .6a. TAT and SRH are the two main conduction mechanisms at low gate bias, and both are exponentially dependent on temperature  [28] . The impact of these thermally aided mechanisms (TAT and SRH) is reduced as the temperature drops, and at very low temperatures, it usually becomes negligible. As a result, after cooling, the BTBT component begins to take precedence over the other conduction methods, improving SS and decreasing leakage current. In contrast, the major conduction mechanism for higher V GS is BTBT, which is hardly dependent on temperature  [29] . Figure  44 .6b depicts the influence of temperature on the S id behavior as a function of V GS . It is to be noted that higher temperatures cause the S id of the device to rise since they have an impact on the emitting and capturing kinetics of trap charges, which has an immediate affect on the density of charge carrier and Fermi level  [30] . Additionally, a temperature-dependent scattering mechanism plays a significant role in the rise in S id . Moreover, due to the existence of prominent TAT and SRH mechanisms, the effect of temperature on the S id behavior is apparent at low V GS  [31] . GHz. It appears that flicker and G-R noise predominated over diffusion noise at lower frequencies, but diffusion noise predominates at higher frequencies. Equation (44.3), which denotes the power spectral density of flicker noise, can be used to validate the fact  [27] . 
 Impact on S id Due to Frequency Variation S id f ð Þ ¼ 2 F þ B F 2 q 2 I 2 D N t E FN ð Þ e 2 ox WL I αf γ ð44:3Þ where F denotes the electric field, L is the carrier tunneling distance at the tunneling junction, N t represents the interface trap density, α is the attenuation factor, W is the gate width, B is constant, γ stands for the factor representing frequency dependence of S id , and f is frequency. As stated above, the equation accurately depicts the inverse connection between flicker noise and frequency. Flicker noise often results from the superimposition of G-R noise that was caused by number fluctuations. As a result, as frequency rises, both G-R and flicker noise decrease. This is because of the less trapping and de-trapping of charge carriers at a higher frequency which suppresses the flicker and G-R noises. Moreover, it is observed that the S id behavior for the case of the SiGe source shows superior noise behavior (reduced S id ) for a wide frequency range than the other two scenarios. This is attributed to the improved transfer characteristics of the SiGe source-based device compared to Si and Ge source-based structures. Moreover, the presence of Ge at the source leads to an increase in the S id level. In the frame of the number fluctuations, the Ge-source devices have a higher trap density than their silicon counterpart which led to a higher fluctuation in carrier number  [14] . 
 Conclusion In this study, the noise behavior of the epitaxial layer encapsulated TFET (ETLTFET) in the presence of interface trap charges is addressed. In order to assess the reliability of the device, the drain current noise spectral densities (S id ) are also determined for a variety of materials for source region (Si, SiGe, and Ge) and operating temperatures (300-400 K). When compared to source materials comprised exclusively of Si or Ge, it has been found that device employing SiGe source is less susceptible to noise. The statement above is supported by the observation of normalized S id versus drain current. The value of the drain current noise power spectral density (S id ) at an operating frequency of 100 Hz has been determined to be 8.07 Â 10 À26 A 2 /Hz for the device using a SiGe source, and the predicted S id values for the device with Si and Ge source are 6.52 Â 10 À25 A 2 /Hz and 1.64 Â 10 À23 A 2 /Hz, respectively. Additionally, the examination of noise at various temperatures shows an apparent impact on S id at low V GS due to the existence of prominent TAT and SRH mechanisms. The findings also revealed that at lower frequencies, flicker and G-R noises predominate, whereas, at higher frequencies, diffusion noise is the major noise source. swing (SS) can be reduced below 60 mV/dec using tunnel field effect transistors (TFETs), negative capacitance field effect transistors (NCFETs), feedback FETs, and impact ionization FETs. Steeper SS devices incorporate more energy-efficient switching. The devices based on band-to-band tunneling phenomenon are known as TFET. The high doping profile is used to incorporate band-to-band tunneling phenomenon in TFET devices. The I on /I off ratio obtained by TFET is better compared to MOSFETs, but the I on is less in TFETs. Like any other technology, TFET has various shortcomings that need to be fixed, such as the low on-state current, complicated and costly fabrication process, random doping fluctuations (RDFs), asymmetric operation between source and drain. Various TFET configurations like heterojunction TFET, L-and U-shaped structure, vertical TFET, pocket doping-based TFET, doping less TFET (DL-TFET), negative capacitance TFET (NC-TFET) and junction-less TFET (JL-TFET), line TFET, electron-hole bilayer TFET that can be employed to overcome all these shortcomings are discussed in this chapter. The hetero-integration of III-V material on silicon substrate, vertical structure, and pocket doping techniques can be used to achieve better the I on /I off ratio. DL-TFET and JL-TFET can reduce the RDF, fabrication cost, and complexity. Integration of negative capacitance effect in TFET can be employed to achieve a much steeper subthreshold swing. This chapter mainly focuses on different types of advanced TFETs structures, their characteristics, and their applications as well.

 Advanced Tunnel Field Effect Transistors MOSFET and Its Drawback Until few past years MOS technology was performing well according to Moore's law, but continuous downscaling has resulted in shifting of the MOSFET technology toward its saturation. Dominant impact of short channel effects is restricting further aggressive scaling of MOSFET. As the transistor gate length is reduced, supply voltage (V DD ) needs to be increased to maintain the overdrive voltage (V DD À V t ), which results in increase in off-state leakage (I off ). The MOSFET has minimum subthreshold slope limitation of 60 mV/dec at room temperature also known as Boltzmann's tyranny  [1, 2] . It signifies that in order to increase the drain current up to one order (10 times), the gate voltage needs to be increased by at least 60 mV. The expression for subthreshold swing (SS) of MOSFET is given by Eq. (45.1)  [1] [2] [3] . S:S ¼ dV g d log I D ð Þ ð Þ ¼ dV g dψ s dψ s d log I D ð Þ ð Þ ð45:1Þ The first term on the right side of the above expression  Δψ s ¼ ΔV g Â C ox C d þ C ox ð45:2Þ The second term dψ s d log I D ð Þ ð Þ in the Eq.  (45.1)  shows the change in bending of surface potential with respect to drain current, which is field-dependent transport term. The relation between drain current and surface potential is expressed by Eq. (  45 .3) I D / exp q ψ s K T ð45:3Þ dψ s d log I D ð Þ ð Þ ¼ ln 10 Â KT q ð45:4Þ At room temperature subthreshold slope of MOSFET can be finally written as S:S ¼ 60 1 þ C d C ox ð45: 5Þ So, the minimum SS that can be achieved MOSFET at room temperature according to Eq. (45.5) is 60 mV/dec that to assuming ideal condition that oxide  capacitance is very large as compared to substrate depletion capacitance or C d ¼ 0 and the proper diffusion current is passing from source to channel. In order to achieve more power efficiency and energy-efficient switching, SS needs to be decreased beyond 60 mV/dec  [4] , which seems to be impossible with current prevalent MOS technology. The IRDS suggests that SS of devices need to be reduced around 40 mV/dec by 2033  [5] . That's why researchers are exploring new ways to achieve sub 60 mV/dec S.S. This can be achieved in two ways, either changing the transport mechanism or employing negative oxide capacitance while satisfying the condition jC ox j > jC d j or both. Tunnel field effect transistor (TFET)  [1, 2, 6] , impact ionization MOS (I-MOS)  [7, 8]  and feedback FET (FB-FET)  [9, 10]  are some of the devices which work on the different transport mechanism and utilize the engineering of second term present in the right side of Eq. (  45 .1) to achieve a steeper S.S. 
 TFET and Its Operating Principle MOSFET devices work on the mechanism of injecting thermal charge carriers over the energy barrier, whereas tunneling field effect transistor operates on inter-band tunneling phenomenon  [1, 2, 6] . The charge carriers can move from one energy band to another energy band at P + -I or N + -I junctions. The inter-band tunneling movement can be controlled by controlling the band bending across the junction with the help of gate biasing. The general structure of n-TFET consists of highly doped source (P + ) and drain (N + ) regions as depicted in Fig.  45 .2. As illustrated in Fig.  45 .3, as the gate biasing is increased, both energy bands of the channel region go down, and when the conduction band of channel region reaches below the valence band of highly doped source region, movement of charge carriers takes place between valence band of source and conduction band of channel, and this is referred as band-to-band tunneling (B2B tunneling). Reverse leakage current resulting from minority carrier diffusion, SRH, and trap aided tunneling (TAT) leakage current is present in OFF state of TFETs  [2] . That's why OFF-state leakage current is significantly very low of the order of 10 À15 to 10 À18 A in TFET  [11] . That's the reason why TFET possesses better I on /I off ratio than MOSFET, but I on of TFET is low, which is one of the major limitations of TFET. The current in TFET depends on inter-band transmission probability of holes and electron. By approximating tunneling barrier as triangular potential, the transmission probability (T WKB ) can be calculated by Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin (WKB) approximation as shown by Eq.  (6, 7) , respectively  [1, 12, 13] . 
 P+ N+ Gate Source Drain Intrinsic T WKB ' exp À 4λ E 3 2 G 2m p 3 j q j h E G þ Δϕ ð Þ ð45:6Þ where E G is energy band gap, m is effective mass of electron, Δϕ is energy-level difference between valence band of source and the conduction band of channel, and λ is total tunneling length, which is inversely dependent on V g . When T WKB is small and varying with respect to gate voltage, then the subthreshold slope (S.S) can be written as given by Eq. (45.7) and when T WKB becomes maximum (¼1) then the S.S can be written as given by Eq. (45.8)  [13] : S:S ' ln 10 ð Þ j q j Â 3qh E G þ Δϕ ð Þ 2 4λ E 3 2 G 2m p ð45: 7Þ S:S ' ln 10 ð Þ j q j Δϕ ð Þ ð45: 8Þ It can be concluded by Eq. (45.7) and (45.8) that for TFET the dependence of S.S on temperature is negligible; rather, it is dependent on tunneling barrier. This also signifies that off-state variations are negligible with rising temperature, which is one of the major advantages of TFET technology allowing them to perform change while IC is heated  [11, 12] . S.S has strong dependence on gate voltage; it varies with gate  
 Advantages of TFET TFET shows excellent switching characteristics even at high temperature as tunneling mechanism has negligible impact of temperature  [14] [15] [16] . Lower variability of S. S is shown in Eqs. (45.7) and  (45.8) . Not only S.S but I d also has negligible dependency on temperature; slight variation of current with temperature is only due to variation of energy gap (E g ). The current is only dependent on the tunneling screening length and not the intrinsic length  [17, 18] , so scaling of device becomes more convenient. Off-state current are lower in TFET when compared to MOSFET device; hence, better I on /I off ratio with a smaller average S.S can be achieved. Moreover, fabrication of TFET is compatible with current CMOS technology. 
 Challenges for TFET Technology TFETs have better performance than MOSFET in various aspects like higher I on /I off ratio, very low leakage current, and steep subthreshold slope. But what is stopping it from becoming commercially popular? One of the main reasons is low on-state current 3-6 order less than MOSFET counterparts. TFET is ambipolar in nature; however, ambipolarity can be suppressed using various techniques  [19] . Fabrication of TFET devices is complex and costly as they require thermal annealing techniques for I on implantation in source and drain regions  [20] [21] [22] . TFET also need abrupt junction for ensuring proper band-to-band tunneling and again creating abrupt junctions while using high temperature process is difficult due to diffusion of dopant atoms from doped (S/D) regions to intrinsic (Channel)  [20] [21] [22] [23] . TFET has greater immunity toward various short channel effects  [24] ; however, highly scaled TFET device shows random doping fluctuations (RDF)  [25] . The RDFs increase the OFF-state current which is undesirable  [26] [27] [28] . Among RDF, random telegraph noise (RTN) shows greater impact on TFET performance; it is due to trapping and de-trapping of carriers at interface majorly at tunneling junction  [29] . 
 Ways to Enhance TFET Performance In order to increase TFET performance, the I on needs to be increased, I off needs to be decreased as low as possible and achieve low S.S over a wide range of drain current. As expressed by Eq. (45.6) tunneling probability depends on various parameters; the values of these parameters can be engineered to obtain high transmission probability which in turn can result in better on-state current. In order to achieve maximum on current and steep S.S, T WKB need to be maximize ('1) for a minimal change in V g . T WKB can be increased by minimizing energy band (E g ), screening length (λ), effective electron mass (m), and increasing Δϕ. Screening length (λ) depends on various parameters like device geometry, gate biasing, gate capacitance, and doping profile at tunnelling junction  [13, 30] . Energy gap (E g ) and effective electron mass (m) are material-dependent properties. Various techniques can be employed to vary these parameters accordingly to boost TFET performance. Some of the techniques are discussed below. 
 Geometry Engineering The gate controllability over the tunneling junction effects the on-state current and SS and by optimizing it, the device performance can be enhanced. Enhanced gate controllability results in lower λ value and hence result in better band-to-band tunneling. Screening length (λ) for planar devices and for wrap around gate cylindrical channel devices can be given as per eqs. (9, 10)  [13, 30] . λ ¼ e r e ox d si d ox ð45:9Þ λ ¼ e r d 2 nw ln d nw þ 2 d ox 8e oxd nw ð45:10Þ where d ox is the oxide thickness, d si is depletion layer thickness of the channel, d nw is thickness of nanowire, ε ox and ε r are permittivity and relative permittivity of channel. High K gate dielectric or overall lower effective oxide thickness (EOT) ensures more gate control over the tunneling junction. Dual gate TFET (DG-TFET), sourcesided overlapped gate structures, and Fin-FET structures are some prime examples utilizing this technique. Overlapping of gate with tunneling region, the drain current can be increased up to 1 order  [31] . Most recent approach in this manner is gate all around (GAA) or Nanowire technique. GAA structures employ more gate controlling (lower λ), resulting in better I on and SS than Fin-FET counterparts. λ can be reduced up to 3-4 folds using GAA structure with same thickness as that of single gate structure  [32] . Introduction of high K dielectric spacers over the source regions also results in enhanced performance. Multigate approaches are also used with metal gates having different work functions to stop backward tunneling by barrier generation; this can reduce ambipolarity and increase band bending at tunneling junction as well  [33, 34] . Moreover, the current of TFET devices depends majorly on screening length and have little effect on channel length. So, the channel length can be reduced up to a certain extent below, which the p-i-n leakage and RDF become more dominant. 
 Doping Engineering The source doping has significant impact on the TFET performance. High source doping and abrupt tunnelling junction facilitate lower λ, resulting in enhanced performance. Drain doping concentration does not have a greater impact on device performance, but lower doping concentration (as source doping need to be high) can be used in drain side as asymmetric doping results in ambipolarity suppression and low OFF-state current  [18, 35, 36] . One more approach is to introduce pocket doping near source region with reverse doping to that of source as shown in Fig.  45 .4. The introduction of pocket doping results in lower tunneling barrier width and also increases the lateral electric field which enhances the on-state current  [37, 38] . 
 Material and Band Engineering Lower energy band gap (Eg) facilitates higher generation rate (G) and transmission probability (T WKB ). Silicon has a band gap of 1.1 eV, and materials like germanium (Ge) (E g ¼ 0.66 eV), Indium Arsenide (InAs) (E g ¼ 0.36 eV), and other materials which have relative lower energy band are used to enhance the device performance as it reduces screening length (λ) and also improves Δϕ. Generally, the low energy band gap material are used in source region which reduces the energy band barrier width at the tunneling junction, and relative higher band gap material are used at the drain side to get higher energy barrier which results in reduction of OFF current, hence overall enhancement in I on /I off ratio. Another parameter is effective mass (m) of electron, reducing it will also enhance performance. Using III-V semiconductor materials can facilitate both improved band bending and lower effective electron mass. Heterojunction TFET devices are able to achieve lower effective energy band than the Homo-junction counterparts, hence results in better performance  [39, 40] . 
 Types of Tunneling Mechanism in TFET Based on the tunneling path due to induced electric field due to gate alignment in TFET tunneling can be distinguished into two types, that is, point tunneling and line tunneling. They were first discovered by Wang  [41] . 
 Point Tunneling In conventional TFETs gate is placed in alignment with source and channel junction (P + -I or N + -I), facilitating tunneling of charge carriers between source and channel inter-bands; this is known as "Point Tunneling" or "lateral tunneling." Point tunneling current starts at lower voltage. According to semiclassical physics approach (WKB approximation), when source doping is assumed to be infinite, the tunneling P+ N+ Gate Source Drain P N+ Fig.  45 .4 Schematic of n-TFET with N + pocket doping near source region  [37]  path is assumed to be circular in nature formed due to electric field from source to gate oxide-channel interface for gate only over the channel configuration as depicted in Fig.  45 .5a. The circular curve seems to move around a central point located exactly above the tunnelling junction somewhere between gate and gate oxide, that is the reason why it is called as "Point tunneling." As the gate voltage increases the tunneling path becomes shorter and straighter. 
 Line Tunneling Another type of tunneling occurs when the gate is overlapped with source region; tunneling in this condition occurs from source toward the oxide (semiconductoroxide interface), which is in vertical direction from source to channel junction and is referred as "Line tunneling" or "Vertical tunneling." In line tunneling paths are straight and perpendicular to channel-oxide interface as shown in Fig.  45 .5b. As V gs increases the band bending increases and when the valence band of the bulk crosses the conduction band of the oxide, band-to-band tunneling occurs. The impact of gate biasing toward band bending is more for line tunneling as the gate is closer to tunneling path, and this signifies that line tunneling requires lesser V GS for same amount of band bending when compared to that of point tunneling. Ideally, the electric field below the gate is uniform over the whole overlapped area, which means all tunneling paths are available simultaneously at a particular bended energy band gap, and as the gate voltage is increased further, more band bending happens, which results in shorter tunneling paths. The current due to line tunneling is proportional to gate overlap length. Line and point tunneling both can be employed in a single structure with alignment of gate over both tunneling junction and channel region.

 Analysis of Various Available TFET Structures The first ever TFET was introduced by Quin et al.  [42]  in 1978. In this work they showed how surface tunneling can be done using band bending on a P + -I -N + device. Since then nearly four decades has been passed and currently researchers are looking an alternative for MOSFET technology, TFET seems to be a suitable candidate. But it has some limitations; the major one is low on-state. So, the researchers are focusing toward improving performance of TFET devices based on techniques discussed earlier in section "Challenges for TFET Technology". Some of the advanced TFET structures are discussed below. Starting the discussion with lateral structures, Boucart et al.  [43]  proposed a dual gate lateral tunnel FET device and studied its characteristics while employing high K dielectric material as gate oxide layer. The structure is shown in Fig.  45 .6. The result suggests that using high K dielectric results in enhanced performance. The device achieves an average subthreshold swing (SS) of 57 mV/dec (less than Boltzmann limit) with I on of 0.23 mA and overall, I on /I off ratio of 2 Â 10 11 for a channel length of 50 nm. Moreover, they also showed that subthreshold swing remains constant with increase in temperature at a fixed gate voltage. Recently, Khan et al.  [44]  proposed a germanium source metal drain TFET with dual dielectric underlap as shown in 10 À4 A/μm, overall I on /I off ratio is 10 13 , and a subthreshold slope of 35 mV/dec is achieved. The conventional TFET devices with P-I-N structure form P-N junctions in the lateral direction conductive path due to gradient variation of doping. Junction-less TFET (JL-TFET) device has a constant doping over the structure, hence no formation of P-N junction  [24, 45, 46] . In JL-TFET P-I-N functionality is developed on N + -N + -N + region by the gate voltage below the flat band voltage similar to charge plasma TFETs. Moreover, they do not require any metallurgical junction; they are simple to fabricate as well. Now let's go through some advanced JL-TFET structures. Devi et al.  [45]  proposed junction-less TFET with a N + SiGe pocket near source end; this incorporates line tunneling in the vertical direction with oxide interface as well as associated with point tunneling in lateral direction. The device is shown in Fig.  45 .8. They suggested that the device can be used for digital inverters as well. The device shows excellent S.S of 43.6 mV/dec and I on of 5.7 Â 10 À4 A/μm, which is twice to that of the conventional junction-less TFET without pocket doping. Tripathi et al.  [46]  also proposed JL-TFET but with a single gate and Si 1-x Ge x pocket doping with mole fraction of 0.3 in between source and channel region as shown in Figs.  45 .9 and 45.10. Incorporation pocket reduces the gate to drain capacitance, resulting in more enhanced switching power performance. At room temperature the device shows drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL) and S.S of 2.1 mV/V and 52.3 mV/dec with gate length of 15 nm, respectively. They also studied effect of temperature variation in 250-400 K in various parameters like I ON , I off , S.S, and DIBL. Now coming toward doping less TFET (DL-TFET) structures employing charge plasma technique to incorporate tunneling. The conventional doped TFET structure requires thermal annealing techniques which increases fabrication cost and complexity; moreover, they are more prone to random doping fluctuations. Doping less TFET devices do not require complicated and costly fabrication processes, and they are more to immune random fluctuations as well  [23] . The first doping less TFET was proposed by Kumar et al.  [23]  as shown in Fig.  45 .9 Schematic of JLSGTFET with pocket doping  [46]  both sides in this structure. The result shows I on of 0.56 mA/μm, I on /I off of 9 Â 10 13  and average subthreshold slope of 48 mV/dec. Recently, Mishra et al.  [48]  proposed a doping less dual gate tunnel field effect transistor (DL-DG-TFET) with Si 0.5 Ge 0.5 as source material; the structure is shown in Fig.  45 .12. In this work researchers employ dual gate one acting as control gate over the channel to modulate the flow majority charge carriers, whereas the fixed gate is kept above source region to develop P region. Work function of fixed gate is kept to be 5.93 eV, whereas work function of drain electrode is 3.9 eV as that in all charge plasma devices. The source region doped with Si 0.5 Ge 0.5 to facilitate lower energy band gap which in turn lower the tunneling screening length. The S.S and I on /I off ratio achieved by this device is 19 mV/dec and 5 Â 10 14 , respectively. Let us move toward advanced vertical and vertical nanowire structures. Kim et al.  [49]  fabricated a double gate TFET device vertical channel sandwiched between lightly silicon as shown in Fig.  45 .13. The tunneling in this device is perpendicular to channel. Moreover, gradual doping profile is employed to suppress ambipolar current. The device is also compatible with germanium epitaxial layer growth process, so further device performance can be improved by introducing Ge. This device result in excellent S.S of 17 mV/dec with I on /I off ratio of 10 4 . Shaikh et al.  [50]  proposed a novel DE-QG-TFET device as shown in Fig.  45 .14. This device employs dual lateral source and T-shaped channel structure to increase I on and suppress ambipolarity, respectively. Ambipolar current is suppressed by maximizing tunneling screening length at drain/channel junction. They compared their device with DG-TFET  [43]  and result shows I on improvement by two times with I on /I off ratio improvement to five orders. Nanowire structure provides a gate-all-around configuration which provides more gate controllability than the conventional structures, resulting in lower value of the screening length (λ). This provides higher band-toband tunneling, resulting in enhanced on-state current. Jang et al.  [51]  proposed a Ge-based vertical nanowire TFET cross-sectional view of the device is presented in Fig.  45 .15. Gate-metal-core optimization in this structure provides a wider band-toband tunneling junction, resulting in higher current than in vertical nanowire TFETs. Moreover, germanium provides a lower energy band and reduced relative electron mass. The electrons are tunneled laterally from source toward gate and then vertically drifted down toward the drain. This device shows a S.S of 42.8 mV/dec and I on of 80.9 μA/μm. Madan et al.  [52]  proposed a gate-all-around cylindrical structure (Fig.  45 .16) with overall channel diameter of 20 nm and drain sided overlapping with dual dielectric configured in between gate and substrate; higher dielectric oxide (HfO 2 ) is kept around only the tunneling junction in order to achieve lower screening length and high on-state current, whereas lower dielectric material (SiO 2 ) is used elsewhere to suppress ambipolarity. The main aim of researchers is to improve on-state current with reduced footprint of the device so that high packaging density could be achieved. For that overall tunneling area need to be increased within the device by making structural modifications. L-TFET, LG-TFET, U-TFET, and T-TFET structure employ the same. Now let's discuss about each of the structure in detail. Let us take a fabricated L-TFET structure  [53] . As shown in Fig.  45 .17, tunneling occurs in perpendicular direction (line tunneling). The effective length of channel (L-shaped channel from to drain) is also increased than the planar structure; hence, it is more scalable as well. The improvement in on-state current is nearly more than 3 orders than the planar structure and 2.5 times lesser average subthreshold swing. U-TFET  [54]  is nearly same as that of L-TFET but with slight modification in the structure, generally drain in U-TFET placed in opposite of the source while gate is placed in between them to incorporate a U-shaped channel. This configuration provides a larger effective channel length; hence, device performance is enhanced. An advanced U-TFET structure with InGaAs/GaAsSb heterojunction is proposed by Shih et al.  [55]  as illustrated in Fig. intrinsic InGaAs used as a spacer layer provides controllability over on-state and off-state currents separately. The on-state current of 520 μA/μm and I on /I off ratio of 10 7 is achieved by the device. A similar structure named LG-TFET was proposed by Yang et al.  [56]  as illustrated in Fig.  45 .19. N + pocket is introduced near the source end in both lateral and vertical directions with gate overlapped over the pocketed region in both lateral and vertical direction to incorporate tunneling in both parallel and perpendicular direction of the channel. The channel remains same for U-TFET, but use of overlap gate over pocket region increases the electric field when the device is on, resulting in higher band-to-band tunneling rate and increased on-state current of nearly 50% from the conventional L-TFET structure. Tunneling in both LG-TFET and L-TFET occurs only in one side at source and channel interface, what if source is introduced in both directions of the gate terminal resulting in more band-to-band tunneling. This type of configuration is proposed by Li et al.  [57]  as illustrated in Fig.  45 .20, in which SiGe pocket is introduced in both sides of the source end region, resulting in heterojunction formation. Moreover, the gate is overlapped in both directions to facilitate tunneling same as in case of LG-TFET but in both directions. The gate seems to be T-shaped, that's why it is called H-TG-TFET. Device achieves an on-state current of 7.02A/μm. Moreover, the device increases the gate to source capacitance due to dual sources and decreases gate to drain capacitance so that Miller capacitance does not deteriorate.  Vanlalawpuia and Bhowmick [58]  proposed a L-channel vertical TFET device ON buried layer oxide having germanium doped source with a thin δ doped layer. Due to tunneling parallel to gate electric field high on-state current is obtained. δ doped layer is incorporated to reduce the off-state leakage current as well as to suppress ambipolarity. Average subthreshold slope of 21.2 mV/dec is achieved. The device structure is illustrated in Fig.  45 .21. Lattanzio et al.  [59]  proposed a novel structure called electron-hole bilayer TFET (EHB-TFET). EHB-TFET work on the principal of simultaneous generation of two carrier layers. As shown in Fig.  45 .22, dual asymmetric gates are employed over the P + and N + region. The biasing of gate over the P + region is fixed while the biasing of gate over N + region is varied; after a particular potential difference between both gate, the barrier between P + and N + layer becomes thin, resulting in tunneling of charge carriers. The device shows an average S.S of 12 mV/dec over six decades of drain current and I on /I off ratio greater than 10 8 . Kim et al.  [60]  proposed a vertical electron-hole bilayer TFET grown on buried oxide layer as depicted in Fig.  45  requires underlapping between source-gate (L us ) and drain-gate (L ud ). As the drain underlapping is decreased, ambipolar increases. Due to that I on decreases as well scalability also suffers. Moreover, due to asymmetric structure of conventional EHB-TFET, self-aligned fabrication process is not possible. All these abovementioned issues can be resolved using vertical structure of EHB-TFET. It has symmetric structure facilitating self-aligned fabrication process, high scalability, and suppressed ambipolarity. Employing negative capacitance in the gate oxide region can lower the subthreshold swing of field effect transistors as discussed in section "MOSFET and It's Drawback". TFETs already possess lower S.S; what if negative capacitive effect is employed on TFET will it further decrease S.S? Yes, that's possible as shown by work and demonstrated in work  [61] [62] [63] [64] . NC-TFET possesses both benefits of negative capacitance and band-to-band tunneling mechanism. Negative effect provides more control over band bending, resulting in more efficient band-to-band tunneling  [62, 63] . NC-TFET has lower threshold voltage, lower subthreshold swing, and improved on-state current than TFET counterparts  [64] . Sohag et al.  [64]  proposed a NC-TFET with dual source GaSb/InGaAsSb/InAs heterojunction structure, and compared with its TFET counterpart, the structure is shown in Fig.  45 .24. Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 (HZO) is used as a ferroelectric material and stack in between oxide layer. Same TFET structure without negative capacitance yields lowest S.S of 21.9 mV/dec, which reduces to 17.37 mV/dec with introduction of Fe material. Threshold voltage also reduces to 0.275 V from 0.65 V. The I on /I off also improves nearly by 0.5 orders.

 Introduction of Lead-Free Halide Perovskites The emergence of new materials for the future generation energy-related applications has gained more importance for modifying such materials by means of chemical and physical approaches. Organic-inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites (OH-LHPs) and pure-inorganic lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are intensively studied for potential optoelectronic applications such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells, photodetectors, sensors, etc.  [1] [2] [3] . Because of their exciting optical properties, lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are considered as future generation materials for multipurpose applications. Compared with traditional semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) such as CdSe, CdTe, InP, etc., LHP NCs are having different surface properties and so synthesis of these materials is also having significant importance. Also, without the passivating shell, the NCs of LHPs have demonstrated highest ever reported photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), up to near-unity  [4] [5] [6] . Moreover, with respect to the halides in the structure, the PL spectrum could be varied from 400 nm to 700 nm in the visible region. Synthesis of LHP NCs have been demonstrated through different approaches, namely, ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP), colloidal hot-injection method, spray deposition, mechanochemcial synthesis, etc.  [7, 8] . In all these methods, LHP NCs are prepared in the presence of different solvents, ligands, and different morphologies with interesting functional properties are achieved. Also, the stability of the LHP NCs also has improved by means of potential organic ligands with different functionality. Perovskite nanomaterials have proven as suitable for different kind of substrates which include glass, fabric, and flexible polymeric substrate  [9, 10] . With all these successful outcomes, we can say that perovskite nanomaterials are capable of fabricating future generation devices with different architectures. However, the use of heavy element lead (Pb 2+ ) is always a problematic issue for the environment and so development of lead-free perovskite NCs is intensively focused in the recent years  [11] . In this view, considerable achievements have been made in the development of lead-free halide perovskite NCs (LFHP NCs) with interesting structural and optical properties  [12, 13] . Elements such as tin (Sn), germanium (Ge), and copper (Cu) are found to be efficient in forming halide perovskite structure and properties of these elements based LFHP NCs are showing promising results for the fabrication of highly efficient optoelectronic devices. Out of others, Cu-based perovskite NCs are showing interesting structural and optical properties and their applicability to fabricate different kind of devices is explored in the recent years  [14, 15] . When Cu ions are doped or treated with the inorganic halide perovskite NCs, the PLQY is incredibly enhanced and this is used for several potential applications  [16] [17] [18] . Specifically, these Cu-LFHPs have proven exemplary optical properties with high PLQY. Also, their carrier transport properties have stimulated to examine them in order to fabricate highly efficient optoelectronic devices. Besides, the solvent and ligands related with the synthesis of Cu-LFHP NCs are delivering interesting results with the size, shape, and other aspects. In this scenario, it is imperative to understand about this interesting compound NCs to explore for several applications. This book chapter discusses about the current developments in synthesis, properties, and applications of the Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 (X¼Cl, Br, I) perovskite NCs. Cesium Copper Halide Perovskites (Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 X5Cl, Br, and I): 
 Structure and Properties The band gap of the Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs is reported over $4 eV, and this shows that all these NCs are exhibiting as direct bandgap materials  [19] . The inorganic framework of these materials is generally influenced by two factors, namely, (a) number of Cu (I) ions in the repeating unit and (ii) average number of bridging halides  [20] . Experimental results show that formation of Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs takes place through forming tetrahedral or trigonal planar network. It is known that LHP NCs are having octahedral structural arrangement, and when these octahedral networks are isolated by ligands and solvent molecules, they are strongly confined. On contrary with this, Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs are adopting either tetrahedral or trigonal planar network. In general, it is identified that two kind of isomers exists with the Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 , namely, αand β-form. In this, only α-Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 exists as tetrahedral (CuX 4 3À ) or trigonal planar form (CuX 3 
 2À ), which leads to the zero-dimensional network, whereas β-Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 consists of two substructures which share one bridging halide, resulting in a one-dimensional network  [20] . Also, these two isomers possess repeating Cu 2 X 5 3À units. Such confined atmosphere ultimately results in intrinsic self-trapped exciton (STE) in Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs. This STE is the specific property of the Cs 3 Cu 5 X 5 and this significantly influences the PL properties of the NCs. For a case of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 , this happens due to the soft lattice nature through which structural distortions occur when [Cu 2 I 5 ] 3À cluster get excited  [21] . This free e-s however get trapped in the lower-energy self-trapped states owing to the photoacoustic coupling effect, and this causes a structural distortion which strongly influences on the PL spectrum, typically a large stokes shift  [22] [23] [24] [25] . This large stoke shift ultimately helps to achieve reabsorption-free Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs to examine future generation device applications  [26, 27] . The structural reorganization can be further explained through Jahn-Teller effect. Here, Cu(I) halide with d 10 closed shell geometry forms a distorted Cu(I)-d 9 distorted geometry during photoexcitation, which makes self-trapping effect  [28] [29] [30] . The self-trapping depth is dependent on the halides and it is generally in the order of Cl > Br > I  [31] . In the case of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs, from the X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), the structure is always exhibited as orthorhombic structure. Usually, hot-injection method assists to form a phase-pure product as observed during the preparation of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 nanorods (NRs) and CsCu 2 I 3 NCs  [32] . Along with large strokes shift and broad PL emission, this STE is usually identified in Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 through the transient measurement analysis, which is inferred a broad excited state absorption plateau in the wavelength region 400-700 nm  [33] . As a direct bandgap material, in Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs the valence band is contributed by Cu 3d orbital whereas conduction band is related with the Cu 4s orbital. The 3d 10 orbitals hybridize with the p orbitals of the halogen for the effective bonding purpose. The schematic diagram of the representation of STE is given in Fig.  46 .1. Considering the optical properties, owing to their large bandgap values, these NCs generally absorb light in the ultraviolet (UV) region. The Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs exist two absorption peaks in the ultraviolet (UV) region, whereas their bromide and chloride counterparts show only one absorption peak. For the nanoplates of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs, a sharp excitonic peak is observed at the wavelength 285 nm  [32] . For a spherical NCs, the typical emission peak lies at 445 nm, as observed in many cases  [22] . The PL emission of these NCs can be tuned in the range of 440-515 nm through varying halides. This emission peak is dependent on size, shape, and composition, and this can be modified by exchanging halides like lead halide perovskite NCs  [34] . Furthermore, these NCs generally possess large exciton binding energy values. For example, it is observed that the exciton binding energy value of the nearly spherical-shaped Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs (size ¼ 20 AE 2.5 nm) is 371 meV, which envisages the PL emission through exciton recombination  [33] . For spherical NCs, the calculated exciton binding energy value is still lower than this and for a case, for the average diameter of 15.5 nm, it is 138.4 meV  [22] . However, this is not a free-exciton recombination mechanism as observed in the case of LHP NCs. Interestingly, on contrary with the CsPbX 3 NCs, these NCs exhibit PL emission at higher wavelength when introducing the halides from I À to Cl À . The PL emission energy of these NCs is related with several factors which includes bandgap, exciton binding energy, lattice distortion energy, self-trapping energy, etc., and this is represented by the following equation  [35] : Along with other properties, morphology of these NCs significantly influences on the optical properties. For example, it is found that zero-dimensional Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 QDs typically have the absorption peak at the 285 nm whereas the 1-D nanorods of the same have the absorption peak at 330 nm  [33] . A similar kind of variation in the peak position is also observed in their PL spectra. Also, in this case, the QDs exhibited blue emission with the impressive PLQY 65%, whereas NRs showed only 5% PLQY. This higher PLQY of QDs may be attributed with the strongly confined or localized electrons, which enhance the PL properties. This impressive PLQY is higher than the previously reported zero-dimensional Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs  [35] . In another study, it is found that reaction temperature is significantly affecting the PLQY of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs and at 80 C, the best PLQY 82.7% is achieved  [36] . In general, different percentage of PLQY has been reported in the case of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs and this typically varies between 30% and 90% depending on the synthesis conditions, morphology, quality of the NCs, and analyzing conditions. Unlike pure-inorganic lead halide perovskite NCs, a large stokes shift is observed in the UV-visible and PL spectra of the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs. This is due to the large energy difference between Cu(I) d 10 and Cu(II)d 9 orbitals and also here Cu(II) exhibits a strong Jahn-Teller effect. In the case of PL emission spectra, the variation is strongly influenced on the morphology similar to absorption spectra. It is observed that the nanoplates morphology of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs exhibits a PL emission peak centered at 444 nm, whereas nanorods of the same show emission at 561  [32] . In the case of thermal quenching property, it is experimentally found that zero-dimensional Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs exhibit poor whereas the 1D Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs exhibit better thermal quenching  [37] . Compared with the pureinorganic lead halide perovskite NCs, the full-width hall maximum (FWHM) value of these NCs shows a large value which strongly conveys the significant variation in the morphology of the prepared NCs. 
 Synthesis of Cesium Copper Iodide Perovskite Nanomaterials Through Colloidal Route Synthesis of Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs is carried out through two different approaches, namely, ligand-assisted reprecipitation method (LARP) and colloidal hot-injection method. In LARP approach, the precursors dissolved in the solvents with different polarity (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO], dimethyl formamide (DMF), etc.) are mixed together to achieve highly monodisperse, crystalline NCs. It is well known that the surface properties of the CsPbX 3 NCs are hardly affected by the solvents, ligands, and additives because of their ionic nature. The structural aspect of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs is interesting owing to the presence of copper ions. According to the literature, formation of these NCs is accompanied through the formation of [Cu 2 I 5 ] during the reaction. With respect to the oxidation state of copper ions, there are two kinds of structures namely tetrahedral [CuI 4 ] and trigonal planar [CuI 3 ] could exist in this [Cu 2 I 5 ] cluster. These two units edge share with the [Cu 2 I 5 ] cluster which is isolated by Cs + ions  [29, 35] . The another potential approach of synthesizing Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs is using hot-injection method. In this method, unlike pure inorganic lead halide NCs, these NCs are prepared at lower temperature. For the synthesis of perovskite NCs, most of the literature describe about the use of colloidal hot-injection method. In specific, the well-known higher boiling point solvents such as oleylamine (OAm), oleic acid (OA), and 1-octadecene (1-ODE) are playing inevitable role in achieving highly stable NCs with different morphology. In the case of Cu-LFHP NCs, hot-injection method plays a key role in synthesizing size-and shape-oriented NCs. It is found that for the preparation of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs, the use of oleylammonium iodide (OAm-I) could serve as efficient precursor to generate narrow size-distributed rod like morphology  [35] . Here, it is important to note that together with serving iodide (I À ) ions, OAm-I reduces Cu 2+ to Cu + . Moreover, despite the lower PLQY (29.2%), the prepared Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs in this approach have showed high PL stability, which is over 45 days. On the other hand, the stability of Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 and Cs 3 Cu 2 Br 5 is found to be less under ambient conditions and so it is advised to prepare these NCs under inert atmosphere. Use of iodide precursor, for example, InI 3 , is found to be significantly influencing on the synthesis temperature ($180 C) and optical properties of the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs  [27, 38] , and further additive engineering of these compound NCs would help to achieve near-unity PLQY. Along with morphology and optical properties, composition of the NCs is influenced by the solvents. For instance, high volume of OAm induces the formation of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs, whereas the low volume of the same promote the formation of CsCu 2 I 3 NCs  [39] . This concept is also valid with respect to the OA, where near-unity PLQY is achieved in the case of Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 and Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs  [40] . With respect to temperature, formation of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs is favored at low temperature (80 C), whereas above 120 C, it converts to CsCu 2 I 3 phase  [36] . This phase transformation is also influenced by the halide and in general Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 formation is encouraged in the presence of haliderich atmosphere  [38] . Moreover, this phase transformation, that is, from Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 to CsCu 2 I 3 , can occur in the presence of water or by a polar solvent  [36, 40] . Despite these, morphological analysis shows that it is difficult to identify the CsCu 2 I 3 phase through high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis despite existence of peaks observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern  [41, 42] . The typical XRD patterns, crystal structures, PL emission spectra, and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analysis of the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 and CsCu 2 I 3 NCs are given in Fig.  46.2.  Other than PL, Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs show superior thermal stability which is confirmed through thermogravimetric analysis  [33, 38] . The high stability is also speculated as attributed with the non-diffusion of copper vacancy (V cu ) in the [Cu 2 I 5 ] 3À cluster  [22] . Because of these higher stability factors, Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs are examined with different aspects by several research groups and interesting results are demonstrated. Although this work describes about the reduction of divalent copper ions to monovalent in the presence of OAm, it is not generally observed  [33] . Similar to lead halide perovskite NCs, surface ligands are playing important role in enhancing PLQY of the Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs. Wang et al. prepared Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs using colloidal hot-injection route and the prepared NCs showed absolute PLQY $87%  [22] . Here, the authors used traditional higher boiling point solvents OAm and OA to achieve spherical NCs with the average size 17.5 nm. Likewise, the ratio of OA/OAm is 1:1 and Cs/Cu is 1:5, disc-shaped Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs is achieved  [36] . The PLQY of the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs could be improved through additive engineering. For example, use of indium iodide (InI 3 ) during synthesis result NCs with 96.6% PLQY  [38] . Earlier, the same approach had demonstrated to achieve Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs with 73.7% PLQY  [27] . This is further achieved to 97.2% through dual capping strategy by means of potassium oleate (K-oleate)  [43] . These analyses are assuring that further use of novel additives could enhance the PL properties and could help to keep it for longer duration. Although the surface of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs is compatible with the long chain organic ligands, it is found that not all ligands are providing the stabilization to the prepared NCs. For example, the interaction of 2-hexyldecanoic acid is poor with the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs in hexane, and this causes a kind of collapsed network in the solution  [32] . Once the NCs are prepared, they are centrifuged and purified and redispersed in appropriate solvents. Mostly, antisolvents such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, etc., are used for purification, which is similar with the lead halide perovskite NCs. Interestingly, Cheng et al. used antisolvent-free gel permeation methodology to purify the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs with the assistance of toluene  [43] . Here, the prepared NCs are dropped on a polystyrene bed along with toluene and the excessive ligands are removed by the polystyrene layer. Such novel approaches will help to avoid requisition of excessive solvents for the purification. Similar to LHP NCs, these compound NCs can be synthesized using ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) approach. Li et al. used dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and toluene to prepare Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs at room temperature  [41] . Here, the precursors are mixed together in DMSO and added with toluene to prepare NCs. Impressively, the PLQY of the Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs synthesized through this method shown near-unity ($100%), whereas in the case of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs it was 30%. This shows that hot-injection method enables to produce Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs with high PLQY. This room temperature preparation method also used to prepare quantum dots (QDs) of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 (size: $4.33 nm) in a confined structure of metal-organic framework, for example, MOF-74  [44] . Jiang et al. have prepared Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs using solid-state reaction method  [45] . Here, the precursors are mixed together using a mortar and allowed a high temperature reaction at 400 C for 6 h. The same research group have demonstrated a scale-up process of this method which provides NCs with high stability up to 2 years  [46] . These methods are showing promising directions in synthesizing Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs with different methods. The morphology of Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs is influenced by different factors that include solvents, ligands, ration between precursors, temperature, etc. For example, the nanorods (NRs) morphology of the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs is achieved through high temperature ($ 110 C), whereas low temperature resulted nearly spherical-shaped QDs ($70 C), and this observation is varied with the Cs 3 Cu 2 Br 5 NCs  [33] . Similarly, Vashista et al. observed a hexagonal nanoplate like morphology with the size $43 nm when the authors carried out the synthesis of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs at 110 C  [32] . Modification in the variation of temperature also influence on the Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs especially formation of nanorods with high PLQY is resulted at 150 C  [47] . Increasing the synthesis temperature with the assistance of precursor like InI 3 results in nanobricks like morphology with the thickness 10 nm and width of around 20-30 nm  [27] . Interestingly, polygon and hexagonal prism-shaped Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs, disc-shaped Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs, long oval-shaped Cs 3 Cu 2 Br 5 NCs are also achieved through hot-injection method under different synthesis conditions  [26, 34, 48] . Compared with hot-injection method, the LARP method produces extremely smaller size Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs which is 2.68 nm AE 0.80 nm  [41] .  Le et al.  have investigated about the influence of length of amines and acids on the morphology of the Cs 3 Cu 2 Br 5 NCs  [49] . Interestingly, here the authors observed the morphology is varied with respect to the chain length of acid/amine pair. In this case, use of hexylamine/hexanoic acid (C6) results in irregular-shaped polydisperse NCs, and use of nonylamine/nonanoic acid (C9) results in nanocuboid morphology, whereas it turns out as nanospheres for the chain length C9 to C18. The schematic representation of the formation of different morphologies of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs using hot-injection method is given in Fig.  46    [29] . Here, the addition of MnI 2 promotes the formation of Cu-oleate rich atmosphere in the reaction medium which promotes the uniform morphology. Moreover, here the morphology influence is observed as higher in the case of MnI 2 than the ZnI 2 . Irrespective of these findings, the formation mechanism of these NCs is yet to be explored to find the important steps for the morphological transformation. Other than Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs, the other counterpart Cs 3 CuX 4 NCs are also getting interested for potential applications. Through LARP method, Yang et al. have observed that by varying the ratio between CsBr and CuBr 2 , the PL peak position of the Cs 2 CuBr 4 QDs could be varied from 466 nm to 388 nm  [52] . This is because when varying the size from 14.2 nm to 4.2 nm, this reflects on the optical properties. The authors have observed a similar kind of trend in the case of Cs 2 CuCl 4 QDs. This strongly reveals that size of the cesium copper halide perovskite NCs could be systematically controlled by the precursor ratio. Similarly, Cs 2 ZnCl 4 QDs prepared using hot-injection method reveal about the role of Cu(I) ions which act as the luminescence center  [53] . Here, the prepared QDs have shown impressive PLQY which is $55%. Likewise, a reasonable PLQY has been achieved (48%) with the CsCu 2 Cl 3 prepared by solid-state synthetic method  [54] . All these investigations reveal that further analysis on these interesting compounds in a nanoscale will clearly help us to achieve NCs with excellent optical properties. The stability of Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs is varied with respect to their composition. Since Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs are easily oxidized, the rate of structural transformation of these NCs is identified as quite rapid and difficult to understand. Despite of oxidation, the life-time of the Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs is observed as extremely higher than their counterparts, which is $136 μS  [35] . When reducing the temperature, it is found that Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs could reach the life-time 877.7 μS at 20 K  [27] . This longer life-time of the prepared NCs supports for their high PLQY, which is useful for the fabrication of the optoelectronic devices. 
 Applications of Cesium Copper Iodide Perovskite Nanomaterials Like LHP NCs, Cu-LFHP NCs are useful to fabricate optoelectronic devices owing to their higher PL emission properties. Also, these NCs also could be blended with a polymer like polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and can be used for the fabrication of light emitting diodes (LEDs). Because of the higher stability and interesting optical properties, Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs are widely used for this purpose. A LED fabricated using Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs with the device structure Al/LiF/TPBi/Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 /NiO/ITO, the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) $1.12 eV was achieved at 7.5 V  [22] . Because of their deep blue emission, Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs are coupled with yellow phosphors to fabricate white-light emitting diodes (WLEDs)  [38] . It is also possible to couple these NCs along with highly luminescent traditional core-shell NCs assembly such as CuInS 2 /ZnS and such composite structure is quite useful to fabricate UV-excited white-LEDs  [34] . Liu et al. prepared Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs embedded with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to fabricate a photodetector, and the authors have achieved the maximum external quantum efficiency of 19.6% at 265 nm which is higher than the bare film (3.3%)  [50] . Assembly of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs with PMMA has also been found to be resistant to water for long time and providing stability  [43, 55] , and this approach is useful to fabricate devices with long-term stability. Also, together with green-emitting Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs, this composite structure could be used for the fabrication of white-LEDs which have maximum luminescence of 1558 cd/m 2  [40] . Similarly, when Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 QDs are embedded within the pores of MOF-74, this composite is found to be useful for the temperature detecting purposes  [44] . Other potential applications such as development of smart and security inks for the identification of counterfeiting currency  [38] , near-UV phototransistor  [45] , luminescent solar concentrator  [26] , X-ray scintillator applications  [27, 56] , photon managing device  [48]  also demonstrated using Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs. It is found that the scintillation performance and stability is improved when Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs are doped with thallium (Tl)  [55] . These experimental demonstrations are assuring that properties of these less-toxic perovskite NCs can be improved for the large-scale industrial production of experimentally demonstrated optoelectronic devices. 
 Summary and Conclusion The structural and optical properties of the Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs clearly show that they are unique class of nanomaterials for the future generation flexible devices. The current investigation results clearly show that Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs are emerging promising materials for the potential applications in various fields. Further analysis of these NCs will help to explore future avenues in the directions of fabricating composite structures and alloyed systems. Besides, the composites of these NCs are showing higher stability which helps us to explore further avenues in different fields. In terms of synthesis view, large-scale synthesis of these NCs is still in the initial phase and advanced strategies such as micro fluidic reactor approaches will ease the existing setbacks in near future. It is expected that efforts in these directions will explore novel ways to enhance the processing and application of these NCs for variety of applications.

 Contents Introduction The memory semiconductor industry plays a vital role in powering the digital revolution by providing essential components for data storage and retrieval in electronic devices  [1] .

Continued research and development in advanced transistor technologies are essential to drive further innovation and unlock new possibilities in the realm of electronic devices and integrated circuits. 
 Power Management Techniques in System-on-Chip (SoC) Power Reduction Techniques in SoC Power reduction is a critical aspect of system-on-chip (SoC) design, as it directly impacts energy efficiency, battery life, and overall system performance (Fig.  56 .2). To address the growing demand for low-power electronic devices, various power reduction techniques have been developed and implemented in SoC design. One widely used power reduction technique is power gating, which involves selectively turning off power to idle or inactive blocks within the SoC. By isolating these inactive components, power gating significantly reduces leakage power consumption, which is a major contributor to total power dissipation. Power gating can be implemented at different granularity levels, ranging from individual transistors to larger functional blocks or subsystems. The effectiveness of power gating depends on accurate power management and control, ensuring that power is properly managed during various operational states. Another important technique is clock gating, which involves disabling or gating the clock signal to idle portions of the circuitry. Clock gating is particularly effective in reducing dynamic power consumption by eliminating unnecessary clock cycles and associated switching activities in idle components. By selectively enabling clocks only when required, clock gating reduces power consumption without compromising system functionality. However, careful consideration must be given to the design and synchronization of clock signals to avoid timing violations and functional errors. In addition to power gating and clock gating, voltage scaling is a widely adopted technique for power reduction. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) allows for the adjustment of operating voltage and clock frequency based on workload and performance requirements. By scaling the voltage and frequency dynamically, SoCs can operate at lower power levels during periods of reduced computational demand, leading to significant energy savings. DVFS techniques require accurate power and performance monitoring, as well as efficient control mechanisms to ensure smooth and reliable transitions between voltage and frequency states. Furthermore, architectural optimizations and design choices can contribute to power reduction in SoCs. Techniques such as data and instruction compression, efficient memory management, and power-aware interconnect design can lead to reduced power consumption without sacrificing system performance. Additionally, the use of low-power design styles, such as asynchronous logic or near-threshold voltage operation, can further enhance power efficiency in SoC designs. 
 Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling in SoC Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a power management technique widely employed in system-on-chip (SoC) design. DVFS enables the adjustment of operating voltage and clock frequency based on the workload and performance requirements of the system. By dynamically scaling the voltage and frequency, SoCs can operate at lower power levels during periods of reduced computational demand, resulting in significant energy savings. The key idea behind DVFS is to match the voltage and frequency levels to the system's immediate requirements. During periods of low activity or idle states, the voltage and frequency can be reduced to minimize power consumption. Conversely, during periods of high computational demand, the voltage and frequency can be increased to ensure optimal performance. Implementing DVFS in SoCs requires accurate power and performance monitoring. Voltage and frequency scaling decisions must be made based on real-time feedback from the system, such as workload analysis, temperature measurements, or power consumption monitoring. Advanced power management units and algorithms are employed to dynamically adjust the voltage and frequency levels, ensuring a balance between power efficiency and performance. DVFS techniques can be applied at various levels within the SoC. At the system level, global voltage and frequency scaling can be implemented to adjust the overall power consumption and performance characteristics of the entire SoC. This approach provides a high-level control mechanism and allows for system-wide power optimization. At the block or functional unit level, localized voltage and frequency scaling can be applied to specific components or modules within the SoC. This fine-grained control enables power optimization at a more granular level, targeting areas of high power consumption or performance bottlenecks. While DVFS offers significant power reduction benefits, it is essential to consider the trade-offs associated with voltage and frequency scaling. Lowering the voltage and frequency levels too aggressively can result in degraded system performance or even functional failures. Therefore, careful analysis and characterization of the SoC's performance and power characteristics are crucial during the design phase. Efficient control mechanisms, feedback loops, and adaptive algorithms are implemented to ensure smooth transitions between voltage and frequency states and to maintain system stability and reliability. 
 Power Delivery Network Design in SoC Power delivery network (PDN) design is a critical aspect of system-on-chip (SoC) design, as it plays a crucial role in ensuring reliable and efficient power distribution to all components and subsystems. With the increasing complexity and power density of SoCs, the design and optimization of the PDN have become paramount to prevent power-related issues and ensure proper functionality of the system. The PDN is responsible for delivering power from the power source to the individual components of the SoC, while maintaining low power supply noise and voltage drop. The primary goal of PDN design is to minimize power supply noise, which can cause functional errors, timing violations, and reliability issues. Power supply noise is a result of current fluctuations and parasitic effects in the interconnects and power distribution network. Voltage drop, on the other hand, refers to the decrease in voltage that occurs as current flows through the interconnects and power distribution network. To address power delivery challenges, several design techniques and optimizations are employed in PDN design. These techniques include careful power grid architecture design, power bus sizing, decoupling capacitance placement, and signal integrity analysis. Power grid architecture design involves the placement and routing of power distribution lines to minimize voltage drop and current crowding. Power bus sizing ensures sufficient current-carrying capacity to avoid excessive voltage drop. Decoupling capacitance placement involves the strategic placement of decoupling capacitors to stabilize the power supply and reduce power supply noise. Signal integrity analysis helps identify potential noise sources, signal coupling, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) issues that can affect the power delivery network. Power delivery network design also takes into account the effects of process variations, temperature changes, and aging effects. These factors can significantly impact the performance and reliability of the power delivery network over time. Therefore, robust design methodologies and optimization techniques are employed to ensure that the PDN can handle variations and environmental changes, providing stable and reliable power distribution throughout the SoC's operational lifetime. 
 Performance Optimization Strategies in System-on-Chip (SoC) Pipeline Design and Optimization in SoC Pipeline design and optimization play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of system-on-chip (SoC) designs. Pipelining is a technique that divides a computational task into a series of sequential stages, enabling the concurrent execution of multiple instructions and improving overall system throughput. This section explores pipeline design principles and optimization strategies employed in SoC designs. In pipeline design, the goal is to minimize the latency of the system by breaking down complex tasks into smaller stages that can be executed simultaneously. Each stage in the pipeline performs a specific operation on the data, and the processed data is passed on to the next stage. This allows for parallel execution of instructions, resulting in increased throughput and improved performance. However, pipeline design must carefully consider potential hazards, such as data dependencies, control dependencies, and structural hazards, which can lead to performance degradation or functional errors. To optimize pipeline design, various techniques are employed. Instruction-level parallelism (ILP) techniques, such as instruction pipelining, superscalar execution, and out-of-order execution, exploit instruction-level parallelism within a single thread to improve performance. These techniques allow the processor to execute multiple instructions simultaneously, overlapping their execution and utilizing available resources more efficiently. Furthermore, branch prediction and speculation techniques are used to mitigate the impact of branch instructions, which can cause pipeline stalls and reduce performance. Branch prediction techniques aim to predict the outcome of a branch instruction before it is resolved, allowing the pipeline to continue execution without waiting for the actual branch outcome. Speculation techniques enable the execution of instructions ahead of the branch instruction, assuming a predicted outcome, and later discarding the results if the prediction was incorrect. Pipeline optimization also involves reducing pipeline stalls and hazards. Techniques such as forwarding, bypassing, and register renaming minimize data hazards and improve instruction throughput. Additionally, compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling, instruction scheduling, and software pipelining, can be employed to optimize code for efficient pipeline utilization. 
 Memory Hierarchy Design in SoC Memory hierarchy design plays a crucial role in system-on-chip (SoC) performance optimization, as memory access is a critical factor influencing system speed and efficiency. SoCs typically consist of multiple levels of memory hierarchy, ranging from registers and caches to main memory and external storage. This section explores memory hierarchy design principles and optimization strategies employed in SoCs. At the highest level of the memory hierarchy are the registers, which provide the fastest and most expensive form of storage. Registers store frequently accessed data and instructions, enabling rapid access and execution. However, their capacity is limited, and they are typically used to store data directly involved in the current execution context, such as operands and intermediate results. Caches, situated closer to the processor, bridge the gap between registers and main memory. They provide a larger storage capacity than registers and serve as a buffer between the processor and main memory. Caches exploit the principle of spatial and temporal locality by storing recently accessed data and instructions. By keeping frequently accessed data in the cache, the memory access time is significantly reduced, improving system performance. Cache design involves considerations such as cache size, associativity, and replacement policies, aiming to maximize hit rates and minimize cache misses. Main memory, or Random Access Memory (RAM), serves as a larger storage medium for data and instructions. It provides a higher capacity than caches but has higher latency and lower bandwidth. Main memory is typically organized into rows and columns, and access to a specific memory location involves row activation, column access, and data transfer. Memory controller design and optimization are crucial to minimize memory access latency and maximize memory bandwidth. External storage, such as solid-state drives (SSDs) or hard disk drives (HDDs), are used for long-term storage and provide even larger capacities. External storage access is significantly slower than main memory, and optimizations such as prefetching, caching, and data compression techniques are employed to improve access efficiency. Optimizing the memory hierarchy involves carefully balancing trade-offs between latency, capacity, and cost. Techniques such as cache optimization, data prefetching, and memory access scheduling are used to improve memory performance. Additionally, techniques like virtual memory management and memory mapping contribute to efficient memory utilization and address space management. 
 Parallelism and Multi-Core Architectures in SoC Parallelism and multi-core architectures are key strategies for performance optimization in system-on-chip (SoC) designs. Parallelism involves dividing a task into multiple subtasks that can be executed simultaneously, exploiting the available hardware resources and improving overall system throughput. Multi-core architectures take advantage of parallelism by incorporating multiple processing cores on a single chip, allowing for the execution of multiple tasks concurrently. Parallelism can be achieved at different levels within an SoC. Instruction-level parallelism (ILP) exploits parallelism within a single thread by executing multiple instructions simultaneously. Techniques such as superscalar execution, out-of-order execution, and speculative execution are employed to maximize instruction-level parallelism. Thread-level parallelism (TLP) involves the simultaneous execution of multiple threads, either within a single application or across multiple applications. TLP is commonly utilized in multi-core architectures, where each core can independently execute a different thread. Multi-core architectures provide increased computational power, as multiple cores can work on different tasks simultaneously, enhancing overall system performance. Parallel programming models and frameworks, such as OpenMP and CUDA, enable developers to express parallelism in their software, effectively utilizing the available hardware resources. These models provide constructs and libraries that simplify the development.

One of the primary aging mechanisms is Bias Temperature Instability (BTI), which occurs due to the build-up of charge traps in the transistor's gate oxide. BTI can result in threshold voltage shifts and degradation of the transistor's performance. Another aging effect is Hot Carrier Injection (HCI), which occurs when high-energy carriers cause damage to the transistor's gate oxide, leading to increased leakage current and reduced reliability. Furthermore, electromigration, stress-induced voiding, and time-dependent dielectric breakdown are other aging mechanisms that can impact the reliability of SoC chips. To address these reliability challenges, various techniques are employed. The use of robust circuit and system design methodologies, such as redundant circuitry and fault-tolerant design, can help mitigate the impact of aging effects. Additionally, temperature-aware design techniques and thermal management strategies are utilized to minimize the thermal stress on the chip and alleviate the effects of temperatureinduced aging. Furthermore, comprehensive reliability analysis and testing are conducted throughout the design and manufacturing process. This includes accelerated aging tests, stress tests, and reliability simulations to assess the chip's performance and ensure its reliability under various operating conditions. Reliability-aware design methodologies, such as reliability-driven optimization and design for reliability, are also employed to enhance the chip's reliability and improve its operational lifetime.

BIST techniques can be applied to various levels of the SoC, including individual cores, memories, input/ output interfaces, and interconnects. One commonly used BIST technique is the application of pseudo-random test patterns, which provide efficient fault coverage and reduce the test time compared to exhaustive testing methods. Pseudo-random test patterns offer good fault coverage by stimulating different operational scenarios and detecting potential faults in the chip. The test patterns are generated by a built-in test pattern generator, and the chip's response to these patterns is analyzed using the builtin response analyzer. Another BIST technique is the use of on-chip test access mechanisms, such as scan chains or boundary scan, which facilitate the efficient testing of the chip's internal components. Scan chains allow for the serial shifting of test patterns into the chip and the capture of output responses, enabling comprehensive testing of the chip's flip-flops and registers. Boundary scan techniques provide access to the chip's I/O pins, allowing for the testing of interconnects and peripheral components. BIST techniques also include error detection and self-repair mechanisms. Error Correction Codes (ECC) are employed to detect and correct errors in memories, ensuring data integrity. The ECC codes are generated and verified by the BIST circuitry, providing error detection and correction capabilities during normal operation. Additionally, redundancy techniques, such as spare rows or columns in memories, can be utilized to replace faulty cells and enhance the reliability of the chip. Overall, BIST techniques enable efficient testing, fault detection, and diagnosis of SoC chips, enhancing their reliability. By integrating test circuitry and applying BIST techniques, designers can ensure that the chip functions correctly and meets the required quality and reliability standards.

ECC and fault-tolerant design enable the detection, correction, and mitigation of errors, enhancing the overall reliability of the chip. This section explores ECC and fault-tolerant design techniques and their role in improving the reliability of SoC chips. ECC is a technique used to detect and correct errors that may occur during data transmission or storage. It involves adding redundancy to the transmitted or stored data, allowing for the detection and correction of errors caused by noise, interference, or faults. ECC codes are generated based on mathematical algorithms, and they are designed to provide a certain level of error detection and correction capability. When data is received or retrieved, the ECC codes are verified and used to identify and correct any errors that may have occurred. ECC is commonly applied to memories, such as RAM or cache, where data integrity is crucial. By detecting and correcting errors in memory, ECC ensures the accuracy and reliability of stored data. The use of ECC codes provides an additional layer of protection against soft errors, which can be caused by various factors such as radiation, electrical noise, or aging effects. ECC techniques can be tailored to the specific requirements of the SoC, considering factors such as error detection and correction capabilities, memory capacity, and performance overhead.

Faults can occur due to various reasons, including process variations, aging effects, environmental conditions, and manufacturing defects. Fault-tolerant design involves incorporating redundancy and error recovery mechanisms to ensure that the chip can continue functioning correctly even in the presence of faults. Redundancy techniques, such as duplication or triplication of critical components, allow for the continued operation of the chip even if one or more components fail. Spare components can be activated to replace faulty ones, ensuring uninterrupted functionality. Redundancy techniques can be applied at different levels, including processors, memories, input/output interfaces, and interconnects. Error recovery mechanisms, such as error detection and reconfiguration, are employed to identify faulty components and take appropriate actions to mitigate their impact. For example, if a fault is detected in a specific component, the system can dynamically reconfigure itself to bypass or disable the faulty component, ensuring the overall system's functionality and reliability.

 Introduction Camera technology has witnessed remarkable advancements over the years, enabling us to capture and preserve precious moments in our lives  [1] . This section provides an overview of the key technologies employed in modern cameras, highlighting their role in enhancing image quality and functionality  [2] . One of the fundamental technologies in cameras is the image sensor. Image sensors are responsible for capturing the incoming light and converting it into electrical signals. There are primarily two types of image sensors used in cameras: complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors and charge-coupled devices (CCD) sensors  [3] . CMOS sensors are widely used due to their low power consumption, high integration capabilities, and faster readout speeds  [3] . CCD sensors, on the other hand, offer excellent image quality and sensitivity, making them suitable for applications where high image fidelity is critical. Analog-to-digital conversion is another essential technology in cameras  [3] . It involves converting the analog electrical signals from the image sensor into digital data that can be processed and stored. The analog signals are sampled and quantized, and then the digital values are encoded for further processing. The quality of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) directly impacts the accuracy and fidelity of the captured image. Signal processing is a crucial aspect of camera technology, responsible for enhancing image quality and implementing various image manipulation functions. Signal processing algorithms are employed to perform tasks such as noise reduction, color correction, image sharpening, and dynamic range adjustment. These algorithms analyze the captured image data and apply mathematical operations to enhance specific aspects of the image  [4] . Noise reduction techniques are employed to mitigate the presence of unwanted noise in the captured images. Different sources, such as sensor noise, thermal noise, and photon noise, can contribute to the overall noise level  [4] . Various algorithms and filters are applied during image processing to reduce noise and improve image clarity. Transistors play a significant role in the functioning of camera technologies  [5] . CMOS image sensors utilize an array of transistors to capture and process light  [6] [7] [8] . Each pixel in the image sensor consists of a photodiode and several transistors that amplify and convert the collected charge into electrical signals. The advancements in transistor technologies, such as the scaling down of transistor sizes and the development of new materials, have enabled higher pixel densities, improved sensitivity, and enhanced overall camera performance. 
 Camera Chip Design Image Sensor The image sensor is a critical component of camera chip design, responsible for capturing light and converting it into electrical signals  [8] . It acts as the "eye" of the camera, detecting photons and converting them into charge carriers that can be processed further to produce a digital image (Fig.  58 
 .1). There are two primary types of image sensors used in camera chips: complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and charge-coupled device (CCD) sensors  [9] . CMOS sensors have gained popularity due to their lower power consumption, faster readout speeds, and higher integration capabilities. They utilize an array of transistors within each pixel to amplify and transfer the captured charge. On the other hand, CCD sensors excel in producing high-quality images with low noise levels, making them ideal for applications that prioritize image fidelity. The design of the image sensor involves careful consideration of several parameters. One crucial parameter is pixel size, which affects the sensor's sensitivity to light. Smaller pixels can capture more detail but may exhibit higher noise levels. Larger pixels, on the other hand, offer improved low-light performance but may In addition to pixel size and array, image sensors incorporate various technologies to enhance performance. For example, backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensors improve light collection by placing the photodiodes on the backside of the sensor, allowing more light to reach the pixels. This technology enhances sensitivity and reduces noise, particularly in low-light conditions. Color filters are another crucial aspect of image sensor design. These filters, typically in the form of a Bayer pattern, allow the sensor to capture color information by selectively filtering light. Each pixel on the sensor is covered by either a red, green, or blue filter, and interpolation algorithms are used to reconstruct full-color images. To optimize image quality, image sensors also incorporate advanced features such as on-chip phase detection autofocus (PDAF) and high dynamic range (HDR) imaging. PDAF enables fast and accurate autofocus by measuring the phase difference between light rays, while HDR imaging combines multiple exposures to capture a broader range of luminance levels, resulting in more balanced and detailed images. 
 Analog-to-Digital Conversion Analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) is a critical component of camera chip design that transforms the continuous analog signals captured by the image sensor into discrete digital data for further processing and storage. This conversion is essential for digitizing the captured image and enabling various image processing operations. The ADC operates by sampling the analog signal at regular intervals and assigning digital values to represent the amplitude of the sampled signal. The accuracy and resolution of the ADC significantly impact the fidelity and quality of the digitized image. Higher resolution ADCs can capture finer details and nuances in the analog signal, resulting in more precise and faithful representation of the image. The performance of the ADC is determined by several key parameters. One important parameter is the sampling rate, which determines how frequently the analog signal is measured. A higher sampling rate allows for better capturing of fast-changing signals and fine details. The bit depth of the ADC, often referred to as the number of quantization levels, determines the precision with which the analog signal is represented digitally. A higher bit depth allows for a greater dynamic range and more accurate representation of color and intensity levels in the image. To achieve accurate and high-quality analog-to-digital conversion, camera chips employ various techniques and architectures. Successive approximation ADCs, delta-sigma ADCs, and pipeline ADCs are among the commonly used architectures in camera chip design. These architectures differ in their complexity, speed, and accuracy, offering trade-offs that must be carefully considered based on the specific requirements of the camera system. In addition to the ADC itself, camera chip designers also focus on minimizing noise and optimizing linearity during the analog-to-digital conversion process. Noise, such as quantization noise and circuit noise, can introduce unwanted artifacts and degrade the image quality. Techniques such as oversampling, noise shaping, and dithering are employed to reduce noise and enhance the accuracy of the digitized signal. Furthermore, the ADC is often integrated with other components in the camera chip to ensure seamless and efficient data transfer. Digital interfaces such as MIPI CSI-2 (Mobile Industry Processor Interface Camera Serial Interface) enable the communication between the image sensor, ADC, and subsequent processing units. These interfaces provide a standardized and efficient way to transmit the digital image data for further processing, storage, and display. 
 Signal Processing in Camera Signal processing plays a vital role in camera systems, enabling various image enhancement and manipulation techniques to optimize image quality and provide advanced functionality. In camera chips, signal processing algorithms are employed to transform the raw image data captured by the image sensor into a final image that meets the desired specifications and visual appeal (Fig.  58 .2). One of the primary objectives of signal processing in cameras is to enhance image quality. This involves compensating for limitations in the image sensor and optical system, correcting for various types of distortions, and improving visual aesthetics. Signal processing algorithms can address issues such as noise reduction, color correction, image sharpening, dynamic range compression, and artifact removal. Noise reduction is an essential aspect of signal processing in cameras. Image sensors inherently introduce noise during the image capture process due to factors such as thermal noise, shot noise, and readout noise. Advanced noise reduction algorithms are employed to effectively reduce these noise components while preserving important image details. Techniques such as spatial filtering, temporal filtering, and advanced denoising algorithms based on statistical models are utilized to achieve optimal noise reduction without sacrificing image sharpness and clarity. Color correction is another critical task in signal processing, ensuring accurate and consistent color reproduction in captured images. Cameras employ color correction algorithms to compensate for colorimetric deviations caused by factors such as different lighting conditions, sensor characteristics, and lens properties. These algorithms adjust the color balance, hue, saturation, and gamma correction to achieve natural and visually pleasing color reproduction. Image sharpening techniques are employed to enhance image details and perceived sharpness. These algorithms exploit local image characteristics to enhance edges and fine structures while minimizing artifacts. The sharpening process involves careful consideration of noise amplification and preservation of natural image textures. Dynamic range compression techniques aim to enhance the visible details in both bright and dark areas of an image. By adjusting the contrast and tonal range, these algorithms ensure that important details are visible even in high-contrast scenes. They prevent overexposure in bright areas and underexposure in dark areas, resulting in a more visually balanced image. Furthermore, signal processing in cameras enables the application of creative effects and filters to images. This includes techniques such as image resizing, cropping, rotation, and applying artistic filters for aesthetic purposes. These features provide users with the ability to add their artistic touch and personalize their images. 
 Noise Reduction Techniques for Camera Noise reduction is a critical aspect of camera technology, aimed at minimizing unwanted noise and artifacts in images to enhance their quality and visual appeal. Cameras employ various noise reduction techniques to mitigate different sources of noise and deliver clean, clear, and sharp images. One common source of noise in camera images is sensor noise, which includes random variations in pixel values caused by factors such as temperature, electronic components, and manufacturing imperfections. To reduce sensor noise, camera chips utilize techniques such as correlated double sampling (CDS) and low-noise amplifiers (LNAs). CDS involves subtracting a reference signal from the pixel's output to eliminate the correlated noise component, while LNAs amplify the weak sensor signals with minimal noise addition. Another type of noise is known as temporal noise, which occurs due to fluctuations in the sensor's output over time. Temporal noise reduction techniques involve averaging multiple frames of the same scene to suppress random temporal variations and produce a smoother and cleaner image. This technique is particularly useful in low-light conditions where the signal-to-noise ratio is low. Shot noise is another significant source of noise in camera images. It is inherent to the physical nature of light and manifests as random variations in the number of photons captured by each pixel. To reduce shot noise, camera chips employ techniques such as oversampling, which involves capturing multiple samples per pixel and averaging them to obtain a more accurate representation of the signal. This technique effectively reduces the impact of shot noise, resulting in improved image quality. Image denoising algorithms play a crucial role in reducing noise in camera images. These algorithms analyze the pixel values and their spatial relationships to distinguish between noise and actual image details. Various denoising techniques, such as spatial filtering, wavelet denoising, and non-local means denoising, are applied to attenuate noise while preserving important image features. These algorithms strike a balance between noise reduction and the preservation of fine details, ensuring that the denoised images remain visually appealing and natural-looking. Noise reduction techniques also consider the trade-off between noise reduction and image sharpness. Aggressive noise reduction algorithms can sometimes result in the loss of image details and a loss of sharpness. To address this, camera chips incorporate techniques such as adaptive noise reduction, which adjust the level of noise reduction based on the image content and the user's preferences. By dynamically adjusting the noise reduction strength, camera chips can deliver images with a balance between noise reduction and preservation of fine details. 
 Transistors in Camera Chips 
 CMOS Image Sensors CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) image sensors are widely used in modern camera chips due to their numerous advantages. These sensors consist of an array of pixels that capture light and convert it into electrical signals. Each pixel contains a photodiode that absorbs photons and generates charge proportional to the light intensity. CMOS image sensors utilize CMOS transistors to amplify and read out the electrical signals from each pixel. These transistors, typically implemented as MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors), play a crucial role in signal amplification, noise reduction, and data conversion. The key advantage of CMOS image sensors is their ability to integrate signal processing circuitry directly onto the sensor chip. This integration eliminates the need for separate processing units and enables on-chip functionality such as analogto-digital conversion, noise reduction, and digital signal processing. It allows for compact camera designs and reduces power consumption. 
 CCD Image Sensors CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) image sensors were prevalent before the widespread adoption of CMOS image sensors. While they are less commonly used in modern camera chips, CCD sensors still find applications in specialized areas that require high-quality imaging, such as scientific and professional photography. CCD image sensors employ an array of pixels, similar to CMOS sensors, but the signal readout mechanism is different. Instead of using transistors to amplify and read out signals, CCD sensors rely on a shift register and charge-coupled elements to transfer charge from pixel to pixel before it reaches the output stage. This charge transfer process enables precise signal processing and noise reduction. One advantage of CCD image sensors is their excellent image quality, especially in terms of sensitivity, dynamic range, and low noise performance. They are wellsuited for applications that require high-resolution and low-light imaging, such as astrophotography and medical imaging.

While CMOS and CCD image sensors dominate the camera market, emerging transistor technologies offer promising opportunities for further improvements. One notable advancement is the use of BSI (Backside Illumination) technology in CMOS image sensors. BSI sensors reverse the conventional sensor architecture by placing the light-sensitive elements on the backside of the sensor, allowing for more efficient light capture. This technology enhances low-light performance and enables the development of compact camera modules. In recent years, fortunately, there has been increasing interest in the use of 2D materials, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides, in camera chips. These materials exhibit unique electrical and optical properties that make them suitable for high-performance transistors and image sensors. Graphene-based transistors, for example, offer high carrier mobility and low noise characteristics, which can improve the overall performance of camera chips. Furthermore, advancements in nanoscale transistor technologies, such as FinFET (Fin Field-Effect Transistor) and nanowire transistors, contribute to higher transistor density, improved energy efficiency, and faster processing speeds. These technologies enable the integration of more complex signal processing circuitry and enhance the overall functionality of camera chips. All in all, transistors play a critical role in camera chips, particularly in image sensors.

These advancements contribute to the development of cutting-edge camera systems capable of delivering exceptional image quality and satisfying the evolving needs of various imaging applications. 
 Performance Optimization in Camera Chip Design Pixel Size and Resolution Pixel size and resolution are crucial aspects of performance optimization in camera chip design. The pixel size refers to the physical dimensions of each pixel on the image sensor, while resolution determines the total number of pixels in the sensor array. Larger pixel sizes offer several advantages in camera chip design. They allow for increased light sensitivity, enabling better performance in low-light conditions. With larger pixels, more photons can be captured, resulting in improved signal-to-noise ratio and reduced noise levels. This leads to sharper and more detailed images. However, larger pixel sizes may limit the overall resolution of the camera as fewer pixels can fit within a given sensor area. Resolution is equally important for performance optimization. Higher resolutions enable the capture of more detail and finer image quality. Increased pixel density allows for more precise representation of the scene, making it suitable for applications that require high levels of detail, such as professional photography and video production. However, higher resolution sensors may exhibit higher noise levels and reduced light sensitivity compared to sensors with larger pixel sizes. Therefore, a balance must be struck between resolution and pixel size to achieve optimal performance. 
 Dynamic Range and Sensitivity Dynamic range and sensitivity are critical parameters in camera chip design, particularly in scenes with varying light levels. Dynamic range refers to the ability of the camera to capture a wide range of light intensities, from the darkest shadows to the brightest highlights, while maintaining detail in both areas. It is a measure of the ratio between the maximum and minimum detectable signal levels. A camera chip with a high dynamic range can preserve details in both dark and bright areas, producing images with enhanced contrast and rich tonal range. Techniques such as HDR (High Dynamic Range) imaging and multi-exposure blending are employed to extend the dynamic range and capture a broader range of light intensities. Sensitivity, also known as ISO sensitivity, determines the camera's ability to capture low-light scenes with sufficient brightness. Higher sensitivity allows for the detection of faint light sources and improves the camera's ability to gather photons in low-light situations. However, increasing sensitivity can introduce more noise into the image, reducing overall image quality. Hence, achieving an optimal balance between sensitivity and noise is crucial for performance optimization. 
 Low-Light Performance Low-light performance is a crucial aspect of camera chip design, as it determines the camera's ability to capture clear and detailed images in low-light or nighttime environments. Achieving good low-light performance requires a combination of factors, including larger pixel sizes, higher sensitivity, and noise reduction techniques. Larger pixel sizes are beneficial for low-light performance as they allow for more light to be captured, resulting in improved signal-to-noise ratio and reduced noise levels. This leads to better image quality in challenging lighting conditions. Higher sensitivity further enhances low-light performance by increasing the camera's ability to detect and amplify weak light signals. Additionally, implementing advanced noise reduction techniques, such as temporal noise reduction and advanced denoising algorithms, further improves low-light performance. These techniques help suppress noise while preserving image details, resulting in clearer and more vibrant low-light images. 
 Emerging Trends and Future Developments in Camera Technology Backside-Illuminated (BSI) CMOS Sensors Backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensors are a significant advancement in camera technology that offers improved image quality and performance. Traditional frontilluminated sensors have certain limitations that can affect image quality, such as reduced sensitivity and increased noise due to light interference within the sensor layers. BSI CMOS sensors address these limitations by flipping the sensor structure and placing the pixel layer on the backside of the chip. This design allows light to directly reach the pixels without any obstructions, resulting in improved light sensitivity, reduced noise, and enhanced image quality. By maximizing the pixel area for light collection, BSI sensors can capture more photons, especially in low-light conditions, leading to brighter and clearer images.

Compared to single halo TM-SG-TFETs and TM-SG-TFETs based on silicon, the channel potential of DH-GS-TM-SG TFETs based on germanium is lower. Hence, the influence of short channels is mitigated because of the gate and channel engineering employed in this model development. The lowest surface potential is virtually always maintained in the OFF state (zero).

 Figure 24 . 24 Figure 24.9 shows the alteration of drain current concerning gate voltage for different drain-source voltages. As the gate voltage increases from negative to positive, there is a rapid increase in tunneling current. It is achieved by lowering the tunneling width and increasing the drain-source voltages. The graph shows that the tunneling generation rate increases by increasing the value of V DS . The drain current of 1 Â 10 À5 A/μm achieves the drain-source voltage of 0.5 V. Figure 24.10 shows the alteration of drain current concerning gate voltage for different gate work functions. The graph shows that as the work function values lower, the drain current achieves improvement. In this case, for work function ranging between 4.2 eV and 4.5 eV, the drain current increases as 1 Â 10 À4 A/μm.

 Figure 25 . 25 14  shows the IV characteristics of the DMGAA TFET for variant drainto-source voltages such as 0.6 V, 0.8 V, and 1 V. In intrinsic region, the energy bands are hard up down by the positive gate-to-source voltage, and tunnelling occurs between the valence band (VB) of the p þ region and the conduction band. Formation of a very strong electric field is resulted in terms of a high I ON current.

 Alternative transistors have been introduced in recent decades to attain lower SS (<60 mV/decade at room temperature) due to a low-power demand. The tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) is alternate transistor that is most widely discussed. The double-gate junctionless tunnel field-effect transistor (JL-TFET) structure is illustrated in Fig. 25.27. The JL-TFET structure contains two isolated gates called the control-gate (CG) and P-gate (PG), as well as a strongly doped n-type Si channel. To give the channel enhanced controllability, double-gate technology is employed. To create the intrinsic and p-type layer below the gates, two distinct metal work functions are applied to CG and PG. To achieve the best results for the desired performance characteristics, JL-TFETs with variable length of silicon channel, width, doping concentration, and source-drain extension length would have different combinations of work functions for CG and PG. The fundamental concept is without using any physical doping, change the (N + -N + -N+) drain, channel, and source of JLFET into a (N + -I-P+) structure. The I D versus V GS curve for the JL-TFET and conventional TFET (CM-TFET) with identical device parameters, with or without the addition of various model, is shown in Fig. 25.28. It has been noted that the JL-performance TFET's parameter closely resembles the CM-TFET's performance.

 where I d is the drain current, μ n is the mobility of the electron, C ox is the oxide capacitance, W is the width of the channel, L is the length of the channel, V gs is the gate-to-source voltage, and V th is the threshold voltage of the device. The drain current equation is basically the function of technology (μ n C ox ), since the mobility of electron and oxide capacitance cannot be changed unless the semiconductor and oxide material are changed. Hence, it is the function of technology. W/L and voltage (V gs -V th ) are the function of ratio of device width and function of voltages, respectively, as shown in the following equation: I d ¼ f (Technology) Â f (W/L) Â f (Voltage).

This distinguishes TFETs from MOSFETs. Silicon has been used to make TFETs because it is abundant and can be made using established methods. Silicon TFETs have performance constraints. At low supply voltage, silicon-based TFETs have low

 Figure 31 . 31 6 shows the ON-state band diagram of a vertical TFET with different dielectric materials (Al 2 O 3 , HfO 2 , La 2 O 3 , and TiO 2 ). If the gate voltage increases the likelihood of an electron passing through the lowest energy level. Height and width determine a barrier's tunability. Material bandgap sets energy-level-independent potential barrier. The electric field or energy band slope determines the potential barrier size. As gate bias increases, tunneling length lowers, increasing current. The potential barrier of an electron from the source's valence band edge must cross to enter the channel's conduction band. Electric field strength raises gate bias and decreases tunneling length. The rate of tunneling increases, and the current flows more rapidly. Longer barriers improve the possibility of burrowing through them. Hence, the probability of tunneling electrons and their number both rise when the gate voltage is raised. The amount of current via a gate is dependent on its voltage [7-9].

In order to improve the detection figure of merit, BioFETs have been altered both structurally and from an application standpoint. Significant advancements have been achieved in the sector by researchers worldwide, ranging from the planar design of ISFETs to the fin, multi-gate, and hybrid architecture of BioFETs.This chapter focuses on the research and analysis of label-free electrochemical biosensors based on dielectric-modulated TFETs, in which the interaction of biomolecules with TFETs is transformed into observable changes in the electrical parameters threshold voltage, drain current, etc.

 :1Þ In TFETs, the switching is based on modulating the tunneling distance between the device's ON and OFF states, as shown in Fig. 35.8. The valence band and conduction band are not oriented in the OFF state, which prevents the device from forming a tunneling channel, thereby band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) is repressed. The energy band diagram (EBD) of TFET in the OFF state is shown in Fig. 35.9a. The tunneling length is large and roughly equals the channel length in OFF state. The EBD in the ON state is shown in Fig. 35.9b. The energy bands of the channel are shifted downward when a positive gate voltage (V GS > 0) is applied, causing an overlap between the valence band (VB) of the source and the conduction band (CB) of the channel. The S/C junction is then obstructed by a small tunneling barrier. The electrons from the source may tunnel through this barrier and reach the drain

When flowing from source to channel, the surface potential increases at a considerably higher pace. The potential increases throughout varied channel lengths of the halo-doped area. The surface potential is solely determined by the work functions. The three materials' work functions differ from those of other materials. The work functions of the materials utilized in the device structures m1, m2, and m3 are 4.4 eV (Tititanium), 4.95 eV (Momolybdenum), and 5.23 eV (Ptplatinum), respectively. Additionally, the SiO 2 /HfO 2 stacked gate oxide enhances the ON current to a greater extent. Figures 36.35, 36.36, and 36

 Figure 36 . 36 Figure 36.39 depicts the transfer characteristics curve at various gate biases. The decrease in depletion width at the source and channel junction results in an improvement in the lateral electrical field, enhancing the chance of tunneling. The reverse leakage current is often strongly reliant on the density of the high-doped drain end. The reverse tunneling current is restricted in our study because of the broader band gap material employed in the drain-channel interface (Si-Si), and the work function of metal 3 is high in comparison to others, resulting in a reduction in reverse leakage current. As depicted in the graph, the drain current is increased while the ambipolar reduction is decreased.Figure36.40 depicts the current densities at various channel lengths. The movement of charge carriers is caused by the drift of electrons and holes. In this figure, the drain bias (V ds ) is set to 1 volt, and the highest peak current density at V gs ¼ 1 volt is calculated to be 6.25 1006 A/m.The cutoff frequencies (fT) for various gate biases are shown in Fig.36.41. The cutoff frequency is larger than 11 times at V gs ¼ 1.2 v and V ds ¼ 0.8 v. This is accomplished in large part by lowering Miller capacitance and increasing transconductance of the device. The cutoff frequency is calculated for the unity current gain using fT ¼ gm/2. (Cgg).The existence of a source side tunneling barrier enhances the Miller capacitance effect. The cutoff frequency significantly improves. This significantly improves the device's switching behavior, resulting in larger ON

 Figure 38 . 38 Figure 38.4 depicts the surface potential characteristics of the proposed NC DG HJ TFET and the conventional HJ TFET for V DS ¼ V G ¼ 1 V. The presence of a FE layer led to V G amplification, which raised the surface potential. The model closely matches the simulation results except at tunneling junctions due to the following assumptions: (i) abrupt doping and (ii) zero voltage drop near the junctions.Direct BTBT is observed in InAs-Si HJ[3, 20]. The G btbt of the NC TFET and its non-NC counterpart at V DS ¼ V G ¼ 1 V is illustrated in Fig.38.5. The energy band alignment will be more for the NC-based structure since the effective V G is higher. As a result, compared to conventional TFET, the probability of tunneling improves.The drain current distribution with respect to V G varying from 0 V to 1 V and V DS ¼ 1 V for the proposed TFET and conventional TFET in linear scale and logarithmic scale is depicted in Figs.38.6 and 38.7, respectively. Drain current is improved in the proposed TFET compared to the conventional TFET because the tunneling width is narrowed. The reduction of tunneling width is due to an increase in the electric field. Because of the TLA technique, the model and simulation match perfectly. The ON-OFF current ratio is also improved.From Fig.38.7, it is observed that the SS of the NC-based proposed device is improved by a factor of voltage amplification factor, A v . The relationship between SS of the proposed NC TFET S NC TFET and A v is given by

 • In 1943, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts introduced the idea of a "logical calculus" that describes a simple model of biological neuron that could be simulated using electrical circuits. This model, known as the McCulloch-Pitts neuron, formed the basis of early neural network research [1-3]. • In the year 1943, Colossus was a set of computers developed by British codebreakers during World War II to help in the cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher, which was used by the German high command to transmit top-secret military messages. • In 1956, the Dartmouth Conference marked the birth of AI as a field of study. • In the 1970s and 1980s, expert systems were developed, which were rule-based systems that could simulate the decision-making abilities of a human expert. • In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue computer defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match. • In 2011, IBM's Watson computer defeated human champions on the quiz show Jeopardy. • In the year 2012, virtual assistant developed by Google for Android devices. • In 2015, an amazon echo (smart speaker) was developed by Amazon which is designed to respond to voice commands and can perform various tasks, including playing music, providing weather and news updates, setting reminders, and controlling smart home devices.

 Figure 44 . 44 Figure 44.7 depicts the fluctuation of S id as a function of frequency from 10 Hz to 1 GHz. It appears that flicker and G-R noise predominated over diffusion noise at lower frequencies, but diffusion noise predominates at higher frequencies. Equation (44.3), which denotes the power spectral density of flicker noise, can be used to validate the fact[27].

 . 3 . 3 Despite many research findings are claiming the lower PLQY of Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs, Liu et al. achieved $70% PLQY through simply increasing volume of OAm during the reaction [50]. Additives are playing important role on the size and shape regulation of the halide perovskite NCs. Especially iodide-containing additives such as ZnI 2 and MnI 2 are playing important role on this effect. These precursors are influencing on the chemical potential, and hence, equilibrium of the reaction is influenced. Along with the morphology variation, the addition of ZnI 2 is resulting in a higher yield in the reaction [51]. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs under different temperature and with different amount of ZnI 2 and their XRD patterns are given in Fig. 46.4. Li et al. carried out synthesis of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs in the presence of MnI 2 along with CuI and found that when the ratio of CuI/MnI 2 is 4:4 at 160 C, the NCs are found to be smaller with monodispersed distribution

 . The smallest dual gate SOI MOSFETs were developed by Ernst (2003). Volume inversion is at the center of a DG-MOSFET since the device's front and back gates control the electron flow across the channel. A double-gate is activated by supplying a bias including both gates simultaneously. For undoped symmetric double-gate tunnel FETs, Chen et al. (2004) suggested a threshold voltage model. Work function engineering in multi-gate FET is a new method presented to improve a better speed of charge transfer in the channel and to reduce the SCEs. A double material gate field-effect transistor was developed by Long et al. (1999) (DMG FET). The strong electric field is reduced by using two gate metals with different work functions in a dual material gate FET. The voltage level of a device with this layout, also known as a heterostructure FET, is much greater closer to the source end than it is to the drain end. Vertical tunnel FETs were proposed for scaling by Bhuwalka et al. (2005), who developed the method of designing the gate work function and changing the band gap. An accurate prediction for a single halo-doped double metal transistor was designed by Zun-Chao et al. in 2009 (DMSG). Subthreshold swing and ON-state drain current have been improved by the application of gate work function engineering in later-generation tunnel FETs Gate Work Function Engineered Tunnel FET

 T ¼ 300 K m n or effective mass of electron from T ¼ 4 K value (1.06 m o À 1.08 m o ) which is wrong and the correct value of electron DOS effective mass at T ¼ 300 K assuming nondegenerate doping case is 1.18 m o . Now this discrepancy of incorrectly assigning the DOS effective mass for electron at T ¼ 300 K for Si for N c calculation gives wrong Fermi-Dirac integral value from n o /N c calculation and hence wrong E c ÀE F calculation or how close the Fermi level E F is relative to conduction band edge E c . Experimental values available for DOS effective mass of electron at T ¼ 300 K for silicon for n-type are only at few values close to 10 21 /cm 3 , so polynomial fitting done in a reference[13]  is still error prone. For holes DOS at degenerate doping in silicon at T ¼ 300 K for p-type, these values are still not computed experimentally at high doping values, so for DOS hole effective mass, we have no polynomial fitting equation available at T ¼ 300 K for silicon to extract the effective mass of hole at these high degenerate doping close to experimental findings. So, the author believes efforts have to be undertaken to constitute analytical modeling equations for DOS effective masses of electron and hole for silicon at T ¼ 300 K at high doping values and also for conductivity effective masses for electron and hole which determine inversion channel mobility.Using Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) Technique for Atomically Thin Layers Deposition on Substrate, Wafer Stacking, and High-K Dielectric and Metal Deposition in Gate, Source, and Drain Contacts ALD is a layer-by-layer conformal physical vapor deposition technique done in an inert condition so that high precision atomically thin layers can be stacked on wafers like in 2D FETs, wafer-to-wafer stacking for 3D integration, deposition of most high-k dielectric materials within 2-3 nm, and metal deposition of gate, source, and drain contacts. ALD deposited metal do not suffer from poly-grain effects or metal granularity effects that cause work function variation of metal and changes flat band value and threshold voltage value in a FET device with as good as spread of statistical variation comparable to random dopant fluctuations based variation. ALD deposited high-K dielectric do not suffer from interfacial defects such as interface states or border traps than any other growth technique. Acceptor like interface states shift threshold voltage to a positive value and donor like interface states shift threshold voltage to a negative value. Also quality of high-k dielectric and its morphology determine how polarization will be maximum to reduce soft optical phonon scattering and remote Coulomb scattering and ALD technique allows us to reduce these scattering effects coming out of ultrathin high-k dielectric films. ALD contacted source and drain show reduced contact resistivity through reduction of (1) metal induced gap states, (2) dipole formation, and (3) image force induced Schottky barrier height (SBH) lowering as the salicided alloy stoichiometry or mole fraction of alloy is precisely controlled by ALD deposited doped salicided metal alloy contacts of source and drain of a FET device used in advanced architecture. 
 Power management, energy-efficient design, and alternative energy sources help achieve this goal. Power management alters a device's operation and behavior to reduce power usage. Clock, power, and changeable voltage and frequency can do this. Clock gating disables a circuit's clock signal while not in use. Power gating involves turning off a circuit while it is not in use. "Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling" adjusts a device's voltage and frequency to match the load, conserving energy. Energy-efficient design reduces energy use. Switching to low-power processors, memory, and screens can accomplish this. Energy-efficient passive cooling options include heat sinks and thermal management systems. Reduce electronic gadget power usage by using non-battery power sources. Sunlight, motion, and ground heat can be used. Alternative energy reduces the need for batteries and electrical outlets. Batteries may last longer and devices may work better. Low-power devices are not just good for saving money and the environment. Energy efficiency improves gadget performance and user happiness. Saving energy extends battery life. Laptops and phones benefit from this. If the gadget uses less power, it may perform better and respond faster. Energy-efficient technology is needed to grow the electronics industry and save the earth. Energy efficiency in devices saves money, extends battery life, and reduces environmental impact. This improves device operation and user experience.

Title: Cesium Copper Halide (Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 , X5Cl, Br, I) Perovskite Nanocrystals: A Potential Candidate in Lead-Free Metal Halide Perovskite Nanomaterials 46
All-inorganic lead-free halide perovskite nanomaterials are extensively analyzed in the recent years for several kind of optoelectronic applications. Because of their less toxic and high stability, the structural and optical properties are much investigated and proposed with new concepts. Out of others, all-inorganic cesium copper halide perovskite nanomaterials (Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 where X¼Cl, Br, and I) have emerged as potential candidate for the modern generation optoelectronic device structures. These nanomaterials can be prepared through colloidal route and applied as films through solvent-based deposition approaches. Interesting properties such as large UV light absorption coefficient value, high photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY), self-trapping exciton (STE), intrinsic defects in the structure are showing that these materials could be a promising candidate for the future generation optoelectronic devices. Single crystals, quantum dots (QDs), two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures and nanorods of these materials are indeed showing excellent progress for further developments in the area of lead-free halide perovskite nanomaterials. This chapter narrates about the present status of Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 nanocrystals (NCs), which include discussion about their potential synthetic routes, exciting optical properties, and potential applications.
Introduction of Lead-Free Halide Perovskites The emergence of new materials for the future generation energy-related applications has gained more importance for modifying such materials by means of chemical and physical approaches. Organic-inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites (OH-LHPs) and pure-inorganic lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are intensively studied for potential optoelectronic applications such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells, photodetectors, sensors, etc.  [1] [2] [3] . Because of their exciting optical properties, lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are considered as future generation materials for multipurpose applications. Compared with traditional semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) such as CdSe, CdTe, InP, etc., LHP NCs are having different surface properties and so synthesis of these materials is also having significant importance. Also, without the passivating shell, the NCs of LHPs have demonstrated highest ever reported photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), up to near-unity  [4] [5] [6] . Moreover, with respect to the halides in the structure, the PL spectrum could be varied from 400 nm to 700 nm in the visible region. Synthesis of LHP NCs have been demonstrated through different approaches, namely, ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP), colloidal hot-injection method, spray deposition, mechanochemcial synthesis, etc.  [7, 8] . In all these methods, LHP NCs are prepared in the presence of different solvents, ligands, and different morphologies with interesting functional properties are achieved. Also, the stability of the LHP NCs also has improved by means of potential organic ligands with different functionality. Perovskite nanomaterials have proven as suitable for different kind of substrates which include glass, fabric, and flexible polymeric substrate  [9, 10] . With all these successful outcomes, we can say that perovskite nanomaterials are capable of fabricating future generation devices with different architectures. However, the use of heavy element lead (Pb 2+ ) is always a problematic issue for the environment and so development of lead-free perovskite NCs is intensively focused in the recent years  [11] . In this view, considerable achievements have been made in the development of lead-free halide perovskite NCs (LFHP NCs) with interesting structural and optical properties  [12, 13] . Elements such as tin (Sn), germanium (Ge), and copper (Cu) are found to be efficient in forming halide perovskite structure and properties of these elements based LFHP NCs are showing promising results for the fabrication of highly efficient optoelectronic devices. Out of others, Cu-based perovskite NCs are showing interesting structural and optical properties and their applicability to fabricate different kind of devices is explored in the recent years  [14, 15] . When Cu ions are doped or treated with the inorganic halide perovskite NCs, the PLQY is incredibly enhanced and this is used for several potential applications  [16] [17] [18] . Specifically, these Cu-LFHPs have proven exemplary optical properties with high PLQY. Also, their carrier transport properties have stimulated to examine them in order to fabricate highly efficient optoelectronic devices. Besides, the solvent and ligands related with the synthesis of Cu-LFHP NCs are delivering interesting results with the size, shape, and other aspects. In this scenario, it is imperative to understand about this interesting compound NCs to explore for several applications. This book chapter discusses about the current developments in synthesis, properties, and applications of the Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 (X¼Cl, Br, I) perovskite NCs. Cesium Copper Halide Perovskites (Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 X5Cl, Br, and I): 
 Structure and Properties The band gap of the Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs is reported over $4 eV, and this shows that all these NCs are exhibiting as direct bandgap materials  [19] . The inorganic framework of these materials is generally influenced by two factors, namely, (a) number of Cu (I) ions in the repeating unit and (ii) average number of bridging halides  [20] . Experimental results show that formation of Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs takes place through forming tetrahedral or trigonal planar network. It is known that LHP NCs are having octahedral structural arrangement, and when these octahedral networks are isolated by ligands and solvent molecules, they are strongly confined. On contrary with this, Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs are adopting either tetrahedral or trigonal planar network. In general, it is identified that two kind of isomers exists with the Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 , namely, αand β-form. In this, only α-Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 exists as tetrahedral (CuX 4 3À ) or trigonal planar form (CuX 3 
 2À ), which leads to the zero-dimensional network, whereas β-Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 consists of two substructures which share one bridging halide, resulting in a one-dimensional network  [20] . Also, these two isomers possess repeating Cu 2 X 5 3À units. Such confined atmosphere ultimately results in intrinsic self-trapped exciton (STE) in Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs. This STE is the specific property of the Cs 3 Cu 5 X 5 and this significantly influences the PL properties of the NCs. For a case of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 , this happens due to the soft lattice nature through which structural distortions occur when [Cu 2 I 5 ] 3À cluster get excited  [21] . This free e-s however get trapped in the lower-energy self-trapped states owing to the photoacoustic coupling effect, and this causes a structural distortion which strongly influences on the PL spectrum, typically a large stokes shift  [22] [23] [24] [25] . This large stoke shift ultimately helps to achieve reabsorption-free Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs to examine future generation device applications  [26, 27] . The structural reorganization can be further explained through Jahn-Teller effect. Here, Cu(I) halide with d 10 closed shell geometry forms a distorted Cu(I)-d 9 distorted geometry during photoexcitation, which makes self-trapping effect  [28] [29] [30] . The self-trapping depth is dependent on the halides and it is generally in the order of Cl > Br > I  [31] . In the case of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs, from the X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), the structure is always exhibited as orthorhombic structure. Usually, hot-injection method assists to form a phase-pure product as observed during the preparation of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 nanorods (NRs) and CsCu 2 I 3 NCs  [32] . Along with large strokes shift and broad PL emission, this STE is usually identified in Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 through the transient measurement analysis, which is inferred a broad excited state absorption plateau in the wavelength region 400-700 nm  [33] . As a direct bandgap material, in Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs the valence band is contributed by Cu 3d orbital whereas conduction band is related with the Cu 4s orbital. The 3d 10 orbitals hybridize with the p orbitals of the halogen for the effective bonding purpose. The schematic diagram of the representation of STE is given in Fig.  46 .1. Considering the optical properties, owing to their large bandgap values, these NCs generally absorb light in the ultraviolet (UV) region. The Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs exist two absorption peaks in the ultraviolet (UV) region, whereas their bromide and chloride counterparts show only one absorption peak. For the nanoplates of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs, a sharp excitonic peak is observed at the wavelength 285 nm  [32] . For a spherical NCs, the typical emission peak lies at 445 nm, as observed in many cases  [22] . The PL emission of these NCs can be tuned in the range of 440-515 nm through varying halides. This emission peak is dependent on size, shape, and composition, and this can be modified by exchanging halides like lead halide perovskite NCs  [34] . Furthermore, these NCs generally possess large exciton binding energy values. For example, it is observed that the exciton binding energy value of the nearly spherical-shaped Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs (size ¼ 20 AE 2.5 nm) is 371 meV, which envisages the PL emission through exciton recombination  [33] . For spherical NCs, the calculated exciton binding energy value is still lower than this and for a case, for the average diameter of 15.5 nm, it is 138.4 meV  [22] . However, this is not a free-exciton recombination mechanism as observed in the case of LHP NCs. Interestingly, on contrary with the CsPbX 3 NCs, these NCs exhibit PL emission at higher wavelength when introducing the halides from I À to Cl À . The PL emission energy of these NCs is related with several factors which includes bandgap, exciton binding energy, lattice distortion energy, self-trapping energy, etc., and this is represented by the following equation  [35] :  E PL ¼ E b À E e À E s À E I where E PL ¼ self-trapped exciton emission energy E b ¼ bandgap energy E e ¼ exciton binding energy E s ¼ self-trapping energy E I ¼ lattice deformation energy Along with other properties, morphology of these NCs significantly influences on the optical properties. For example, it is found that zero-dimensional Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 QDs typically have the absorption peak at the 285 nm whereas the 1-D nanorods of the same have the absorption peak at 330 nm  [33] . A similar kind of variation in the peak position is also observed in their PL spectra. Also, in this case, the QDs exhibited blue emission with the impressive PLQY 65%, whereas NRs showed only 5% PLQY. This higher PLQY of QDs may be attributed with the strongly confined or localized electrons, which enhance the PL properties. This impressive PLQY is higher than the previously reported zero-dimensional Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs  [35] . In another study, it is found that reaction temperature is significantly affecting the PLQY of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs and at 80 C, the best PLQY 82.7% is achieved  [36] . In general, different percentage of PLQY has been reported in the case of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs and this typically varies between 30% and 90% depending on the synthesis conditions, morphology, quality of the NCs, and analyzing conditions. Unlike pure-inorganic lead halide perovskite NCs, a large stokes shift is observed in the UV-visible and PL spectra of the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs. This is due to the large energy difference between Cu(I) d 10 and Cu(II)d 9 orbitals and also here Cu(II) exhibits a strong Jahn-Teller effect. In the case of PL emission spectra, the variation is strongly influenced on the morphology similar to absorption spectra. It is observed that the nanoplates morphology of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs exhibits a PL emission peak centered at 444 nm, whereas nanorods of the same show emission at 561  [32] . In the case of thermal quenching property, it is experimentally found that zero-dimensional Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs exhibit poor whereas the 1D Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs exhibit better thermal quenching  [37] . Compared with the pureinorganic lead halide perovskite NCs, the full-width hall maximum (FWHM) value of these NCs shows a large value which strongly conveys the significant variation in the morphology of the prepared NCs. 
 Synthesis of Cesium Copper Iodide Perovskite Nanomaterials Through Colloidal Route Synthesis of Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs is carried out through two different approaches, namely, ligand-assisted reprecipitation method (LARP) and colloidal hot-injection method. In LARP approach, the precursors dissolved in the solvents with different polarity (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO], dimethyl formamide (DMF), etc.) are mixed together to achieve highly monodisperse, crystalline NCs. It is well known that the surface properties of the CsPbX 3 NCs are hardly affected by the solvents, ligands, and additives because of their ionic nature. The structural aspect of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs is interesting owing to the presence of copper ions. According to the literature, formation of these NCs is accompanied through the formation of [Cu 2 I 5 ] during the reaction. With respect to the oxidation state of copper ions, there are two kinds of structures namely tetrahedral [CuI 4 ] and trigonal planar [CuI 3 ] could exist in this [Cu 2 I 5 ] cluster. These two units edge share with the [Cu 2 I 5 ] cluster which is isolated by Cs + ions  [29, 35] . The another potential approach of synthesizing Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs is using hot-injection method. In this method, unlike pure inorganic lead halide NCs, these NCs are prepared at lower temperature. For the synthesis of perovskite NCs, most of the literature describe about the use of colloidal hot-injection method. In specific, the well-known higher boiling point solvents such as oleylamine (OAm), oleic acid (OA), and 1-octadecene (1-ODE) are playing inevitable role in achieving highly stable NCs with different morphology. In the case of Cu-LFHP NCs, hot-injection method plays a key role in synthesizing size-and shape-oriented NCs. It is found that for the preparation of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs, the use of oleylammonium iodide (OAm-I) could serve as efficient precursor to generate narrow size-distributed rod like morphology  [35] . Here, it is important to note that together with serving iodide (I À ) ions, OAm-I reduces Cu 2+ to Cu + . Moreover, despite the lower PLQY (29.2%), the prepared Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs in this approach have showed high PL stability, which is over 45 days. On the other hand, the stability of Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 and Cs 3 Cu 2 Br 5 is found to be less under ambient conditions and so it is advised to prepare these NCs under inert atmosphere. Use of iodide precursor, for example, InI 3 , is found to be significantly influencing on the synthesis temperature ($180 C) and optical properties of the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs  [27, 38] , and further additive engineering of these compound NCs would help to achieve near-unity PLQY. Along with morphology and optical properties, composition of the NCs is influenced by the solvents. For instance, high volume of OAm induces the formation of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs, whereas the low volume of the same promote the formation of CsCu 2 I 3 NCs  [39] . This concept is also valid with respect to the OA, where near-unity PLQY is achieved in the case of Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 and Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs  [40] . With respect to temperature, formation of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs is favored at low temperature (80 C), whereas above 120 C, it converts to CsCu 2 I 3 phase  [36] . This phase transformation is also influenced by the halide and in general Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 formation is encouraged in the presence of haliderich atmosphere  [38] . Moreover, this phase transformation, that is, from Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 to CsCu 2 I 3 , can occur in the presence of water or by a polar solvent  [36, 40] . Despite these, morphological analysis shows that it is difficult to identify the CsCu 2 I 3 phase through high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis despite existence of peaks observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern  [41, 42] . The typical XRD patterns, crystal structures, PL emission spectra, and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analysis of the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 and CsCu 2 I 3 NCs are given in Fig.  46.2.  Other than PL, Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs show superior thermal stability which is confirmed through thermogravimetric analysis  [33, 38] . The high stability is also speculated as attributed with the non-diffusion of copper vacancy (V cu ) in the [Cu 2 I 5 ] 3À cluster  [22] . Because of these higher stability factors, Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs are examined with different aspects by several research groups and interesting results are demonstrated. Although this work describes about the reduction of divalent copper ions to monovalent in the presence of OAm, it is not generally observed  [33] . Similar to lead halide perovskite NCs, surface ligands are playing important role in enhancing PLQY of the Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs. Wang et al. prepared Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs using colloidal hot-injection route and the prepared NCs showed absolute PLQY $87%  [22] . Here, the authors used traditional higher boiling point solvents OAm and OA to achieve spherical NCs with the average size 17.5 nm. Likewise, the ratio of OA/OAm is 1:1 and Cs/Cu is 1:5, disc-shaped Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs is achieved  [36] . The PLQY of the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs could be improved through additive engineering. For example, use of indium iodide (InI 3 ) during synthesis result NCs with 96.6% PLQY  [38] . Earlier, the same approach had demonstrated to achieve Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs with 73.7% PLQY  [27] . This is further achieved to 97.2% through dual capping strategy by means of potassium oleate (K-oleate)  [43] . These analyses are assuring that further use of novel additives could enhance the PL properties and could help to keep it for longer duration. Although the surface of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs is compatible with the long chain organic ligands, it is found that not all ligands are providing the stabilization to the prepared NCs. For example, the interaction of 2-hexyldecanoic acid is poor with the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs in hexane, and this causes a kind of collapsed network in the solution  [32] . Once the NCs are prepared, they are centrifuged and purified and redispersed in appropriate solvents. Mostly, antisolvents such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, etc., are used for purification, which is similar with the lead halide perovskite NCs. Interestingly, Cheng et al. used antisolvent-free gel permeation methodology to purify the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs with the assistance of toluene  [43] . Here, the prepared NCs are dropped on a polystyrene bed along with toluene and the excessive ligands are removed by the polystyrene layer. Such novel approaches will help to avoid requisition of excessive solvents for the purification. Similar to LHP NCs, these compound NCs can be synthesized using ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) approach. Li et al. used dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and toluene to prepare Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs at room temperature  [41] . Here, the precursors are mixed together in DMSO and added with toluene to prepare NCs. Impressively, the PLQY of the Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs synthesized through this method shown near-unity ($100%), whereas in the case of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs it was 30%. This shows that hot-injection method enables to produce Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs with high PLQY. This room temperature preparation method also used to prepare quantum dots (QDs) of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 (size: $4.33 nm) in a confined structure of metal-organic framework, for example, MOF-74  [44] . Jiang et al. have prepared Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs using solid-state reaction method  [45] . Here, the precursors are mixed together using a mortar and allowed a high temperature reaction at 400 C for 6 h. The same research group have demonstrated a scale-up process of this method which provides NCs with high stability up to 2 years  [46] . These methods are showing promising directions in synthesizing Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs with different methods. The morphology of Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs is influenced by different factors that include solvents, ligands, ration between precursors, temperature, etc. For example, the nanorods (NRs) morphology of the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs is achieved through high temperature ($ 110 C), whereas low temperature resulted nearly spherical-shaped QDs ($70 C), and this observation is varied with the Cs 3 Cu 2 Br 5 NCs  [33] . Similarly, Vashista et al. observed a hexagonal nanoplate like morphology with the size $43 nm when the authors carried out the synthesis of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs at 110 C  [32] . Modification in the variation of temperature also influence on the Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs especially formation of nanorods with high PLQY is resulted at 150 C  [47] . Increasing the synthesis temperature with the assistance of precursor like InI 3 results in nanobricks like morphology with the thickness 10 nm and width of around 20-30 nm  [27] . Interestingly, polygon and hexagonal prism-shaped Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs, disc-shaped Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs, long oval-shaped Cs 3 Cu 2 Br 5 NCs are also achieved through hot-injection method under different synthesis conditions  [26, 34, 48] . Compared with hot-injection method, the LARP method produces extremely smaller size Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs which is 2.68 nm AE 0.80 nm  [41] .  Le et al.  have investigated about the influence of length of amines and acids on the morphology of the Cs 3 Cu 2 Br 5 NCs  [49] . Interestingly, here the authors observed the morphology is varied with respect to the chain length of acid/amine pair. In this case, use of hexylamine/hexanoic acid (C6) results in irregular-shaped polydisperse NCs, and use of nonylamine/nonanoic acid (C9) results in nanocuboid morphology, whereas it turns out as nanospheres for the chain length C9 to C18. The schematic representation of the formation of different morphologies of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs using hot-injection method is given in Fig.  46    [29] . Here, the addition of MnI 2 promotes the formation of Cu-oleate rich atmosphere in the reaction medium which promotes the uniform morphology. Moreover, here the morphology influence is observed as higher in the case of MnI 2 than the ZnI 2 . Irrespective of these findings, the formation mechanism of these NCs is yet to be explored to find the important steps for the morphological transformation. Other than Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs, the other counterpart Cs 3 CuX 4 NCs are also getting interested for potential applications. Through LARP method, Yang et al. have observed that by varying the ratio between CsBr and CuBr 2 , the PL peak position of the Cs 2 CuBr 4 QDs could be varied from 466 nm to 388 nm  [52] . This is because when varying the size from 14.2 nm to 4.2 nm, this reflects on the optical properties. The authors have observed a similar kind of trend in the case of Cs 2 CuCl 4 QDs. This strongly reveals that size of the cesium copper halide perovskite NCs could be systematically controlled by the precursor ratio. Similarly, Cs 2 ZnCl 4 QDs prepared using hot-injection method reveal about the role of Cu(I) ions which act as the luminescence center  [53] . Here, the prepared QDs have shown impressive PLQY which is $55%. Likewise, a reasonable PLQY has been achieved (48%) with the CsCu 2 Cl 3 prepared by solid-state synthetic method  [54] . All these investigations reveal that further analysis on these interesting compounds in a nanoscale will clearly help us to achieve NCs with excellent optical properties. The stability of Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs is varied with respect to their composition. Since Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs are easily oxidized, the rate of structural transformation of these NCs is identified as quite rapid and difficult to understand. Despite of oxidation, the life-time of the Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs is observed as extremely higher than their counterparts, which is $136 μS  [35] . When reducing the temperature, it is found that Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs could reach the life-time 877.7 μS at 20 K  [27] . This longer life-time of the prepared NCs supports for their high PLQY, which is useful for the fabrication of the optoelectronic devices. 
 Applications of Cesium Copper Iodide Perovskite Nanomaterials Like LHP NCs, Cu-LFHP NCs are useful to fabricate optoelectronic devices owing to their higher PL emission properties. Also, these NCs also could be blended with a polymer like polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and can be used for the fabrication of light emitting diodes (LEDs). Because of the higher stability and interesting optical properties, Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs are widely used for this purpose. A LED fabricated using Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs with the device structure Al/LiF/TPBi/Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 /NiO/ITO, the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) $1.12 eV was achieved at 7.5 V  [22] . Because of their deep blue emission, Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs are coupled with yellow phosphors to fabricate white-light emitting diodes (WLEDs)  [38] . It is also possible to couple these NCs along with highly luminescent traditional core-shell NCs assembly such as CuInS 2 /ZnS and such composite structure is quite useful to fabricate UV-excited white-LEDs  [34] . Liu et al. prepared Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs embedded with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to fabricate a photodetector, and the authors have achieved the maximum external quantum efficiency of 19.6% at 265 nm which is higher than the bare film (3.3%)  [50] . Assembly of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs with PMMA has also been found to be resistant to water for long time and providing stability  [43, 55] , and this approach is useful to fabricate devices with long-term stability. Also, together with green-emitting Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs, this composite structure could be used for the fabrication of white-LEDs which have maximum luminescence of 1558 cd/m 2  [40] . Similarly, when Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 QDs are embedded within the pores of MOF-74, this composite is found to be useful for the temperature detecting purposes  [44] . Other potential applications such as development of smart and security inks for the identification of counterfeiting currency  [38] , near-UV phototransistor  [45] , luminescent solar concentrator  [26] , X-ray scintillator applications  [27, 56] , photon managing device  [48]  also demonstrated using Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs. It is found that the scintillation performance and stability is improved when Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs are doped with thallium (Tl)  [55] . These experimental demonstrations are assuring that properties of these less-toxic perovskite NCs can be improved for the large-scale industrial production of experimentally demonstrated optoelectronic devices. 
 Summary and Conclusion The structural and optical properties of the Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs clearly show that they are unique class of nanomaterials for the future generation flexible devices. The current investigation results clearly show that Cs 3 Cu 2 X 5 NCs are emerging promising materials for the potential applications in various fields. Further analysis of these NCs will help to explore future avenues in the directions of fabricating composite structures and alloyed systems. Besides, the composites of these NCs are showing higher stability which helps us to explore further avenues in different fields. In terms of synthesis view, large-scale synthesis of these NCs is still in the initial phase and advanced strategies such as micro fluidic reactor approaches will ease the existing setbacks in near future. It is expected that efforts in these directions will explore novel ways to enhance the processing and application of these NCs for variety of applications.

 . 3 . 3 Despite many research findings are claiming the lower PLQY of Cs 3 Cu 2 Cl 5 NCs, Liu et al. achieved $70% PLQY through simply increasing volume of OAm during the reaction [50]. Additives are playing important role on the size and shape regulation of the halide perovskite NCs. Especially iodide-containing additives such as ZnI 2 and MnI 2 are playing important role on this effect. These precursors are influencing on the chemical potential, and hence, equilibrium of the reaction is influenced. Along with the morphology variation, the addition of ZnI 2 is resulting in a higher yield in the reaction [51]. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs under different temperature and with different amount of ZnI 2 and their XRD patterns are given in Fig. 46.4. Li et al. carried out synthesis of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs in the presence of MnI 2 along with CuI and found that when the ratio of CuI/MnI 2 is 4:4 at 160 C, the NCs are found to be smaller with monodispersed distribution
