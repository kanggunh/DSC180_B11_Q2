Title: Investigating ASnI 2 Br wide bandgap tin perovskite for bifacial solar cells: Modeling of bifacial efficiency with comparative analysis
In this study, a novel perovskite bifacial solar cell featuring ASnI 2 Br as the absorber material, with the A-site cation represented by EDA 0.01 (GA 0.06 (FA 0.8 Cs 0.2 ) 0.94 ) 0.98 , was proposed. For the first time, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of such a structure, achieving a notable 21.94% with rear-side illumination, was obtained. Additionally, the first investigation into three distinct methods for estimating the bifacial efficiency (η bi ) of wide bandgap tin-perovskite bifacial solar cells, namely, characteristics addition (CA), generation addition (GA), and mathematical modeling (MM), was implemented. To validate the efficacy estimated by these methods, we apply them to an additional baseline model calibrated extensively with an experimentally verified bifacial perovskite solar cell (PSC) exposed to concurrent front-and rear illumination. Our findings indicate that the CA and GA methods outperform the MM, with the GA method closely aligning with experimental bifacial PSC parameters. Opting for the superior GA method, our analysis showed that the estimated η bi of the proposed device is 30.17% under 100 mW cm -2 front-side and 50 mW cm -2 rear-side illumination intensity. Furthermore, the η bi of the proposed device was evaluated under various experimentally calculated rear-side surface spectra, revealing an optimum η bi of 31.05% when the tile was used as the rear surface material.
Introduction Over the past decade, PSCs have emerged as a leading contender in the realm of photovoltaics (PVs), due to their remarkable advancements in efficiency and ease of manufacturing. With a certified PCE of 26.1%  [1] , they present a compelling alternative to conventional silicon-based solar technologies. Their low-temperature production methods  [2]  and projected cost-effectiveness  [3]  make them an attractive option for renewable energy. By compositional engineering of the ABX 3 structure, the optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials can be finely tuned to enhance device efficiency. While single-junction devices have approached theoretical limits, novel configurations, such as multi-junction  [4] , concentrated  [5] , bifacial solar cells  [6] , or their combinations  [7] , were explored to maximize power generation per unit area. Bifacial solar cells show potential for enhancing device efficiency without requiring significant structural changes. Instead of covering the entire back surface of a solar cell with an opaque metal electrode, bifacial solar cell designs utilize a transparent conducting electrode to facilitate light harvesting from both the front-and rear-sides. This approach enables the device to collect reflected light (albedo) from the ground, enhancing its overall efficiency. Efficient bifacial designs are uncommon in inorganic thin-film solar cells like cadmium telluride and copper indium gallium selenide. This is primarily because these cells lack a built-in electric field near the rear surface and have insufficient carrier lifetime and diffusion length to transport minority carriers from the rear-side to the front heterojunction  [8, 9] . However, PSCs present a unique opportunity for bifacial applications, owing to their exceptional optoelectrical properties, such as high absorption coefficients and long carrier lifetimes, along with their device architectures that do not rely on p-n junctions. Despite this, their evaluation has primarily focused on single-side illumination conditions. Typically, researchers measure device efficiency under either side illumination with one sun irradiance and calculate the bifaciality, which does not provide the exact idea of η bi and only offers the efficiency ratio under the front-and rear-side illumination  [6] . In practical scenarios, bifacial solar cells may experience concurrent illumination from both the front and back contacts. However, the PV performance of bifacial PSCs (BPSCs) under concurrent illumination or adjustable albedo light has not been comprehensively examined or reported, with limited research in this field  [10] [11] [12] . It is crucial to understand how concurrent illumination impacts the PV parameters of BPSCs. This gap underscores the necessity for further investigation into the operational behavior of BPSCs under varying illumination conditions, which would be facilitated by the estimation of η bi . In this manuscript, we investigate a wide-bandgap (1.62 eV) perovskite absorber ASnI 2 Br doped with 3% GeI 2 , structured as FTO/PEDOT: PSS/Absorber/C 60 /Ag, used as a reference structure  [13] . The goal is to explore enhancements in the efficiency of the reference structure, which has been systematically optimized in our previous study  [14] . The back contact (ITO) in the optimized structure FTO/PEDOT:PSS/Absorber/ ITO establishes the device's bifacial nature. Hence, we introduce our previously optimized monofacial device, referred to as the proposed BPSC, and investigate potential improvements in PCE. In section 2, we analyze the PV performance of the proposed BPSC using three distinct methods: CA, GA, and MM. While the absorber material (ASnI 2 Br) of the proposed BPSC was previously calibrated as a monofacial device in our earlier research  [14] , this manuscript marks the first report of the proposed BPSC under concurrent front-and rear-side illumination. As experimental validation of the proposed BPSC has not been conducted thus far, we developed an additional baseline model based on an experimentally validated BPSC  [10]  to validate the aforementioned methods. Section 3 presents experimental analysis utilizing reflected spectra of different surface sets to evaluate device performance for the real-world scenario. Finally, Section 4 concludes the manuscript, summarizing findings and implications. 
 Results and discussion The optimized structure, depicted in Fig.  1a  as FTO/PEDOT:PSS/ Absorber/ITO, showcases front and rear JV characteristics. The back surface (ITO) serves a dual purpose as an electron transport layer (ETL) and a transparent contact, establishing the device's bifacial nature. Fig.  1b  illustrates the energy level diagram of the proposed BPSC. Our previous study was focused solely on optimizing the device under front illumination  [14] . Here, we explore the performance of the device under rear illumination for the first time. Under standard test conditions (STC) with AM 1.5G spectrum illumination, the optimized device is characterized by efficiency of 18.68% and 21.94% with front-and rear-side illumination, respectively. Other performance parameters are reported in Table  1 . 
 Estimation of bifacial efficiency through device characteristics addition In this subsection, the η bi value of the proposed BPSC is calculated at constant temperature by the superposition of the current density-voltage (JV) characteristics under the front-and rear-side illumination. Under illumination, the JV characteristic is not only the function of illumination intensity (P) but also depends on the voltage (V). The dark current density (J D ) caused by the random generation of charge carriers per unit area of the device depends solely on the voltage. In contrast, the light-generated current density (J L ) depends strictly on the illumination intensity. Therefore, the total current density (J) in the solar cell under illumination is represented by Eq. (1). J(V, P) = J D (V) + J L (P) (1) J f ( V, P f ) = J D (V) + J L,f ( P f ) (2) J r (V, P r ) = J D (V) + J L,r (P r ) (3) Eqs. (  2 ) and (3) define the total current densities when material is illuminated from the front (J f ) and rear (J r ) sides, respectively. These equations include J D and the light-generated current density, either under front-side illumination (J L,f ) or rear-side illumination (J L,r ). The light intensity is denoted as (P f ) for front-side illumination and (P r ) for rear-side illumination. In a bifacial solar cell with concurrent front-and rear-side illumination, the contributions from each source can be summed up to obtain the bifacial current density (J bi ), as expressed by Eq. (  4 ). J bi ( V, P f , P r ) = J D (V) + J L,f ( P f ) + J L,r (P r ) = J f ( V, P f ) + J r (V, P r ) -J D (V) (4) This method is an approximation based on the linearity assumption of the solar cell. When summing Equations (  2 ) and (3), the dark current term appears twice, requiring its subtraction after adding the total current density under front-and rear-side illumination. To estimate the potential of the proposed BPSC, although not practically feasible in the real-world scenario, we initially estimate the η bi , considering the illumination AM 1.5G with the incident light power (N D ) of 100 mW cm -2 from front-and rear-side of the device. In Fig.  2  are the bifacial JV characteristics obtained by the CA method, with all performance parameters refined from the JV characteristics. Additionally, in Fig.  2  also is the increment in bifacial open-circuit voltage (V OC-bi ) resulting from the algebraic addition of the JV characteristics under dark, front-, and rear-side illumination. In Fig.  3a  are the JV characteristics estimated using the CA method for the proposed BPSC under concurrent illumination. Here, the N D level  of 100 mW cm -2 is fixed for front-, while it is varied from 0 to 50 mW cm -2 for the rear-side illumination. In Fig.  3b , an increase in the V OC-bi of the proposed BPSC by 76 mV is evident as N D changes from 0 to 50 mW cm -2 . The maximum difference in Voc between front and bifacial illumination reported in the literature is approximately 50 mV  [15, 16] , whereas the V OC-bi calculated by the CA method tends to be slightly higher. Such discrepancies may arise from the requirement to fulfil the linear relation given by Equation (  4 ). In Fig.  3c , the bifacial short-circuit current density (J SC-bi ) of the proposed BPSC increases from 17.60 to 28.01 mA cm -2 with rear-side N D . This increase is attributed to enhancing the generation of electronhole pairs, consequently boosting the rear current density. As this method directly adds the front and rear current densities, the J SC-bi of the proposed BPSC increases linearly with the increment in N D . In Fig.  3d , a decrease in the bifacial fill factor (FF bi ) is observed due to the increment in V OC-bi and J SC-bi . While both the maximum power voltage (V MPP-bi ) and maximum power current (I MPP-bi ) increase slightly, the overall effect is a reduction in the FF bi of the proposed BPSC. This decrease in FF bi with increasing rear-side N D is attributed to increased recombination losses and resistance associated with higher photocurrent. The variation in η bi of the proposed BPSC is shown in Fig.  3e , where an increase in η bi from 18.68% to 30.81% as rear-side N D varied from 0 to 50 mW cm -2 is clear. It is noted that the variation of the rear-side N D is limited to 50 mW cm -2 only, considering practical scenarios. 
 Estimation of bifacial efficiency through generation addition In this subsection, the η bi of the proposed BPSC is calculated using the GA method  [17] . This method is considered as more accurate because it does not rely on the assumption of linearity. To analyze the potential of the proposed BPSC, we obtained the generation profiles under front illumination (G f ) and rear illumination (G r ) conditions with N D = 100 mW cm -2 . These profiles were combined to obtain the bifacial generation (G bi ), as shown in Fig.  4a  and b . The G bi of the bifacial device under concurrent front-and rear-side illumination is calculated using Eq. (  5 ): G bi (x) = G f (x) + G r (x) (5) In Fig.  4a , we observe a higher number of electron-hole pairs at the illuminated side, which gradually diminishes as the distance from the illumination source increases. However, the bifacial generation profile reveals a significant presence of electron-hole pairs generated on both sides of the device. This dual-sided generation contributes to an enhanced current density for the proposed BPSC. In Fig.  4b , the bifacial generation profile is depicted with rear-side N D varying from 0 to 50 mW cm -2 with front N D fixed at 100 mW cm -2 . It is evident that as the N D of rear illumination increases, the generation of charge carriers from the rear-side also increases. This phenomenon significantly contributes to the J SC-bi and hence η bi of the device. These profiles offer insights into the spatial distribution of electronhole pairs generated over the thickness of the device, crucial for understanding performance enhancement mechanisms in bifacial solar cells. Fig.  5a  presents the JV characteristics of the proposed BPSC considering the bifacial generation profile obtained through the GA method with N D varying from 0 to 50 mW cm -2 . Notably, there is a significant increase in J SC-bi with N D , while only marginal variation is observed in the V OC-bi of the proposed BPSC. In Fig.  5b , V OC-bi increases from 1.3 to 1.324 V as N D varies from 0 to 50 mW cm -2 , consistent with literature findings. This minor enhancement in V OC-bi is attributed to the increment in the quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) in the ITO layer. An increase in rear-side N D primarily affects the concentration of minority carriersholes, in the ETL. This higher concentration of holes alters the Fig.  2 . JV characteristics of the proposed BPSC under dark condition, frontand rear-side illumination, along with the bifacial JV curve estimated through the CA method. position of the fermi level at the ETL side, bringing it closer to the valence band. Consequently, this increases the QFLS and hence the V OC-bi of the device. Conversely, significant improvement in J SC-bi is observed in Fig.  5c , increasing from 17.60 to 27.99 mA cm -2 across the same N D range due to increased electron-hole pair generation from concurrent illumination. In Fig.  5d , a decrease is seen in FF bi from 81.43% to 77.57%, attributed to increased bulk recombination processes. Consequently, the η bi of the proposed BPSC experiences a notable enhancement, rising from 18.68% to 28.75%, as shown in Fig.  5e . 
 Estimation of bifacial efficiency through mathematical modeling In this subsection, the η bi of the proposed BPSC is estimated through MM  [18] , utilizing the performance parameters calculated under frontand rear-side illumination, each with N D of 100 mW cm -2 reported in Table  1 . According to MM, the η bi of the bifacial solar cell under concurrent illumination can be calculated by Eq. (  6 ): η bi = I SC-bi V OC-bi FF bi A module ( G f + G r ) (6) Here, A module represents the module area (front surface only), and V OC-bi , I SC-bi , FF bi , and η bi are defined as the bifacial performance parameters. Here, we consider G f = STC with AM 1.5G spectrum illumination and G r = x. STC. Since SCAPS-1D (Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator-1D)  [19] , provides J sc instead of I sc , we have modified the equations accordingly, replacing I sc with J sc , leading to the revised Eq.  (7) . η bi = J SC-bi V OC-bi FF bi ( G f + G r ) (7) The J SC-bi denoted by Eq. (  8 ), assumes a linear current density response under varying illumination conditions and can be calculated by the linear addition of front and rear current densities, where an irradiance factor (x) is employed to specify N D of rear illumination. The x can be estimated by Eq. (  9 ). J SC-bi = J SC-f + x.J SC-r (8) x = G r G f (9) V OC-bi is calculated by Eq. (  10 ), with front and rear performance parameters including bifacial current density gain (R JSC ) denoted by Eq.  (11) . V OC-bi = V OC-f + ( V OC-r -V OC-f ) ln ( R JSC ) ln ( J SC-r /J SC-f ) ( 10 ) R JSC = J SC-f + x.J SC-r J SC-f = 1 + x J SC-r J SC-f (11) The FF bi is calculated by Eq. (  12 ) using the pseudo fill factor (pFF), which is represented by Eq. (  13 ). The pFF is the FF of the device  considering no series resistance (R S ) loss. FF bi = pFF -R JSC ( V OC-f V OC-bi ) ( pFF -FF f ) (12) pFF = ( J SC-r /J SC-f ) FF f -FF r ( V OC-r /V OC-f ) ( J SC-r /J SC-f ) - ( V OC-r /V OC-f ) (13) An increase in J SC-bi from 17.60 to 28.01 mA cm -2 with rear-side light illumination varying from 0 to 50 mW cm -2 is clear in Fig.  6b . This enhancement is attributed to the linear addition of front and rear current densities. In this model, the light intensity of the rear side is quantified by the x. To analyze variations in light intensity, x is systematically varied within the range of 0 to 0.5. V OC obtained by this model increases from 1.304 to 1.325 V with rear-side light intensity and is plotted in Fig.  6a . V OC-r > V OC-f and I SC-r > I SC-f for our proposed BPSC, indicating that the V OC-bi will increase with rear-side light intensity. It is observed from Eq. (  10 ) that V OC-bi will always increase when both J SC and V OC of the rear-side are higher or lower than the front-side; otherwise, it will decrease with rear-side N D . Fig.  6c  represents FF bi decreasing from 81.43% to 77.78%; while pFF of the device is 87.88%. The lowering in FF bi is due to the increase in bifacial current density gain, which eventually leads to bulk recombination and hence lowering the FF bi of the device. Fig.  6d  indicates an increment in η bi from 18.68% to 19.25%. All the performance parameters estimated through CA, GA, and MM are presented in Table  2 . Although the efficiency estimated through the CA method shows higher values compared to GA and MM, the lack of experimental results for the proposed device necessitates the creation of a baseline model with experimental results. Upon establishing this baseline model, all three methods will be applied and discussed in the next section of this manuscript. 
 Experimental validation In this manuscript, we have explored the performance of the proposed BPSC using three distinct methods: CA, GA, and MM. While the absorber material (ASnI 2 Br) of the BPSC was previously calibrated as a monofacial device in  [14] , this manuscript marks the first report of the proposed BPSC. As experimental validation of the BPSC is not currently feasible, we developed a baseline model based on an experimentally validated BPSC to validate the aforementioned methods. The architecture of the experimental BPSC comprises MgF 2 /glass/ITO/poly(triarylamine) (PTAA)/perovskite/C 60 /SnO 2 /ITO/Ag grid/MgF 2 , with FA 0.8 Cs 0.2 Pb(I 0.9 Br 0.1 ) 3 chosen as the absorber material, as presented in Fig.  7 (a)  [10] . Performance parameters of both the experimental and the calibrated device, along with percentage errors, are tabulated in Table  3  for comparison. Notably, all these parameters are accurately reproduced within ±1.2% by creating a baseline model using the provided internal parameters through the SCAPS-1D simulation tool. In Fig.  7 (b) are the JV characteristics of the experimental and the calibrated device under front-and rear-side illumination. The comparison of performance parameters for the experimentally validated BPSC using three methods -CA, GA, and MMis depicted in Fig.  8a-d . Notably, an increase in V OC-bi with rear-side N D across all three methods is displayed in Fig.  8a . However, for lower values (0 to 30 mW cm -2 ) of rear-side N D , the V OC-bi determined by the GA method -V OC-bi (GA) -closely aligns with the experimental -V OC-bi (Exp). For higher values (30 to 50 mW cm -2 ), the V OC-bi obtained through MM -V OC-bi (MM) -more accurately reflects the V OC-bi (Exp). However, all these variations are from 40 to 50 mV and do not have a significant impact on the η bi of the bifacial device. In Fig.  8b , it is seen that the J SC-bi values obtained by all three methods are closely matched the experimental data due to their dependence on the linear addition of the current density. Oppositely, in Fig.  8c , it is evident that only FF bi (GA) closely follows the FF bi (Exp) up to 40 mW cm -2 , while the FF bi estimated Fig.  6 . Variation in (a) V OC-bi , (b) J SC-bi , (c) FF bi , and (d) η bi of the proposed BPSC calculated by MM, with rear-side N D varied from 0 to 50 mW cm -2 . through CA and MM do not align with the experimental data. Since the η bi depends on the other performance parameters and all the performance parameters elucidated by GA method closely track the experimental data, we consider the GA method as the most suitable for further estimation of η bi . In the next section, we will estimate the performance parameters of the proposed BPSC with the GA method using different rear surface sets. 
 Experimental section Based on the superior performance exhibited by the GA method in estimating bifacial solar cell parameters, as reported in the preceding sections, we now turn our attention to estimating η bi of the proposed BPSC under varying rear-side surfaces using GA method. Considering the significant impact of reflected light intensity from the rear surface on practical solar cell performance, influenced by factors such as wavelength and surface type, a precise assessment of this reflection is crucial. To achieve this, we employed an Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) fiber-optic spectrometer from Ocean Optics Inc., featuring a deuterium and halogen lamp (DH-2000-BAL) as the light source, which emits light within the 200 to 1100 nm range. The spectrometer (MAYA 2000 PRO) serves as the optical receiver, as depicted in Fig.  9(a) . In this section, we present an analysis of the rear-side reflected spectra obtained experimentally using the UV-Vis fiber-optic spectrometer. Our investigation included various rear-side surfaces such as tile, dry leaves, dry sand, grass, and wet sand. The reflected spectra of these surfaces, along with the AM 1.5G solar spectrum, are shown in Fig.  9 (b). Additionally, numerical analyses were conducted on the proposed BPSC structure using SCAPS-1D version 3.3.11. We estimate the η bi of the proposed BPSC with different rear-side surfaces, and the respective performance parameters are reported in Table  4 . 
 Conclusion In conclusion, this manuscript introduces a novel BPSC based on the ASnI 2 Br absorber, optimized under rear-side illumination, yielding PCE of 21.94%. Through a comprehensive investigation, three distinct methods -CA, GA, and MMwere tested for estimating η bi of the proposed BPSC and compare their performance. To validate these methods, we establish a baseline model using an experimentally validated BPSC. Our findings indicate that the GA method closely tracks experimental values, demonstrating its effectiveness in estimating the performance of the proposed BPSC. Moreover, our study highlights the significance of the choice of rearside surface, which has a notable impact on the overall solar cell performance. By considering experimentally calculated reflected spectra of various rear-side surfaces, such as tile, dry leaves, dry sand, grass and wet sand, we elucidated their effects on the η bi of the proposed BPSC. Notably, the proposed BPSC achieved a maximum η bi of 31.05% when tile was utilized as the rear-side surface, as calculated through the GA method. These findings underscore the importance of selecting an appropriate method for accurately evaluating the performance of BPSCs. Further refinement and validation of these methods could enhance their accuracy and utility in efficiency estimation and optimization of bifacial solar cell devices.
