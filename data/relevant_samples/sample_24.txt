Title: Inhomogeneous Halide Anions Distribution along Out-of-Plane Direction in Wide-Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells and Its Effect on Open Circuit Voltage Loss and Phase Segregation
The large open circuit voltage (V OC ) loss and phase segregation are two main obstacles hindering the development of wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Even though substantial progress has been made through crystallization regulation and surface modification on perovskite, the mechanism of V OC loss and phase segregation has rarely been studied. In this paper, we first investigate the halide ions distribution along the out-of-plane direction and find the initial inhomogeneous distribution of halide ions during the crystallization process is an important reason. It leads to the formation of an unfavorable potential well in PSCs, resulting in V OC loss as well as generation of strong strain exacerbating phase segregation. Through introducing melatonin (MT) into perovskite precursors, a homogeneous distribution of halide anions is realized due to the well-regulated crystallization. Consequently, the treated PSCs exhibit an optimized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.88% with a V OC loss as low as 0.38 V, which are the best values for wide-bandgap PSCs up to now.
INTRODUCTION Organic-inorganic halide perovskite is currently regarded as the most promising material for solar cells, primarily because of its outstanding performance in converting sunlight into electric power.  1, 2  the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has rapidly increased from 3.8% initially to 26.1% at present.  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]  Simultaneously, the bandgap of perovskite can be adjusted across a wide spectral range, making them ideal for tandem solar cells such as perovskite/silicon, perovskite/ perovskite, and perovskite/CIGS, surpassing the Shockley-Queisser (S-Q) efficiency limit.  [10] [11] [12] [13]  Typically, mixed-halide wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskites are preferred as the front cells in tandem devices, which can be easily prepared using a solution-based method and adjusting the bandgap by partially replacing iodides with bromides.  14  It is known that the V OC loss and serious halide phase segregation are the two main obstacles that need to be overcome for wide-bandgap PSCs.  [15] [16] [17] [18]  The large V OC loss makes the PCE of wide-bandgap PSCs fall far behind their counterpart.  14  The phase segregation refers to the phenomenon in which the different halide anions separate and aggregate under light irradiation, leading to the formation of a region that exhibits a wide bandgap and a region that exhibits a narrow bandgap. This process results in the creation of halide vacancies at their original positions.  [19] [20] [21] [22]  Great efforts have been made to mitigate these issues. One major approach is to expand the bandgap by incorporating large-sized cations to partially replace the A-site cations and reduce the bromide content in the composition.  23, 24  For instance, the perovskite FA 0.6 Cs 0.3 DMA 0.1 PbI 2.4 Br 0.6 with low to 20% Br content achieved an ideal bandgap of 1.7 eV while successfully suppressing halide segregation.  25  However, incorporation of large organic cations at the A-site unavoidably results in the formation of complex 2D/3D structures either within the perovskite layer or on its surface, which can hinder the efficient transport of charge carriers. Another method generally used is to employ small molecule additives with suitable functional groups that can immobilize the movement of halide anions and eliminate vacancies inside perovskite films. As an illustration, Yang et al. incorporated F-type pseudohalogen additives (PF  6-  or BF  4- ) into the FA 0.65 MA 0.20 Cs 0.15 Pb(I 0.8 Br 0.2 ) 3 precursor. These anions, which have a higher electron affinity, were able to replace the unbonded halide ions, thereby reducing the stress distortion of the film and inhibiting phase separation. As a result, a PCE of up to 20% was obtained for 1.67 eV PSC, with good stability as well.  26  Chen et al. proposed a method to suppress the initial separation of halide phases during perovskite crystallization by adding 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (ABF) to the mixed-halide precursor. Consequently, the 1.63 and 1.68 eV WBG PSCs deliver the champion PCE of 21.76% and 20.11%, with a V OC of 1.18 and 1.21 V, respectively.  27  In a subsequent study, Chen's group introduced aminoethanesulfonic acid (AESA) into the Cs 0.2 FA 0.8 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 perovskite precursor. The addition of AESA helped to promote the components' uniformity of the perovskite film, resulting in a record-breaking efficiency of 19.66% in an MA-free WBG PSCs with a bandgap of 1.77 eV.  28  To date, there is an increasing research interest in mixed-halogen wide-bandgap perovskites, mainly on seeking new and effective materials to solve the two problems.  9, [29] [30] [31]  However, the reasons leading to the large V OC loss and segregation of halide anions are rarely studied. In this work, we investigate the composition and crystal structure of WBG perovskites along the out-of-plane direction and observe how they affect V OC loss and phase segregation for the first time. Interestingly, we find that the halide anions do not distribute uniformly along this direction as we generally expect in I-Br mixed WBG perovskite, with more bromine on the top and more iodine at the bottom of perovskite film. Further investigation indicates that this nonuniform distribution has a strong relation with V OC loss and phase segregation. First, it leads to the formation of an unfavorable potential well in PSCs, resulting in a large V OC loss. Moreover, the gradient distribution of halide anions generates strain inside perovskite films, exacerbating phase segregation. To address these issues, we introduced a green additive (melatonin) into perovskite precursors. The addition of MT slowed the crystallization rate of perovskite film, balanced the precipitation speed of PbBr 2 and PbI 2 from the solvent, and resulted in homogeneous distribution of halide anions along the out-of-plane direction. This approach ultimately reduced the additional V OC loss and improved the power conversion efficiency of WBG PSCs, suppressing the phase segregation. Subsequently, the MTtreated devices obtained a PCE of 22.88% and a V OC of 1.245 V, with a corresponding V OC loss of only 0.38 V. 
 EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Materials. Formamidinium iodide (FAI, >99.5%), cesium iodide (CsI, 99.999%), lead iodide (PbI 2 , 99.9%), and lead bromide (PbBr 2 , 99.999%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology. Spiro-OMeTAD, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), 4-tertbutylpyridine (TBP), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.8%), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI), and chlorobenzene were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Device Fabrication. First, the FTO glass is cleaned sequentially with deionized water, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and ethanol, with ultrasonic cleaning for 30 min. Then, the FTO glass is dried using a N 2 gun, followed by a 20 min UV-ozone treatment. The SnO 2 colloidal solution (15%) was diluted with deionized water (1:2, v/v), deposited onto the cleaned FTO glass at a spin-coating speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed for 30 min at 150 °C. The 1.60 M Cs 0.1 FA 0.9 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 perovskite precursor solution was obtained by mixing 0.16 mmol of CsI, 1.44 mmol of FAI, 0.408 mmol of PbBr 2 , and 1.192 mmol of PbI 2 in 1 mL of DMF/DMSO (4:1, v/v) mixed solvent. For melatonin-based precursors, 1.2 mg of melatonin were additionally added in the perovskite solution. The perovskite precursor solution was applied to the surface of the SnO 2 layer via spin-coating. The speed was set to 5000 rpm, and the coating was carried out for a duration of 30 s. Subsequently, 220 μL of ethyl acetate was introduced onto the film at 5 s prior to completion of the spin-coating stage. Following this, the specimen was subjected to a period of annealing at a temperature of 150 °C and for a duration of 10 min. Spiro-OMeTAD (72.3 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene and shaken until clarified. Subsequently, 28.8 μL of TBP was added, followed by 17.5 μL of a preconfigured acetonitrile solution of Li-TFSI (520 mg/mL) to configure the hole transport layer solution. This solution was then spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s in a glovebox. Finally, evaporation of a gold electrode proceeded, with an area of 0.06 cm 2 and a thickness of approximately 80 nm. Device Characterization. The perovskite's crystal structures were analyzed through XRD (Rigaku Smartlab-3 kW). A UV-visible spectrophotometer (Agilent Carry5000) was utilized for measuring absorption spectra. A DeltaFlex fluorescence spectrometer (HORI-BA) was used for both photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. The pulsed laser with a wavelength of 485 nm was utilized as the excitation source. I-V characteristics were determined by employing a Keithley 2400 source meter while subjecting the sample to standard AM 1.5 G solar illumination by using a solar simulator from Enli Technology Co., Ltd. The tests were conducted in both reverse (1.30 V → -0.05 V, step: 0.024 V) and forward (-0.05 V → 1.30 V, step: 0.024 V) scan modes. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out using a QE/IPCE system also from Enli Technology Co. Ltd. Dark I-V curves were obtained using the space charge limited current (SCLC). The defect concentration was derived from this. Peeling-Off Method. We prepared a specimen consisting of an ITO/PTAA/perovskite/Ag stack. The PTAA layer, prepared at a concentration of 30 mg/mL in chlorobenzene, acted as a sacrificial layer to remove the perovskite film and expose the bottom interface. The Ag layer was evaporated onto the samples to fully cover the perovskite films. Then, the samples were placed in a N 2 glovebox and immersed in chlorobenzene for 20 min, causing the PTAA layer to dissolve and the perovskite film along with the Ag layer to float. The films were then flipped onto a clean quartz substrate for transportation. To remove any remaining PTAA residues, the samples were immersed in chlorobenzene for an additional 5 min. Finally, the samples were air-dried in a N 2 environment for further evaluation of the bottom interface.  32  Williamson-Hall (W-H) Analysis Method. The microstrain of perovskite films was evaluated by a Williamson-Hall analysis. The microstrain of perovskite films was induced from the XRD patterns based on the equation K D cos 4 sin T = + (1) where β T is the full at width at half-maximum (FHWM), ε is the slope of the fitted straight line, representing the second class of residual strain here, K represents the shape factor, which takes a value of 0.9 for a cubic structure, λ represents the wavelength of incident X-rays (0.15405 nm), D is the crystalline size, and θ is the peak position in radians.  33, 34   
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The one-step deposition method and antisolvent treatment were employed to prepare FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 hybrid perovskite films, as depicted in Figure  S1  (see the Experimental Section for details). Figure  S2  presents the molecular structure of MT, which contains both C�O and -NH groups. First, we characterized the morphologies of perovskite films by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Both perovskite films exhibit a compact morphology with distinct grain boundaries, and the MT-treated film exhibits increased crystal grain size and a more homogeneous size distribution (Figure  1a, b ). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the control and MTtreated films are shown in Figure  1c, d . It can be observed that the introduction of MT results in a reduction in root-meansquare (RMS), indicating a smoother surface for the MT film. This smoother surface facilitates desirable interfacial contact between the perovskite film and the Spiro-OMeTAD layer, thereby promoting electron extraction. The Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) images are displayed in Figure  S3 . It is evident that the surface potential of the MT-treated film has decreased and the distribution is more uniform. However, the control film exhibits a relatively higher surface potential fluctuation. These results suggest that MT can effectively improves the planar homogeneity of the perovskite films. Subsequently, we conducted X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements to investigate the composition as well as the crystallinity of the perovskite films. Figure  1e  illustrates strong XRD peaks at 14.08°, 19.99°, and 31.82°, which correspond to the (100), (110), and (210) diffraction planes of polycrystalline perovskite films,  35  respectively. After the introduction of MT, the positions of these main peaks remained largely unchanged, indicating that MT did not affect the crystal structure and composition of perovskite. In addition, it is found that the introduction of MT enhances the crystallinity of the perovskite films, as evidenced by the obviously stronger diffraction angles at 14.08°after MT treatment. In order to investigate the distribution of halides in the outof-plane direction, we conducted steady-state PL measurements on perovskite films from both the front and back sides, with the front side representing the film surface and the back side representing the glass substrate, as depicted in Figure  2a, b . The PL peak from the back side of the control film exhibits a red-shift of 4 nm compared to that from the front side (Figure  2a ). In contrast, the PL peaks from both sides almost overlap for the MT-treated film (Figure  2b ), suggesting the film is more homogeneous in the vertical direction, and this homogeneity could be attributed to the homogeneous distribution of halides in the out-of-plane direction of the perovskite films. Subsequently, the grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) technique was employed to investigate the crystal structure from the exposed bottom surface of perovskite film (see the Experimental Section for specific experimental methods). By varying the angle of incidence, information about the perovskite film at different depths could be captured. As displayed in Figure  2c , for the control film, the diffraction angle gradually shifts to higher angles with increasing incidence angle, implying that as the film depth increases (away from the glass side of the perovskite film), the films transition from an iodide-rich phase to a bromide-rich phase. This indicates the nonuniform halides distribution along the out-of-plane direction of the control film. In the case of the MT-treated film, it is observed that the diffraction angle of the film remains relatively stable as the incidence angle increases (Figure  2d ), which suggests that MT can improve the inhomogeneous distribution. In order to study the impact of halide distribution on the energy level of perovskite, we performed UV-vis absorption spectra and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, as shown in Figures  S4  and S5 . We can use the following formula to calculate the Fermi energy (E F ): E E 21.22 F cutoff = (2) where E cutoff is the secondary electron cutoff energy boundary.  36, 37  Here, we conducted UV-vis absorption spectroscopy measurements on both the front side (film surface) and the back side (glass substrate) of the perovskite films.  38  As displayed in Figure  S4 , the absorption edge from the glass side of the control film exhibits a slight red-shift compared to that from the front side. However, the absorption edges from both sides almost coincide for the MT-treated film, which indicates improved halide distribution. To further confirm it, we prepared another two perovskite films with higher bromide contents and conducted the same UV-vis measurement. We obtain similar results that the control shows an obvious difference between the top and bottom and MTtreated ones does not. Moreover, as the content of bromide increases, the difference becomes larger (Figure  S4e-l ). This confirms the nonuniform distribution of halides anions and the improvement by MT treatment. Additionally, we measured the UPS on the bottom surface of the exfoliated perovskite films and on the top surface  39  and calculated the value of E F (Figure  S5 ). All of these parameters are summarized in Table  S1 . Figure  2e  presents the corresponding energy level diagram of the bottom and upper of the perovskite, SnO 2 , and spiro-OMeTAD layer. As seen, a potential well between the perovskite film and SnO 2 is formed for the control film, which is unfavorable for electron transport to SnO 2 . This potential well is absent for MT-treated film. The improved band alignment between perovskite/SnO 2 enables efficient electron and hole selective extraction at the interfaces. Furthermore, we investigated energy alignments of perovskite films with higher Br contents using UPS (Figures  S6  and S7 ). We find that the energy level difference between the top and bottom of the perovskite becomes larger and the potential well between SnO 2 and perovskite becomes deeper as the Br content increases. These further confirm the nonuniform distribution of halides as observed and its effect on the arrangement of energy level. In the following, we investigated the effect of the uniform distribution of halides on the extraction of electrons and holes. First, we prepared electron-only and hole-only structures: glass/SnO 2 /perovskite and glass/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. The TRPL was then employed to characterize the extraction ability of electrons and holes. As illustrated in Figure  3a ,b, the extraction rates of electrons and holes in the control device exhibit significant differences, whereas the extraction rates of electrons and holes in the MT device show less disparity. This observation suggests that the uniform distribution of halides can enhance the matching of electron and hole extraction rates, thereby facilitating the carrier transport of the devices. Additionally, we performed electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and dark J-V characterization measurements to investigate the charge transport behavior of PSCs. The Nyquist plots in Figure  3c  demonstrate that the MT-treated film has a lower charge transfer resistance (R ct ) and a higher carrier recombination resistance (R rec ). The dark current density of the MT-treated devices, as shown in Figure  3d , is 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the control device. To further assess the trap density of perovskite films with a more uniform halide distribution after MT treatment, we employed electron-only and hole-only devices to measure the SCLC (Figure  3e, f ). The electron trap-state density and hole trap-state density values for the control devices are 1.02 × 10 16 and 1.16 × 10 16 cm -3 , respectively, based on the dark J-V curve. For the MT-treated devices, the corresponding values are 5.87 × 10 15 and 9.18 × 10 15 cm -3 , respectively (Table  S2 ). These suggest that there is less charge recombination and better interfacial contact  40  after MT treatment. To investigate the impact of a uniform distribution of halides on the stability of perovskite films under irradiation, steady-state PL was used to examine the photostability under continuous AM 1.5G illumination. Following a period of 240 min of illumination, the PL peak of the control film exhibited a shift from 760 to 781 nm, which suggests severe phase segregation (Figure  3g ). However, with the introduction of MT, the PL peak only shifts from 758 to 769 nm (Figure  3h ), indicating a notable improvement in photostability. We also calculated the PL FWHM and found that the FWHM of the control film increased from 42 to 53, and the FWHM gradually widened as the illumination time increased. However, the FWHM of the MT-treated film increased from 40 to 43, and the FWHM did not have obvious widening as the illumination time increased. This improvement can be linked to the more uniform distribution of halides within the perovskite film following the treatment with MT. To further confirm the photostability, we measured the in situ PL both on the top and bottom sides of the perovskite films under 405 nm laser excitation with an intensity of 100 mW cm -2 . As shown in Figure  S8 , the control film showed an obvious shift under continuous laser excitation. It is even more serious for the top surface of a perovskite film with higher Br contents. However, it did not shift for the MT-treated film, and we cannot see any difference between the top surface and bottom surface. This confirmed that the perovskite films with homogeneous halide distribution can inhibit phase separation and improve photostability. Considering the gradient distribution of halide anions along the out-of-plane direction, it is supposed that strain might be generated. Williamson-Hall (W-H) plots were utilized to investigate the strain in the mixed-halide WBG perovskite films (see the Experimental Section for details). The slope of each fitted curve in Figure  3i  represents the magnitude of the strain. The slopes are 0.0070 for the control film and 0.0042 for the MT film, which suggests that strain exists as expected, and it becomes smaller after MT treatment. The relationship between the halide distribution and magnitude of strain indicates that halide nonuniformity contributes to the generation of strain. We further believe that the strain reduction after MT modification is an important reason for the improved phase segregation of perovskite films under light irradiation. To confirm this, we performed W-H fitting and photostability experiments on perovskite films with higher Br contents as well. As shown in Figures  S9  and S10 , the strain gradually increases and the photostability becomes worse as the Br content increases, which confirms that the halide uniformity has strong relationship with strain and phase segregation in WBG perovskites. To explore the physical mechanism leading to the nonuniform halide distribution, we investigated the growth process of the perovskite films. The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) full spectra exhibited stretching vibrations of the -NH at 3430 cm -1 and the C�O at 1658 cm -1 (Figure  4a, b ). The characteristic stretching vibration presents notable shifts after MT treatment, indicating the chemical interaction between the MT molecule and the PbI 2 . This interaction is further confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results that the Pb 4f and I 3d peaks shift to lower binding energies after MT treatment (Figure  4c, d ) and the Br 3d peak shifts to lower binding energies (Figure  S11 ). The perovskite crystallization kinetics were investigated by in situ observation and PL measurements. We coated perovskite precursor on substrate and annealed at a low temperature of 50 °C to slow down and observe the crystallization process. Figure  S12  demonstrates that freshly coated perovskite precursor films initially appear brown. The control film gradually darkens from brown to dark brown (within 10 s) and eventually turns black (within 40 s). However, the precursor film with MT exhibits a much slower color change during the annealing process, transitioning from brown to black after 80 s. During the annealing process, the films were monitored by in situ PL as well. Figure  4e ,f shows that the control sample achieves its maximum PL intensity after being heated at 50 °C for 40 s, while the target sample reaches its maximum PL intensity after being heated at 50 °C for 80 s. These suggest that the addition of MT can effectively delay the crystallization rate of the perovskite. As illustrated in Figure  4i , the slow crystallization speed allows for the even incorporation speed of Br and I anion into the octahedral framework. In the case of quick crystallization, the Br anion exhibits higher incorporation speed due to the lower solubility of PbBr 2 in the solvent than PbI 2 , which leads to higher Br content on the upper region of perovskite film. Furthermore, to confirm that the mismatched energy level in the vertical direction of the perovskite is caused by the X-site ions and not by the A-site ions, we conducted in situ PL measurements on the FA 0.8 Cs 0.2 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 and FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 Pb(I 0.7 Br 0.3 ) 3 perovskite samples during the annealing process as above and compared with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 Pb-(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 . We find that the increase in Cs content does not have an obvious effect on the position of the PL peak, whereas the increase in Br content notably shifts it (Figure  4g, h ). This suggests that the energy level mismatch is indeed induced by the heterogeneous distribution of X-site anions. Subsequently, we fabricated PSCs with the structures of FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite (FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 /spiro-OMe-TAD/Au. We conducted a systematic comparison of the photovoltaic performance of the devices with and without MT. Figure  S13  presents the box statistics of PCE (%), FF (%), V OC , and J SC for both the control and the MT-treated groups. These results indicate that MT additives notably improve the performance of the device. Figure  5a  displays the current density versus voltage (J-V) curve for the cells with and without MT, showing that the device with MT achieves a higher PCE of 22.88% compared to the control film's PCE of 19.77%. Additionally, the PSC with MT exhibits a higher V OC of 1.25 V, a J SC of 23.06 mA/cm 2 , and an FF of 79.7% (Table  S3 ). We also measured the EQE of the control and MT devices (Figure  5b ). The device with MT demonstrated higher values across the entire wavelength range, indicating improved charge transport and carrier collection after MT treatment. The integration current of 22.32 mA/cm 2 for MT-treated devices is larger than that for the control (21.83 mA/cm 2 ). Based on the best we know, this is the highest efficiency and lowest V OC loss for wide-bandgap PSCs with ∼1.63 eV (Figure  5c  and Table  S4 ). Additionally, we measured the long-term stability and thermal stability of PSCs with and without MT. The unencapsulated devices were aged in the air with 30-40% humidity for over 1200 h. It was found that the MT devices exhibited a retention of 85% of its initial PCE, whereas the control devices demonstrated 65% of its original level (Figure  5d ). The thermal stability of the devices was investigated by subjecting them to a temperature of 85 °C on a hot plate within a N 2 glovebox, after which the PCE was measured. The MT devices demonstrated a sustained PCE of 89% over the course of 400 h, a notable improvement over the 76% observed in the control devices (Figure  S14 ). As far as the mechanism for the improved stability is concerned, we believe the suppressed phase segregation by MT treatment plays a leading role. Moreover, the -NH group of MT interacts with halide ions and forms a hydrogen bond, which inhibits ion migration and contributes to the stability as well. 
 CONCLUSION In summary, we investigate the halide distribution along the out-of-plane direction of WBG perovskite and its effect on the performance of the device for the first time. Through PL and GIXRD measurement, we find that halide anions exhibit gradient distribution along the out-of-plane direction, with higher Br content on the top of perovskite film and higher I content at the bottom. This uneven distribution leads to the formation of a potential well between SnO 2 and perovskite, which hinders the extraction of photogenerated electrons. Moreover, the nonuniform distribution leads to the generation of strain in perovskite film, hastening the phase segregation under light irradiation. After MT treatment, this uniform distribution issue is well addressed. Accordingly, it optimizes energy level alignment, promotes electron extraction, and suppresses phase segregation. Finally, based on this method, we obtain a WBG PSC, which has a PCE of 22.88% and notably improved stability.
