 Device Fabrication: Single-junction NBG PSCs. The pre-patterned FTO glass substrates were cleaned in sequence with deionized water and IPA. PEDOT:PSS was deposited on FTO substrates by spin-coating at 5,000 rpm for 30 s and was then annealed on a hotplate at 120 °C for 15 min in ambient air. After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were transferred immediately to a N 2 -filled glovebox. The NBG perovskite films were fabricated by spin coating NBG perovskite precursor at 1,000 r.p.m. for 10 s and 5,000 r.p.m. for 35s. CB (300 μl) at room temperature was dropped on the spinning substrate during the second spin-coating step 20 s before the end of the procedure. For the EDAI 2 -passivated perovskite films, EDAI 2 solution (with a concentration of 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 mg/ml in IPA) was dropped dynamically on the spinning substrate at 5000 r.p.m. for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. For the PCBM-passivated perovskite films, PCBM solution (with a concentration of 3, 5, 7 and 9 mg/ml in CB) was dropped statically on the substrate and was spin-coated at 5000 r.p.m. for 30 s and annealed at 70 °C for 5 min. For the ISADP perovskite films, EDAI 2 and PCBM were sequentially deposited on the perovskite films. Then 25 nm C 60 was thermally evaporated (Beijing Technol Science) on top of the films. After that, the films were then transferred to the atomic layer deposition system (Shenzhen Superald). After 180 cycles, SnO 2 (25nm) was deposited at 90 °C using tetrakis (dimethylamino) tin (IV) and deionized water. After ALD deposition, the substrates were transferred back to the thermal evaporation system to deposit 90 nm Ag. All-perovskite Tandem Solar Cells. The pre-patterned ITO glass substrates were sequentially cleaned using deionized water and isopropanol. NiO was deposited by magnetron sputtering on the ITO substrates. Subsequently, the solution of the self-assembled molecule (SAM, Me-4PACz:MeO-2PACz=1:1, 0.3 mg mL -1 in ethanol) was spin-coated on the NiO film at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 ℃ for 5 min in air. After cooling, the substrates were transferred immediately to a N 2 -filled glovebox for the deposition of WBG perovskite films. The WBG perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated at 2,000 r.p.m. for 10s and 4,000 r.p.m. for 40 s. EA (150 μl) was dropped on the spinning substrate during the second spin-coating step at 10 s before the end of the procedure. Then, it was annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, the perovskite films were post-treated by spin coating PDAI 2 solution (1 mg mL -1 in IPA) at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s and annealed at 100 ℃ for 5 min. Then 25 nm C 60 was thermally deposited. The films were then transferred to the atomic layer deposition system (Shenzhen Superald). After 180 cycles, SnO 2 (25nm) was deposited at 90 °C using tetrakis (dimethylamino) tin (IV) and deionized water. After ALD deposition, the substrates were transferred back to the thermal evaporation system to deposit an ultrathin layer of Au clusters (approximately 1 nm). NBG subcells were then deposited on top of the substrates, following the same processes as the fabrication of single-junction NBG PSCs. 
 Characterizations of Perovskite Films: X-ray diffraction (XRD) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns of perovskite films were measured by Empyrean diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with a Nickel filter. The diffraction data were collected with an angular range of 5° < 2θ < 60° and Δ θ = 0.02° over 10 min. Photoluminescence mapping (PL mapping) and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured by DeltaFLEX (Horiba). The excitation wavelength was set at 532 nm. PLQY tests were performed by FLS1000 (EdinburghInstruments) with 532 nm excitation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films were acquired using the Field emission SEM (JSM-7800F). The cross-sectional SEM images of the tandem devices were observed by the Field emission SEM (TESCAN MAIA3 GMU). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained by the Cypher S (Oxford Instruments). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed on the Thermo Fisher ESCALAB XI+ spectrometer with a non-monochromated He Iα photon source (hν = 21.22 eV). Absorption spectra of the perovskite films were recorded by the Shimadzu UV 2450 spectrometry. For the PCBM-passivated and ISADP perovskite films, the concentration of PCBM was 5 mg/ml (CB) unless otherwise specified. For the EDAI 2passivated and ISADP perovskite films, the concentration of EDAI 2 was 0.7 mg/ml (IPA) unless otherwise specified. 
 Characterizations of Solar Cells: Current density-Voltage (J-V) curves of the single junction PSCs and TSCs were measured under AM 1.5G illumination (1000 W m -2 ) from a light source simulator (Enlitech Technology) with a digital source meter (Keithley 2400). The intensity of the light source was calibrated by a standard silicon reference cell (calibrated by the National PV Industry Measurement and Testing Center). For the NBG single-junction PSCs, the current density-voltage (J-V) and light intensity-dependent V OC (V-L) measurements were conducted in reverse (from 0.9 V to -0.1 V) scan and forward (from -0.1 V to 0.9 V) scan, with a delay time of 50 ms. The light intensity was changed by changing the power input of the light source. For the TSCs, the measurements were conducted under reverse (from 2.2 V to -0.1 V) scan and forward (from -0.1 V to 2.2 V) scan, with a delay time of 50 ms. External quantum efficiency measurements were conducted by the QE-R (Enlitech Technology) under DC mode with a metallic designated shading mask. For the TSCs, the EQE spectra of the WBG subcells were measured with an 850 nm near-infrared continuous biased light and the NBG subcells were measured with a 550 nm blue continuous biased light. Dark current curves, Mott-Schottky measurements and EIS measurements were conducted on an electrochemical analysis instrument (CHI660E, CH Instruments Ins). For the dark current measurement, the voltage scanned from -0.5 V to 1 V with the speed of 20 mV s -1 in a dark box. For the Mott-Schottky measurement, the voltage scanned from 0 V to 1 V with the speed of 2 mV s -1 in a dark box. 
 Stability Tests of Solar Cells: The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) tests were conducted for the encapsulated devices under continuous AM 1.5G illumination in a chamber, and the temperature was set at 25 °C. The voltage was automatically calculated and applied; the current output of the device was tracked. All devices were encapsulated by glass sheets (25 mm × 25 mm × 2 mm), interconnected via halo-butyl in the middle in a vacuum laminator by hot press. The upper and lower substrate temperature was set at 90 °C. The background pressure was brought to below 10 kPa, and then the sample was pressed for 10 min.                   Figure S6 .

Title: An Orientation-Enhanced Interlayer Enables Efficient Sn-Pb Binary Perovskite Solar Cells and All-Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells with High Fill Factors
The performance of narrow-bandgap (NBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is limited by the severe nonradiative recombination and carrier transport barrier at the electron selective interface. Here, we reveal the importance of the molecular orientation for effective defect passivation and protection for Sn 2+ at the perovskite/C 60 interface. We constructed an internally self-anchored dual-passivation (ISADP) layer, where the orientation of PCBM can be significantly enhanced by the interaction between ammonium and carbonyl groups. It can facilitate the contact with C 60 and minimize the nonradiative energy loss at the electron transport interface. This strategy remarkably enhances the FF of NBG PSCs, from 77.45% to 82.88%, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 20.67% to 24.02%. Moreover, monolithic allperovskite TSCs exhibit a high certified PCE (under reverse scan) of 28.12% and a record FF of 84.25%. This work opens up a new pathway for enhancing the performance of monolithic all-perovskite TSCs.
O ver the past 15 years, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become the most promising next-generation photovoltaic technology owing to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low manufacturing costs.  [1] [2] [3] [4]  All-perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs), combining a wide-bandgap (WBG) PSC as the front subcell and a narrow-bandgap (NBG) PSC as the back subcell, have attracted great attention due to their higher potential PCE without limitation of the Shockley-Queisser (S-Q) theoretical efficiency limit.  5, 6  However, the performance of TSCs is now limited by the NBG subcells that contain a hybrid of Sn 2+ and Pb 2+ .  7, 8  Currently, great efforts have been made to further improve the performance of NBG PSCs.  [9] [10] [11] [12]  It has been demonstrated that surface treatment can significantly enhance the performance of PSCs.  13  Ethylenediamine (EDA) has been found to decrease the surface defects by screening perovskite against oxygen and bonding with undercoordinated Sn 2+ .  14  Quasi-2D materials have been developed for surface passivation of NBG perovskite films.  15  Recently, a PCE of 22.65% for Sn-Pb hybrid PSC with a high FF of 81.47% by BDA-EDAI 2 surface polishing has been achieved.  16  However, research on passivation methods for NBG perovskites remains limited. The severe nonradiative recombination at the NBG perovskite/C 60 interface is still a huge challenge. The fill factor (FF) values of NBG PSCs and monolithic all-perovskite TSCs are normally less than 83%, far behind their single-junction pure-Pb counterpart (>86%). Due to the rapid reaction between Sn 2+ and organic cations, the crystallization process of NBG perovskite is uncontrollable, leading to uneven film surfaces and enormous defects.  17  These exposed Sn  2+  and vacancy defects at the grain boundaries can result in significant nonradiative recombination of charge carriers.  18  Although [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is rarely used as electron transport layers (ETL) nowadays due to its lower electron mobility compared to C 60 , a thin film of PCBM was proven effective for defect passivation.  [19] [20] [21] [22] [23]  However, the application of PCBM is limited in the state-of-the-art configuration of all-perovskite TSCs and the underlying reason is still unclear. In this study, we reveal the importance of the molecular orientation for the effective defect passivation, grain boundary filling, and protection for Sn 2+ at the perovskite/ETL interface. We constructed an internally self-anchored dual-passivation (ISADP) layer, where the orientation of PCBM can be significantly enhanced by the application of diammonium diiodide compounds such as ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI 2 ), propanediammonium diiodide (PDAI 2 ), and butanediammonium diiodide (BDAI 2 ). As a result, the nonradiative recombination and open-circuit voltage (V OC ) deficit are reduced. Well stacked PCBM and superior interfacial energy alignment facilitate charge transport at the perovskite/ETL interface, which improves the FF and short-circuit current (J SC ) of the devices. The PCE of NBG PSCs was promoted from 20.67% to 24.02% with an improved V OC of 0.88 V and an impressive FF of 82.88%. The monolithic all-perovskite TSC with a champion PCE of 28.61% and an FF of 84.39% (certified PCE = 28.12%, FF = 84.25%) was achieved. The projected T90 for the encapsulated TSCs at the maximum power point (MPP) was prolonged by 36.6%. We proposed that the diammonium diiodide compounds layer acts as a double-sided adhesive tape, to simultaneously passivate the surface defect of the perovskite and modulate the molecular alignment of PCBM, which affects transport properties of PCBM.  24  The schematic diagrams of the interface contact and defect passivation for the EDAI 2 -passivated and ISADP films are illustrated in Figures  1a  and 1b . This achieves superior contact at the perovskite/C 60 interface and a superior passivation effect at the perovskite surface. Characterizations were performed to validate our hypothesis. We first conducted molecular dynamics simulations (Supplementary Note 1) on nine randomly distributed PCBM molecules on the perovskite or EDA substrate. After relaxation, the PCBM molecules exhibited a random distribution on the perovskite substrate (Figure  S1 ) and an orientated alignment on the EDA substrate, with the C=O facing toward the EDA (Figure  S2 ). The relaxation process is demonstrated in Supplementary Videos 1 and 2. Grazingincidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) was further performed on PCBM films deposited on bare glass or glass/diammonium diiodide compound layer (EDAI 2 , PDAI 2 , and BDAI 2 ) substrate (Figure  1c ). The higher intensity revealed a more oriented molecular alignment when PCBM film was deposited on glass/diammonium diiodide compound layer substrates.  25  Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy tests were conducted on EDAI 2 , PCBM, and EDAI 2 /PCBM films. As demonstrated in Figure  1d , the C=O stretching peak of the pure PCBM film shifted from 1735 to 1732 cm -1 when it was deposited on a glass/EDAI 2 substrate. The NH 3 + in-plane bending peak of EDAI 2 also shifted from 1577 to 1572 cm -1 . These results indicate a reduced vibrational frequency due to the coordination between the C=O bond of PCBM and the NH 3 + group of EDAI 2 . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was then performed on the PCBM films deposited on perovskite/EDAI 2 or perovskite. As illustrated in Figure  S3 , the O 1s peak shifted from 532.7 to 531.99 eV when there was a pretreated EDAI 2 layer, indicating the environment change of C=O in PCBM. We then assessed the impact of the ISADP strategy on NBG perovskite film qualities. The NBG perovskite with a composition of (FASnI 3 ) 0.6 (MAPbI 3 ) 0.4 and a low Urbach energy (E U ) was studied.  26  The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern demonstrates a well-crystallized perovskite film (Figure  S4 ). For the EDAI 2 and PCBM-passivated devices, EDAI 2 and PCBM solutions were dropped onto the perovskite films, followed by spin-coating and annealing. For the ISADP films, EDAI 2 and PCBM were sequentially deposited on the perovskite films. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra and the corresponding Tauc-plot curves of the posttreated films are illustrated in Figures  S5a  and S5b . The nearly unchanged UV-vis spectra and bandgaps (E g = 1.25 eV) revealed that the post-treatments had minimal impacts on the overall quality of the perovskite films. We assessed the film morphology before and after posttreatment by conducting scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements. As illustrated in Figure  S6 , after EDAI 2 treatment, the perovskite grain surfaces were uniformly coated with a thin organic layer with poor conductivity, resulting in blurred grain boundaries. In the case of PCBM treatment, cracks appear at the grain boundaries, which may be attributed to poor wettability between the PCBM and the perovskite and the unevenness of the film surface. The presence of these cracks may lead to the exposure of grain boundary defects and cause current leakage. For the ISADP films, improved coverage and filling at the grain boundaries were observed, indicating fewer defects. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were subsequently conducted to confirm the surface morphology of the films. As shown in Figure  S7 , the rootmean-square (RMS) roughness of the control perovskite film decreased from 47.28 to 46.17 nm with EDAI 2 treatment and to 44.54 nm with PCBM treatment, and decreased to 40.47 nm with ISADP treatment. The smoother surface will facilitate contact with C 60 and enhance charge carrier transport performance. To understand the reasons for the changes in the surface morphology of the perovskite, we conducted contact angle measurements for the PCBM solution (Figure  S8 ). The contact angle of the PCBM solution on the perovskite layer was 20.7°and decreased to 12.4°on the EDAI 2 -treated film, which was attributed to a smoother surface after EDAI 2 treatment and the interactions between PCBM and EDAI 2 . The performance of the charge carriers significantly influences the performance of PSCs. We first conducted steady-state photoluminescence (PL) tests to evaluate the effect of our strategy on carrier recombination characteristics. As shown in Figure  2a , when excited from the glass side, the emission intensity remains similar for the perovskite films with different PCBM thicknesses, suggesting that the PCBM layers are too thin to significantly reduce carrier concentration. When excited from the film side, the PL intensity markedly decreases due to the high defect density in the film surface. We further assessed the effect of different passivation methods on PL intensity by exciting the samples from the film side and found that the ISADP method provided significantly better passivation compared to the single-layer passivation (Figure  2b ). We conducted photoluminescence mapping (PL mapping) tests to assess the uniformity of carrier performance (Figure  S9 ), which was characterized by the coefficient of variation (COV), defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the PL intensity. The ISADP film exhibited the lowest COV of 0.052. We propose that the uniformity of PL intensity within the microregion has been improved due to the effective passivation of grain boundary defects. The carrier lifetime was obtained by the time-resolved photoluminescence TRPL test (Figure  2c , Supporting Information, and Table  S3 ). The carrier lifetimes for the control, EDAI 2 -passivated, PCBMpassivated, and ISADP films were 431.06, 545.11, 450.76, and 609.98 ns, respectively. We further performed photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) measurements to investigate the impact of the ISADP strategy on quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) of the  
 Nano Letters pubs.acs.org/NanoLett Letter perovskite. The PLQY results for the control and ISADP films with or without C 60 are presented in Figure  2d , from which QFLS were calculated (Figure  2e  and Supplementary Note 3). For the 1.25 eV (FASnI 3 ) 0.6 (MAPbI 3 ) 0.4 perovskite, the radiative QFLS limit was 0.98 V. The QFLS value of the ISADP film was 0.885 V, which was higher than that of the control film (0.817 V). For the films with a C 60 layer, the QFLS was 0.852 and 0.76 V. The QFLS improvement was attributed to reduced interfacial loss, which suppressed voltage and FF deficits.  27  Space charge limited-current (SCLC) measurements were performed on hole-only devices to estimate the influence of our strategy on the defect densities of the perovskite films (Figure  2f ). The defect densities were calculated from the SCLC curves (Supplementary Note 4). The control device exhibited the highest defect density of 9.18 × 10 14 cm -3 . The EDAI 2 -passivated and PCBM-passivated films exhibited a lower defect density of 5.68 × 10 14 and 6.12 × 10 14 cm -3 , respectively. The ISADP film showed the lowest defect density of 5.42 × 10 14 cm -3 , demonstrating that the ISADP strategy was efficient in decreasing surface defects. The ISADP strategy was also demonstrated to protect Sn 2+ from oxidation. We conducted XPS measurements for the perovskite films with or without passivation exposed to air for 5 h (Figure  S10 ) to assess the influence of our strategy on antioxidation ability. The integrated area ratios of Sn 2+ to Sn 4+ were 1.216, 7.375, 6.556, and 10.5 for the control, EDAI 2 -passivated, PCBMpassivated, and ISADP perovskite films, respectively (Figure  2g ). The inhibited formation of Sn 4+ demonstrates that the ISADP strategy remarkably improves the antioxidation ability of the perovskite film. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed to analyze the energy alignment of the perovskite (Figures  S11  and S12 ). The energy level diagram is illustrated in Figure  2h  (Supplementary Note 5). Upon treating the perovskite surface with the passivation layer, we observed a shift of the valence band maximum along with the Fermi level of the perovskite. The control film exhibited a strong p-type character due to the oxidation of Sn 2+ to Sn 4+ . The passivated films demonstrated more n-type characteristics due to the protection of exposed Sn 2+ , benefiting the carrier transport process.  14, 23  We further assessed the influence of the orientation of PCBM on the charge carrier transfer characteristics by measuring conductivity and electron mobility calculated by the Mott-Gurney law (Figure  S6 , Figure  S13 , and Table  S1 ). The conductivity and mobility both increased by over 60%, indicating that the pretreated EDAI 2 has a significant effect on the electrical properties of PCBM. We fabricated inverted single-junction NBG PSCs based on the configuration of glass/FTO/PEDOT:PSS/NBG PVSK (∼850 nm)/passivation/C 60 /ALD-SnO 2 /Ag. The schematic diagram and cross-sectional SEM image of the entire PSC are illustrated in Figures  3a  and 3b . The concentrations of EDAI 2 and PCBM for single-layer passivation were optimized. With the increase of the EDAI 2 concentration (Figure  S14 ), both the V OC and FF were enhanced, indicating improved passivation effects. For the PCBM-passivated devices (Figure  S15 ), the V OC increase, which was attributed to grain boundary passivation, was less pronounced, and the FF values declined when the concentration was greater than 5 mg/mL. The FF and J SC decline were attributed to increased series resistance (R S ) and poor contact between C 60 and PCBM. The detailed concentration optimization for the ISADP strategy is illustrated in Figure  S16  and the average PCE is illustrated in Figure  3c , which demonstrates a synergistic effect of PCBM and EDAI 2 , with impressive V OC enhancement. The FF showed a significant improvement, and the reduction of J SC was effectively mitigated compared with single-layer passivation, achieving a high PCE. The optimal concentrations for EDAI 2 and PCBM are 0.7 and 5 mg/mL, achieving the highest FF values. These results indicated that the synergistic effect of the ISADP strategy is important for enhancing the performance of NBG PSCs. The current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the champion PSCs are illustrated in Figure  3d . The optimum PCE of the control device was 20.67%. After EDAI 2 or PCBM treatment, the devices showed similar performance enhancement. After ISADP post-treatment, the champion device showed a remarkable PCE of 24.02%, with a V OC of 0.88 V, a J SC of 32.94 mA cm -2 , and an impressive FF of 82.88% (Table  S2 ). The efficiency and FF values of the champion ISADP device are among the best in recently published studies, as illustrated in Figure  3e .  11, 12, 16, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41]  External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were conducted for the devices (Figure  3f ), revealing an EQE decrease in the range of 650 and 800 nm for the EDAI 2passivated and PCBM-passivated devices. We attributed the EQE decrease to an increased R S . The decrease was reduced for the ISADP device, which was attributed to improved charge carrier transport. The integrated J SC values calculated from the EQE results were in good agreement with the J SC values obtained from the J-V curves. We further calculated the Urbach energy (E U ) from the EQE spectra to demonstrate the subgap defects of the devices (Supplementary Note 7).  42  As shown in Figure  S17 , the ISADP device exhibited the lowest E U value (20.53 meV). This result indicates reduced electrical disorder and reduced subgap absorption for the ISADP device, demonstrating less V OC deficit, which we attributed to more effective defect passivation.  26  Mott-Schottky (M-S) measurements (Figure  3g ) further revealed that the ISADP device exhibited the highest built-in potential (V bi ) of 0.691 V, significantly higher than that of the control (0.59 V), EDAI 2passivated (0.675 V), and PCBM-passivated (0.64 V) devices. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (Figure  S18 ) and dark-current measurements (Figure  S19 ) were further performed to assess the carrier recombination characteristics of the devices. The largest semicircle in the EIS spectra and lowest saturation current in dark conditions of the ISADP device demonstrated significantly reduced nonradiative recombination rate. Light-intensity-dependent V OC measurements (Figure  3h ) indicated the lowest ideality factor (n) for the ISADP device (n = 1.29) compared to the control (n = 1.57), EDAI 2 -passivated (n = 1.33), and PCBM-passivated (n = 1.38) devices (Supplementary Note 8), suggesting reduced Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination, consistent with the trends of V OC and V bi . To assess the influence of our strategy on the storage stability of NBG PSCs, we stored the unencapsulated devices in a N 2 -filled glovebox under dark conditions (Figure  3i ). After 2000 h of storage, the control, EDAI 2 -passivated, PCBMpassivated, and ISADP devices retained 81.7%, 91.7%, 85.9%, and 95.2% of their initial PCEs. The above results demonstrate that our strategy significantly enhances the performance of NBG PSCs. Based on the above results, we further fabricated monolithic all-perovskite TSCs with the configuration glass/ITO/NiO/   4a  and 4b . A WBG perovskite with a composition of FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 was employed to fabricate the back subcell of the TSC. The J-V curve and the EQE spectrum of a single-junction WBG PSC are shown in Figures  S20a  and S20b . The J-V curves of the champion control and ISADP TSCs are illustrated in Figure  4c , and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table  S4 . The champion PCE of the ISADP TSC was 28.61%, representing a 5.88% improvement compared to the control TSC's PCE of 27.02%. The stabilized PCE of the champion ISADP TSC device was 28.43% (Figure  S21 ). We also fabricated 1.035 cm 2 TSCs, achieving a champion PCE of 27.37%, compared to the control TSC's PCE of 25.6% (Figure  S22  and Table  S5 ). This result demonstrates that our strategy is effective when it is scaled up to larger areas. We sent an encapsulated TSC to an accredited independent photovoltaic calibration laboratory (China National PV Industry Measurement and Testing Center, NPVM) for certification. The TSC achieved a certified PCE of 28.12% (V OC = 2.129 V, J SC = 15.68 mA cm -2 , FF = 84.25%, reverse voltage scan) with an aperture area of 0.07634 cm 2 (Figure  S23 ). This efficiency is among the best in recently published studies, with a record FF among all TSC works with efficiencies >26%, as illustrated in Figure  4d .  12, 16, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41]  The J SC values integrated from the EQE spectra (Figure  4d ) for the NBG and WBG subcells were 15.71 and 15.89 mA cm -2 , respectively, which were well-matched and in good agreement with the J SC values obtained from the J-V curves. We conducted MPPT tests for the encapsulated control and ISADP TSCs to confirm the influence of our strategy on the device operational stability. As illustrated in Figure  4f , the ISADP strategy extended the time required for the device's PCE to decrease by 10% (T90) from 530 h for the control device to 726 h, representing a 36.6% increase. This operational stability performance is among the best in recently published works (Table  S6 ). In conclusion, we demonstrated a dual passivation strategy to simultaneously passivate the defects at the perovskite surface and improve the charge transport at the perovskite/C 60 interface. More oriented molecular alignment was achieved by the interaction between EDAI 2 and PCBM. A smoother film surface with decreased defects and a longer carrier lifetime was observed, improving the FF of the device. This optimized device structure significantly improves the PCE and shelf stability of the NBG PSCs. The champion single junction device yielded a champion PCE of 24.02% with a high FF of 82.88%. Moreover, we fabricated monolithic all-perovskite TSCs, achieving a champion PCE of 28.61% (certified 28.12% with a record FF of 84.25%) with a stabilized PCE of 28.43%, which maintained 90% of its initial PCE after 726 h of MPPT. This work sheds light on new strategies boosting the performance of NBG PSCs and monolithic all-perovskite TSCs.
