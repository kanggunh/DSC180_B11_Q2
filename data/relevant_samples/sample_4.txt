Title: Enhancing stability and efficiency in SnO 2 based HTL-free, printable carbon-based perovskite solar cells for outdoor/indoor photovoltaics
Recent advancements in hole transport layer (HTL)-free, printable carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) have gained increased research interest. Notably, their scalability, cost-effectiveness, and improved stability make them particularly attractive among various perovskite solar cell configurations. In the current study, we explored the potential of un-encapsulated, HTL-free, C-PSCs in outdoor and indoor light conditions, employing different concentrations of tin oxide (SnO 2 ) as the electron transport material. Among the investigated concentrations, 0.07 M SnO 2 precursor yielded the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE), reaching 9.79% under standard 1 sun illumination and 10.40% at a lower intensity of 0.6 sun. The PSCs demonstrated a remarkable 22.37% efficiency under 1000 lx indoor CFL illumination, and attained 22.21% efficiency under LED illumination, marking the highest reported indoor photovoltaic performance for carbon-based, HTL-free PSCs. To elucidate the underlying charge-transfer process, we carried out intensity-dependent current-voltage (J-V) measurements to analyze non-radiative bulk recombination in the perovskite layer. Interfacial recombination was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and transient photovoltage decay measurements. Optical and electrical stimulation of C-PSCs were performed under both full sun and indoor illumination, providing insight into recombination and light absorption differences under these illuminations. Additionally, we also showcased the potential of simple, printable indoor light harvesters for self-powered applications by connecting two C-PSCs to create a self-powered temperature sensor.
Introduction Over the past ten years, the photovoltaic research community worldwide has paid increased attention to PSCs due to their better power conversion efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and the utilization of scalable, less energy-intensive fabrication procedures with efficiencies reaching 26.1 % in merely a decade time.  [1] [2] [3] [4]  With the intense research taking place in perovskite solar cell technology, it is presently undergoing the transition from laboratory based science to commercial products.  [5] [6] [7] [8]  Recently, silicon-perovskite tandem devices have gained wider attention reaching to an efficiency of 33.7 %, much closer to the Shockley limit.  [9]  The efficient PSCs used to realize higher PCE employ precious scarce metal electrodes like gold (Au) or silver (Ag) which limits its scalability potentials simultaneously increasing the production cost tremendously.  [2, 3, 10, 11]  Therefore, as an alternative to noble metals, C-PSCs is under development which offer the possibility of using affordable carbon based materials as well as provides the advantage of using simple scalable processes like screen-printing, blade coating, slotdie deposition and spray coating which can easily be translated to pilot production.  [8, [12] [13] [14]  Another significant barrier preventing PSCs from being commercialised is the utilisation of many layers, which results in multiple interfaces and labor-intensive fabrication. Thus use of HTL-free architecture along with printable carbon-based electrodes and semiconductor electron transport layers processed at lower temperatures, is gaining prominence.  [15] [16] [17]  This approach is recognized for its simplicity, ease of fabrication, reduced production costs, and improved scalability potential. With the incorporation of suitable perovskite materials and device architectures, HTL-free C-PSCs are expected to achieve efficiencies surpassing 17 %.  [18] . The conventional HTL-free, C-PSC architecture uses either mesoporous or planar electron transport layers (ETL).  [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24]  Planar ETL improves the charge extraction and transport by lowering the recombination rate at the ETL/perovskite interface.  [25]  Tin oxide (SnO 2 ) is the most commonly used planar ETL considering better charge transport properties and can be processed at lower temperatures compared to mesoporous structures, primarily based on TiO 2 and ZnO.  [26] [27] [28]  The added advantages of wide band gap, higher electron mobility, deep conduction and valance band make SnO 2 an ideal ETL for perovskite solar cells. In 2015, Ke et. al. replaced mesoporous TiO 2 layer with SnO 2 which increased the average efficiency of the PSCs from 15.17 % to 16.44 %.  [29]  In HTL free, C-PSC, the open-circuit potential (V oc ) and fill factor (FF) are generally lower as charge recombination at perovskite/ carbon interface is higher as well as hole extraction is slower using carbon electrodes compared to metal contacts.  [30]  Recombination in HTL-free, C-PSCs was studied by Li et. al. and they could reduce recombination by introducing FAX (X = I, Br) in perovskite.  [18]  Similarly, Huo et. al. used propylamine hydrobromide and its derivative 3bromopropylamine hydrobromide to passivate perovskite layer (CsPbI 2 Br) leading to lower recombination.  [31]  In another study, Elakshar and co-workers fabricated bi-facial perovskite solar cells without HTL using single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films achieving an efficiency of 16.7 % under full sun irradiation. Since the recombination was higher at perovskite/SWCNT interface, they adopted passivation using methylammonium iodide reducing the recombination at the interfaces leading to improved photovoltaic performance.  [32] . PSCs exhibit comparatively higher efficiencies in low/diffuse light conditions, making them ideal for both outdoor and indoor photovoltaics.  [33, 34]  Unlike conventional silicon technology, which experiences reduced efficiency indoors, PSCs offer a significant advantage.  [35]  While dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC) and organic solar cells (OSC) have achieved efficiencies above 35 % under standard indoor illuminations, PSCs stand out for their ease of manufacturing at scale and unlike DSC and OSC, they do not heavily rely on complex molecular synthesis making it cost-competitive.  [36, 37]  Using perovskites with custom modified bandgaps and interlayers PSCs have already achieved efficiencies exceeding 40 % under indoor light illuminations using complicated device architectures and evaporated metal electrodes.  [38, 39]  Recently Makming et. al. obtained a PCE of 32 % in 1000 lx LED lighting with C-PSC using Cs 0.17 FA 0.83 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 and CuSCN doped with CuPc as HTL.  [40]  Tsoi et. al. reported HTL-free, C-PSCs producing a maximum power of 89.4 µW/cm 2 at 1000 lx and 16.3 µW/cm 2 at 200 lx.  [41]  In another study, Kim et. al. reported an efficiency of 20.9 % under LED illumination and 18.2 % under fluorescent light (CFL) using fully printed HTL-free mesoporous carbon based PSC.  [42]  Rossi et. al. reported an efficiency of 18 % for 196 cm 2 HTL-free carbon based printable mesoporous modules under indoor conditions.  [43]  Despite the substantial potential of HTL-free, C-PSCs for indoor photovoltaics applications, exploration in the context of indoor photovoltaics (IPV) has been limited thus far. In the present study, as an initial step towards developing efficient and stable printable C-PSCs, we optimized the concentration of the SnO 2 precursor solution (0.03, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.1 (in molar)) employed as the ETL. Perovskite layer formed over the SnO 2 film deposited using these different precursor concentrations showed varied structural and morphological properties. Further un-encapsulated, HTL-free, C-PSCs were fabricated using standard MAPbI 3 as perovskite layer and the photovoltaic performance was investigated in detail under standard outdoor and indoor illuminations. With one sun illumination (100 mW/ cm 2 ), we were able to attain a PCE of 9.79 % using an optimized SnO 2 precursor concentration of 0.07 M. The same devices delivered a PCE of 22.37 % and 22.21 % under 1000 lx CFL and LED illuminations. The PSCs fabricated using 0.07 M SnO 2 concentration was found to be comparatively more stable and reproducible in terms of photovoltaic performance. Optical and electrical characterizations were carried out in detail to obtain a better fundamental understanding of electron transfer process and charge separation mechanism taking place in these devices. We examined non-radiative bulk recombination in the perovskite layer, analysing intensity dependent current-voltage (J-V) measurements, while interfacial recombination was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and transient photovoltage decay. Further, optical, and electrical stimulation of C-PSCs were carried out to further extend the fundamental understanding related to photon distribution, light absorption and recombination in these devices. Moreover, the present study also explores the potential of using MAPbI 3 based un-encapsulated, HTL-free, C-PSCs for real world self-powered applications, demonstrating the possibility by showcasing a self-powered temperature sensor powered under standard 1000 lx indoor illumination using two serially interconnected C-PSCs. 
 Results and discussion 
 Thin film studies In this study, we used MAPbI 3 to examine the potential of HTL-free, carbon-based perovskite solar cells. The device architecture (FTO/ SnO 2 /MAPbI 3 /Carbon) and fabricated devices are illustrated in Fig.  1(a)  and (b). SnO 2 thin films, formed with different molar concentrations of precursor (0.03, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.1, Figure  S1 , SI), were examined alongside the perovskite layer deposited over the SnO 2 layer using XRD (Fig.  1c ). All films exhibited (1 1 0), (1 1 2), (2 1 1), (2 0 2), (2 2 0), (3 1 0), (3 1 2), (2 2 4) and (3 1 4) peaks similar to the standard sample. Peak left to the (1 1 0) corresponds to the lead iodide (PbI 2 ). The peak intensity reflects the crystallinity of the films, with superior crystallinity observed for perovskite coated on SnO 2 layers with molar concentrations of 0.07 and 0.1. The crystallite size, determined from XRD using Debye-Scherrer formula, was found to have an average grain size of 79.27 nm, 76.24 nm, 83.96 nm and 93.43 nm for the films on top of 0.03, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.1 M concentration of SnO 2 respectively. Lattice strain, calculated from the Williamson-Hall (W-H) plot (Figure  S2 , SI) for perovskite films on 0.03, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.1 M concentration of SnO 2 , demonstrated values of 4.42 × 10 -4 , 4.45 × 10 -4 , 3.35 × 10 -4 and 3.89 × 10 -4 , respectively. Lattice compression was observed in 0.03 M sample, while other samples exhibited lattice expansion, with 0.07 M showing less strain in the W-H plot. Recent reports indicate that the formation energy of halide vacancies increases with increase in perovskite compressive strain.  [44]  Similarly, Jones et al. also reported that the strain induced structural defects can influence the non-radiative recombination in perovskite films. They showed a direct relation between lattice strain with defect states and non-radiative recombination in perovskites by combining confocal transient PL (TRPL) with synchrotron scanning micro XRD.  [45]  In our study lattice strain is less for the film formed on top of 0.07 M SnO 2 , which suggests that the defect density and non-radiative recombination in the perovskite films formed on top of 0.07 M SnO 2 is less. To examine the morphology of the perovskite layers, SEM images were captured at different SnO 2 concentrations. Fig.  2  represents the SEM images of perovskite layer over SnO 2 with different precursor concentrations. Concentration of 0.07 M for SnO 2 resulted in a densely packed film, promoting the growth of uniform and closely packed perovskite grains. The average grain size of perovskite was calculated to be 156.25 nm, 164.17 nm, 208.27 nm and 244.53 nm for layers formed on top of 0.03, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.1 M concentration of SnO 2 , respectively. The histogram of grains for different SnO 2 precursor concentrations is provided in Figure  S3 , SI, while Figure  S4 , SI showcases SEM images of the SnO 2 layers formed with different precursor concentrations. Further, we carried out optical measurements on the thin films to understand absorption and emission properties of perovskite films deposited over various SnO 2 precursor concentrations. Fig.  3  shows the absorption and emission spectra of these films. The Tauc's plot derived from the absorption spectrum indicates a consistent band gap of 1.61 eV for all four films. Since band gap was 1.61 eV, each perovskite films exhibited similar absorption with an onset extended to NIR region. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the sample were studied with an excitation wavelength of 460 nm, we observed that the PL intensity of the perovskite film on top of 0.03 M SnO 2 layer was minimal, and it gradually increased with higher SnO 2 concentrations and reached to its maximum in the perovskite film made above 0.07 M SnO 2 concentration. However, with further increase in SnO 2 concentration, PL intensity drastically dropped. This trend in PL shows that the nonradiative recombination was highest in perovskite film formed on top of 0.03 M SnO 2 layer, further it decreases with increase in SnO 2 concentration and reaches to an optimum level at 0.07 M SnO 2 concentration. PL intensity of the perovskite film varies due to the defect states in the perovskite.  [46, 47]  Since perovskite layer is deposited over SnO layer, the film quality of perovskite layer relies on the quality of SnO  layer. In the present study, we changed SnO 2 precursor concentration from 0.03 M to 0.1 M. It is observed that an optimum densely packed SnO 2 film formed with 0.07 M SnO 2 precursor which resulted in perovskite layer with minimal defects and hence highest PL intensity. Notably, defect states or trap states in perovskite film contribute to nonradiative recombination, highlighting the role of SnO 2 layer in directly modifying the trap distribution. Thus, achieving high-quality perovskite films with enhanced electrical properties rely on precise control and improvement of SnO 2 film quality. 
 Photovoltaic studies HTL-free, C-PSCs were fabricated with different concentrations of SnO 2 precursor as ETL, and their photovoltaic performance was studied under 1 sun illumination (100 mW/cm 2 ) without encapsulation, at a relative humidity (RH) of 80 % present in the laboratory and at room temperature (24 • C). The current density (J) vs voltage (V), as well as the Incident Photon to Current Conversion Efficiency (IPCE) spectra of C-PSCs made with 0.03, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.1 M concentrations of SnO 2 are presented in Fig.  4 (b) and (c). We observed an increase in PCE with concentration and a maximum PCE of 9.79 % at 0.07 M concentration was obtained and the PCE further decreased with increase in SnO concentration. Fabrication and characterization details of C-PSCs were provided in the experimental section, SI with a summary of obtained photovoltaic parameters provided in Table  1 . Notably, the short-circuit current density (J sc ) followed the same trend as that of PCE. Furthermore, the open-circuit voltage (V oc ) improved with increase in SnO concentration reaching 1 V at both 0.05 and 0.07 M SnO 2 concentrations, while it significantly dropped at a higher concentration of 0.1 M. A similar trend was also observed for the fill factor (FF). Poor fill factor of   HTL-free carbon-based solar cell is due to the higher sheet resistance of the carbon layers. We measured the sheet resistance of the carbon layers using four-probe and it was found to be 15 Ω/□, which is two orders higher than the sheet resistance of metal contacts. This suggests that the increased sheet resistance increases the series resistance of the device. It is one of the possible reasons for the poor fill factor of the devices. Another important point to be noted is that, in the present device architecture to improve the device stability and to lower the complexity, HTL was not used which also resulted in poor contact bewteen perovskite and carbon layers. From literature we can see that introducing HTL will provide better ohmic contact  [40]  and hence the fill factor can be improved, but the stability will be compromised. Given that stability is a critical factor influencing the commercialization of PSCs, we sought to comprehensively assess the photovoltaic performance of six devices for each SnO 2 concentration over one-week period. Fig.  5  represents the statistical distribution of PCE for unencapsulated HTL-free, C-PSCs measured under 80 % relative humidity for different molar concentrations of SnO 2 throughout the week. The PCE of C-PSCs with 0.07 M SnO 2 remained consistent during the monitoring period, showcasing stable performance, charge collection efficiency and better transport. However, the PCE of C-PSCs with 0.03 M and 0.1 M SnO 2 dropped drastically, rendering the devices nonfunctional after 4 days (for 0.03 M SnO 2 ) and 5 days (for 0.1 M SnO 2 ), respectively. The average efficiency of the cells with a concentration of 0.07 M SnO 2 exceeded 7 %, representing the highest average value compared to other SnO 2 concentrations. Normalized PCE of the best cells for each concentration is also provided in Figure  S5 , SI. All devices were un-encapsulated, and the measurements were carried out in a room with 80 % relative humidity (RH) under room temperature. Carbon layers are hydrophobic in nature, which reduces the effect of moisture in the perovskite layer. Since the architecture was HTL-free and carbon can extract holes without any hole transport layer, moisture instability of the organic hole transport layers also can be surpassed. Evaporation of metal electrodes many a times leads to its penetration to HTL and perovskite layers reducing the performance and stability. Carbon electrodes are free of these issues, and hence the solar cells will have better stability even without encapsulation.  [48] . In perovskite solar cells, bulk recombination significantly influences J sc , whereas interfacial recombination impacts V oc and FF. To investigate these recombinations we analysed light intensity-dependent J sc and V oc . Fig.  6 (a, b ) shows J sc and V oc vs light intensities (0.1 sun to 1 sun) for PSCs with varying SnO 2 concentrations. The photovoltaic performance at different intensities are tabulated in Tables S1-S4, SI. J sc depends on the light intensity as J sc ∝ I α , here α is power-law exponent. The determined α values were 1.39, 1.07, 1.08 and 1.21 for SnO 2 concentrations of 0.03, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.10 M, respectively. An α value closer to 1.0 indicates less charge recombination, and in the present study, 0.05 M and 0.07 M SnO 2 concentrations indicate lower recombination. Similarly, from intensity-dependent V oc , the ideality factor (n) of the devices was calculated from V oc proportional to (nk B T/q) ln(I) relation, where T is temperature, k B is Boltzmann's constant, q is elementary charge, and I is incident light intensity. Ideally n should be 1 when recombination is radiative while with non-radiative, trap-assisted recombination results in n reaching to 2. In perovskite solar cell, n is often greater than 2 due to complex interfacial charge recombination and ion migration. The determined n values were found to be 6.10, 1.38, 1.46, and 2.09 for 0.03, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.1 M concentrations of SnO 2 , respectively. The lower n values at 0.05 and 0.07 M concentrations indicate lower bulk recombination, aligning well with the J sc values of these devices.  
 Table 2 Power-law exponent (α), ideality factor (n), recombination current density (J 0 ) calculated from J-V measurements and recombination resistance (R rec ) obtained from EIS for different SnO 2 concentrations. Conversely, the higher n values at 0.03 and 0.1 M concentrations resulted in comparatively lower J sc as a result of higher bulk recombination. Then we investigated the recombination properties of the devices through saturated recombination current density (J 0 ) calculated from the J-V curves; which also followed a similar trend with the ideality factor further supporting bulk recombination in perovskite layer. Table  2  provides power-law exponent (α), ideality factor (n), recombination current density (J 0 ) calculated from J-V measurements and recombination resistance (R rec ) obtained by fitting Nyquist plot for different SnO 2 precursor concentrations. To further investigate the interfacial charge recombination, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was used, and the obtained Nyquist plot is provided in Fig.  6(d ). The plot comprises of a lower frequency parallel R-C component corresponding to charge recombination at SnO 2 /perovskite interface and another parallel R-C component at higher frequency representing recombination at perovskite/carbon interface. Given the absence of a HTL in the current device architecture, charge recombination at the perovskite/carbon interface is likely to dominate, which explains why two distinguished semicircles are hardly visible. To obtain the electrical parameters, the Nyquist plot was fitted with the equivalent circuit as given in the inset of Fig.  6(d) , and the fitted parameters for different concentrations are provided in Table  S5 , SI. The charge transfer resistance at the perovskite/carbon interface was found to be highest for 0.07 M SnO 2 concentration (3419 Ω), while for other molar concentrations (0.03, 0.05 and 0.1), values of 1072 Ω, 2424 Ω and 2820 Ω were obtained, respectively. Additionally, we further carried out transient photovoltage decay and the decay was fitted using first order exponential decay equation (Figure  S6 , SI). The observed lifetime is anticipated to be primarily influenced by charge recombination at the perovskite/carbon interface, and the trend in lifetime aligns with the variations observed in V oc and FF. To gain insights into charge generation and recombination within the perovskite layer, optical and electrical simulations were conducted using OghmaNano simulation software. The J-V characteristics were fitted using a 1D drift-diffusion model, and the experimental and simulated J-V plots are presented in Figure  S7 , SI, with the corresponding fitted parameters summarized in Table  S6 , SI. Fig.  7  shows the photon absorption and recombination in perovskite layer as a function of thickness. Photon absorption, obtained from optical simulation, exhibited similarity across various SnO 2 concentrations, consistent with the absorption characteristics of the perovskite layer above SnO 2 . The contour plot of photon distribution and absorption revealed a significant    S9 , SI). However, the non-radiative trap assisted recombination in perovskite layer was highest for 0.03 M, followed by 0.05 M and 0.1 M SnO 2 concentrations, while the minimum recombination was observed for 0.07 M SnO 2 concentration (Fig.  7(b) ). This trend in non-radiative recombination also holds for the simulation done at different voltages (Fig.  7(c )), aligning well with the experimental photoluminescence (PL) results. Notably, bulk recombination serves as the origin of J sc across various SnO 2 concentrations. Therefore, the trend in bulk recombination precisely mirrors the J sc trend across different SnO 2 concentrations. With superior visible light harvesting capabilities and the flexibility to fine-tune the band gap, PSCs stand out as an optimal choice for indoor photovoltaics (IPV). PSCs used for IPV applications often rely on complex device architectures with multiple interfaces and expensive metal evaporations for contacts. In contrast, our approach focuses on employing scalable and simple HTL-free, carbon-based PSCs for IPV, positioning them as a promising solution for self-powered IoT electronics. We assessed the photovoltaic performance of C-PSCs with our HTL-free architecture under 1000 lx indoor warm white CFL and LED illuminations, achieving efficiencies of 22.37 % and 22.21 %, respectively, for 0.07 M SnO 2 concentration. Under 1000 lx cool white LED, the devices delivered an efficiency of 17.57 %. Under 1000 lx illumination, 0.03 M devices showed efficiencies of 11.69 % under warm white CFL, 11.07 % under warm white LED and 4.75 % under cool white LED. For 0.05 M concentration, efficiencies of 20.59 % under warm white CFL, 20.11 % in warm white LED, and 13.82 % under cool white LED illumination were obtained. For devices with 0.1 M SnO 2 concentration, we achieved efficiencies of 16.97 %, 14.23 % and 13.41 % under 1000 lx warm white CFL, warm white LED and cool white LED illuminations, respectively. Fig.  8  (a), (b) and (c) display the J-V plots of PSCs under indoor light conditions, with 0.07 M SnO 2 demonstrating better performance across all three indoor lighting conditions, similar to 1 sun illumination. Table  3  summarizes the efficiency of best devices under various indoor light illuminations and Figure  S10 , SI shows the spectrum of 1000 lx warm white CFL, warm white LED and cool white LED lights used in the present study along with integrated power. Table  S7 , SI shows the performance of HTL-free C-PSC from literature under indoor conditions. For a comprehensive understanding of the enhanced photovoltaic performance under indoor/artificial lights compared to one sun illumination, we conducted a comparative optical simulation using Oghma-Nano software under both the intensities. The analysis focused on the best-performing HTL-free, C-PSC with 0.07 M SnO 2 concentration under 1 sun and LED illumination of 1000 lx (Fig.  9 ). Photon distribution and absorption patterns in these devices were found to closely match (Fig.  9 (a) and (b)), in contrast to one sun illumination, where photon absorption is narrower compared to the distribution (Fig.  9 (c) and (d)). The observed broader absorption under indoor illumination indicates improved spectral matching, contributing to higher efficiencies. To demonstrate the practical application of these HTL-free, C-PSCs, we constructed a mini-module by serially connecting two devices with an active area of 0.25 cm 2 , successfully powering a temperature sensor in a  room illuminated under 1000 lx (Fig.  8 (d), supplementary video S1). To further improve efficiency under indoor/artificial illumination, optimisations involving experimenting with various perovskite materials and fine-tuning the interface of perovskite and carbon layer is further required. 
 Conclusions In the present study, we investigated the influence of the electron transport layer (SnO 2 ) on the photovoltaic performance of MAPbI 3based, HTL-free C-PSCs under full sun and indoor/artificial illuminations. By varying molar concentrations of SnO 2 precursor (0.03, 0.05, 0.07, and 0.10), we optimized the ETL for HTL-free, C-PSCs. Our analysis included XRD, SEM, absorption, and steady-state photoluminescence studies on SnO 2 and perovskite films. XRD confirmed the formation of crystalline perovskite films on SnO 2 layers, with superior crystallinity observed for 0.07 M SnO 2 concentration. SEM images revealed densely packed perovskite grains for 0.07 M SnO 2 . The W-H plot indicated lower strain in the perovskite layer on 0.07 M SnO 2 . Interestingly, while absorption similarities were evident, the emission differences suggested dissimilar trap distribution in perovskite layers. Furthermore, a reduced non-radiative recombination was observed at a higher SnO 2 concentration of 0.07 M, as indicated by the enhanced photoluminescence intensity. HTL-free, C-PSCs fabricated using 0.07 M SnO 2 demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 9.79 % PCE under 1 sun (100 mW/ cm 2 ) and 22.37 % under 1000 lx warm white CFL, along with 22.21 % under LED illumination which are among the highest reported indoor performance using HTL-free, C-PSC under indoor/artificial light. The stability of 0.07 M SnO 2 C-PSCs was evident during a week-long monitoring period, compared to significant drops experienced in 0.03 M and 0.1 M SnO 2 counterparts. Exploration of interfacial device dynamics highlighted lower non-radiative bulk recombination in 0.07 M SnO 2 C-PSCs. Optical and electrical simulations supported experimental findings, and indoor performance improvement was substantiated through simulations. A practical demonstration connecting two C-PSCs, powering a temperature sensor under standard 1000 lx LED illumination, showcase the real-world potential of these indoor light harvesting perovskite solar cells.
