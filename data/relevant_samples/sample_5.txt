Title: Solvation-Driven Grain Boundary Passivation Improving the Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells
The efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is hindered by substantial defects within the grain boundaries (GBs) of polycrystalline perovskite films. Conventional post-treatment strategies struggle to precisely repair these defects at GBs. Here, a targeted grain boundary passivation strategy through solvent effects by incorporating symmetrical biphenyl molecules is proposed, 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS) and 4,4′-sulfodiphenol (SDP), aiming to mitigate defects at GBs and optimize energy level arrangements through their electric dipole effects. Compared to the pristine device, the SDP-modified device exhibits significant improvements, including a champion efficiency of 24.39% and an impressive fill factor, along with excellent operation stability. This work provides an effective and straightforward solution for improving the performance of PSCs.
Introduction Organic-inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite materials offer outstanding photovoltaic properties and scalable fabrication through solution processes.  [1, 2]  Presently, the single-junction perovskite solar cells have achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.1%, rivaling commercial monocrystalline silicon solar cells.  [3, 4]  However, the polycrystalline perovskite films prepared by the low-temperature solution process are yet to attain thermodynamic equilibrium.  [5]  The major concern lies in the numerous electronic defects, such as uncoordinated Pb 2+ ions and dangling bonds,  [6, 7]  concentrated at inter-aggregate grain boundaries (GBs) and intra-aggregate GBs.  [8] [9] [10]  These defects are the root cause of nonradiative recombination loss, negatively impacting charge carrier behavior, and device performance.  [8, 11]  In DOI: 10.1002/aenm.202303387 addition, GBs serve as the initiation points for perovskite film degradation, given their susceptibility to trapping environmental factors like heat, water, gas, or solvents.  [12, 13]  Therefore, addressing these nonradiative recombination pathways at the GBs is imperative to approach the Shockley-Queisser (S-Q) limit of 31% in PCE and improve the device stability.  [14, 15]  To resolve these issues, various surface passivation agents, such as functional organic molecules,  [16, 17]  polymers,  [18, 19]  and organic halide salts,  [20, 21]  have been attempted to passivate the defect in the GBs of perovskite film. Some efforts including Lewis bases containing nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and electron rich aromatic structure, which can provide lone pair electrons to passive cation defects and undercoordination sites.  [1, 22]  Additionally, Lewis acid molecules like diphenyl-C61-methyl butyrate (PCBM) can mitigate certain electron trap states, which accept electrons from Lewis base defects of perovskite films.  [23, 24]  Molecular passivation has emerged as a reliable and effective strategy for the passivation of perovskite defects. However, most posttreatment processes involve the dissolution of solid passivators in solvents.  [25] [26] [27]  During the spin coating, the rapid evaporation of the solvent causes the solution to solidify quickly. Consequently, due to the inherent nature of solid passivating agents, achieving selective surface passivation, specifically targeting certain locations on the surface of perovskite films, has proven to be a challenging endeavor.  [28]  Herein, 4,4′-diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS) and 4,4′sulfonyldiphenol (SDP) were used as passivators to selectively passivate defects at GBs. The interaction between DDS or SDP and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) solvent facilitates their migration to the inter-aggregate during annealing, leading to the reduction of defect density by selectively passivating uncoordinated Pb 2+ ions at GBs. Furthermore, the permanent dipole effects induced by DDS and SDP improve energy alignment, promoting charge transfer and reducing carrier recombination. Consequently, SDP-treated devices achieved a remarkable fill factor (FF) of 86.0% and a leading power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.39%, surpassing both DDS-treated (23.41%) and pristine devices (22.18%). Furthermore, SDP treatment significantly enhanced humidity stability, with devices retaining 95.9% of their initial efficiency after 1400 h of ambient air storage. Unencapsulated PSCs maintain 96% of their original efficiency after  
 Results and Discussion Solvation pertains to the electrostatic interaction between solvent molecules and solute molecules or ions. In our study, this solvation process acts as a driving force for achieving selective passivation. During the annealing, solvent evaporation facilitates modifier transfer, which can achieve selective passivation. 4,4′-diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS) and 4,4′-sulfonyldiphenol (SDP) with N and O polar groups, solvate readily with isopropanol (IPA) and effectively passivate electron deficient defects such as Pb 2+ in perovskite films. Thus, we introduce DDS and SDP to selectively passivate the defects at grain boundaries (GBs) in perovskite films. To study the interaction of DDS and SDP with perovskite films, theoretical calculations are carried out based on density functional theory (DFT). As illustrated in Figure  1a , these calculations revealed strong interactions between DDS/SDP and lead/iodine due to electron-rich and electron-deficient groups.  [29] [30] [31]  Figure  1b  depicts the schematic diagram of perovskite film post-treated by DDS and SDP. DDS and SDP were dissolved in IPA, spin coated on perovskite film, and annealed for 10 min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the surface morphology of the films. In Figure  1c -e, the pristine perovskite film exhibits a typical polycrystalline structure with numerous GBs. Notably, the DDS-treated perovskite film displayed a distinctive layer with deep contrast covering inter-aggregate GBs, indicating DDS coverage at inter-aggregate GBs. Additionally, increasing the concentration resulted in more complete GB coverage, as evidenced by deeper contrast (Figure  S1 , Supporting Information). A similar phenomenon was observed in the SDP-treated perovskite film, where SDP filled inter-aggregate GBs and covered surface intra-aggregate GBs (Figure  S2 , Supporting Information). Different from most existing methods that uniformly treat the entire surface of perovskite films due to immobility,  [32] [33] [34]  our approach using DDS and SDP post-treatment selectively covers GBs. The time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) depth profile images of the perovskite films are presented in Figure  S3  (Supporting Information). Notably, there is a discernible intensity of the SO 2 -component emanating from the DDS-and SDP-treated perovskite films within the top surface ≈50 nm, in contrast to the negligible signal observed in the pristine film. This observation suggests that DDS and SDP are distributed along the grain boundaries on the surface. To investigate the mechanism underlying the selective grain boundary modification of DDS and SDP, we monitored the morphological evolution of the perovskite film at various annealing times using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure  2a ). In the case of the DDS-treated sample, a discernible passivator layer fully envelops the surface of the perovskite film in the initial stages of annealing. Subsequently, DDS gradually migrates toward inter-aggregate grain boundaries. Conversely, for the SDP-treated sample, SDP is randomly distributed on the perovskite surface, resembling "patches" before annealing. However, after 10 s of annealing, a portion of the SDP migrates toward both inter-aggregate grain boundaries and surface intraaggregate grain boundaries, while another portion remains unchanged. As the annealing progresses, SDP fully migrates to the grain boundaries. We further investigate the driving force behind passivator migration during the annealing process. Specifically, pure DDS or SDP (without IPA) directly was spread onto perovskite film surfaces and annealed them at 100°C for 10 min. SEM observations (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information) reveal that DDS and SDP aggregate on the film surface in "patches," a pattern differing from their uniform distribution at perovskite grain boundaries in Figure  2a . This indicates that the thermal diffusion of DDS and SDP, as well as their interactions with the perovskite, are not the primary factors causing passivator migration, underscoring the importance of IPA in this process. Subsequently, a separate experiment using only IPA for post-treatment of the perovskite film was conducted (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information). The surface morphology of the sample treated only with IPA remained unchanged, resembling that of the pristine perovskite film, suggesting that IPA alone does not induce significant changes in the perovskite surface morphology during annealing. Therefore, we speculate that the solvent interaction between the passivator and IPA primarily drives passivator migration during annealing, ultimately resulting in selective grain boundary modification. Furthermore, the DFT simulations provides additional evidence for the formation mechanism of selective grain boundary modification of DDS and SDP (Note S1, Supporting Information). DFT results reveal strong intermolecular interactions between DDS, SDP, and IPA,  [35, 36]  with interaction energies of -6.96 and -5.42 kcal mol -1 , respectively (Figure  S6  and Table  S1 , Supporting Information). These interactions likely play a pivotal role in driving the selective grain boundary passivation by DDS and SDP. Due to the robust electrostatic interaction between IPA and DDS and SDP, IPA did not completely volatilize during the spin coating; instead, IPA gradually escapes and drives the passivator towards the grain boundaries during annealing. Importantly, the morphological consistency between the perovskite at 30 s of annealing and the 10 min of annealing (Figure  2a ) suggests that the passivating only occurs during the initial annealing when IPA has not completely evaporated. Subsequently, DDS and SDP anchor at perovskite grain boundaries. Therefore, combining experimental and theoretical results, the observed selective grain boundary modification in the DDS-and SDP-treated samples is indeed attributed to the interaction between IPA and DDS or SDP. We evaluated the surface composition and chemical interactions of perovskite films via. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure  S7 , Supporting Information). Compared to the pristine perovskite film, the DDS-and SDP-treated samples showed S 2p signals at 162.6 and 163.8 eV, indicating successful surface modification (Figure  S8 , Supporting Information).  [37]  In Figure  2b , the pristine perovskite film exhibits two main peaks at 138.43 and 143.31 eV, corresponding to Pb 4f 7/2 and Pb 4f 5/2 . Posttreatment with DDS and SDP cause a shift in the Pb peak to lower binding energy, indicating an interaction between uncoordinated Pb  2+  and Lewis base group (-S═O, -NH 2 , and -OH) from the passivators, resulting in increased the electron density on Pb.  [38]  This shift is more pronoumced in SDP-treated sample suggesting an stronger interaction between SDP and Pb 2+ . The peak at 400.52 eV is attributed to the N 1s of FA + (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information). After the introduction of DDS, a new peak emerge at 399.37 eV, corresponding to the N of DDS. Notebly, the the N peak of FA + shift to lower binding energy, likely due to the increased electron density resulting from interactions between passivators and FA + .  [39]  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to investigate the interactions between passivators and perovskite films (Figure  2c, d ). For DDS only sample, stretching vibrations of the S═O were observed at 1273.8 and 1139.8 cm -1 .  [40]  After DDS post-treatment, these vibrations shifted to 1278.1 and 1142.6 cm -1 , while the bending vibration of N-H shifts from 1624.4 to 1630.8 cm -1 . These alterationsare attributed to the robust interaction between DDS and perovskite films.  [19, 41]  A similar trend was observed on the SDP-treated perovskite films, with the stretching vibration peak of S═O moved from 1279.7 and 1134.2 cm -1 to 1291.7 and 1138.7 cm -1 . Additionally, the stretching vibration of C-O shifts from 1219.8 to 1222.7 cm -1 (Figure  2d ).  [42]  Notably, the shift of S═O peak of SDP-treated perovskite films is larger than that of DDS, consistent with the XPS results. To analyze the passivation role of DDS and SDP, we carried out density functional theory (DFT) simulations of a FAPbI 3 perovskite (Note S2, Supporting Information). A PbI 2 -rich perovskite surface was set as a control and added the DDS or SDP.  [43]  The chemical bonding state between the perovskite layer and DDS or SDP is evaluated by calculating the charge difference.  [44]  The differential charge density distribution of the optimized surface structure of the perovskite is shown in Figure  S10  (Supporting Information), where the yellow and blue colors indicate the electron accumulation and depletion, respectively. The charge transfer can be distinguished from Lewis acid-base interaction between S═O or -NH 2 of DDS and S═O or -OH of SDP and undercoordinated Pb 2+ . The adsorption energies of DDS and SDP on PbI 2 -terminated slabs are calculated to be -0.614, -0.963, -0.840, and -0.747 eV, respectively (Figure  2e, f ). These chemical interactions of DDS and SDP with undercoordinated Pb 2+ could either passivate defects and reduce I vacancy migration channels and defect generation, which prevents the electrons from being captured by the defects and reduces recombination. These findings indicate the strong interactions between that DDS and SDP perovskite, effectively passivating surface defects of perovskite films. Furthermore, Xray diffraction (XRD) and Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were conducted. There are no obvious differences in the diffraction peak intensity (Figures  S11  and S12 , Supporting Information). Surface morphology and potential of perovskite films were examined before and after DDS and SDP posttreatment using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Post-treatment with DDS and SDP led to a re-duction in the root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness from 41.82 nm in the pristine perovskite film to 34.25 and 32.45 nm, respectively (Figure  3a -c and Table  S2 , Supporting Information). The reduction of surface roughness indicates that the modifier effectively covers the concave position at the grain boundary.  [45]  In Figure  3d -f and Table  S2  (Supporting Information), the contact potential difference (CPD) value of the pristine, DDS-and SDP-treated sample are shown at is -105 ± 7.00, 76 ± 4.07, and -361 ± 15.77 mV, respectively. These differences of CPD align with work function (W F ) trend measured by UPS. Moreover, the results of AFM and KPFM were drawn and shown in Figure  3g-i . The pristine perovskite film exhibits uniform CPD, with a CDP difference (ΔV CPD ) of 47 mV between GBs and adjacent grain interior, consistent with the prior research.  [46]  GBs have lower CPD than the grain interior, aiding the extraction of holes at the GBs.  [47]  After posttreatment with DDS and SDP, the ΔV CPD values decrease to 18 and 76 mV, respectively. Given the smoother surface and altered ΔV CPD , it suggests that DDS and SDP posttreatment selectively covers the GBs in the perovskite film, aligning with SEM observations.  [15, 17]  The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was measured to assess the effect of DDS and SDP posttreatment on the energy level arrangement at the perovskite-hole transport layer (HTL) interface. The energy level structure results, determined according to UPS spectrum (Figure  S13 , Supporting Information) and Tauc plots (Figure  S14 , Supporting Information) are summarized in Table  S3  (Supporting Information). The surface W F of the pristine perovskite film was 4.62 eV. After posttreatment by DDS and SDP, the surface W F was adjusted to 4.60 and 4.68 eV, respectively. Figure  3j  illustrates the influence of these post treatments on level alignment. Compared to the pristine perovskite film, both DDS-and SDP-treated samples exhibit an upward shift in the energy band structure facilitating charge extraction and transfer.  [48]  These changes of surface W F and energy band structure can be attributed to the alteration of interface terminals and the dipole effect of polar molecules after posttreatment.  [49, 50]  The dipole moments of DDS and SDP, calculated by DFT, are 5.62 and 5.84 Debye, respectively. Notably, the SDP-treated perovskite films demonstrate more pronounced ptype behavior and energy band upshift, enhanced the extraction of photogenerated hole from perovskite to spiro-OMeTAD. This results in improved in higher short circuit current (J SC ) and fill factor (FF) of photovoltaic devices. The impact of selective grain boundary passivation on trap density (N t ) and carrier dynamics was investigated, quantified by space charge limited current (SCLC). The trap-filling limit voltage (V TFL ) for the pristine device, DDS and SDP device are 0.31, 0.20, and 0.17 V, respectively. According to the relationship between V TFL and N t , the N t decreasing from 2.74 × 10 -15 cm -3 of the pristine device to 1.77 × 10 -15 cm -3 of DDS device and 1.51 × 10 -15 cm -3 of SDP device (Figure  4a  and Note S3, Supporting Information). As expected, both DDS-and SDP-treated devices showed lower defect density than the pristine counterpart. Notably, SDP-treated devices exhibit the lowest defect density, attributed to the selective passivation and the stronger interaction between SDP and perovskite. Further investigations of the passivation effect were conducted by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra. Compared with the pristine perovskite film, both DDS-and   and d-f ) 2D surface potential images measured using KPFM of the pristine perovskite film and DDS-and SDPtreated perovskite films. g-i) The relative V CPD line-scan spectra extracted from the corresponding maps (the blue line of Figure  3a-f ). j) Energy-level alignments at the perovskite/HTL interfaces determined by the UPS spectra. SDP-treated perovskite films exhibited enhanced PL intensity (Figure  4b ), indicating reduced nonradiative recombination.  [51]  Figure  4c  shows the TRPL measurements of the pristine, DDStreated and SDP-treated perovskite films on glass substrates. The corresponding carrier lifetimes were determined using biexponential fitting methods (Note S4, Supporting Information), and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table  S4  (Supporting Information). The DDS-treated and SDP-treated perovskite films show longer average carrier lifetimes (146.43 and 223.84 ns, re-spectively) compared to the pristine film (107.51 ns). The prolonged lifetimes observed in DDS-treated and SDP-treated perovskite film manifest reduced surface nonradiative recombination at the interface.  [27, 32]  Additionally, time-resolved confocal fluorescence microscopy (TCFM) measurements (Figure  4d-f ) were performed to confirmed the PL intensity and carrier lifetime distribution DDS-and SDP-treated perovskite films displayed brighter coloration and extended carrier lifetime compared to the dark pristine film. The PL count in DDS-and SDP-treated films was also higher (Figure  S15 , Supporting Information). These observations highlight the advantages of selective grain boundary passivation, which including inhibiting nonradiative recombination and likely obtaining high photovoltaic performance.  [52, 53]  Light dependent open-circuit voltage (V OC ) was performed to investigate the carrier behavior (Figure  4g ). The ideality factor (N id ) values of the DDS and SDP devices decreased from 1.55 to 1.46 and 1.31, respectively (Note S5, Supporting Information). This reduction in N id supports the effectiveness of selective grain boundary passivation in inhibiting trap-assisted recombination and the increasing the FF of PSCs. Mott-Schottky measurements show that the SDP device exhibits the largest builtin potential (V bi ) at 0.97 V, surpassing the DDS device (0.93 V), and the pristine device (0.91 V) (Figure  4h ). The higher builtin potential enhances the driving force for carrier separation, resulting in higher V OC for the device. Transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were performed under open circuit conditions (Figure  4i ). The charge recombination lifetime of the DDS and SDP devices is increased to 119.5 and 95.8 μs, respectively, compared to 53.7 μs for the pristine device. This indicates that the non-radiative recombination is effectively reduced.  [54]  Last, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis is used to study the charge recombination behavior of PSCs (Figure  S16 , Supporting Information). The DDS (25.4 kΩ) and SDP (32.9 kΩ) devices exhibit greater recombination resistance compared to the pristine device (13.6 kΩ), demonstrating effective suppression of charge recombination.  [55]  To evaluate the impact of selective grain boundary passivation with DDS and SDP on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, the PSCs with a conventional n-i-p structure FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite/DDS or SDP/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag were prepared. The SEM cross section of the complete device and passivation mechanism diagram are shown in Figures  5a  and S17  (Supporting Information). The current density-voltage (J-V) curves recorded by the forward and reverse scanning of the optimal device (Figure  5b ), and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Tables S5 (Supporting Information). The FF of SDP device is significantly improved to 84.86%, accompanied by a J SC value is 25.53 mA cm -2 , and a V OC value is 1.126 V. Consequently, the champion PCE of SDP device reaches 24.39%, surpassing that of the DDS device (23.41%) and pristine device (22.18%). The hysteresis index (HI) of devices after selective grain boundary passivation is also reduced (Note S6, Supporting Information). The integrated J SC from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectral integral of the pristine, the DDS and SDP devices are 24.19, 24.44, and 24.73 mA cm -2 , respectively (Figure  5c ), matched well with the corresponding J-V results. Photovoltaic parameters from 25 cells of the pristine and the DDS and SDP devices are statistically analyzed (Figure  5d, e ; Figure  S18  and Table  S6 , Supporting Information). These results reveal slight improvements in V OC and J SC , along with the ultra-high FF. The average FF increased significantly from 80.29% to 84.27%, playing a pivotal role in enhancing PCE. Moreover, the selective grain boundary passivation with SDP can effectively inhibit charge transport recombination, resulting in an ultra-high FF of 86.0% (Figure  S19  and Table  S7 , Supporting Information) compared with that of the pristine device with 81.84%, which ranks among the highest reported for planar PSCs to date.  [56, 57]  The FF loss between the Shockley-Queisser (S-Q) limit and the measured value (consisting of nonradiative loss and charge transport loss) is compared to better understand the loss mechanism of PSCs (Note S7, Supporting Information).  [58, 59]  Figure  5f  shows that SDP-PCE M effectively inhibits both nonradiative and charge transfer loss, resulting in an FF of 84.86%. Predominantly, SDP-FF M , because of effectively inhibiting nonradiative loss and reducing charge transfer loss to a greater extent, thus significantly enhancing FF up to 86.0%, corresponding to 95.6% of the thermodynamic limit of its bandgap (Table  S8 , Supporting Information). Furthermore, the stabilized power output (SPO) at maximum power point (MPP) bias was performed to confirms the reliability of the devices (Figure  5g ). The pristine and the DDS and SDP devices maintain good optical stability after continuous illumination for 600 s. The SDP device attains a remarkable SPO of 23.56%, underscoring the outstanding optical stability achieved through selective grain boundary passivation. The long-term stability tests of perovskite films and photovoltaic devices under different conditions were carried out. First, we conducted long-term durability tests on perovskite films in an environment with a temperature of 25 °C and a relative humidity (RH) of 40 ± 10%. The pristine perovskite film exhibited a notable increase in the 𝛿-FAPbI 3 diffraction peak after 360 h, transitioning to 𝛿-FAPbI 3 after 720 h (Figure  S20a , Supporting Information). In contrast, the DDS-treated perovskite film showed effective mitigation of phase transition, albeit with a high 𝛿-FAPbI 3 diffraction peak still observed after 720 h (Figure  S20b , Supporting Information). Remarkably, the XRD pattern of the SDPtreated perovskite film shows slightly change and still shows the black perovskite phase 𝛼-FAPbI 3 (Figure  S20c , Supporting Information). These findings suggest that selective boundary passivation can inhibit phase transition and degradation of perovskite film even under relatively high humidity. The water contact angle test (Figure  S21 , Supporting Information) shows that the contact angles of the pristine, DDS-treated and SDP-treated perovskite films are 56.61°, 61.44°, and 63.54°, respectively, which imply a better moisture resistance for DDS-and SDP-treated perovskite films. Subsequently, the long-term environmental stability of unpackaged devices at ambient conditions (25 °C and 20-30%, RH) was explored (Figure  5h ). After 1400 h of aging, the PCE of the pristine device declined rapidly to 84.0% of its initial value, while the DDS and SDP devices remained 92.6 and 95.9% of their initial values, respectively. Furthermore, we further assessed the operational stability of the unencapsulated devices by MPPT under continuous illumination (white light LED array, N 2 filled box, 30 °C) (Figure  S22 , Supporting Information). The SDP device maintained 96% of the initial efficiency after 200 h, which was better than the pristine device (retained 53% of its initial PCE). Various stability measurements show that selective grain boundary passivation defect provides an effective and novel solution for enhancing both the efficiency and stability of PSCs. 
 Conclusion In summary, we have developed a solvent-based strategy to selectively passivate grain boundaries, optimizing energy level alignment. The passivation is achieved through the interaction between electron-rich units (-S═O, -NH 2 , and -OH) in DDS and SDP with undercoordinated Pb 2+ and FA + . Furthermore, the electric dipole effect of DDS and SDP aligns the energy levels in the treated perovskite films. These combined mechanisms reduce trap states at grain boundaries and significantly suppress non-radiative recombination, resulting in exceptional devices with a PCE of 24.39% and an impressive fill factor. The unpackaged devices show excellent long-term stability. Our selective grain boundary passivation strategy offers promising prospects for enhancing the interface property of perovskite films, with potential applications in advanced perovskite-based electronic devices.

Title: Supporting Information for Solvation-Driven Grain Boundary Passivation Improving the Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells
All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Fluorine-doped tin oxidecoated (FTO, 14 Ω/sq) glass substrates and 2, 2′, 7, 7′-tetrakis (N, N-dipmethoxyphenylamine)-9, 9′-spirobifluorene) (Spiro-OMeTAD, >99.86%) were obtained from Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd. Lead iodide (PbI2, 99.99%), Formamidinium iodide (FAI, 99.9%), Methylammonium iodide (MAI, 99.5%) and Methylammonium chloride (MACl, 99.5%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Dimethyl formamide (DMF, 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%), Chlorobenzene (CB, 99%), and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Technology Co., Ltd. 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS, 97%) and 4,4′-sulfonyldiphenol (SDP, 99%) were purchased from Innochem. Tin dioxide hydrocolloid dispersion (SnO2, 15%) was purchased from Alfa. 
 Device fabrication The FTO was cleaned by ultrasonication in anhydrous ethanol and deionized water for 20 min, each, followed by drying in an air oven (60 o C). Prior to fabricating the ETL, The FTO was treated with UV ozone and plasma for 15 min, respectively. The SnO2 dispersion, diluted to 5 wt%, was deposited on the FTO substrate at 3500 rpm for 30 s followed by annealing at 180 o C for 30 min. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing PbI2 (756.1 mg), FAI (240.8 mg), MACl (24.1 mg), and MAI (17.5 mg) into the DMSO/DMF (100/900 v/v) mixture. The perovskite was deposited onto substrate at 1000 rpm for 10 sec (2000 rpm ramp) and 5000 rpm for 30 sec (2000 rpm ramp). After entering the second step, 120 μL of CB was dropped on the spinning substrate in the last 15 sec. The substrates were then transferred onto a hotplate at 120 ℃ for 40 min. For the DDS and SDP treatment, different concentrations of DDS and SDP in IPA (2 mg mL 1 , 4 mg mL 1 and 6 mg mL 1 ) were deposited at 5000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. After cooling to room temperature, 90 mg of spiro-OMeTAD
S3 was dissolved 1 mL of chlorobenzene with additives of 23 μL of Li-TFSI solution (520 mg mL -1 in acetonitrile), 39.5 μL of t-BP, and 10 μL of FK209 (375 mg mL -1 in ACN) as a holetransporting material, was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 100 nm silver (Ag) was evaporated thermally under high vacuum on perovskite film to complete the device fabrication. 
 Material characterization The morphology and structure were determined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-7610F Plus) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu Kα radiation, Smart Lab, Rigaku). The interaction of perovskite film with DDS and SDP was characterized by the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Thermo Fisher, Nicolet iS50). The XPS and the UPS were carried out an XPS/UPS system (Thermo Scientific, ESCLAB 250XI). The KPFM and AFM was conducted using MFP-3D (Oxford Instruments Asylum Research). The Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra measures by the PerkinElmer Lambda 950UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra (excitation wavelength of 475 nm) were measured using a Thermo Scientific Luminescence Fluorescence Spectrometer (LF-1303003). The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectrum (excitation wavelength of 805 nm) was recorded on a time correlated single photon counting method (Zolix) on Omin-λ Monochromator/Spectrograph with a 760 nm laser. The PL intensity and carrier lifetime distribution of perovskite films were measured by time-resolved confocal fluorescence microscopy (TCFM, FastFLIM Q2, ISS Inc) with a 405 nm picosecond pulsed diode laser. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was carried out with a TOF-SIMS 5-100 instrument (ION-TOF GmbH, Germany). The operational stability of the unencapsulated devices was measured at 30 °C in a N2 filled glove box under a white LED lamp with 16-channel thin film photovoltaic MPP tracking test system (YH-VMPP-16). Watercontact angles were measured by Dataphysics OCA-20 with automatic contact angle measuring instrument. 
 Device characterization The current density-voltage (J-V) curves and the stabilized power output of photovoltaic devices were obtained by a Keithley 2400 source measure unit under AM 1.5 G illumination in N2-filled glovebox at 100 mW•cm 2 using a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (SS-F5-3A, Enli Technology Co. Ltd., Taiwan). The scan directions were forward (0.1 V → +1.2 V) and reverse (+1.2 V → 0.1 V). Simulator irradiance was characterized using a calibrated spectrometer and illumination intensity was set using a certified silicon diode. External quantum efficiency was measured by a solar cell spectral response measurement system (QE-R, Enli Technology Co. Ltd., Taiwan). The transient photovoltage decay (TPV), electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement, and Mott-Schottky analysis were carried out in an electrochemical workstation (IM6ex, Zahner, Germany). The performance and other related characterizations of devices were measured under ambient condition without encapsulation. DFT+D3 method using empirical correction in Grimme's scheme  S9,10  . Spin polarization method was adopted to describe the magnetic system. The adsorption energy of adsorbent was calculated as: E(ads) = E(*adsorbent)  E(*)  E(adsorbent). E(*adsorbent), E(*) and E(adsorbent) represent the total energy of * adsorbent, * and adsorbent molecule, respectively. The charge difference data was calculated by the tool --VASPKIT  S11  . 
 Note S3. The trap density (Nt) of the electron-only devices (FTO/SnO2/perovskites/DDS or SDP/PC60BM/Ag) was determined from the electron-only dark J-V curves obtained by a space charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The Nt value was calculated according to the equation: S12 𝑁 𝑡 = 2𝜀𝜀 0 𝑉 𝑇𝐹𝐿 ⅇ𝑑 2 where ɛ is the relative dielectric constant of perovskite film, ɛ0 is the vacuum permittivity, VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, e is the elementary charge, and d is the thickness of the perovskite film. Where nid is the ideality factor, K is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the electron charge. 
 Note 
 Note S6. The hysteresis index (HI) was calculated using the following equation:  S16   
 𝐻𝐼 = 𝑃𝐶𝐸 𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒 -𝑃𝐶𝐸 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑 𝑃𝐶𝐸 𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒 Where PCEreverse and PCEforward are the PCE corresponding to the reserve and forward scans. 
 Note S7. The detailed analysis of FF enhancement: The loss of measured FF from the Shockley-Queisser (S-Q) limit is composed of nonradiative loss and charge transport loss, and the maximum FF (FFmax) without charge transport loss can be empirically calculated with the equations listed below:  S17,18  FF max = 𝑣 𝑂𝐶 -ln (𝑣 𝑂𝐶 + 0.72) 𝑣 𝑂𝐶 + 1 𝑣 𝑂𝐶 = 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 𝑛𝑘 𝐵 𝑇/ⅇ where n is the ideality factor fitted from J-V curves.                        S4 .Note S5 . S4S5 The double exponential decay function was used to fit the TRPL decay curves as followswhere A1 and A2 are the relative amplitudes, and τ1 and τ2 represent the fast and slow decay times, which could be ascribed to nonradiative recombination and radiative recombination inside the grains, respectively.And the average lifetime (ave) is calculated by the following equation: S14 The plots of VOC versus light intensity (I) curves were described to e evaluate the trap-assisted recombination via the following equation:S15
