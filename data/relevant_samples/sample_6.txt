Perovskite Solar Cell Fabrication The n-i-p device configuration was adopted in this study (FTO/c-TiO 2 /SnO 2 /FAPbI 3 /Spiro-OMeTAD/Au). The patterned FTO substrate was sequentially cleaned with detergent soap water, deionized water, acetone and ethanol in the ultrasonic bath for 30 min, respectively. For the c-TiO 2 precursor solution, dilute 1mL bis (2, 4-glutamic acid) bis (2-propanol) titanium (IV) (75% isopropanol solution) with 19mL anhydrous ethanol. The substrate was preheated to 500 °C, and c-TiO 2 layer was deposited on top of FTO glass using the spray pyrolysis method. After spray pyrolysis, the FTO/c-TiO 2 substrate was heat at 500 °C for 60 min before cooling down to ambient temperature. The substrates were treated with oxygen plasma for 25 min. The compact SnO 2 layer was fabricated by the PAA modification method. [1] SnO 2 colloid precursor were diluted 20 times with deionized water and then mixed with PAA (1 mg/mL) under stirring at 80 °C for 3 h. The resulting solution was spin-coated onto the c-TiO 2 layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s. 
 S3 The substrates were heated at 160 °C for 30 min. Before coating the perovskite layer, the substrate was treated with oxygen plasma for 8 min and transferred immediately to the glove box for further process. The FAPbI 3 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing 705.2 mg PbI 2 , 240.8 mg FAI, 33.8 mg MACl and 5.8 mg MAPbBr 3 in DMF:DMSO (8:1) was spin coated onto SnO 2 with two-step program: 1,000 and 6,000 rpm for 10 and 30 s, respectively. During the second step, 100 μL of chlorobenzene (with/without YZ-301, YZ-302 and YZ-303) was drop-coated to treat the perovskite films. The substrate was dried on a hot plate at 120 °C for 60 min to produce FAPbI 3 perovskite thin film. Subsequently, Spiro-OMeTAD (73 mg/mL) was dissolved in chlorobenzene containing 29 μ L tBP, 17.5 μ L Li-TFSI (520 mg/mL in acetonitrile), and the resulting solution was spun onto the top of the perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds. Finally, the 100 nm Au electrode was thermally evaporated to the top of the HTM layer. 
 Characterization and measurement The XPS spectrum of the sample was measured using the photoelectron spectrometer (model: AXIS-Ultra DLD). The XRD patterns of the samples were examined by A confocal microscope constructed from a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu A. radiation (λ=1.5418 A).

The LUMO level of IPM is calculated from the following equation: , where E g   g HOMO LUMO E E E    is estimated from the intersection of the absorption and emission spectra of the material. The J-V curve was tested using a Newport Oriel Sol3A solar simulation system under a standard sunlight of 1.5 AM (100 mW cm -2 ), with a standard silicon cell calibration to determine the simulator light intensity. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using the CEL-QPCE3000 photoelectrochemical quantum efficiency test analysis system.

After cooling down the reaction to room temperature, the mixture was diluted with dichloromethane S6 and washed with water. The organic layer was collected and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate= 7:1 vol/vol) to obtain YZ-301 (0.815 g, yield: 65%) as a green solid.  1

Title: Enhancing the Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells via the Functional Group Synergistic Effect in Interfacial Passivation Materials
Interfacial defects are considered to be a stumbling block in producing highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs), so a more reasonable design is required for interfacial passivation materials (IPMs) to achieve further improvements in PSC performance. Here, we use fluorine atom (-F) and methoxy (-OCH 3 ) functional groups to modify the same molecular fragment, obtaining three kinds of IPMs named YZ-301, YZ-302, and YZ-303, respectively. Through the subtle combination of -F and -OCH 3 , the fragment in YZ-302 exhibits an enhanced electronegativity, rendering the correlative IPM with a stronger interaction with the perovskite layer. As a result, YZ-302 shows the best defect passivation and hole transport effect at the interface, and the PSC based on YZ-302 treatment achieves the best efficiency approaching 24%, which is better than the reference and devices with other IPMs, and it also has excellent device stability.
P erovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly increased over a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.1% during the past decade, attracting much attention to investigate the excellent photoelectric characteristics of perovskite materials. PSC is also considered to rival other commercial photovoltaic technologies for further application.  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]  Typically, the perovskite layer produces a large number of defects on the interface and grain boundaries from precursors to the solidstate film. These imperfections trap photoexcited charges and act as unstable sites on the film, dragging down the overall PSC performance. In order to step from the laboratory to the practical stage, huge efforts have been made to enhance PSC's PCE and stability via crystallization engineering, defect passivation, and interface charge-transporting regulation. Wherein, organic molecular materials are a kind of effective tool to realize interface modulation.  [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]  It is expected that an effective interface passivation material (IPM) could interact with defect states such as uncoordinated metal cations, halide anion vacancies, metal-halide antisites, etc.  [15] [16] [17] [18]  Therefore, various functional groups, such as fluorine (-F), carbonyl (-C�O), amino (-NH 2 ), etc., have been installed on the organic molecular materials to deactive these charged defects, while the correspondingly treated PSCs have been definitely improved and stabilized.  8, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24]  Recently, to make molecules show versatility, IPMs have gradually become a system containing multifunctional groups. And the intramolecular synergy of these functional fragments is thought to significantly impact the material properties.  [25] [26] [27]  Many works have also been carried out to reveal this kind of synergistic effect. Jiang et al. found that -F as a passivating group can weaken/strengthen other electron-rich passivating groups within the same molecule through electrostatic or hydrogen bonding.  25  Wang et al. reported two coumarin derivatives containing hydroxyethyl and methacrylate groups, respectively. Two -C�O groups of methacrylate-based coumarin can increase the hydrophobicity and extent of binding to the perovskite layer, synergistically enhancing the defect passivating ability.  28  Cui et al. found that the synergy between amide and π conjugated structures achieved a polymer-like passivation network to firmly anchor with Pb-I units, reducing the defect density.  29  It is of great interest to continue to delve deeper into the synergistic mechanism of functional groups within the same passivation molecule. Herein, we designed and synthesized three multifunctional molecules as IPMs, that are, N 3 ,N  6  -bis(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3yl)-N 3 ,N 6 ,9-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-9H-carbazole-3,6-diamine (YZ-301), N 3 ,N 6 -bis(3,5-difluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)-N 3 ,N  6  bis(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-9-(4-methoxyphenyl)-9H-carbazole-3,6-diamine (YZ-302), and N 3 ,N  6  -bis(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-9-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N 3 ,N 6 -bis(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)-9H-carbazole-3,6-diamine (YZ-303). In these IPMs, three carbazoles are connected with N nodes as the π-conjugated molecular skeleton to ensure the hole transport and crystallization orientation.  [30] [31] [32] [33]  Different combinations of -F and methoxy (-OCH 3 ) on the terminal phenyl group generate structural differences. Both -F and -OCH 3 can exert considerable impact on the perovskite lattice, which could passivate defects and promote carrier transport, respectively. But their synergistic effect in the same molecule has rarely been discussed before. Density functional theory and experimental results show that the synergistic effect regulate the electron density of YZ-302 molecule, inducing the strongest binding effect with the perovskite film. The enhanced  interaction in YZ-302 facilitated better defect passivation and hole transport. The above effect that one plus one is greater than two is the so-called synergy of -F and -OCH 3 . However, due to the lack of this synergy, YZ-301 and YZ-303 molecules fail to produce satisfactory passivation and charge transport performance. The PSCs treated with YZ-302 yield a best PCE of 23.8%, which is much higher than the untreated reference (22.2%) and YZ-301 and YZ-303 devices. In addition, the stability of the PSC with YZ-302 is also improved due to less defect density, desired crystalline quality, and improved hydrophobicity of treated perovskite film. The molecular structures and synthetic routes of YZ-301, YZ-302, and YZ-303 are shown in Figures  1a  and Scheme S1 . Three different phenyl groups, 4-methoxyphenyl, 3, 5-difluoro-4-methoxyphenyl, and 3, 4, 5-trifluorophenyl, are connected to the three-carbazole conjugated skeletons through the Buchwald coupling reactions. These resultant IPMs were added into the perovskite films via antisolvent chlorobenzene (CB) during the spin-coating procedure. In this process, these IPM molecules can easily react with the perovskite lattice through Lewis acid-base and hydrogen bonding interactions. First, we simulated the electrostatic surface potential (ESP) of YZ-301, YZ-302, and YZ-303 molecules by density functional theory (DFT) to evaluate the potential interaction sites. Interestingly, it was found that significant negative charge densities are present on the different phenyl groups in these IPMs, which tend to affect the perovskite lattice (Figure  1b ). 3,5-Difluoro-4methoxyphenyl in YZ-302 obviously shows a deeper red color area near -OCH 3 group than YZ301, which indicates a relatively more negative charge density than YZ-301 without F. While, replacing -OCH 3 with -F in YZ-302 produces three F substituted YZ-303, which exhibit no obvious enhanced negative charge intensity. From the perspective of the molecular dipole (Figure  S16 ), both ortho -F groups can attract electron clouds from phenyls, and the vector direction of these attractions similarly directs to the middle -OCH 3 or -F on phenyl in YZ-302 and YZ-303, respectively, greatly intensifying the negative charge density in this region. However, the electron cloud density of -F is lower than -OCH 3 , so the order of electronegativity may become 3, 5difluoro-4-methoxyphenyl (YZ-302) > 4-methoxyphenyl (YZ-301) ≈ 3, 4, 5-trifluorophenyl (YZ-303).  34  Slicing these molecular fragments above to adhere on perovskite lattice, the adsorption energies (E ads ) at the interface are calculated to be -0.548, -0.605 and -0.363 eV, respectively (Figure  1c ). The results imply that these IPMs may exert an obvious and distinct influence on perovskite film and PSCs. To probe the interaction between IPMs and FAPbI 3 perovskite films, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted. After being added into perovskite film, the typical peaks of Pb 4f and I 3d for IPMs treated samples exhibit shifts toward lower binding energy compared to the untreated control (Figure  2a  which is inferior to YZ-302.  35  The XPS spectra of F 1s and O 1s also indicate the introduction of IPMs and the interaction with perovskite films (Figure  S17 ). To explore the crystallinity and morphology of treated perovskite films, we performed Xray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Figure  2c ). The XRD patterns of the control and treated perovskite films show the significant diffraction peaks at 13.94°and 28.10°, corresponding to the (001) and (002) planes in the cubic perovskite material. The similar peak patterns indicate that the IPMs does not change the perovskite crystal structure. In addition, YZ-302 significantly improve the (001) peak, as well as the intensity ratio of the (001) and (002) peaks, implying that YZ-302 doped perovskite film has higher crystallinity and preferred orientation. YZ-301 and YZ-303 has no effect and even weaken the quality of the perovskite films. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) directly presents the morphology of the perovskite films with and without IPMs (Figure  2d ). Compared with the control sample, the films treated with the three additive molecules all show smoother surfaces with less small and irregular grains, which may be due to the πconjugated IPMs become the heteronuclear crystallization centers to expand the grain sizes. In cross-sectional SEM images, YZ-302 treated PSCs exhibit monolithic grains from the top to the bottom (Figure  S18 ). Although the grains are enlarged, YZ-301 and YZ-303 do not regulate the crystallizing orientation well, resulting in slightly chaotic grain growth. Both -F and -OCH 3 can interact with perovskite and so can with the components of perovskite precursor. The -F and -OCH 3 will become active sites of IPMs-inducing heteronuclear crystallization. But not every IPM can play a positive role in perovskite growing. We investigate the XRD patterns of perovskite films before and after annealing (Figure  S19 ). After comparing the ratio of δ and α phase peaks, YZ-302 obviously promotes the transition of FA-based perovskite from δ to α phase. YZ-301 is almost the same as control sample, but YZ-303 impedes the transformation process. A greater number of -F groups in YZ-303 tend to generate more hydrogen bonding between the organo-ammonium salt and YZ303, which may delay the perovskite growth process too much to hardly get a good crystallization orientation. In Figure  2e , atomic force microscopy (AFM) images also confirm the decrease in roughness of the perovskite film, and F-containing IPMs (YZ-302 and YZ-303) produce significant smoothing effects, which are beneficial for the contact and efficient hole transport at the interface. The surface smoothing by YZ-302 and YZ-303 can be attributed to -F on the terminal phenyls. The 19 F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was performed to investigate the interaction between -F and the perovskite precursors. In Figure  S20 , upon adding FAI and PbI 2 to YZ-302 and YZ-303, the 19 F signals become broad and undergo shifts, which indicate that F-containing molecules interact with perovskite precursors and further affect the crystallization process.  36  YZ-303 contains more -F and obtains the smoothest perovskite surface but the least ideal crystal orientation. Hence, the synergy of -F and -OCH 3 not only intensifies the interaction with perovskite lattice but also regulates the film quality, which is beneficial to the defect passivation and hole transport. By using steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and timeresolved PL (TRPL) spectroscopy, we investigate the influence of IPMs on the nonradiative recombination and transport dynamics. It is found that the PL intensity of perovskite film increases to a certain extent after YZ-302 treatment, proving the nonradiative recombination is effectively suppressed (Figure  3a ). YZ-301 and YZ-303 treatments weaken the PL intensities due to an increase of defects caused by unsatisfactory crystal quality. At the same time, the fluorescence decay is fitted by the double exponential decay function Y = A 1 exp (-t/τ 1 ) + A 2 exp (-t/τ 2 ) and the data are collected in Table  S1 . The decay trend of PL lifetime is the same as the steady-state test (Figure  3b ). Compared with the control (τ avg = 428.9 ns), YZ-302 treatment yields the longest τ avg of 621.0 ns, indicating enhanced charge extraction and suppressed nonradiative recombination at the interface.  37  Accordingly, the carrier lifetimes of the YZ-301 and YZ-303 based perovskite films are 240.5 and 215.1 ns, respectively. The result is basically consistent with that of the XRD test. The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method further illustrated that YZ302 has the most significant impact on the   S3 ), partially explaining the perovskite energy level alterations. The result above suggests that the synergy of -F and -OCH 3 in YZ-302 not only decreases the nonradiative recombination but also regulates the energy level alignment and charge transport. Based on the above findings, we prepared devices with the structure of FTO/c-TiO 2 /SnO 2 /FAPbI 3 /Spiro-OMeTAD/Au to verify the impact of IPMs on PSC photovoltaic performance and long-term stability. Figure  4a  shows the photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) curves of different PSCs. A V OC of 1.11 V, a J SC of 24.3 mA•cm -2 , an FF of 82.5%, and a PCE of 22.2% are obtained from the control device. Supported by the synergy of -F and -OCH 3 , the device treated with YZ-302 achieves an optimal PCE of up to 23.8% with an ultrahigh V OC of 1.16 V, a J SC of 24.8 mA•cm -2 , and an FF of 83.1%. Upon employing YZ-302, the perovskite film quality is obviously improved with enhanced charge transport, which can be attributed to the synergy of -F and -OCH 3 . This is reflected by the better performance of YZ-302 based PSCs. The device treated with YZ-301 has a V OC of 1.12 V, a J SC of 24.4 mA•cm -2 , an FF of 82.6%, and a PCE of 22.6%. YZ-301 containing only -OCH 3 has a suitable energy level and good hole transport ability. It will ensure the smooth hole transport at the interface, while it is difficult to significantly contribute to perovskite crystallization and defect passivation. So, the YZ-301 device performed similarly to the control one. The device treated with YZ-303 produces only a PCE of 21.6% and a J SC of 24.9 mA•cm -2 with a poor V OC of 1.08 V and an FF of 79.5%. For YZ-303, 3, 4, 5-trifluorophenyl does not intensify the interaction with perovskite film and drags YZ-303 HOMO to a lower level. It may be not beneficial for hole transport at interface. After YZ-303 treatment, the perovskite film became even worse than the control one. Even though YZ-303 can also passivate the defects, poor crystallization quality makes this  The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters pubs.acs.org/JPCL Letter passivation like a drop in the bucket. These above results can be reflected in the lower V OC and FF. And then, all different PSCs are collected as J-V curves with forward and reverse directions. The YZ-302 based device has the lowest hysteresis index, and all data are presented in Table  1 . The incidentphoton-to-current efficiency (IPCE) curves of the corresponding devices are shown in Figure  4b , and the integral current densities agree well with the J-V curve measurement results, confirming the authenticity of the photovoltaic performance. The stable power output of the PSCs at the maximum power point (control is 096 V, YZ-301 is 0.97 V, YZ-302 is 0.99 V, YZ-303 is 0.92 V) are shown in Figure  4c , and the steady-state PCEs of control, YZ-301, YZ-302 and YZ-303 treated devices are 22.0%, 22.2%, 23.5%, and 21.3%, respectively, which match well with the results of J-V tests above. In addition, we made statistics on the photovoltaic parameters of 20 devices for every condition to plot the distribution box (Figure  4d ). YZ-302 based PSCs exhibit PCEs and good reproducibility higher than those of other treatments. In Figure  S24 , it can be seen that the V OC makes the greatest contribution to PCE improvement, which suggest the surface defects are really passivated with the assistance of the functional group synergy. We further measured the dark state saturation current density (J 0 ) through the dark J-V curve to evaluate the charge recombination.  38, 39  As shown in Figure  S25 , YZ-302 molecule treatment (2.376 × 10 -8 μA) reduced the J 0 compared with the control (1.651 × 10 -7 ) by an order of magnitude, much lower than YZ-301 and YZ-303. To understand the increased V OC , we extracted the built-in potential (V bi ) from the Mott-Schottky measurement. As shown in Figure  4e , YZ-302 molecule treatment obtains the highest V bi of 0.96 V compared to control, YZ-301 and YZ-303 based devices, which indicates that the driving force for charge transport is stronger, resulting in an increase in V OC for YZ-302 based devices.  40  To gain more insight into the improved PCE, we investigated the relationship between V OC and the light intensity (Figure  4f ). The YZ-302 curve of V OC on light intensity gives a slope of 1.14 K B T/q that is smaller than those under other conditions, giving the same conclusion that YZ-302 suppresses the defect-assisted charge recombination. The J SC dependence on light intensity is also shown in Figure  S28 . The increase of the slope of the YZ-302-based device indicates that the charge extraction ability is enhanced and the defect is reduced. To explore the stability of these PCSs, we measured the contact angle of water on a perovskite film with different IPMs (Figure  5a ). The conjugated structure of YZ-301 improves hydrophobicity compared to control film. With the number of -F group increasing, the hydrophobicity is further increased by YZ-302. At the same time, although YZ-303 molecules have more F atoms, the unsatisfactory film quality deteriorated the hydrophobic effect. Dense and hydrophobic films are more conducive to stability. After monitoring, the perovskite film treated with IPMs has better storage stability under 35 °C and 50-55% RH, as shown in Figure  S26 . The control perovskite film has been significantly degraded since the eighth day, while the treated perovskite films have not changed. When the control perovskite film has been completely degraded, the treated perovskite films have not changed obviously. As shown in Figure  5b , the PSC with YZ-302 still retained 80% of its initial PCE after aging in ambient conditions for 1200 h, while the control device only had a PCE under 80% of its performance. In addition, the thermal stability tests under conditions of 85 °C and 30-35% RH showed that the PSC with YZ-302 had higher thermal stability compared to the control device and could still maintain 70% of the initial PCE after 100 h of aging (Figure  5c ). Meanwhile, as shown in Figure  S27 , the perovskite film with YZ-302 showed a similar thermal stability improvement under the conditions of 85 °C and 45-50% RH. The thermal stability of three IPMs was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As shown in Figure  S29a , the decomposition temperatures (T d ) at 10% weight loss of YZ-301, YZ-302 and YZ-303 are 347, 389, and 412 °C, respectively, which indicates that all IPMs have good thermal stability. Figure  S29b  shows that the glass transition temperatures (T g ) of YZ-301, YZ-302 and YZ-303 are 156.7, 144.5, and 157.0 °C, respectively. From TGA and DSC test, IPMs will not become the main instable issues under a relative high temperature. In summary, we have developed three interfacial passivation materials YZ-301, YZ-302, and YZ-303 with three different phenyl groups, 4-methoxyphenyl, 3, 5-difluoro-4-methoxyphenyl and 3, 4, 5-trifluorophenyl, respectively, to regulate the HTL interface of PSCs. In the resultant IPMs, YZ-302 has both -F and -OCH 3 on the terminal phenyl groups and produces a synergy in which the enhanced charge density in the region effectively promotes defect passivation and hole transport. At the same time, YZ-302 optimizes the perovskite crystal quality and the hydrophobicity, really realizing the multifunctionality at the interface. Consequently, YZ-302 treated PSCs yield a best PCE of 23.8% and excellent storage stability superior to control devices. However, YZ-301 and YZ-303 have not achieved the desired results due to poor passivation and crystallization effects. Our work provides new insights into the rational IPM design with the functional group synergy, which can act versatilely in highly efficient PSCs.
