Title: Molecular templating of layered halide perovskite nanowires

Layered metal-halide perovskites, or two-dimensional perovskites, can be synthesized in solution, and their optical and electronic properties can be tuned by changing their composition. We report a molecular templating method that restricted crystal growth along all crystallographic directions except for  [110]  and promoted one-dimensional growth. Our approach is widely applicable to synthesize a range of high-quality layered perovskite nanowires with large aspect ratios and tunable organic-inorganic chemical compositions. These nanowires form exceptionally well-defined and flexible cavities that exhibited a wide range of unusual optical properties beyond those of conventional perovskite nanowires. We observed anisotropic emission polarization, low-loss waveguiding (below 3 decibels per millimeter), and efficient low-threshold light amplification (below 20 microjoules per square centimeter). L ayered metal-halide perovskites, or twodimensional (2D) perovskites, can be synthesized in solution, and their optical and electronic properties can be tuned by changing their composition  (1) . Growth of 1D forms of these materials has been limited to vapor-phase growth (2, 3) of (BA) 2 PbI 4 , where BA is butylammonium, or to lithographically templated solution-phase growth of (BA) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 , where MA is methylammonium and the layer number n is 2 to 5  (4, 5) . These methods have high processing complexity and cost as well as limited scalability and design flexibility. Notably, the structure of layered perovskites has inspired the use of bulky organic spacers with engineered bandgaps (6, 7) and intermolecular p interactions  (8) . We have found organic templating molecules that can break the inplane symmetry of layered perovskites and induce 1D growth through secondary bonding interactions. Specifically, these molecules introduce in-plane hydrogen bonding that is compatible with both the ionic nature and octahedron spacing of halide perovskites. Nanowires of layered perovskites can be readily assembled in solution facilitated by the formation of a 1D H-bonded organic network. These nanowires with tailorable lengths and highquality cavities provide an ideal platform to study anisotropic excitonic behaviors, light propagation, and lasing in layered perovskites. Our approach highlights the structural tunability of organic-inorganic hybrid semiconductors, which also brings unprecedented morphological control to layered materials. 
 In-plane unidirectional H bonding Organic spacers for layered perovskites typically impose weak long-range order. For example, an out-of-plane view along the stacking direction of (PEA) 2 PbBr 4 , where PEA is phenylethylammonium, shows weak intermolecular interactions in the organic layer (Fig.  1A ). To align the cations, carboxylic acid (COOH) was chosen to dimerize through multiple H bonds, which have strong directionality and are widely used to drive the self-assembly and alignment of organic building blocks  (9) . Derivatizing PEA with COOH to the 3-position of the phenyl ring resulted in the out-of-plane formation of classic COOH dimers across the van der Waals gap (Fig.  1B ), as previously observed in 2D perovskites  (10) . However, this out-of-plane directionality did not alter the in-plane growth of layered perovskite crystals, and only 2D nanostructures were obtained. To direct 1D growth, we first attempted to align the H bonds parallel to inorganic slabs. An additional COOH unit was introduced in the para position of the existing moiety to form a backbone resembling terephthalic acid (TPA), that we named TPA3 [2-(2,5-dicarboxyphenoxy)ethan-1-aminium; Fig.  1C ]. The crystal structure of (TPA3) 2 PbBr 4 revealed well-aligned, parallel 1D chains of TPA3 on top of 2D inorganic slabs driven by unidirectional intermolecular interactions (Fig.  1, C  and E ). Adjacent TPA moieties were connected along the [010] crystallographic direction with a spacing of 9.54 Å characterized by the aromatic centroid distance. Each 1D chain consisted of periodic COOH dimers with an average H-bonding distance of 1.78 Å. This unidirectional in-plane connectivity in the organic layer led to the solution-phase selfassembly of layered perovskites exclusively into needles and wires (Fig.  1C  and fig.  S1 ). These 1D crystals had a mean aspect ratio as large as 28.9 (fig.  S2 ). However, the TPA3-based structures exhibited several unsatisfactory morphological and optical properties. Growing high-quality crystals (fig.  S3, A  and B ) required a very slow selfassembly process because fast growth usually led to poorly defined end facets (Fig.  1C  and fig.  S3 , D to H) or even hyperbranched crystals, as observed in the case of (TPA3) 2 PbI 4 (fig.  S4, A  and B , and movie S1). Negligible excitonic features were observed even from photoluminescence (PL) of slow-assembled (TPA3) 2 PbBr 4 single crystals. The emission was dominated by a broad band that we attributed to self-trapped excitons or in-gap defect states (fig.  S3, B  and C )  (11) . The iodide counterpart instead presented broad excitonic emission (fig.  S4, C to E ). We hypothesized that strong H bonds disrupted the assembly of ionic species and led to extensive defect formation during crystal growth that drove hyperbranching. Considerable octahedral distortion was observed in (TPA3) 2 PbBr 4 (characterized by the Pb-Br bond distance variation, Dd = 9.1 × 10 -4 ; Fig.  1E ) that was associated with quenched excitonic feature and broadband emission  (12) . 
 Partially broken 1D chains To balance secondary bonding with ionic assembly, we partially disrupted the 1D H-bonding network by substituting one COOH unit in the TPA backbone with bromine, which prevented COOH dimers from twisting back to form outof-plane H bonds. This candidate, BrCA3 [2-(2bromo-5-carboxyphenoxy)ethan-1-aminium] maintained a similar in-plane connectivity but formed parallelly aligned "partially broken" 1D chains above inorganic slabs (Fig.  1D ), which were parallel to the 3 10 ½ direction but deviated from the stacking directions of the octahedrons. Octahedral distortions were reduced by an order of magnitude (Dd = 8.9 × 10 -5 ), presumably from the relief of stress in the Hbonded network. Each chain was constructed by pairs of BrCA3 through COOH dimerization with the same spacing and H-bonding distance as those in the TPA3 counterpart. Adjacent molecules were well separated at the bromine terminal, with an intermolecular Br-Br spacing of 3.30 Å (Fig.  1F ), and allowed the occupation of water molecules stabilized through H bonding with ammonium tails. Given the hygroscopic nature of halide perovskites, this partial occupancy of water is rather unusual. The partially broken 1D connectivity introduced by BrCA3 promoted balanced and rapid 1D self-assembly of layered perovskites. Crystal growth was further accelerated at the dropletair interface to produce high-quality nanowires. This floating growth method was originally developed  (13)  for capturing thin 2D sheets of layered perovskites and subsequent transfer preserving pristine morphology (materials and methods). The nucleation and 1D growth of (BrCA3) 2 PbBr 4 were studied with in situ microscopy (movie S2) revealing a growth rate that was ~40 times as fast along the long axis compared with the short (fig.  S5 ). Nanowires of (BrCA3) 2 PbBr 4 exhibited a mean length, width, and height of 8.45 mm, 409 nm, and 361 nm, respectively, and maintained a mean aspect ratio of 22.0 (fig.  S6 ). A characteristic nanowire shown in Fig.  1D  had an exceptional aspect ratio of >100 (~80 mm long and ~0.7 mm wide), welldefined end facets, and a twisted morphology. The solution-phase synthesis additionally allowed easy scaling-up, cleaning, and surface coating of nanowires with dense and uniform coverage (materials and methods and fig.  S7 ). 
 Growth mechanism studies Although the formation of 2D perovskite nanowires appeared to depend on the inherent 1D connectivity within the organic layer, additional studies were needed to determine whether their growth direction followed the H-bond direction of COOH dimers. We used single-crystal x-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) to face-index bulk crystals and nanowires of (BrCA3) 2 PbBr 4 , respectively (Fig.  2 , A to C, and fig.  S8 ). The long axis of each crystal was aligned with its [110] crystallographic direction and the short axis with 1 10 ½ , both matching the octahedron stacking direction. However, the COOH dimers (along 3 10 ½ ) were at an angle of 63°relative to the [110] long axis, and the dimer orientation in RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE the TPA3 counterpart was perpendicular to its long axis (fig.  S9 ). These findings contradicted our initial intuitive hypothesis that nanowires would grow along the directional H bonds. Instead, the COOH dimers hindered rather than facilitated the growth of layered perovskites. Alignment of cations correlated with the distinct exposure of COOH moieties at the side versus the end facets (here, side facets refer to all of the facets parallel to the long axis), as shown in Fig.  2D  for the  22 1  ð Þ end facet when viewed along the [110] growth direction. Six side facets were subsequently indexed as 110 ð Þ, 113 ð Þ, 1 13 ð Þ, and their Friedel pairs according to the hexagonal cylindrical crystal previously investigated with SC-XRD (Fig.  2B  and fig.  S8A ). Dangling COOH moieties were abundant on all six side facets (Fig.  2D ) because of the near-perpendicular H-bond alignment with the long axis,  [110] . Notably absent was the (001) facet parallel to the [PbBr 4 ] 2- slabs, which was typically observed in conventional 2D perovskites but instead subdivided into 113 ð Þ and 1 13 ð Þ, which further enhanced the surface exposure of COOH. These findings suggested that surface dangling carboxylic acids would slow down crystal growth and lead to the preferred exposure of COOH-abundant surfaces. In previously reported polymer-assisted synthesis of oxide perovskite Pb(Zr/Ti)O 3 nanowires (  14 ), the polymer was hypothesized to reduce the surface tension of certain crystallographic planes. Nanowire growth was thus driven by the coverage of high-energy exposed surfaces and left them as end facets. In our system, surface dangling carboxylic acids protected nanowire side facets by forming robust H bonds with water, and incoming cations must break the existing solvent shield. In fact, water was an essential solvent for 1D growth: Crystals randomly nucleated and clustered in nonaqueous media even within protic alcohols (fig.  S10 ). Water passivation lowered the surface energy of COOH-abundant facets, but such an effect became particularly weak at the 22 1 ð Þ end. As illustrated in fig.  S11 , the 110 ð Þ side facets were uniformly covered with dangling COOH moieties, whereas the density was nearly halved at 22 1 ð Þ, which was insufficient to protect it from incoming cations. Surface energies of notable facets calculated with density functional theory (DFT) revealed considerable anisotropy after addressing the effects from RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE water passivation, leading to higher surface energy at the 22 1 ð Þfacet (fig.  S11, F  and G ). Thus, the molecular templating effect of inplane COOH dimers aligned organic cations and drove the anisotropic surface termination of dangling COOH moieties that protected these surfaces through robust H bonding with aqueous solvent molecules. The discussions spanning crystal nucleation, molecular and unit cell level, nanowire morphology, and bulk crystals were integrated in fig.  S12  and sup plementary text 1. In particular, this mechanism points to the crucial alignment of H bonds with the growth direction (90°in TPA3 and 63°in BrCA3-templated counterparts), which affected the relative abundance of dangling COOH on side versus end facets and therefore the effect of 1D growth. A perfect perpendicular alignment in (TPA3) 2 PbBr 4 led to rapid 1D growth but poor cavities in nanocrystals, whereas the seemingly imperfect H-bond alignment in (BrCA3) 2 PbBr 4 presented a well-balanced crystal growth and nanowires with excellent cavities. Nanowires of (BrCA3) 2 PbBr 4 displayed diverse morphologies that were commonly observed with hexagonal or acute trapezoidal end facets (Fig.  2 , E to G). The interplay among side facets could lead to distinct termination morphology even within a single nanowire (fig.  S13A ). These intricate morphological features likely stem from the surface modification with dangling COOH, so a range of low-energy facets were exposed. Notably, narrow and thin crystals (~30 nm) also exhibited smooth terminations (fig.  S13B ). They easily bend or twist; Fig.  2G  shows 180°twisting of a nanoribbon. Highresolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provided additional structural characterizations despite the high sensitivity of 2D perovskite nanowires to electron beam damage (fig.  S14 ). Optically, (BrCA3) 2 PbBr 4 exhibited white PL at room temperature with a sharp excitonic peak at 413 nm and lower-energy broad emission band (Fig.  2, I  and J ). The PL characteristics were unaffected by bending or twisting. 
 An expanded library of layered perovskite nanowires We used the BrCA3 spacer to synthesize a wide range of layered perovskites. For example, BrCA3-based nanowires with [PbI 4 ] 2-and 4 ] 2-matrices were readily obtained (Fig.  3,  A  and B ). These candidates exhibited better stability against ambience, heat, and light com-pared with PEA-based structures (figs. S15 to S17). High aspect ratios were generally achievable in quasi-2D perovskites, such as n = 2 (BrCA3) 2 MAPb 2 Br 7 (Fig.  3C ) and n = 2 and n = 3 in lead-iodide counterparts (Fig.  3, D  and E ). Epitaxial growth of these nanowires originated from their end facets. Representative diblock or triblock longitudinal heterostructures obtained with deliberate fast nucleation of (BrCA3) 2 PbBr 4 on the as-grown iodide cores (materials and methods) had interfaces between the core and shell that were morphologically indiscernible (Fig.  3F ), but the longitudinal extension of bromide segments could be distinguished by its distinctive white PL. Coaxial growth around the side facets of iodide cores remained negligible because dangling COOH groups on each side facet shielded asgrown crystals against the coaxial nucleation of additional layers. Enhanced core and shell resolution was further achieved through selectively exciting bromide or iodide sections (fig.  S18, A to E ). In contrast to those synthesized with 3D halide perovskites with a gradient ion distribution  (15) , nanowire heterostructures based on layered perovskites had enhanced stability against halide migration that preserved Br-I interface contrast (fig.  S18F ).  
 RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE The use of partially broken 1D H-bonded chain was expanded by substituting bromide groups in BrCA3 with fluoride or methyl groups. These derivatives also enabled 1D growth of layered perovskite nanowires (fig.  S19 ). Optically, compared with (BrCA3) 2 PbBr 4 , the emission was yellowish green for the methyl analog but bluish white for the fluoride analog. Although broadband emission reduced the color purity, it also facilitated color tunability in layered perovskite nanowires with subtle variation of organic spacers. 
 Unusual optical properties Morphologically restricting the growth of layered perovskites into 1D nanowires led to distinctive optical properties along, perpendicular, or both to the stacking direction of these layered structures. Emission typically displayed weak linear polarization [degree of polarization (DOP) < 3%] with propagation direction approximately along their long axes (fig.  S20 ), which we attributed to the anisotropic con-finement of electric field within high-aspect ratio nanostructures  (16) . However, a 58% DOP was observed from a representative candidate of (BrCA3) 2 PbI 4 (Fig.  4A ), where the emission propagated almost perpendicular to its long axis, in contradiction with our previous observations. Layered perovskites exhibited intrinsic emission polarization caused by the in-plane confinement of excitons  (17) . Such a phenomenon is challenging to observe in 2D plates when viewed along the stacking direction in a typical epidetection setup, whereas nanowires offer accessibility to their side facets. Therefore, when viewing perpendicular to the stacking direction, strong linearly polarized PL was revealed that propagated perpendicular to the long axes, which could explain the observation in Fig.  4A . We examined a piece of twisted (BrCA3) 2 PbI 4 nanowire to resolve the origin of its polarization dependence (Fig.  4B ). Twisting allowed the observation of both in-plane and out-ofplane optical properties within a single nano-wire. As illustrated subsequently, inorganic slabs were originally stacked parallel to the substrate on the top of the image, and then crystal gradually twisted to allow the view perpendicular to its stacking direction. The twisting action allowed the observation of diverse polarization profile within the same crystal, which was further quantified and spatially resolved. Emission polarization was negligible at the top, but the crystal gradually exhibited linearly polarized emission with slowly rotated polarization direction along the twisting action, resulting in a DOP of 40% at the bottom. This demonstration of twist-dependent tunable emission polarization from a single semiconductor nanowire arose from the combination of layered crystal structure, 1D growth kinetics, and the twisted morphology. Nanowires of layered perovskites are candidates for active waveguides given their tailorable length, emission tunability, and flexibility. Waveguide losses were assessed from several ~100-mm-long wires of (BrCA3) 2 PbBr 4 according to their propagation distance-dependent relative tip emission intensity collected and analyzed with far-field PL images (materials and methods). Nanowires of (BrCA3) 2 PbBr 4 exhibited intrinsic loss coefficients as low as 2.7 dB/mm, as observed in straight samples (Fig.  5A ). Best-performing contemporary inorganic  (18, 19)  and organic (20) semiconductor waveguides typically exhibit losses within 10 dB/mm. Narrow and bent nanowires (Fig.  5B ), or even strongly twisted ones (Fig.  5C ), had similar losses to those of wide and straight waveguides as they remained crystalline after bending or twisting. Waveguides could be coupled to transport light to adjacent crystals and create a complex optical network  (18) . A few coupled nanowires were examined through tip-tip interactions or cross-intersections (Fig.  5D  and fig.  S21 ), demonstrating proof-of-concept potentials to construct more-complex optical networks. Directional propagation of light within 1D nanowires was necessary to ensure efficient coupling of waveguides. Figure  5D  shows a perpendicular pair of cross-coupled waveguides that formed multiple scattering sites. Because of the 1D propagation of light, only the right end of the intersection could be illuminated when excitation light was injected from the left side of the intersection, and vice versa. Minimal outcoupled light was detected from the vertical nanowire when the horizontal crystal was excited. Building on previous studies of semiconductor nanowire lasers  (21)  and lasing in 3D halide perovskites  (22, 23) , we investigated the light amplification behavior of BrCA3-based nanowires. In lead-based layered perovskites, the lasing threshold is often constrained by the strong exciton-phonon interaction or Auger recombination  (7) . Enhanced lasing performances Emission from the two end facets in nanowires of (BrCA3) 2 SnI 4 gradually became dominant with increasing pump fluence (fig.  S24 ) and was accompanied by the appearance of spatial interference patterns (Fig.  5E ) and multimode lasing at the lower-energy side of the spontaneous emission band (Fig.  5F ). We monitored the integrated emission intensity across the threshold to determine a lasing threshold of 17 mJ/cm 2 (Fig.  5G ) versus that of ~100 mJ/cm 2 observed in contemporary tin-based layered perovskites. The bright localized emission from the tips and multimode lasing from this ~16.0-mm-long nanowire were both consistent from the strong waveguiding behavior under Fabry-Perot modes. Mode spacing (DE) from a series of nanowires with varying lengths (L) decreased with L and followed a linear trend with the reciprocal nanowire length (1/L), confirming the Fabry-Perot cavity characteristics (Fig.  5H  and fig.  S25 ). 
 Discussion The method to manipulate the morphology of layered perovskites by introducing robust intermolecular interactions between organic spacers is distinctive to the special crystal structures of organic-inorganic hybrid materials and requires more comprehensive investigations. In our implementation, the COOH dimer was originally exploited to enforce 1D connectivity within the organic layer. Unexpectedly, this directionality was transferred to the assembled system. Through a thorough examination, the molecular templating effect was elucidated as aligning spacers using in-plane directional H bonds, which further drove the anisotropic surface termination of dangling COOH that protected these facets through robust H bonds with aqueous solvent molecules.  
 RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE Subsequently, balanced growth conditions and high-quality nanowires were achieved through subtle yet crucial manipulation over the alignment of H bonds with respect to growth direction. 2D perovskite nanowires based on BrCA3 incited a range of unusual optical properties. The intrinsic excitonic nature of layered halide perovskites enabled facile observation and control of polarized emission. These nanowires also revealed exceptional cavity qualities, which could be used as active waveguides with low propagation loss coefficients and to facilitate light amplification with low thresholds compared with other systems. Morphological control with directional supramolecular synthons proves to be a generally applicable strategy for various layered perovskite structures and diverse organic spacers. However, its merit extends to a broad range of organicinorganic hybrid materials. Particularly, the selection of functional groups and intermolecular interactions to be incorporated within the organic layer transcends far beyond COOH dimers and the H-bonding network. For example, p interactions (p-p, p-p, or s-p), electrostatic forces, and even chirality could also be readily implemented  (8) . Further explorations in this regard will introduce enhanced versatility in these hybrid layered materials as the nextgeneration semiconductors, where the collective benefits of conventional organic and inorganic counterparts readily converge.

Materials and Methods 
 Materials Lead bromide (PbBr2, 99.999% trace metals basis, #398853), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.999% trace metals basis, perovskite grade, #900168), tin iodide (SnI2, AnhydroBeads™, -10 mesh, 99.99% trace metals basis, #409308), hydrobromic acid (HBr, 48 wt.% in H2O), hydroiodic acid (HI, 57 wt.% in H2O), hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2, 50 wt.% in H2O) were purchased from Millipore Sigma. Methylammonium bromide (MABr, >99.99%, #SKU MS301000), Methylammonium iodide (MAI, >99.99%, #SKU MS101000) were purchased from Greatcell Solar Materials. Deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) and deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) were purchased from Millipore Sigma. Anhydrous solvents used in organic synthesis were purchased from Millipore Sigma. Precursors used are specified in the following sections. Perovskite single crystal growth for crystal structure determination and face indexing Bulk bromide perovskite single crystals were obtained through slow-cooling a solution composed of HBr, PbBr2, and organic ammonium salts. The iodide counterparts were obtained with PbI2 and the organic ammonium salts in HI and H3PO2 as solvents. MABr or MAI were added to obtain n>1 structures. Additionally, dimethylformamide (DMF) was added to assist the formation of (BrCA3)2MAPb2Br7 single crystals only. The detailed crystal growth parameters such as the ratio of solvents and the concentration of each precursor are specified in table  S1 . In detail, the precursors and solvents were mixed in a 2 mL scintillation vial (note, vials with rubber caps were used but those with Teflon caps were preferred. Vial size will affect the slowcooling performances due to the mild refluxing at high temperatures). After being tightly capped, the sample vial was heated carefully with a heat gun over 100 o C or on a 160-180 o C hotplate to induce mild refluxing of solvents until materials were completely dissolved and the solution was clear. This process was carried out with great caution in a fume hood with sash closed. Sonication was occasionally used to assist the dissolution of materials, but magnetic stirring was avoided. To avoid rapid precipitation upon placing the vial in a boiling water bath, the mixture was then stabilized on a 90 o C hotplate to ensure no precipitate was observed even with mild evaporation of solvents inside the vial and condensation thereafter. Then, the vial was transferred to and sealed in a Dewar flask containing boiling water, which was then stored at ambient conditions to allow slowcooling for 72-96 hours until the water bath reached room temperature. Crystals were stored in solution until being removed for structure determination and face indexing. 
 Perovskite nanowire growth Nanosized perovskite single crystals were grown with a variety of methods including floating growth and fast-cooling. In principle, fast nucleation accelerates the crystal growth to produce nanosized objects. The floating growth method additionally preserves the pristine crystal morphology and ensures crack-free transfer. The preparation methods of precursor solution were similar to those mentioned above for perovskite single crystal growth. The exact composition of solution varied in each scenario and is documented in table  S1 . Floating growth was used for n=1 [PbBr4] 2-, n=1 [PbI4] 2-, and n=2 bromide nanowires. The method accelerates the crystal growth at air-liquid interface and has been well-documented in  (13) . In detail, a clear and refluxing solution containing perovskite precursors was cooled to 70 o C and kept undisturbed until the temperature had stabilized, sometimes indicated by the formation and stabilization of precipitates. The exact temperature varies depending on the material composition, precursor concentration, etc., and should be optimized for other material systems and purposes. 1-3 µL of the supernatant were extracted with a 10 µL micropipette onto a glass substrate at ambient conditions in air. Nucleation and growth quickly initiated at the air-droplet interface. This process was monitored under an optical microscope (movies S1, S2, and fig.  S5 ). Nanocrystals grown with this method were then picked-up by gently touching the droplet surface with various substrates including TEM grids, silicon (Si), Si/silica (SiO2), or polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamps (from GelPak). Leftover solvents were gently absorbed with a piece of filter paper. Fast-cooling was used to synthesize n=1 [SnI4] 2-. This method was same as slow-cooling except that the cooling speed was accelerated to a few minutes. In detail, the clear and refluxing precursors solution was cooled to room temperature without external control and kept undisturbed until a precipitate formed. The precipitated crystals were then transferred to various substrates with similar methods as described before. For n>1 lead-iodide nanowires, regular slow-cooling was used as faster cooling reduced the phase purity. A summary of each crystal growth method is presented in table  S2 . Scaled-up synthesis and cleaning of nanowires Fast-cooling was employed for scaled-up synthesis, illustrated using (BrCA3)2PbBr4 (fig.  S7 ). After the crystals precipitated from HBr solutions, a large PDMS stamp was used to absorb large quantity of crystals, which were then released into ethyl acetate. The process was repeated multiple times. Hydrophobic nature of PDMS minimized absorption of mineral acid, but trace amount, including that absorbed on the crystals could be well mixed with ethyl acetate without phasesegregation, which effectively completes the cleaning. A simple touch with ethyl acetate would release all the crystals absorbed on PDMS. Ethyl acetate was chosen as the cleaning solvent to prevent etching and degradation of crystal morphology or emissive properties (tested with (BrCA3)2PbBr4, (FCA3)2PbBr4, and (TPA3)2PbBr4 over a course of at least 6 months when dispensed in ethyl acetate). Other more polar organic solvents tested (acetone and isopropanol) would significantly etch the crystals over time. Less polar solvents tested (hexane and ether) did not mix well with even trace amount of HBr and were unsuitable for cleaning. Crystals dispensed in ethyl acetate could be repeatedly cleaned with fresh ethyl acetate if necessary. Nanowires from the ethyl acetate suspension could be easily drop-casted onto various substrates, demonstrated in fig.  S7  with dense and uniform coverage. This method can be generalized to HI/H3PO2 system. 
 Epitaxial growth of perovskite nanowire heterostructures This method uses longitudinal epitaxial nanowire heterostructures with (BrCA3)2PbI4 core and (BrCA3)2PbBr4 shell as example. First, (BrCA3)2PbI4 nanowires were prepared on Si/SiO2 or PDMS substrates. (BrCA3)2PbBr4 shell was further grown with the floating growth method from a 70 o C droplet. In detail, the droplet was left cooled-down for a few seconds giving an oversaturated solution. A few particles might already crash out at the air-liquid interface. Then, the substrate with the core was placed upside-down to cover the shell droplet leading to immediate epitaxial growth of shell materials on the as-grown core. The substrate was then removed from the droplet and leftover solvent was absorbed gently with a filter paper. 
 Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction (SC-XRD) Single crystals of the investigated compounds were coated with a trace of Fomblin oil and were transferred to the goniometer head of a Bruker Quest diffractometer. Data for (TPA3)2PbI4, (TPA3)2PbBr4 (296 K), (BrCA3)2PbI4, (BrCA3)2SnI4 and (BrCA3)2PbBr4 (300&150 K) were collected on an instrument with a fixed chi angle, a Mo Kα wavelength (λ = 0.71073 Å) sealed tube fine focus X-ray tube, a single crystal curved graphite incident beam monochromator, and a Photon II area detector. Data for (BrCA3)2(MA)Pb2Br7, (TPA3)2PbBr4 (150 K) and (mCA1)2PbBr4 were collected on an instrument with kappa geometry, a Cu Kα wavelength (λ = 1.54178 Å) I-μ-S microsource X-ray tube, a laterally graded multilayer (Goebel) mirror for monochromatization, and a Photon III C14 area detector. Both instruments were equipped with an Oxford Cryosystems low temperature device and examination and data collection were performed at 150 K, except for (TPA3)2PbBr4 and (BrCA3)2PbBr4, which were measured at both 150 and 296 or 300 K, respectively. In particular, (BrCA3)2PbBr4 displayed a phase change between 150 and 300 K, and the crystal structure at 300 K was used for presentation materials. Data were collected, reflections were indexed and processed, and the files scaled and corrected for absorption using APEX4  (27)  and SADABS or TWINABS  (28) . The space groups were assigned using XPREP within the SHELXTL suite of programs  (29, 30)  and solved by dual methods using ShelXT  (31)  and refined by full matrix least squares against F 2 with all reflections using Shelxl2018 or Shelxl2019 (32) using the graphical interface Shelxle  (33) . Where not specified otherwise (table  S3 -11 and associated text) H atoms were handled as follows: H atoms attached to carbon and nitrogen atoms as well as hydroxyl hydrogens were positioned geometrically and constrained to ride on their parent atoms. C-H bond distances were constrained to 0.95 Å for aromatic and alkene C-H moieties, and to 0.99 and 0.98 Å for aliphatic CH2 and CH3 moieties, respectively. Methyl CH3, ammonium NH3 + and hydroxyl H atoms were allowed to rotate but not to tip to best fit the experimental electron density. Water H atom positions were refined, and O-H distances were restrained to 0.84(2) Å. Where necessary, water HH distances were restrained to 1.36(2) Å, and H atom positions were further restrained based on hydrogen bonding considerations. Uiso(H) values were set to a multiple of Ueq(C) with 1.5 for CH3, NH3 + and OH, and 1.2 for C-H and CH2 units, respectively. Additional data collection and refinement details, including description of disorder (where present) can be found in table  S3  to S11. Complete crystallographic data, in CIF format, have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC), with the deposition number 2292512-2292519, and 2295157.

 Face indexing of single crystals A suitable well-shaped single crystal representative of the bulk of each sample was selected using Carl Zeiss Discoery.V8 crystal microscope and mounted with the help of a trace of Fomblin oil on a MiTeGen micromesh mount (80 μm diameter mesh area with 15 μm openings). The mounted crystal was transferred to the goniometer head of the molybdenum wavelength Bruker Quest diffractometer described above (the same as used for data collection) precooled to the specified temperature. Data for unit cell determination were collected using APEX4 (27) (three times 12 frames with 0.5 frame width). After determination of a preliminary unit cell, the crystal was rotated around phi (360 rotation) and an image was collected every one degree. Full data were then collected, and the structure was determined to establish the standard unit cell, and this unit cell was then loaded by reimporting the result of the integration of all data. Then, using the Apex4 subroutine for face indexing, crystal faces with indices < 3 for h, k and l along the viewing direction of each image were identified, and the distance to the center of rotation was measured until all visible crystal faces were accounted for and the shape of the crystal determined from crystal faces did match the actual shape of the crystal. Results were used for absorption correction (for samples not twinned by non-merohedry) and to establish the shape and habit of crystals. 
 Steady state optical measurements All bright-field images were collected with a custom Olympus BX53 microscope equipped with a linear polarizer (U-AN360-3). All PL images were taken using an X-Cite Series 120 Q lamp as the excitation source. A coherent continuous wave OBIS 375 nm laser excitation source was used for PL spectrum measurements and selected-area excitation in waveguide study. The filter cube in the Olympus BX53 microscope contains a 330-385 nm bandpass filter for excitation. PL spectra were collected with a SpectraPro HRS-300 spectrometer. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to characterize the nanowires in fig.  S18  performed using a Zeiss 880 upright laser scanning microscope. Excitation wavelengths and band pass filters were specified in the figure caption. 
 Optically pumped lasing measurements Nanowires on Si/SiO2 were optically pumped with a 400 nm femtosecond beam generated with a Ti:Sapphire seed laser, an ultrafast amplifier (Spectra-Physics, Solstice Ace; 1 kHz, 100 fs, 800 nm, linear polarization), and second harmonic generation. An electronic shutter controlled the number of pulses per exposure, and a variable neutral-density optical attenuator was used to control the excitation power. The sample was mounted in a Ar-filled cryostat. Experiments were performed at 88 K. The cryostat was placed on an inverted microscope. The laser beam was defocused to cover the entire crystal under investigation. A 420 nm long pass dichroic mirror was used to eliminate collection of excitation light. Spectra were collected using a grating spectrometer (50 µm slit width, 1200 g/mm blaze holographic grating, and liquid-nitrogen-cooled Si CCD array detector). The sample exposure time varied between 200 ms and 2 s. The laser fluence was calculated based on the spot size measured under microscope and the average power determined using a calibrated power meter. 
 Emission polarization and data analysis Instead of analyzing PL spectra, PL images were collected with an emission polarizer and analyzed with ImageJ. In detail, a region of interest (ROI) unique to each nanowire was set to avoid analyzing the waveguided light at the edge which would complicate the results. The total ROI-specific intensity at each polarizer angle was calculated and used for data plots. The X-Cite Series 120 Q lamp was used as the excitation source to illuminate the entire crystal. Exposure time used to collect the PL images was same across one measurement set and was chosen carefully to avoid pixel saturation. Regarding the twisted nanowire in Fig.  4B , three ROIs were used to analyze the polarization at the top, middle, and the bottom of the crystal. 
 Waveguide loss coefficient measurement Waveguide losses were assessed according to the propagation-distance-dependent relative tip emission intensity collected and analyzed with far-field PL images and ImageJ. In detail, the 375 nm laser beam (⌀ ~15 nm) was focused at various positions on each nanowire and the distances from the focal point to the tip were calculated as light propagation distances (D). Exposure time used to collect the PL images was same across one measurement set and was chosen carefully so that both the tip and body emission (i.e., emission near the excitation spot) were below saturation. ROI was used to analyze the total intensity of tip and body emission. Each PL image was separated into red, green, and blue channels. Green channels were used to represent the material inherent waveguide loss while blue channel was affected by self-absorption, and red channel had low signal/noise ratio. Relative tip emission (𝐼 𝑡𝑖𝑝 /𝐼 𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦 ) was calculated and plotted against D. The data plot was fitted with the waveguide loss equation ( 𝐼 𝑡𝑖𝑝 𝐼 𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦 = 𝐴𝑒 -𝛼𝐷 ) to obtain the loss coefficient. 
 Morphology characterizations The Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) image and electron diffraction pattern were obtained on a 200 kV JEOL JEM-F200 field-emission microscope equipped with a CMOS camara (Gatan Rio16). 1500 mesh copper grids were used for TEM (Ted Pella #G1500HS). Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was conducted with an Asylum Cypher ES AFM under tapping mode using Ti/Pt coated silicon cantilevers (#AC240TM-R3). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was conducted with a Hitachi S-4800 Field Emission SEM or a FEI Nova NanoSEM Field Emission SEM. All SEM images in the main text were obtained from Hitachi, with a through the lens detector (TLD) and gun voltages of 5.0 kV (Fig.  2E , 3A, 3B, and 3F) or 10.0 kV (Fig.  2H  and Fig  3, C-E ). Fig.  2 , E-G were tilted 30 o . SEM instrument, detector, and gun voltages are specified in each figure caption in the supplementary materials here. 
 NMR NMR was acquired at room temperature with a Bruker Avance III HD 400MHz spectrometer equipped with a 2-channel Nanobay console and a 5mm BBFO Z-gradient SmartProbe, or Bruker NEO 500MHz equipped with prodigy liquid-nitrogen cooled cryoprobe with BBFO configuration. NMR spectra were analyzed with Mestrenova.

 Data presentation and visualization The program Mercury was used for crystal structure illustration in this article. AFM data were analyzed in the Gwyddion software. Bright field, PL, and SEM images were analyzed in ImageJ. Translations and rotations were executed when necessary. Brightness and contrast were adjusted when necessary to aid the presentation of fine details. The Blender software was used for 3D modeling in Fig.  2A  and Fig.  4B . b DMF is necessary for growing (BrCA3)2MAPb2Br7. Without DMF addition, slow-cooling resulted in either n=1 or 3D perovskites as majority. Other additives (ethanol, isopropanol) were screened as well, but did not result in formation of n=2 crystals. c Phase-pure n>1 iodide crystals were extremely difficult to obtain. Listed here are a few precursor solutions used. Slow-cooling typically gave a cloudy suspension of crystals with mixed phases. Toluene was identified as a suitable additive to drive the formation of phase-pure n=2 or n=3 iodide crystals. Other additives were screened: methanol, ethanol, isopropanol was unsuitable for our system which drove liquid phase separation; acetonitrile and acetone did not lead to phase separation, but did not drive the formation of n=2 or n=3 iodide species; chlorobenzene and 1,2dichlorobenzene could be used to replace toluene.  
 Synthesis of Organic Cations  NMR spectra are included at the end of the file. (mCA1-Br), 3-carboxyphenyl)methanaminium bromide The boc-protected amine, 3-(((tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)methyl)benzoic acid (from Ambeed, 1 mmol, 1 eq.) was added to a 4 mL vial. Then, 48% aqueous HBr solution (3 mL, excess) was added to cleave the boc protecting group and form the ammonium bromide in-situ. The mixture was stirred vigorously at 50 o C overnight, during which the heterogenous mixture gradually became a homogenous suspension. Water was added to obtain a clear solution, which was washed 3 times with dichloromethane. Then, the water phase was collected and concentrated. The product was recrystallized in water, filtered, and dried in vacuum at 60 o C to give a white solid. Yield: 47.0%.  BrCA3, TPA3, FCA3, and MeCA3 were synthesized according to the following general scheme. Scheme S1. Synthetic routes for BrCA3 TPA3, FCA3, and MeCA3. First step: attaching Boc-protected amine side chain to hydroxybenzoates Hydroxybenzoates (1.0 eq.), potassium carbonate (K2CO3, from Millipore Sigma, 2.0 eq.), and tert-butyl (2-bromoethyl)carbamate (from Millipore Sigma, 1.5-2.0 eq.) were added to roundbottom flask charged with a stir bar. After a brief purge with Ar, anhydrous acetonitrile (MeCN, 0.1-0.2 M) was added. After extensive purging with Ar, the suspension was stirred at 90-95 o C to induce refluxing of MeCN for 12-24 h. The reaction can be further accelerated by addition of cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, from Millipore Sigma, 0.5-1.0 eq.) or by replacing the solvent with anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) but without increasing the temperature. Water was added, and the crude product was extracted with dichloromethane, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated before been further purified with silica column chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetate). Product (boc-protected amine) and starting material (hydroxybenzoate) typically have similar Rf values and can be indistinguishable during column chromatography. Hence, considerable consumption of the starting material is crucial to obtain products with decent purity. However, a small amount of starting material in the final product can be further removed during the purification after converting the product to ammonium salts. The recipe for each compound is specified below. Second step: simultaneous amine deprotection, protonation, and benzoate de-esterification To a round-bottom flask charged with a stir bar was added the boc-protected amine from the previous reaction (1 mmol, 1 eq.), followed by anhydrous dioxane (10 mL, 0.1 M). After complete dissolution, 48% HBr (aq. 10 mmol, 10 eq.) was added. After extensive Ar purging, the solution was heated at 95 o C to induce mild refluxing of solvents for 12 h. Similarly, 57% aqueous HI was used to synthesize iodide salts. The reaction mixtures will gradually turn yellow for the bromides and black for iodides. Solvents were then completely removed from the solution through rotary evaporation, including water contained in HBr or HI. Then, the crude product was reprecipitated at least thrice by dissolution in acetone followed by addition of diethyl ether. The crude products usually have decent solubility in acetone for the iodine salts, but bromides are only poorly soluble. Thus, the crude bromide salts were extensively sonicated in acetone before addition of ether.  (TPA3-Br), 2-(2,5-dicarboxyphenoxy)ethan-1- 
 Supplementary Text 1. The molecular templating effects The molecular templating effect is widely explored in organic-inorganic hybrid materials and can be generally defined as using organic templates to control the properties of assembled systems  (34) . For instance, in metal-chalcogenides, topology and dimensionality of the crystal structures could be tuned using various organic mono-and di-amines. COOH-functionalized organic agents have been crucial to the design of various MOF structures. A subtle variation on the substitution site of benzenedicarboxylates could lead to extremely complex topologically aperiodic frameworks  (35) . Moreover, in biomineralization processes, organic additives can alter the surface tension of certain crystal facets via selective adsorption  (36)  and therefore inhibit the growth of these facets or even facilitate dissolution  (37) . Specific to our case, the molecular templating effect is expressed by aligning cations using inplane directional H-bonds, which further drives the anisotropic surface termination of dangling COOH that protected these facets through robust H-bonds with solvent molecules. Such effect aligns well with the surface energy theory used to explain anisotropic growth of crystal facets. As modeled with DFT (fig.  S11 ), the protection with dangling COOH significantly lowers the energy of nanowire side faces and facilitates 1D growth by coverage of high-energy end facets. Such a phenomenon is similar to polymer-assisted synthesis of Pb(Zr/Ti)O3 nanowires  (14) . Thus, the organic templating effect originates from internally aligned cations but is facilitated by external protection from solvent molecules. Such effects point to the importance of (#1) aqueous solvent that protects the COOH-abundant surfaces, and (#2) the angle between parallellyaligned cation chains and the 1D growth direction (i.e., the long axis -[110] in (BrCA3)2PbBr4 and [001] in (TPA3)2PbBr4). The latter aspect affects the relative abundance of dangling COOH on side v.s. end facets. #1 can be supported by the necessity of water in crystal growth (fig.  S10 ). The molecular templating effect heavily relies on the relative abundance of dangling COOH on side v.s. end facets. Accordingly, one would imagine that perfect 1D growth can be achieved when the H-bonded cations align exactly perpendicular with the long axis, leaving dangling COOH exclusively abundant at the side faces. Yet, this templating effect would be weakened when Hbonds and long axis deviate from perpendicular alignment. (TPA3)2PbBr4 and (BrCA3)2PbBr4 (structures can be found in Fig.  1 ) form a natural pair to support this hypothesis. While 1D crystals both grew along one zig-zag octahedron stacking direction, the crystal structure of TPA3 case presented the prefect case where H-bonds aligned perpendicular with the [001] growth direction. BrCA3 based structures, on the contrary, exhibited an angle of 63 o between their [110] growth direction and aligned cations. Consequently, the population of dangling COOH moieties at the end facets become non-negligible (detailed in fig.  S11 ). At the thermodynamic regime (bulk crystal synthesis, fig.  S12, D  and G ), this subtle difference resulted in a much larger mean aspect ratio observed within bulk single crystals of (TPA3)2PbBr4 (28.9) v.s. (BrCA3)2PbBr4 (2.79). When kinetic factors came into play with faster self-assembly, 1D growth was accelerated along the preferential axis and nanowires of (BrCA3)2PbBr4 exhibited a much higher mean aspect ratio of 22.0 (fig.  S6 ). However, the perfect H-bond alignment in (TPA3)2PbBr4 led to more defects and poor cavities with pointy ends which prevented their photonic applications, likely due to the relatively large lattice strain and extremely fast and uncontrollable growth kinetics. In this regard, (BrCA3)2PbBr4 with "partially broken 1D chains" and seemingly non-perfect H-bond alignment presented well-balanced crystal growth and high aspect-ratio nanowires with excellent cavities. As a summary, we presented fig.  S12  to pull the thread between crystal nucleation, molecular level understanding, nanowire morphology, and large bulk crystals.     The length-time relationship clearly deviated from linearity. In-situ monitoring did not initiate from the nucleation stage (except for movie S2). However, the growth rate was still much faster at the beginning stage when monitoring started. As growth proceeded, supply of precursors gradually decreased which was accompanied by a reduced growth rate. Growth at the later stage would become diffusion limited, giving a near-linear length-time relationship. To present the growth rate, we selectively fit the data points at the later stage of our monitoring where growth could be diffusion limited and length-time relationship appeared linear. According to the growth rate extracted here, the long axis exhibited much faster growth compared with the short axis by a factor of (A) 41, (B) 37, (C) 42, and (D) 46. The floating growth method was used for quantifying dimension of (BrCA3)2PbBr4 nanowires since it best preserved the pristine morphology of crystals grown. This method promotes extremely fast crystal growth (refer to fig.  S5  for a quantification on growth rate). Here, to demonstrate the advantage of this method in synthesizing narrow (w.r.t. width) and thin (w.r.t. height) nanowires, crystal growth was terminated within 10s of their nucleation. Over 600 crystals were quantified for l, w, l/w, and over 200 for h. Notably, even at such early termination, the mean aspect ratio of crystals synthesized was maintained at 22.0, while the smallest aspect ratio found was still 2.6. SEM specifics: FEI Nova; Everhart-Thornley detector (ETD); 5.0 kV; spot size 4.5; no tilting. 
 Fig. S7. Uniform surface coating with (BrCA3)2PbBr4 nanowires A large-area high resolution SEM map of nanowires of (BrCA3)2PbBr4, which was grown in mineral acid, cleaned with ethyl acetate, and drop-casted onto PDMS with a dense and uniform coverage.   
 Fig. S9. Face-indexing of (TPA3)2PbBr4 (A) A bulk crystal of (TPA3)2PbBr4 (monoclinic) face-indexed with SC-XRD exhibiting the "stacking plane" (100) as the major side face. (B) Cross-section view of the crystal structure at (100) plane reveals parallel alignment of H-bonding network with the [010] short axis. In other words, growth of nanowire (long axis) is clearly perpendicular to the alignment of H-bonds. Red shades mark the surface dangling COOH units, which only exist at the side faces. These results indicate that the surface dangling CA units, again, protects selected crystal faces and drives the 1D growth of nanowires. The solvent evaporation method was adopted from  (6) . All procedures were carried out in a N2filled glovebox. In detail, a ~0.5*0.5 cm Si/SiO2 substrate was placed in a 4 mL scintillation vial and 10 uL of the precursor solution (detailed above) was dropped onto the substrate. The vial was heated on a hotplate at 80 o C for 20 min. or at 90 o C for 10 min.    Due to the extreme sensitivity of layered halide perovskites to electron beam and the relatively high electron dose rate required during the HRTEM imaging process, the nanowire begins to bend at the moment the electron beam irradiates on it. This can be confirmed from the in-situ electron diffraction (Fig.  S14, B  and C ) that the intensity of diffraction spots changes from central symmetric to non-symmetric, and obvious change in the diffraction patterns occurred within less than 4 seconds. In this regard, nanowires of (BrCA3)2PbBr4 were more beam-sensitive than (TPA3)2PbBr4 and HRTEM trials all failed. The electron dose used for HRTEM imaging of electron beam-sensitive halide perovskite materials is generally around 10 eÅ -2 s -1 . However, even under the dose-rate of 7.54 eÅ -2 s -1 , a significant specimen-drift occurred within 1s after electron beam irradiates on the nanowire of (TPA3)2PbBr4 (Fig.  S14, D  and E ). This phenomenon is more pronounced in many of the unsuccessful trials. Therefore, the best HRTEM image (Fig.  S14A ) only showed one-dimensional lattice fringe from (TPA3)2PbBr4. Atomic-resolution image with two-dimensional lattice fringes has not been achieved yet due to severe drift issues along another direction.  (left) Integrated PL intensity over time. (right) morphological stability: bright field and PL images under each condition. Photostability was tracked under 385 nm UV excitation (Methods) at 0.033 mW/cm 2 . Note that physical damage was obvious on 2D sheets of (PEA)2SnI4 after UV excitation. For nanowires of (BrCA3)2SnI4, stability can be enhanced via additional protection with a 200 nm spin-coated poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Note that power density was increased to 0.20 mW/cm 2 after PMMA coating, yet still showing enhanced stability compared to without protection. emission collected with a 593 nm bandpass filter. Both bromide and iodide components can be excited at 405 nm, but their relative emission intensity near 593 nm varied from sample to sample. For instance, (Ciii) exhibits clear contrast between bromide and iodide sections due to the relatively dim emission intensity from iodide components and the more pronounced emission from the bromide shell. (iv) grey-scale PL images with 488 nm excitation and emission collected with a 520 nm bandpass filter. Only the excitation from the iodide components can be observed in this setting. (F) PL images of the same nanowire heterostructures after a month, showing a clearly preserved Br/I interface. Scale bars: 5 µm. Data obtained at room temperature. 
 Fig. S19. Optical and morphological properties of nanowires of (A) (FCA3)2PbBr4 and (B) (MeCA3)2PbBr4 Scale bars: 10 µm. Data obtained at room temperature.   The PL FWHM v.s. T curve (A) was fitted with the following function to extract the exciton phonon coupling constant assuming Bose-Einstein distribution of optical phonon: Γ = Γ 0 + Γ 𝑎𝑐 𝑇 + Γ 𝑜𝑝 * 1 𝑒 𝐸 𝑝ℎ /𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 -1 where Γ 0 is the inhomogenous boardening factor, Γ 𝑎𝑐 is the acoustic phonon coupling constant, Γ 𝑜𝑝 is the optical phonon coupling constant, 𝐸 𝑝ℎ is the phonon constant, and 𝑘 𝐵 is the Boltzmann constant. Optical phonon is usually dominant in 2D perovskites while the acoustic is negligible, and hence Γ 𝑎𝑐 was fixed at zero during fitting. Fitting resulted in a Γ 𝑜𝑝 of 1.5±0.2*10 2 and 1.9±0.3*10 2 meV for the two nanowires of (BrCA3)2SnI4 studied (dataset with the latter value was illustrated here). Fitting with aforementioned equation resulted in a Γ 𝑜𝑝 of 2.1±0.7*10 2 and 4.0±0.9*10 2 meV for the two nanowires of (BrCA3)2PbI4 studied (dataset with the former value was illustrated here). In our materials system, nanowires of (BrCA3)2PbI4 were not able to lase even with the help of its Fabry-Perot cavities, and efficient lasing was only observed in (BrCA3)2SnI4. Here, we directly compare the lead and tin derivatives with temperature (T) dependent PL and TRPL to unveil the photophysical origin of lasing performances. Results indicated a much higher exciton-phonon coupling in nanowires of (BrCA3)2PbI4 compared with (BrCA3)2SnI4 as the coupling constants were extracted from the PL FWHM v.s. T curve. This subsequently led to greater contribution of self-trapped excitons or in-gap defect states in the lead case, which exhibited a much pronounced broad and slow-emitting bands as temperature decreased.

 Supplementary Text 2. Computation Methods The geometry optimization and total energy calculations of both the bulk structure and the surface slabs were performed in Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)  (38) . The Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method was employed with a plane-wave basis set energy cutoff of 400 eV  (39) . The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) (40) exchange-correlation functional, a type of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional, was used. These calculations maintained a convergence criterion of 10 -5 eV for the total energy and 0.05 eV/Å on the residual force exerted on the structure. To create the surface slabs with orientations (1 ̅ 10), (1 ̅ 13), and (11 ̅ 3), a 2×1×1 supercell was used, while the (221 ̅ ) slab was structured using a 2×2×1 supercell-these variations in construction methods were necessitated by the differing periodicities. Each construction featured vacuum layers with a thickness of at least 15 Å normal to the cleaved surface. For the triclinic structures, (1 ̅ 13), and (11 ̅ 3), this distance could not be set exactly but the c-axis spacing was selected so that the closest pair of atoms were approximately 15 Å apart. In the case of the bulk structure, an 8×8×4 Γ-centered k-mesh was used for geometry optimization. Full atomic relaxation was performed during the geometry optimization of all four surface slabs, (1 ̅ 10), (221 ̅ ), (1 ̅ 13), and (11 ̅ 3), utilizing Γ-centered k-point grids with dimensions 5×4×1, 5×2×1, 5×2×1, and 5×2×1, respectively. 
 Surface Energy Calculation The surface energy was calculated as the sum of the bond cleavage and surface relaxation energies: 𝐸 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓 = 𝐸 𝑐𝑙 + 𝐸 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑥 Here, 𝐸 𝑐𝑙 is the bond cleaving energy, which is the energy associated with the loss of intermolecular interactions that occurs upon forming the desired surface from the bulk structure and, 𝐸 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑥 corresponds to the energy associated with the geometric relaxation of the surface relative to the bulk. This decomposition is standard in perovskite surface energy calculations  (41, 42) . Fig.  S26  exhibits the detailed surface construction procedure using the (1 ̅ 10) surface slab as an example, and fig.  S27  shows the initial conformation for the cleaving and relaxing surface slabs for all four orientations. In detail, 𝐸 𝑐𝑙 is mathematically defined as: 𝐸 𝑐𝑙 = 𝐸 𝑠𝑙𝑎𝑏 𝑢𝑛𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑥 -𝐸 𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘 -𝐸 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 2𝐴 Here, 𝐸 𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘 is the total energy of the bulk structure calculated as an integer number of unit cell energies of the energy of a fully relaxed unit cell, 𝐸 𝑠𝑙𝑎𝑏 𝑢𝑛𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑥 is the total energy of unrelaxed cleavage surface slab (fig.  S26A ), which is the supercell accommodated with a vacuum region exceeding 15 Å, A signifies the surface area of the cleaving surface, and 𝐸 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 is a correction based on the number of dangling hydrogen bonds. During this process, two non-identical surfaces are generated, with one having complete lead-bromide octahedrons (marked in red) and the other having bromide vacancies (marked in blue), both originating from the removal of the same set of bonds. Consequently, the bond cleaving energy is evenly distributed across both surfaces-hence, the division by two. Because the experimental structures are expected to be passivated by water, the cleavage energies were corrected using an estimate, 𝐸 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 , for the hydrogen-bond energy based on DFT. This estimate was obtained based on the energy difference between the hydrated and dehydrated versions of the cation in the geometry of the crystal. A gas-phase calculation was performed using the geometry of a single BrCA3 cation taken from the crystal structure and placing three water molecules with oxygens oriented toward the hydroxyl in random positions within 2 Å of the cation's hydroxyl oxygen. This gap between the water molecules and the ligand allowed them to reorient during the optimization to passivate the dangling hydrogen bond. The geometry optimization was performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level embedded in the Gaussian 16 software  (43)  with the BrCA3 cation frozen except for the -COOH functional group. The correction per dangling hydrogen bond, 𝐸 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 , was calculated as the energy difference between the optimized hydrated ligand (𝐸 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ) and the energy of each isolated species (𝐸 𝐵𝑟𝐶𝐴3 and 𝐸 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ) as shown below. 𝐸 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 = 𝐸 𝐵𝑟𝐶𝐴3 + 𝐸 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 -𝐸 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 This value was 3.20 eV as indicated in fig.  S11F . 𝐸 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑥 , or the surface relaxation energy, was calculated as 𝐸 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑥 = 𝐸 𝑠𝑙𝑎𝑏 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑥 -𝐸 𝑠𝑙𝑎𝑏 𝑢𝑛𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑥 2𝐴 where 𝐸 𝑠𝑙𝑎𝑏 𝑢𝑛𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑥 is the energy of the unrelaxed surface slab (fig.  S26B ), 𝐸 𝑠𝑙𝑎𝑏 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑥 is the energy of relaxed surface slab (fig.  S26C ), and A is the surface area of the slab. The factor of two in the denominator is because there are two surfaces in the surface slab. The relaxing surface slab is modified from the cleavage surface slab to make the two cleaved surfaces identical to each other so that the relaxation energy of the same surface is being calculated rather than an average over distinct surfaces. In our calculation, the cleaved surface with complete lead-bromide octahedrons (marked in red) is selected as the surface of interest, and the other having bromide vacancies is modified to form complete octahedrons.

Best results were obtained by treating twinning as pseudo-merohedral and application of the twin matrix 1 0 0.914 0 -1 0 0 0 -1. The BASF value refined to 0.358  (4) . Hydroxy H atoms were restrained to be coplanar with the carboxylic acid C and O atoms.  
 Refinement details The structure emulates a double the volume C or A centered orthorhombic cell and is twinned by that symmetry (180 rotation around reciprocal a-axis). Application of the twin transformation axis 101 0-10 00-1 yielded a BASF value of 0.5031(4), indicating close to perfect twinning.  
 Refinement details The structure exhibits pseudo translations (pseudo-C-centering). Exact translational symmetry is broken by modulation of the bromide ions and ammonium groups, by disorder of one of the cations, and by presence of a water molecule. Water H atom positions were refined and O-H and HH distances were restrained to 0.84(2) and 1.36(2) Å, respectively. The position of H1B_1 was further restrained based on hydrogen bonding considerations. Carboxylate H atoms were placed in calculated positions, torsion angles were allowed to refine, but H atoms were restrained to be coplanar with the carboxylate groups.  
 Refinement details The structure exhibits pseudo translations (pseudo-Centering). Exact translational symmetry is broken by modulation of the bromide ions and ammonium groups, by disorder of one of the cations, and by presence of a water molecule. One of the bromide ions and one of the cations are jointly disordered by different folding of the ethyl ammonium group. This disorder extends to the entire cation and one of the bromides the ammonium is H-bonded to. The two disordered cation moieties were restrained to have similar geometries. The carboxylate group was excluded from the disorder. Uij components of ADPs for disordered atoms closer to each other than 2.0 Å were restrained to be similar. Subject to these conditions the occupancy ratio refined to 0.870  (7)  to 0.130  (7) . Water H atom positions were refined and O-H and HH distances were restrained to 0.84(2) and 1.36(2) Å, respectively. The position of H1B_1 was further restrained based on hydrogen bonding considerations. Carboxylate H atoms were placed in calculated positions, torsion angles were allowed to refine, but H atoms were restrained to be coplanar with the carboxylate groups. Refinement details A partially occupied water molecule induces disorder for one ethyl ammonium fragment. The disorder extends into the adjacent bromophenyl moiety. The two disordered moieties were restrained to have similar geometries as the equivalent fragment of the other not disordered cation. The atoms C7 and C7B were constrained to be planar. Uij components of ADPs for disordered atoms closer to each other than 2.0 Å were restrained to be similar. Equivalent C atoms of the phenyl ring from the two moieties were constrained to have identical ADPs. Water H atom positions were refined and O-H and HH distances were restrained to 0.84(2) and 1.36(2) Angstrom, respectively. H4B of the water molecule was further restrained based on hydrogen bonding considerations. Subject to these conditions the occupancy ratio refined to 0.567(6) to 0.433  (6)  in favor of water being present.  
 Refinement details The structure exhibits metrically orthorhombic dimensions and is twinned by this symmetry. Application of the twin matrix -1 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 1 resulted in a twin ratio of 0.638(2) to 0.362  (2) . The structure exbibits pseudo-translation by half a unit cell along the a-axis. Exact translational symmetry is broken by a 2-fold rotation of the outer organic cations (swapping the positions of the bromine atom and carboxylate groups and the position of the O-CH2-CH2-NH3 group) and by slight modulation of the bromide atoms of the Pb-Br layers. A half-occupied water molecule is present in the structure. Its presence or absence induces disorder for the adjacent ethyl ammonium fragments of the outer organic cations and disorder was refined with one common occupancy ratio. The disordered moieties were restrained to have similar geometries. The carboxylate H atoms were restrained to be coplanar with the COO groups. Uij components of ADPs for all atoms of the outer organic cations closer to each other than 2.0 Å were restrained to be similar. Water H atom positions were initially refined while a damping factor was applied and O-H and HH distances were restrained to 0.84(2) and 1.36(2) Å, respectively. In the final refinement cycles the water H atoms were constrained to ride on the position of the oxygen atom and the damping factor was removed. Subject to these conditions the occupancy ratio refined to 0.501  (15)  to 0.499  (15) , indicating systematic ordering of the water molecule position and exact half occupancy (no resolved superlattice reflections are present in the diffraction pattern). All bromine atoms of the Pb-Br layer other than Br3 were refined as disordered. The disorder of the Br atoms is correlated and a common occupancy ratio was used. The occupancy ratio refined to 0.510  (16)  to 0.490  (16) , indicating again the possibility of ordering with exact half occupancy within each layer. The methyl ammonium cations are extensively disordered by close to free rotation. The disorder was approximated by refining two-fold disorder. The C-N bond distances were restrained to be similar to each other. H atoms were initially refined as a free rotor (AFIX 137) while a damping factor was applied. In the final refinement cycles the H atoms were constrained to ride on the position of the N or C atoms and the damping factor was removed. Subject to these conditions the occupancy ratio refined to 0.52(3) to 0.48(3). Fig. S1 . S1 Overall abundance of 1D crystals of (TPA3)2PbBr4 under SEM and in suspension . Fig. S2.

Distinct surface dangling COOH on (𝟏 ̅ 𝟏𝟎) vs (𝟐𝟐𝟏 ̅ ) surface and surface energy calculations (A) 2D side view of a representative (1 ̅ 10) surface slab consisting of two organic layers sandwiched by three inorganic slabs. Surface cations expose COOH or Br end groups in an alternating fashion. (B) 3D view of (1 ̅ 10) surface further reveals nearly "stand up" cations, leading to uniform and dense coverage with dangling COOH. After water passivation, the (1 ̅ 10) surface is well protected from incoming species in the solution. (C) The (221 ̅ ) surface, in drastic contrast, exhibited alternating Br or COOH terminated sections. (D) 3D surface view reveals "lying down" cations due to the 63 o alignment of COOH dimer with the nanowire long axis (Fig. 2A and fig. S8). Overall, the (221 ̅ ) surface has a much-reduced surface coverage with dangling COOH and cannot be well-protected even after water passivation. The (1 ̅ 10) and (221 ̅ ) surfaces shown in (B) and (D) have similar cross-section areas of 1270 and 1431 Å 2 , respectively. Thus, illustration here presents a valid qualitative comparison of dangling COOH density. (E) COOH density at each surface is calculated, where the (221 ̅ ) plane exhibits near-half COOH density compared to (1 ̅ 10). (F) Optimized structure of BrCA3 + H-bonded to three water molecules with a passivation energy of 3.20 eV. (G) Calculated surface energy of representative faces. Surface energy was dramatically reduced when passivated with water, leaving (221 ̅ ) the high-energy surface to drive the 1D growth.
