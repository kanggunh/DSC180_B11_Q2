Title: Color Tuning in Cesium Lead Halide Nanocrystals via A-site Substitution as an Alternative Method for Achieving Spectrally Stable Blue Perovskite Nanocrystal Lightemitting Diodes

Supplementary Note 1: Estimation of radiative and non-radiation recombination rates. The total exciton decay lifetime was determined through the tri-exponential fitting of time-resolved PL traces. The tri-exponential function: (Equation S1) 𝑃𝐿(𝑡) = Σ 3 𝑖 = 1 𝑎 𝑖 𝑒 -𝑡/𝜏 𝑖 used for fitting is the minimal sum of exponentials provided the satisfying level of fit quality. We assume the multiexponential PL decay profile reflects the different trap densities in the nanocrystals in the measured ensemble and can be understood as follows. The τ i component corresponds to an effective lifetime of the a i fraction of the entire ensemble (thus, ). In this regard, we can further assume all measured Σ 3 𝑖 = 1 𝑎 𝑖 = 1 nanocrystals have the same radiative recombination constant k r (related to intrinsic radiative lifetime, τ r , as k r = 1/ τ r ) and different non-radiative recombination constant k nr depending on the trap density in a given sub-ensemble of nanocrystals. Thus, weighting the fraction of the individual sub-ensemble lifetimes through a i , the average PL lifetime (< >) of the ensemble can be estimated via amplitude averaging  [12] [13] [14]  of the 𝜏 sub-ensemble lifetimes as . (Equation S2) 〈𝜏〉 = ∫ ∞ 0 𝐼 𝑇𝑅𝑃𝐿 (𝑡)𝑑𝑡 𝐼 𝑇𝑅𝑃𝐿 (𝑡 = 0) = ∑ 𝑛 𝑖 = 1 𝑎 𝑖 𝜏 𝑖 ∑ 𝑛 𝑖 = 1 𝑎 𝑖 Since the PLQY is the ratio of radiative to total recombination rate, the radiative and apparent non-radiative lifetimes can be determined as and ., 𝜏 𝑟 = 〈𝜏〉 𝑃𝐿𝑄𝑌 𝜏 𝑛𝑟 = 〈𝜏〉 1 -𝑃𝐿𝑄𝑌 correspondingly. Hence, the radiative and non-radiative rates are expressed as (Equation  S3 ) 𝑘 𝑟 = 𝑃𝐿𝑄𝑌 〈𝜏〉 (Equation S4) 𝑘 𝑛𝑟 = 1 〈𝜏〉 - 𝑃𝐿𝑄𝑌 〈𝜏〉 The composition-dependent lifetimes for each sub-ensemble, their relative fraction, and averaged lifetimes are listed in Table  S5 , while radiative and non-radiative rates are listed in Table  S6 .       0% Rb + OTAc @ 4.5 mA/cm 2 25% Rb + OTAc @ 4.5 mA/cm 2 50% Rb + OTAc @ 4.5 mA/cm 2 67.5% Rb + OTAc @ 4.3 mA/cm 2 L/L0 (a.u.)

Title: Color Tuning in Cesium Lead Halide Nanocrystals via A-Site Substitution as an Alternative Method for Achieving Spectrally Stable Blue Perovskite Nanocrystal Light-Emitting Diodes
Blue-emitting lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) continue to exhibit unstable emission spectra, resulting from halide migration effects that hinder the performance of blue NC light-emitting diodes (NC-LEDs). One method to avoid halide mixing while still attaining deeper blue emission with improved stability is to incorporate rubidium into the mixture of A-site ions. Here, we explore the impact of varying the amount of rubidium doping in lead halide perovskite NCs. Our findings indicate that the rubidium-doping ratio influences the number of defects in the perovskite NCs, ultimately affecting the degree of blue shift we observe and the resulting performance of the NC-LEDs. Additionally, this study presents a modified room-temperature, open-air synthesis of sky-blue perovskite Cs x Rb 1-x PbBr 3 NCs with 0 to 45% Rb-alloying. The synthesized NCs have sizes ranging from 13.0 to 15.6 nm, and their emission can be adjusted from 515 to 496 nm with an observed full width at half-maximum of between 19 and 26 nm. These NCs also demonstrate a high photoluminescence quantum yield ranging from 94.5 to 69.7%. The NC-LEDs fabricated from these NCs showed stable spectra, a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.0% with a peak luminescence of 32,300 cd/m 2 at 508 nm for green emission, and a maximum EQE of 5.9% with a peak luminescence of 21,700 cd/m 2 at 496 nm for sky-blue emission. These results highlight the potential of Rballoying lead halide perovskite NCs for developing efficient and spectrally stable blue perovskite NC-LEDs.
■ INTRODUCTION Inorganic lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) such as APbX 3 (A is a monovalent cation; X is Cl -, Br -, or I -) have recently gained attention as the active layer in optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and solar cells.  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  Their remarkable properties include high color purity, tunable color, high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), solution processability, and flexibility. While green and red perovskite NC-LEDs have reportedly achieved external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) over 20% in recent years,  [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]  blue perovskite NC-LEDs are still lagging due to the large bandgap in the blue perovskite NCs, which hinders charge injection and experiences reduced radiative recombination due to interband traps. Thus, finding materials with better optical properties and device performance remains an important goal for the NC-LED community. There are two primary strategies to synthesize blue-emitting perovskite NCs for LEDs. The first strategy is to prepare CsPb(Br/Cl) 3 mixed-halide perovskites by incorporating chlorine into bromide perovskite NCs.  11  Zeng's group reported the first blue mixed-halide perovskite NC-LEDs with an EQE of 0.07% in 2015.  12  However, mixed-halide perovskite NC-LEDs are likely to experience serious halide migration effects and unstable electroluminescence (EL) spectra.  13  The second strategy is to achieve blue emission from highly quantum-confined CsPbBr 3 quantum dots using very small NCs.  3  Recently, a high-efficiency pure blue (465 nm) halide perovskite QD-LED with an EQE of 10% was reportedly produced using an in situ synthesis method.  14  Nevertheless, colloidal quantum-confined CsPbBr 3 quantum dots generally require complex synthesis and separation methods and a large amount of insulating organic ligands such as oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) that may hinder the performance of the resulting LEDs.  [15] [16] [17]  Additionally, size control for such samples can be challenging to achieve, and the sizes must remain stable during processing. A third, infrequently explored strategy to tune pure bromide perovskite NCs from green to blue is changing the A-site cations from the larger Cs + cations to smaller Rb + cations. This color tuning mechanism is well-understood via previously reported NC samples.  [18] [19] [20] [21] [22]  Despite the favorable optical properties of the previously reported Rb-alloyed NCs in the solution phase, the NC thin film requires further enhancements to facilitate better device fabrication. Consequently, as of now, there have been no efficient Rb-alloyed all-inorganic perovskite NC-LEDs that have been reported. Here, we report a facile synthesis method for Rb-alloyed colloidal all-inorganic perovskite NCs under ambient conditions with a large percentage of incorporated Rb. By adding smaller A-site cations into the perovskite NCs, we can tune the photoluminescence (PL) emission peak of the NC samples without mixed halides or achieving very small NCs.  23  We successfully replaced up to 43% of the Cs + cations with Rb + cations in order to tune the emission peak from green (515 nm) to sky-blue (494 nm) with an excellent PLQY of 70% in solution and 56% in the sky-blue thin film. Moreover, we successfully used the NCs as the active layer for fabricating LEDs. The devices reported here achieved a maximum EQE of 11.0% at an EL wavelength of 508 nm and a maximum luminescence of 32,300 cd/m 2 for NCs with 20% Rb-alloying. We can also achieve a maximum EQE of 5.9% at a sky-blue peak EL wavelength of 496 nm with a maximum luminescence of 21,700 cd/m 2 for NCs with 40% Rb-alloying. We found that different alloying ratios of Rb contributed to varying quantities of defects in the lead halide perovskite NCs, thus altering the blue shift of the sample PL and the efficiency of the NC-LEDs. A similar effect can also be observed in Cs 1-x Rb x Pb(Br/Cl) 3 NCs, which were used to achieve pure to deep blue (<470 nm) NC-LEDs, albeit with halide mixing effects. 
 ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structural and Optoelectronic Properties of Cs 1-x Rb x PbBr 3 NCs. We synthesized the Cs 1-x Rb x PbBr 3 perovskite NCs via modification of a previously reported room-temperature injection method in an ambient environment.  24  Varying quantities of Rb + precursors were added into the Cs + precursor solution to form the A-site cation precursor solution, as shown in Figure  1a . In the synthesis, tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB) and didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) were used as ligands. Ammonium ligands were fully protonated, which can prevent the proton exchange from OA to OAm in the traditional hotinjection method and increase stability.  24, 25  Moreover, excess bromide salts provided a Br --rich environment during the reaction, which can prevent the defect of halide vacancy formation in NCs.  26  The experimental details are illustrated in Supporting Information and Figure  S1 . After the synthesis, we determined the elemental composition of the NC sample by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) (Table  S1 ). Here, we defined x = [Rb]/([Rb] + [Cs]), where x represents the rubidium to cesium ratio in the Rb-alloyed samples. During synthesis, we replaced 25, 50, 67.5, and 75% cesium octanoate (Cs + OTAc) with rubidium octanoate (Rb + OTAc) and obtained 20, 33, 40, and 43% of Rb incorporated into the NCs, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Figure  1b ) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, Figure  1c ) were performed for structural characterization of NCs. The TEM images show that all the samples were monodispersed, with a mainly cubic perovskite structure, as shown in Figure  1b . The size distribution histograms exhibited a negligible size deviation in NCs with the average size (as measured by the length of one side) equal to 13.0 ± 2.6, 13.5 ± 2.3, 15.6 ± 3.6, 14.0 ± 3.0, and 15.2 ± 3.1 nm for 0, 20, 33, 40, and 43% rubidium incorporated, respectively (Figure  S5 ). All the samples showed diffraction peaks, as shown in Figure  1c , at 15.0, 21.0, 31.0, and 34.0°corresponding to the (100), (110), (200), and (210) planes, respectively, which are attributed to the cubic perovskite structure. For the Rb-alloyed samples, the diffraction peaks for the (100), (110), and (200) planes were shifted to larger diffraction angles, indicating a lattice contraction caused by the incorporation of a smaller cation into the NCs.  18  The peaks shifted further when more rubidium was alloyed into the NCs. The PL spectra, also shown in Figure  1a , show the emission peaks shifting from 515 to 494 nm once the Rb + cation concentration increases from 0 to 43%. The tilting distortion of the octahedral crystal structure and the enlargement of the perovskite NC bandgap due to the substitution of a smaller Rb + to a bigger Cs + cation are also shown as a diagram in Figure  1a .  [19] [20] [21]  However, we observed that a further increase in the amount of the Rb + precursor does not seem to contribute to further shifting of the PL peak or any further changes in the XRD pattern (Figure  1c ). This indicates that the amount of Rb + cation incorporation at room temperature is limited, with ∼43% being the maximum concentration of Rb observed in the NC samples that we produced. The PL shift with increasing Rb + cations is accompanied by the fundamental first absorption peak shifting from 505 to 457 nm, as evident in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra, also shown in Figure  1a . The PL excitation (PLE, Figure  S2 ) spectra also exhibit the same blue shift, consistent with the UV-vis spectra. However, the PLQY of the NC solution samples decreases from 95 to 70%, inversely proportional to the amount of Rb-alloying from 0 to 43%, as shown in Table  1 . This shift in PLQY suggests that at high Rb concentrations, some destabilization of the crystal structure or surface states occurs, which increases the number of defect sites. The Tauc plot in Figure  1a (inset)  shows the bandgap energy increasing from 2.38 to 2.57 eV with an increasing amount of the Rb + cation from 0 to 43%.  27  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed to further study the band structures of the NC samples. The XPS peaks are consistent with the chemical compositions of the samples. The XPS spectrum shows the Rb 3d 3/2 (112.2 eV) and Rb 3d 5/2 (110.7 eV) signals in all the Rb-alloyed NCs (Figure  S6 ). The increase in intensity along with the increasing amount of Rb confirms the incorporation of Rb into the NCs. Inversely, the intensities of Cs 3d 3/2 (738.8 eV) and Cs 3d 5/2 (724.9 eV) signals in XPS decrease with increasing Rb, indicating that Rb successfully replaces Cs. Moreover, there are no noticeable reductions in Pb 4f and Br 3d signal intensity, indicating that Rb does not replace the Pb 2+ cation. Furthermore, there is an increase of the binding energy in Cs 3d, Pb 4f, and Br 3d signals when Rb + cations are incorporated because of the smaller electronegativity of Rb.  28  Henceforth, the binding energy of Cs to Pb and Br has differed from the original, indicating distortion of the cubic perovskite NC structure attributed to the introduction of Rb + cations. The UPS spectra show that the cutoff shifts to higher binding energy in both the valence region and cutoff, indicating that adding more Rb + cations would lower the valence bands of perovskite NCs (Figure  S7 ). Cs 1-x Rb x PbBr 3 NC-LEDs Performance. To fabricate LEDs using the NCs as the active layer, a poly (3,4ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) electrode and poly(N,N′-bis-4-butylphenyl-N,N′-bisphenyl)benzidine (poly-TPD) hole-transporting layer (HTL) were fabricated by spin-casting, and a 2,2,2-(1,3,5-benzinetryl)tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBi) electron-transporting layer (ETL) was formed by thermal evaporation. The resulting standard, relatively optimized, device architecture (Figure  S8f ) of the NC-LED was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/poly-TPD (5 mg/mL)/perovskite NCs (30 mg/mL)/TPBi (30 nm)/LiF (0.8 nm)/Al (100 nm), and this was used to test the NC samples with varying Rb concentrations. The band diagram in Figure  2a  shows the energy levels of each layer.  29  The band energy levels for the NCs are calculated using the UPS and Tauc plot data. We obtained the energy levels of HOMO from the formula E HOMO = (E cutoff -E vbm ) + E 0 ,  30  where E 0 is the He(I) energy, E cutoff is the cutoff energy, and E vbm is the valence band maximum. By coupling this with the calculated bandgap energy (E g ) from the Tauc plots in Figure  1a , we can obtain the energy levels of LUMO, where E LUMO = E HOMO + E g . The detailed values are summarized in Table  S2 . The J-V-L and EQE-J-μ plots are shown in Figure  2c, d , respectively, and details of the device performances are summarized in Table  2 . The EL peaks show decreasing peak wavelengths from 518 to 496 nm with a narrow full width at half-maximum (fwhm) from 20 to 28 nm, respectively, under increasing Rb-alloying from 0 to 43% (incorporated). This shift in the EL matches the changes in the PL of the NC samples (Figure  2b ), and the CIE coordinates are plotted in Figure  5e . The control sample (0% Rb-alloyed) NC-LEDs achieved a maximum EQE of 6.4% at a green EL of 518 nm with a narrow fwhm of 21 nm. At a turn-on voltage of 1.9 V, a maximum luminescence of 22,100 cd/m 2 and a maximum current efficiency of 16.3 cd/A were achieved with this sample. The highest maximum EQE of 11.0% is achieved using 20% Rb-alloyed NC-LEDs with a blue-green EL of 508 nm, a narrow fwhm of 20 nm, a turn-on voltage of 2.4 V, a maximum luminescence of 32,300 cd/m 2 , and a maximum current efficiency of 29.0 cd/A. Furthermore, the 40% Rb-alloyed NC-LED demonstrated a sky-blue EL at 496 nm with a narrow fwhm of 24 nm and a maximum EQE value of 5.9% with a low turn-on voltage of 2.1 V, a maximum luminescence of 21,700 cd/m 2 , and a maximum current efficiency of 19.9 cd/A. All the NC-LEDs show stable EL spectra from 3 to 7 V because no halide migration is able to occur in these pure bromide NCs (Figure  S8a-e ). The NC-LED lifetimes for all the samples (Figure  S10 ) were measured under humid ambient conditions without packaging and are typical for this type of device architecture.  8, 31  We also conducted supplementary characterization on the NC active layer films to better understand the mechanism behind why the device performance changes with Rb content. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness (R q ) of the NC films is 1.3-3.3 nm (Figure S9 and Table  S3 ), indicating that smooth active layers were formed in the devices, as is required for efficient LEDs. The PL spectra of the NC films in Figure  3a  show the emission peak shifting from 515 to 494 nm with a narrow fwhm of 25 to 21 nm when the content of Rb increases from 0 to 43%, which is consistent with the PL of the NCs in solution (Figure  1a ). However, the highest PLQY of 83% is observed in the 20% Rb-alloyed NC film, while the 0% Rb-alloyed NC film has a lower PLQY of 64%. Contrary to expectations, the PLQY then decreased from 77 to 47% when the amount of Rb gradually increased from 33 to 43%. To further understand the relationship between PLQY and the alloying ratio, we performed a time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurement on the perovskite NC films, as shown in Figure  3b . The average PL decay time was extracted from the data using a triexponential fit (Figure  S11 ). The fitted parameters can be ascribed to short-lived lifetime (τ 1 ), middle-lived lifetime (τ 2 ), and longlived lifetime (τ 3 ) components  32  (a detailed description of the fitting is given in the Supporting Information in Supplementary Note 1 with detailed TRPL parameters summarized in Table  S5 ). We have found that the average lifetime (τ avg ) increases when the content of Rb increases from 0 to 43% (eq S2). To further analyze the PL lifetime, we calculated the radiative (k r ) and nonradiative transition rates (k nr ) using the relationship between lifetime and the PLQY of the NC films (eqs S3 and S4). Table  S5  shows a similar order of magnitude for ⟨τ⟩ and the i = 2 subensemble. These data suggest that roughly a third of the pristine samples are almost defect-free, assuming that defects account for the fast (nonradiative) recombination. Correspondingly, the fastest decay of the i = 1 subensemble may be attributed to particles with a high density of shallow traps (presumably due to surface defects) causing fast trapping of the photoexcited carriers.  33  The longest decaying subensemble is related to particles with deep traps dominating the recombination.  33, 34  In contrast to other reports on pristine  [33] [34] [35]  and alloyed 36-38 perovskites, wherein the same approach has been used for recombination rate estimations, we observe a gradual increase of ⟨τ⟩ and nongradual change of the PLQY and ultimately k r with the increase of the Rb concentration. At 20% Rb-alloying, the PLQY reaches its maximum, accompanied by a noticeable rise in k r and a significant drop in k nr . Together with that, a relative fraction of the i = 1 subensemble drops, while the fraction of the other subensembles rises. The drop of fraction i = 1 and rise of fraction i = 2 suggest the possibility of a Cs +related defect passivation with Rb + . The decrease in fast recombination due to shallow defects corresponds to a greater likelihood of recombination by the middle-and long-lived mechanisms. The bandgap increase, with higher Rb content, is due to the lattice contraction that shifts the conduction band minima toward higher energies. At very high Rb concentrations, it is possible that this activates deeper traps previously in the conduction band,  33  making them more probable as a long-lived recombination (nonradiative or delayed) pathway. As a result, the effective radiative lifetime rises. Therefore, the  PLQY peaks at moderate Rb content and then falls again as the crystal structure shows less tolerance for further increases of Rb. Regarding the increase of radiative recombination rate at the lowest Rb concentrations, a plausible reason might be the local distortion of the crystal lattice.  35  The local distortion of the perovskite lattice induced by Rb + cations (20% Rb is equivalent to the majority of the unit cells in the lattice having at least one Rb + cation) breaks the periodicity of the NC lattice. As a result, the electron-hole overlap of the exciton increases in the vicinity of the Rb + cation, increasing the radiative decay probability. However, a further rise in the doping level excessively distorts the lattice. It increases the probability of nonradiative recombination due to lattice defects, while the gradual increase in bandgap activates additional deep traps previously located within the conduction band. The rise of the radiative recombination rate due to Cs +related defect passivation cannot overcome the growing likelihood of these deep trap-induced nonradiative events due to the increase of lattice distortion/bandgap, resulting in a decrease in PLQY. Since higher k r and suppressed k nr lead to higher PLQY, one can see that the PLQY trend is consistent with the trend of the EQE in these NC-LEDs. We also measured space-charge-limited current (SCLC) to study the defect state and carrier balance for NC-LEDs.  39  We investigated the J-V curves of the hole-only devices with the device architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/poly-TPD (5 mg/mL)/ perovskite NCs/MoO 3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm) and the electron-only devices with the device architecture ITO/ ZnO/perovskite NCs/TPBi (30 nm)/LiF (0.8 nm)/Al (100 nm). The defect states were studied by trap density extraction from the fitting of J-V curves on a log-log scale, as shown in where ε 0 the vacuum permittivity, ε is the relative dielectric constant of NCs, V TFL is the trap-filled voltage, e is the elementary electronic charge, and L is the thickness of NCs films. Assuming 2 ε = 4.9, the hole (electron) trap densities were estimated to be 7.7 × 10 16 cm -3 (1.2 × 10 17 cm -3 ) for the pristine sample and gradually rising from 7.1 × 10 16 cm -3 (1.1 × 10 17 cm -3 ) to 9.2 × 10 16 cm -3 (1.7 × 10 17 cm -3 ) with the Rb + concentration increasing from 33 to 43% (Table  S7 ). The hole and electron trap density minima (5.0 × 10 16 cm -3 for hole; 9.6 × 10 16 cm -3 for electron) at 20% Rb-alloying result in the highest maximum EQE. Due to the fact that 33% Rballoying can also reduce the hole and electron trap densities, the maximum EQE would still be higher than the control LED. In addition, 42 and 45% Rb incorporation increase the hole and electron trap densities, and thus, the maximum EQE values are lower than that of the control LED. These defects are attributed to the defects generated by lattice distortion at high Rb content, as seen also in the lifetime fitting analysis. Carrier mobility can also be estimated by fitting the SCLC curve to the Child's law equation  37, 42   = J V L 9 8 0 2 3 ( 2 ) where J is the current density, V is the applied voltage, L is the thickness of the active layer, μ is the carrier mobility, ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, and ε is the relative dielectric constant of the NCs. As shown in Table  S7 , the initial hole (electron) mobilities of 6.0 × 10 -5 (3.6 × 10 -8 ) cm 2 V -1 s -1 for the pristine sample rose for the 20 and 33% Rb-alloying, followed by a drastic reduction for higher Rb concentrations. The Fermi level for the 20 and 33% Rb-alloyed NCs has shifted to the middle of the bandgap because of higher hole mobility and electron mobility,  28, 43  contributing to a higher maximum EQE. 
 Rubidium and Chlorine Mixed Cs 1-x Rb x Pb(Br/Cl) 3 Perovskite NC-LEDs. Rb + cation-and Cl -anion-alloyed perovskite NC-LEDs were synthesized to tune emission further toward the pure blue range, as shown in Figure  4a . The NCs were synthesized by replacing 0.33 mol of PbBr 2 with PbCl 2 in a mixed halide Pb 2+ solution. To synthesize the NCs, 1 mL of the A-site precursor (Cs + OTAc:Rb + OTAc = 1:0, 0.75:0.25, 0.5:0.5, and 0.325:0.675) was then mixed and injected into the Pb 2+ solution. The optical properties of these deep blue perovskite NCs are summarized in Table  S8 . The TEM images show NCs that are monodispersed and exhibit a cubic structure similar to that of pure bromide, as shown in Figure  4b . The element analysis by XPS for 50% Rb + OTAc samples shows that the 39% Rb + cation was alloyed into the NCs, consistent with the pure bromide NCs (Table  S10 ). We also used these NCs as active layers for NC-LED fabrication with the same device structure. The device performance is summarized in Figure  S14  and Table  S11 . We observed that with 25% Rb + OTAc replacement, the maximum EQE has been moderately enhanced from 1.4 to 1.6% (Figure  S14b ), despite the EL shifting from 475 to 469 nm, as shown in Figure  5a, b . This is due to decreasing the trap density by Rb-alloying and is consistent with the results observed in the pure bromide NC-LEDs. With more Rb + OTAc replacement, the EL can be tuned to the deep blue region (<470 nm), as shown in Figure  5c, d . It is noteworthy that all the NC-LEDs maintained their spectral stability during operation, despite the halide mixing, and that ion migration appeared suppressed by the introduction of moderate amounts of Rb-alloying, as has been noted in previous experiments on Rb-alloying.  44  The CIE coordinates of the EL of the mixed halide NCs are presented in Figure  5e , where 50% Rb + OTAc replacement exhibits emission (0.136, 0.052) very close to the Rec. 2020 standard (0.131, 0.046) and brings a promising future for display application. 
 ■ CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, we demonstrated studies on NCs in solution, in thin films, and in LEDs with varying degrees of Rb-alloying. We also performed a modified novel facile synthesis method for the large concentrations of Rb + cation alloyed into the perovskite Cs 1-x Rb x PbBr 3 NCs, with up to 43% of Rb incorporated under ambient conditions. The NCs were successfully employed as the active layer LEDs and achieved spectrally stable and efficient sky-blue NC-LEDs. We also observed that the PL emission of the LEDs can be tuned from 515 to 494 nm by differing the amount of the Rb + cation from 0 to 43% due to bandgap enlargement and lattice distortion. Moreover, with 20% Rb-alloying, the device performance can be enhanced from the maximum EQE of 6.4 to 11% and the maximum luminance of 22,100 to 32,300 cd/m 2 . On the other hand, 40% Rb-alloyed NC films showed an excellent PL at a sky-blue wavelength of 495 nm with a PLQY of 56% and a spectrally stable EL at 496 nm with a maximum EQE of 5.9% and a maximum luminance of 21,700 cd/m 2 . We have linked the changes in material and device performance to changes in the lattice structure and optical efficiency. This method provides an easy strategy for the emission tuning and fabrication of blue LEDs. Furthermore, our improved understanding of lattice, trapping, and performance could help further the development of blue perovskite NC-LEDs as a future commercial technology. ■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Materials.

Lesker), and zinc oxide ink for spin coating/slot-die coating (ZnO, Sigma-Aldrich) were used. All the chemicals were purchased and used without further purification. Synthesis of Cs 1-x Rb x PbBr 3 NCs. The NCs were synthesized by room-temperature injection methods referenced by Zeng et al. with modifications.  24  For the synthesis of NCs, different volumes (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.675, and 0.75 mL) of the rubidium precursor (0.1 M Rb 2 CO 3 in OTAc) were added into the cesium precursor (0.1 M Cs 2 CO 3 in OTAc) to form 1 mL A-site cation precursor solutions. 0.5 mL of a cation precursor was swiftly dropped into 4.5 mL of a Pb 2+ solution (0.1 M PbBr 2 and 0.2 M TOAB in toluene) under vigorous stirring for 5 min. Subsequently, 1.5 mL of a DDAB solution (10 mg/mL in toluene) was added, and the solution was stirred for 2 min. After 2 min of stirring, 13 mL of ethyl acetate was added into the crude solution, followed by centrifuging at 6000 rpm for 5 min. Then, the supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was dispersed in 2 mL of toluene. After that, 4 mL of ethyl acetate was added into the solution following centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was collected. Finally, 0.5 mL of n-octane was added into the precipitate for dispersion, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant was collected and filtered by a 0.22 μm PTFE syringe filter to obtain NC solution for further use. Device Fabrication. ITO substrates were subsequently cleaned in Decon 90, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol under 15 min of sonication. Then, 10 min of O 2 plasma was applied for surface activation. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto a substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. The substrates were subsequently transferred into a N 2 -filled glovebox. Poly-TPD (5 mg/ mL at chlorobenzene) was spin-coated onto the substrate at 2000 rpm for 60 s, followed by annealing at 120 °C for 15 min. NC solutions (40 μL) were spin-coated onto a substrate at 2000 rpm for 60 s, followed by annealing at 60 °C for 10 min. Then, samples were loaded into the evaporation chamber, where TPBi and LiF were subsequently evaporated at a rate of 0.4 and 0.1 Å/s for 30 and 0.8 nm, respectively. A shadow mask with a pixel area of 6 mm 2 was applied for Al evaporation at a rate of 1 Å/s for 100 nm. Characterization Methods. The UV-vis absorbance spectra were obtained by a Nanbei NU-T5 UV-vis spectrophotometer. The PL and PLE spectra were recorded by an FS5 spectrofluorometer. The PLQYs were obtained by an FS5 spectrofluorometer coupled with an integrating sphere. The crystalline structures of the NCs were determined via an X-ray diffractometer (PW1825 Philips). ICP-MS (Agilent 7700x) was used to determine the elemental compositions. TRPL was carried out by exciting the sample with a 390 nm, 100 fs laser generated by frequency doubling the output of a mode-locked titanium sapphire oscillator laser tuned to 780 nm. The beam was attenuated by a variable ND wheel, and the power before the sample was measured with a laser power meter (Newport). The laser was focused onto the sample, and the PL was collected into a monochromator (Acton Spectrapro 275) by a pair of achromatic lenses. The peak wavelength of the PL was dispersed by a 1200 lin/ mm grating onto a photon counter, and time-correlated single photon counting was carried out using a Becker and Hickl system. For timeintegrated PL, the PL was diverted into a fiber-coupled spectrometer (Acton Spectrapro 500i) equipped with a Peltier-cooled EMCCD (Andor Newton). The TEM images were obtained by a JEOL 2010F transmission electron microscope. The SEM images were obtained with a JEOL-6390 scanning electron microscope. The AFM images were obtained by a scanning probe microscope Dimension ICON. XPS spectra were obtained with a PHI 5600 (Physical Electronics). UPS was performed using a Kratos Axis Ultra with a base pressure of ∼4 × 10 -10 mbar equipped with a He-I UV-light source (21.22 eV). The EL spectrum, current-luminance plots, current-voltage curves, and EQE were recorded simultaneously with a commercial system (XPQY-EQE-350-1100, Guangzhou Xi Pu Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd.) coupled with an integrated sphere (GPS-4P-SL, Labsphere). The scanning rate of EQE and J-V-L was fixed at 0.1 V/ s. The accuracy of the commercial system was verified by using a calibrated photodetector FDS-1010 CAL (Thorlabs) in the "small distance-wide collector" method, whereby nearly all the emitted photons are collected, and the error was found to be <5%. For SCLC measurement, all the layer deposition follows the same device procedure except further notice. For the hole-only device, 10 nm of MoO 3 and 100 nm of Ag were thermally evaporated. For the electrononly device, ZnO was spin-coated on ITO glasses at 2000 rpm for 45 s, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15 min to form a holeblocking layer.
