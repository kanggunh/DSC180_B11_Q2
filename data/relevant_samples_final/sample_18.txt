Title: Photocontrolled interfacial defect passivation of coumarin 151 with enhanced hydrophobicity for stable perovskite solar cell
Defect passivation has been recognized as an efficient strategy to boost the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for commercial applications. However, most reported strategies overly emphasize passivation of undesirable defects, while ignoring the inherent instability of perovskite materials caused by environmental risks. In this study, we explore a groundbreaking strategy to integrate various functions of defect passivation, photoresponsivity and photocontrolled hydrophobicity in one device via the surface engineering of 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (C151). The detailed experiments demonstrate that C151 based PSCs have regulated power conversion efficiency and stability responding to UV illumination due to the photodimerization of coumarin. On the one hand, the photodimer of C151 (C151-L) can form stronger chelation with various defect sites in comparison with C151, resulting in optimized energy level arrangement, superior charge extraction/transport and significantly inhibited nonradivation recombination. One the other hand, morphological changes of the perovskite film triggered by UV illumination also bring convertible surface hydrophobicity transition. As a result, the unpackaged C151-L modified device exhibits excellent stability maintaining 91% of its initial PCE after aging for 1000 h under a relative humidity of 30%-40% at 20 • C. Moreover, C151-L plays a positive role in improving the operation stability against high humidity, continuous UV radiation, and heating stress. This work may offer more choices for materials with tunable properties in high-efficiency optoelectronic devices.
Introduction In recent years, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have potentially become a strong competitor to the next generation of photovoltaic technology, taking advantage of their remarkable features such as tunable bandgap, long charge diffusion length, high absorption coefficient and low cost  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Up to the present, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has climbed up to 26.1% for single-junction PSCs at laboratory scale  [6] . However, the poor long-term stability of PSCs remains a major challenge for the commercial application. There are two main reasons for this instability of PSCs. One is the rapid decomposition of perovskite material induced by moisture, oxygen, heat and light  [7] [8] [9] [10] . The other is undesirable defects disorderly distributed at surfaces and grain boundaries of perovskite film, which can not only lead to nonradiative charge recombination but also offer pathways for ion migration, dramatically resulting in reduced PCE and irreversible degradation of PSCs  [11, 12] . Therefore, many techniques have been used to passivate harmful defects such as interface engineering, additive methods, component optimization, solvent annealing and the adjustment of processing conditions  [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, most reported approaches give excessive highlight to the passivation of undesirable defects, but neglect the inherent instability of perovskite material. After all, the decomposition of perovskite material in ambient environment can further lead to the formation of harmful defects  [17] [18] [19] . In this regard, further study is required to develop an effective strategy that is capable of passivating the defects in perovskite while simultaneously minimizing the environmental risks inducing perovskite film degradation. Studies have shown photosensitive materials can undergo a series of chemical or physical reactions under light irradiation at specific wavelengths, resulting in structural and morphological changes, and empowering specific functional effects, such as photoconductive, photovoltaic and optical memory  [20, 21] . As the best-known photoresponse materials, coumarin and its derivatives are also widely considered in a variety of optoelectronic fields owing to their remarkable photophysical and photochemical properties  [22, 23] . In addition, coumarins are considered to be one of the most effective compounds to passivate defects distributed in perovskite grain boundaries and surfaces. For example, Liu et al. doped organic dye coumarin 343 in perovskite precursor solution as a defect passivator, which not only improved the performance of the relevant device but also benefited devices' stability  [24] . Xie et al. used coumarin as a multifunctional additive to passivate Pb 2+ , iodine and organic cation defects of perovskite by thermal destruction of the coumarin in the reannealing step, and achieved the champion PCE up to 24 %  [25] . Luo et al. introduced coumarin 153 (C153) into perovskite precursor to effectively increase device efficiency and operation stability against UV radiation by realizing a stabilized structure with suppressed grain defects  [26] . Different from the aforementioned works using coumarins as bulk additive, we introduce 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (C151) as an interfacial passivator in PSCs in this work. C151 contains carbonyl (C --O), amino (-NH 2 ) and fluorine (-F) in its molecular skeleton, which can passivate both positive and negative defects in perovskite. Most importantly, we highight that a synergistic function of defect passivation, photoresponsivity and photocontrolled hydrophobicity are realized by one single material. As known, coumarin derivatives can undergo a [2 + 2] photocycloaddition reaction upon irradiation with a wavelength at 365 nm  [27] . Consequently, the photodimer can form upon UV light illumination. Structural changes of coumarin treated by UV light form two distinct interaction strengths at the coumarin/ perovskite interface that can not only modulate carrier transport but also result in a light-induced change in morphologies and hydrophobicity, which correspondingly induce the improvement of PCE and stability. It is expected that our research can offer more choices for materials with tunable properties in high-efficiency organic optoelectronic devices. 
 Results and discussion In this work, the compositon of the perovskite is (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (-MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 (hereinafter referred to as the control) was prepared by two-step deposition method shown in Fig.  S1 . The device structure was displayed in Fig.  S2 . C151 was applied as a passivation layer on the top surface of the perovskite film. Under the irradiation of ultraviolet light at a wavelength of 365 nm, C151 is able to form a dimer, named as C151-L. The photodimerization route and possible passivation mechanism are demonstrated in Fig.  1a . Both C151 and C151-L contain carbonyl (C --O), amino (-NH 2 ) and fluorine (-F) in their molecular skeleton, which can passivate the Pb 2+ , halide ions and organic cation defects. Compared to C151, its dimer C151-L can form stronger chelation with the defect sites and interact more stably and reliably with perovskite grains by cooridination and hydrogen bonding  [28] [29] [30] . By analyzing the electrostatic potential surface (ESP) spectra of C151 and C151-L molecules (Fig.  1b ), C --O presents a strong negative charge, which can passivate the positive defect of Pb 2+ in the perovskite crystal, and the -NH 2 and -F groups present a strong positive charge, which can bind with the halide ions negative defects  [31, 32] . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the interaction of C151 and C151-L on the perovskite precursor PbI 2 and Formamidinium Iodide (FAI). As shown in Fig.  1c-e , the typical binding energy peaks of Pb4f and I3d shifted toward to a higher value when C151 and C151-L were applied, indicating that coumarin can chemically interact with PbI 2 . Compared with the pure FAI and pure C151 films, the N1s peaks were shifted towards a lower binding energy after treatment with C151 and C151-L, which can further elucidate the interaction between C151 and FAI. Moreover, the shift of XPS peaks of C151-L modified sample is slightly greater than that of C151 modified in all cases. That is because C151-L is the photodimer of C151 due to structural change of coumarin treated by UV light. C151-L has stronger interaction with PbI 2 and FAI, so the deviation in the XPS results of PbI 2 and FAI is larger. In addition, lattice distortion and inherent microstrain can also account for molecular interactions between the perovskite components and coumarin  [33] . We further investigated the interaction of C151 and C151-L with PbI 2 and FAI by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). As shown in Fig.  1f , the vibrational stretching at 1601 cm -1 corresponding to Pb -I bond is obviously weakened, indicating that both C151 and C151-L have the potential to interact with Pb 2+ defects. In particular, the vibrational stretching of C --O belonging to courmain bands shift from 1710 cm -1 to 1715 cm -1 , while the vibration peak of C --C shift from 1655 cm -1 to 1658 cm -1 after ultraviolet irradiation. That is because of the formation of photodimer C151-L after UV irradiation. After the formation of coumarin dimer, there will be some shift in FTIR  [34] . In the FTIR of FAI shown in Fig.  1g , the FAI appears to peak at 1700 cm -1 representing a symmetric C --N stretching of the FA + cation  [35, 36] . After modification of C151 and C151-L, the tensile vibration of C --N moves respectively to 1709 cm -1 and 1713 cm -1 , indicating that both C151 and C151-L can chemically interact with FAI. In the Fig.  S3 , the peak value of N -H of FAI at 3348 cm -1 moved to 3358 cm -1 and 3362 cm -1 after modification by C151 and C151-L, respectively, indicating that C151 and C151-L can form hydrogen bonding with FAI. In addition, hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) experiments was further conducted to study hydrogen bonding interactions. As shown in Fig.  S4 , there are three types of hydrogen atoms in FAI, similarly with the previous report  [37] . Both C151 and C151-L can produce F…H-N hydrogen bonding with FA cation. Typically, strong hydrogen bonds result in large chemical transfers to low fields (high ppm) due to de-shielding. The more the nuclear magnetic peak shifts, the stronger the hydrogen bond interaction with FAI. Therefore, it concluded that the dimer C151-L has stronger hydrogen bonding with FAI compared to C151 monomer. The crystallinity of the control and modified perovskite samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) as illustrated in Fig.  1h . All the samples exhibit the same perovskite diffraction peak at 14.41 • and 28.61 • which correspond to the (1 1 0) and (2 2 0) planes  [38] . Significantly, compared with the control and C151 modified perovskite films, the diffraction peaks (1 1 0) and (2 2 0) of the modified sample by C151-L are stronger  [39] . The improvement of the crystal quality should be attributed to the interaction between C151 dimer and perovskite, which sutures the grain boundaries. Subsequently, we have conducted additional XRD spectra of perovskite with varying concentrations of C151 and C151-L. As displayed in Fig.  S5 , for both C151 and C151-L modified samples, the intensity of the diffraction peak corresponding to perovskite appeared the highest value at 5 mg/mL, which can identify that 5 mg/mL is the optimal concentration to passivate the perovskite surface most effectively. Atomic force microscope (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were conducted to investigate the influence of the interfacial embedding modification on the perovskite morphology and crystal structure. As presented in Fig.  2a-c , the Ra value of perovskite films increased with the addition of C151. The perovskite film modified by C151-L has the highest Ra value of 79.9 nm, which is much higher than that of C151 modified perovskite film (29.0 nm) and pure perovskite film  (23.3 nm) . According to previous reports, the increase in the surface roughness of perovskite reduces the reflection of light, further enhancing the light absorption and scattering of perovskite layer  [40] [41] [42] . It is worth noting that flower-shaped crystals were found to grow on the surface of the C151-L modified perovskite sample, which is due to the photodimerization behavior of C151 under ultraviolet light irradiation. The morphology changes cause by the photodimerization of coumarin have been found by many literatures  [43] [44] [45] . Similar phenomena have also been observed in SEM images (Fig.  2d-f ). C151-L modified perovskite film has larger grains and a more uniform distribution than pristine and C151 modified perovskite films. Notably, in comparison with the control film, a fluff-like film grew on the surface of the C151 modified perovskite film, while the surface of C151-L modified sample after ultraviolet irradiation changed from fluff-like to fireworks growing in the perovskite grain boundaries. For a clear comparation, statistics are performed on grain size accroding to the SEM images. As can be seen in Fig.  2h  and i , the average grain size of the perovskite films with C151-L modification is 1011.28 nm, which is much bigger than that of the control film (804.24 nm) and C151 modified film (835.40 nm). The increased grain size should result from an optimized crystallization process, further changing the grain growth and size  [46] . The crosssection SEM images were also measured, as displayed in Fig.  S6 . Unfortunately, no significant difference was observed in terms of grain distribution between the control perovskite film and the C151 or C151-L modified perovskite film. According to the above discussion, C151 and C151-L are expected to be effective passivation layers. Therefore, we further evaluated the effect of C151 and C151-L on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. We first investigated the dependence of device performance on the concentration of C151 (3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 mg/mL), and the associated current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics and statistical distribution of photovoltaic parameters were shown in Fig.  3a  and Fig.  S7 . It reached its maximum value when the C151 concentration is 5 mg/mL. Subsequently, we have performed UV irradiation time experiments (0, 30, 60 and 90 s) under this optimal concentration of C151 (5 mg/mL). As a result, the optimal duration of photodimerization was determined to be 60 s (Fig.  3b  and Fig.  S8 ). According to previous studies, the degree of photodimerization of coumarin depends on the duration of UV irradiation  [47] . As illustrated in Fig.  3c , the photodimerisation behaviour can be studied by UV-vis absorption. The typical peak of coumarin around 245 nm decreased with the exposure time to 365 nm UV light and was almost completely quenched in 60 s, indicating the complete formation of C151 dimers. The quenching phenomenon of the absorption peak caused by coumarin photodimerization has been reported by numerous literatures  [27, 48, 49] . This trend is consistent with our J-V diagram of C151 modified devices under different light duration (Fig.  3b ). Fig.  3d  and Table  S1  depict the J-V curves and data of performance parameters for control, C151 modified and C151-L modified devices under forward and reverse scanning. For the champion control device, the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) is 1.09 V, the short-circuit current density (J SC ) is 24.35 mA/cm 2 , the fill factor (FF) is 77.18% and the PCE is 20.44%. For the champion device modified with C151, these four parameters are increased to 1.11 V, 24.59 mA/cm 2 , 78.21% and 21.34%, respectively. As a comparison, the champion device modified with C151-L shows a highest PCE of 22.46% with V OC of 1.14 V, J SC of 25.25 mA/cm 2 and FF of 78.31%. As indicated statistical distribution in Fig.  S9 , all performance parameters are significantly improved. In order to ensure the reliability of experimental data, each condition in this work contains more than 20 pieces of devices. The improvement of FF could be due to better perovskite crystal quality, and the main reason for the increase in V OC and PCE is the suppressed charge recombination and accelerated charge extraction at the interface, which will be discussed in the following section. To further confirm the reliability of the J SC , we measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the control, C151 and C151-L modified devices. As shown in Fig.  3e , The J SC of the control device is 23.35 mA/cm 2 , while the J SC of the C151 and C151-L modified devices is 23.92 mA/cm 2 and 24.08 mA/cm 2 , respectively. The modified devices have a better current density match, which is in accordance with the results obtained from the J-V plot. According to perovskite UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig.  3f ), all perovskite films have a similar absorption window from 500 nm to 850 nm. However, the absorption intensity markedly enhances after the modification of C151 and C151-L, which should be due to the better and more uniform perovskite crystal in the modified sample. In order to systematically understand the underlying mechanism of photovoltaic performance enhancement for PSCs modified by C151 and C151-L, the interface charge transfer and recombination kinetics were conducted. We first measured the photoluminescence intensity (PL) of the corresponding devices to probe the surface properties. As can be seen in Fig.  4a , the PL emission intensity of C151 modified and C151-L modified perovskite layers are approximately 2.01 and 2.82 times greater than that of the unmodified layer, demonstrating that both methods can passivate defects with specific charges  [50] . Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of unmodified and modified glass/ perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD samples (Fig.  4b ) were measured to characterize carrier extraction lifetime at the perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD interface. The fast and slow decay times were fitted using the following bimolecular attenuation formula. Detailed fitting parameters were listed in Table  S2 . I(t) = I 0 + A 1 exp -t/τ1 + A 2 exp -t/τ2 (1) Then, the mean time τ ave was obtained by the formula: τ ave = ( A 1 τ 2 1 + A 2 τ 2 2 )/ (A 1 τ 1 + A 2 τ 2 ) (2) where τ 1 is the fast decay related to charge transfer and/or trap-assisted recombination and τ 2 is the slow decay associated with bimolecular recombination  [51] . Compared with the control film (τ ave = 285.7 ns), the carrier extraction lifetime of C151 and C151-L treated samples decreased to 236.6 ns and 207.0 ns, respectively. This indicates that the modified sample has faster charge extraction/transfer at the interface. The addition of C151 and photodimerization can effectively improve the perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD interface and reduce defects, enhancing the extraction and transport of electrons, and ultimately leading to higher J SC and FF. This is crucial for obtaining high efficiency and high voltage devices. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to gain insight into the internal electrical properties of comparative PSCs, as displayed in Fig.  4c . The inserted image is the corresponding equivalent circuit diagram of the impedance results. At an operating voltage of 0.80 V, low frequency arcs are usually used to represent the charge transfer resistance. According to the fitting results, the transfer resistance after C151 photodimerization modification is smallest, demonstrating that the modification of C151-L can significantly suppress recombination of charge carrier and enhance charge transfer capability  [52] . In addition, the dark state J-V curves are also plotted and the results are represented in Fig.  4d . The dark current of C151-L modified device is lower than that of the other devices, indicating that the presence of C151-L can effectively suppress carrier recombination and facilitate charge transfer, which is in accordance with the EIS measurements. To better understand the effect of C151 and C151-L modification on the charge transport properties of the PSCs, Mott-Schottky measurements are carried out as shown in Fig.  4e . The extracted built-in potential (V bi ) of C151 and C151-L modified devices is 0.89 eV and 0.91 eV, respectively, higher than V bi of the control device (0.86 eV).The enhanced V bi can facilitate photogenerated carrier separation and further reduce the recombination of charge carriers  [53] . J SC and V OC as a function of the light intensity were analyzed to gain a deep insight into the mechansm of carrier transport and recombination in the corresponding PSCs. Fig.  4f  shows a linear relationship between V OC and light intensity for control, C151 and C151-L based devices. In the linear fiting curve of V OC versus light intensity, the trap-assisted recombination is represented by the slope deviation from the unit k B T/q, where q is the electric charge, T is the absolute temperature and k B is the Boltzmann constant. The slopes of C151 and C151-L modified devices were 1.23 k B T/q and 1.35 k B T/q, respectively, much smaller than that of the control device (1.50 k B T/q). Fig.  S10  shows the relationship between J SC and light intensity, and the fitting α values of C151 and C151-L are 0.935 and 0.985, respectively. The α value is much closer to 1 than that of the control device (0.901), which indicates that the modification of C151 and C151-L can effectively reduce bimolecular recombination  [54] . This result further confirms that both C151 and C151-L treatments effectively inhibit the defect assisted recombination. Further investigation of the charge carrier dynamic of the corresponding devices were carried out via transient photocurrent (TPC) to obtain the charge transfer time (τ tr ), respectively. The TPC decay could be analyzed by using a single exponential attenuation function fitting. The fitting equation and fitting parameters without and with modification were summarized in Table  S3 . As shown in Fig.  S11 , the devices based on C151-L modification achieve faster photocurrent attenuation than control and C151-modified devices. The charge transfer time of C151 and C151-L modified devices is 2.42 μs and 1.27 μs, lower than that of control device (3.07 μs). The shorter τ tr indicate that the perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD interface has higher charge extraction efficiency and faster carrier transfer rate. The reduction in defect state density can lead to an increase in charge extraction efficiency and carrier transfer rate. For further investigation of the defect density in perovskite thin films, we have prepared pure electronic devices with FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite/PCBM/Ag structure, which is used to measure the space charge limited current (SCLC). The trap filling limit voltage (V TFL ) trap density can be fitted using the following formula: N t = 2ε 0 εV TFL eL 2 (3) where N t is the defect density, ε 0 (=56.246) and ε (=8.85 × 10 -14 ) are the vacuum permittivity and relative permittivity of the perovskite, e is basic charge, and L(=675 nm) is the perovskite layer thickness measured by cross-section SEM image shown in Fig.  S12 , respectively. The smaller the V TFL , the smaller N t value will be. As illustrated in Fig.  S13 , in comparison with the V TFL value 0.25 V for the control device, the V TFL values after the modification of C151 and C151-L are 0.20 V and 0.18 V. And the corresponding N t for the control, C151 and C151-L based devices are 2.05 × 10 15 cm -3 , 1.63 × 10 15 cm -3 and 1.47 × 10 15 cm -3 , respectively (Fig.  S14 ). The significant reduction in trap density after the modification of C151 and C151-L demonstrated the effectiveness of defect passivation in this work  [55] . Subsequently, in order to investigate the influence of the interfacial embedding modification on surface electrical properties, we carried out additional tests on ultraviolet photoelectron energy (UPS) spectroscopy to determine the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM). The E cut-off and E F,edge regions were shown in Fig.  4g  to obtain the corresponding energy level distribution. The Fermi energy level (E F ) of the perovskite films with and without modification were obtained by the equatioon of E F = E cut-off -hv (hv = 21.22 eV). VBM is obtained by the formula VBM = E F,edge -E F , and CBM is calculated by the formula CBM = VBM-E g . E g is caculated by the Tauc plot of UV-vis absorption spectra. The calculated VBM of C151 and C151-L modified perovskite films are -5.831 eV and -5.766 eV, respectively. The energy level diagram of C151 and C151-L modified perovskite system is shown in Fig.  4h . After the addition of C151-L, E F increased by 0.166 eV(from -4.051 eV to -3.885 eV), reflecting that C151-L passivated film exhibited more N-type properties. The N-type feature ensures that the perovskite layer is aligned with the electron/hole transport layer, resulting in optimized energy level arrangement, which further benefiting the promoting hole formation, collecting and blocking unwanted electron transfer, ultimately favoring the increasing of V OC . Contact angle measurements of water droplet on the surface of perovskite film were carried out, as shown in Fig.  5a . In addition to morphological changes, C151 also brings the apparent contact angel (CA) transformations. Due to coumarin with low surface energy, the contact angel changes from original hydrophilic (47 • ) to hydrophobic (85 • ). Furthermore, the CA of C151 surface can convert from 85 • to 95 • under 365 nm UV light irradiation, due to the photodimerization of C151. These results indicate a better moisture resistant of C151 and C151-L modified perovskites. Due to the excellent hydrophobicity of C151 and C151-L, we further explored the stability of the unpackaged perovskite films and the corresponding PSCs at a relative humidity of 30%-40% at 20 • C. As exhibited in Fig.  5b , the optical color of the control perovskite film without passivation was converted to yellow within 10 days, implying a degeneration in the perovskite films. Meanwhile the similar situation was observed for C151 modified film after 20 days. By contrast, C151-L modified perovskite film exhibited superior stability without any color changes even after 40 days. The same trend was investigated in longterm stability experiments. As shown in Fig.  5c , the C151 and C151-L modified devices retained 82% and 91% of their initial efficiencies after aging for 1000 h under a relative humidity (RH) of 30%-40% at 20 • C, while only 40% for the control device. In short, the merit of blocking moisture penetration makes C151-L passivation successfully adopted to promote device stability. In addition, the steady-state PCE under the corresponding voltage of the maximum power point irradiated by AM 1.5G was measured, as shown in Fig.  5d . In comparison with control and C151 modified devices, C151-L modified device show better optical stability with almost no attenuation within 450 s. Finally, we further studied the operation stability of the corresponding unencapsulated devices without and with modification by aging them under extreme conditions. Firstly, the unencapsulated devices were stored under 95% RH high humidity air environment to test their stablity. As shown in Fig.  5e , the PCE of the control device rapidly dropped below 30% after 150 h, while the C151 modified and C151-L modified devices remained more than 70% and 80% of the initial PCE, respectively. Furthermore, the UV stability of the corresponding devices was trackeed under continuous 50 mW/cm 2 ultraviolet irradiation in air environment (30%-40% RH, 25 • C). As shown in Fig.  5f , the C151 modified and C151-L modified devices maintained over 85% and 91% of their original PCE after 240 h, respectively. Under the same age conditons, the PCE of the control device rapidly decayed to 41% of the initial PCE. Finally, the target devices also exhibit excellent stability under continuous heating at 85 • C in ambient air at 30%-40% RH. As shown in Fig.  5g , C151-L modified device retained 91% of its initial PCE, which is remarkably better than that of C151 modified and control devices. These impressive results indicate that C151-L plays a positive effect in improving the device stability against high RH, UV radiation, and heating stress, which is mainly attributed to the efficent defect passivation at perovskite surface. 
 Conclusion In summary, we presented a facile strategy that enabled us to achieve highly efficient and stable PSCs by photosensitive effects using C151 as an interface passivation layer. C151 incorporates multitudinous passivation group (-C --O, -NH 2 and -F) in its backbone, which play a crucial role in passivating positive and negative charge defects throughchemically coordination and hydrogen bonding with perovskite. Furthermore, C151 undergoes photodimerization under 365 nm UV illumination. The resulting dimer, C151-L, not only forms stronger chelation with defect sites but also enhances surface hydrophobicity of the perovskite film. Detailed characterization indicates that C151-L modification gives rise to better perovskite film quality, optimized energy level arrangemet, superior charge extraction/transport properties and significantly inhibited nonradivation recombination. Consequently, the PCE increases from 20.44% to 22.46%, with a remarkable enhancement of 50 mV in V OC for device passivated by C151-L. Moreover, the enhanced surface hydrophobicity of C151-L leads to better stability of the perovskite film and the corresponding device. As a result, the unpackaged C151-L modified device still retains 91% of its original PCE after being aged for nearly 1000 h at 20 ℃ and in a RH of 30%-40%. Moreover, the resultant device shows increased operation stability against high humidity, continuous UV radiation, and heating stress. A simple strategy is offered by this work to realize self-regulated defect passivation responding to UV illumination to further enhance the performance and long-term stability of PSCs for commercial applications.

The precursor of the SnO 2 colloid (15 wt%) was prepared by α-Aesar (tin(IV) oxide) method. Anhydrous ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH, AR) was purchased from Sinopod Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. 
 Solar cell fabrication The PSCs were fabricated on the FTO glass substrates and washed sequentially with deionised water, acetone, deionised water and ethanol for 15 min. The cleaned substrates were then nitrogen gun dried and UVozone for 15 min. The n-i-p planar perovskite solar cell device was prepared by a two-step deposition technique (FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite /spiro-OMeTAD/Ag). A layer of SnO 2 nanoparticle film (containing 2.67 wt% deionized water) was deposited on the cleaned substrates at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 150 • C for 60 min in ambient air. After the samples had been cooled to room temperature, they were exposed to UV ozone and transferred to a glove box. Organometalide perovskites were then prepared using a two-step spin-coating technique in a nitrogen glove box. PbI 2 (1.2 mol) was dissolved in DMF: DMSO (95:5) solution, rotated on a cooled FTO/SnO 2 substrate at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and then tempered at 70 • C for 5 min to cool the substrate to room temperature. The FAI: MACl: MABr (60:8.2:6 mg/mL) organic mixture was then spun on PbI 2 at 2000 rpm for 20 s followed by annealing at 150 • C for 15 min at room temperature (30%-40% RH). Subsequently, C151 and C151-L pasivation procedure was conducted, which will be introduced in detail as following. After the preparation of interficial passivation layer, the Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer was deposited on the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 20 s. The preparation of the Spiro-OMeTAD mixed solution: A mixture containing 72.3 mg Spiro-OMeTAD, 35 μL Li-TFSI stock solution (260 mg Li-TFSI dissolved in 1 mL AN), 30 μL 4-tBP and 1 mL CB was cooled to room temperature. Finally, a silver top electrode with a thickness of 120 nm was thermally deposited in a high vacuum chamber (≈8 × 10 -4 Pa) using a hood with an aperture of 0.051 cm 2 . 
 C151 and C151-L passivation C151 solution was obtained by dissolving C151 in IPA under different concentration (3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 mg/mL), and then the dissolved solution was spin coated on the top of perovskite film at 5000 rpm for 30 s to obtain C151 passivation layer. Subsequently, the C151 treated samples were irradiated under a 365 nm ultraviolet lamp for varying illumination times (30 s, 60 s and 90 s) in order to promote the photodimerization of C151 and further obtain C151-L passivation layer. 
 Measurement and characterization UV-vis absorption spectra of the glass/C151 films were conducted with UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV7500, Pu-Xi Co., Ltd, Shanghai). 1 H NMR spectra of FAI with and without passivation were performed on a Bruker AVANCE III 400 (Zurich, Switzerland) spectrometer at room temperature.The J-V curves were recorded under AM 1.5G (100 mW/ cm 2 ) illumination using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The scan rate is 100 mV/s and the range is 1.2 V to -0.2 V. The measurements were all taken at room temperature without packaging, and a black mask with a diameter of 0.051 cm 2 was used in the lighting step. SEM was performed on a microscope (SU5000, HITACHI) to characterize the surface morphologies of the FTO/perovskite films with and without passivation. XPS (FTO/PbI 2 or FTO/FAI with and without passivation) and UPS (FTO/ perovskite films with and without passivation) analyses were performed on a photoelectron spectrometer (ThermoFisher Nexsa, USA). AFM images are measured based on FTO/perovskite films with and without passivation using an atomic force microscope (DimensionXR). FTIR was recorded using Thermo Fisher infrared Fourier transform microscope (Nicolet 6700, USA). The phase of perovskite films with and without passivation was characterized by XRD with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm, D/Max-2500/PC-40KV). An electrochemical workstation (CS Studio5, Wuhan) was applied to analyze EIS of the corresponding devices at a voltage of less than 0.8 V. Z-View software was used to fit and analyze the measured EIS data. The light intensity dependence of V OC and J SC was determined by scanning the J-V curves of PSCs under different light intensity with Keithley 2400 light source meter. A fluorescence spectrometer (Alph 300R/UHTS3000) was used to record the PL spectra of glass/ perovskite films. TRPL tests with glass/ perovskite/ Spiro-OMeTAD stucture were performed with a FluoTime 300 system using an excitation wavelength of 637 nm. TPC curves of the corresponding devices were recorded by an oscilloscope (NL100, 337 nm). SCLC analysis was measured based on the electron only devices with FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite/PCBM/Ag structure using Keithley 2400 in darkness.
