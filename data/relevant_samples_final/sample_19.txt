Title: Multifaceted Design of Surface Passivator for Upgraded Charge Extraction in Perovskite Solar Cells

Introduction Thin film photovoltaic research witnessed significant attention with the advent of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), measuring an unparalleled power conversion efficiency (PCE), soaring from 3.8% to 26.5% in over a decade.  [1] [2] [3]  However, the PSCs have not yet demonstrated the required stability due to the defects present at the surface, which are further aggravated by operationality.  [4]  The enhancement in PCE is being reported, and the possibility of achieving 30% has been theoretically predicted.  [5, 6]  To attain the theoretical limits in performance, it is essential to control charge recombination and minimize various nonradiative recombination losses in both the bulk and interfaces.  [7]  In this vein, the main contributors to nonradiative recombination losses in PSCs are deep-level defects, characterized by a thermal activation energy higher than k B T.  [8, 9]  The most efficient PSCs are typically fabricated from bulk (3D) perovskites, while layered perovskites have shown higher stability.  [10]  Arguably, improving the stability of 3D perovskites is paramount. Inspired by the stability-inducing properties of Lewis bases in layered perovskites, it can act as a guiding force to induce stability in bulk perovskites. In this context, the utilization of organic molecules with long chains as passivator agents not only reduces ion migration from the perovskite to the hole transport material (HTM) but also serves as a barrier against the volatility of formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA).  [11]  So far, a range of organic materials, as passivators, have been employed in perovskite thin films to reduce defect formation and defect density through molecular interaction with undercoordinated metal cations or halide anions.  [12] [13] [14]  Surface passivation of the perovskite is endorsed as an effective method to mitigate nonradiative recombination losses and, subsequently, to boost the photovoltage.  [15, 16]  Undercoordinated ions can be passivated through ionic or coordinate bonding by employing functional groups with opposite charges, while vacancies can be filled by either ammonium cations or halide anions.  [17]  Currently, phenyl ethyl-ammonium iodide (PEAI) is the preferred choice as a surface passivator for halide perovskite, allowing suppression of nonradiative recombination and surface defect reduction, to optimize performance.  [18]  Moreover, PEAI provides surface passivation along with the ability to interact on {100} and {111} of the perovskite grain, and this interaction is due to the different sizes of the passivation grains, making PEAI a rational choice over other amine functionalization.  [19]  In addition to surface passivation, addressing ion migration is imperative to enhance the longevity of PSCs. Ag þ ions can migrate through the absorber layer similarly to halide ions; although the diffusion barrier for Ag þ is on par with that of highly mobile iodide ions, the defects caused by Ag þ are relatively benign.  [20] [21] [22]  To prevent potential degradation from silver ion migration, passivation techniques are being implemented to improve the stability of the perovskite by reducing defect densities and blocking ion migration pathways, especially in cases where it is used as a cathode. The nonradiative recombination arising from the interfaces of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) pose a hurdle, impacting both the efficiency and stability of devices. Functionalized organic molecules can passivate the perovskite surface to suppress the defects and can also fine-tune the microstructure. This in turn promotes reliability and performance enhancement in solar cells. Using a design protocol, cyanoguanidine diiodide is synthesized and employed as a surface passivator for the fabrication of PSCs, and boosted performance from 20.44% to 23.04% is achieved. This improvement stems from an improved fill factor reaching up to 80.64%, together with the open-circuit voltage (V oc ) measuring 1119 mV. The steady-state photoluminescence and microstructure of passivated perovskites display significant surface modification of the perovskite film which favorably impacts the charge carrier transfer at the interface of perovskite and Spiro-OMeTAD. Our findings suggest that improved solar cell performance is due to the synergetic effect of amino and cyano functional groups along with the iodide reservoir in the organic passivator. Guanidinium iodide improves perovskite film quality by reducing defect densities and enhancing charge transport, leading to better efficiency and stability.  [23]  Though guanidinium iodide has shown promising results, cyanoguanidine introduces unique chemical functionalities, such as electron-donating nature and stronger dipole interactions, which can interact effectively with the perovskite films. Here, we deduce the impact of typical passivating salts on PSC performance and uncover the interactive role of the halide salt with FA-rich perovskite (Cs 0.05 FA 0.9 MA 0.05 PbI 3 ). Three surface passivators, PEAI, imidazolium iodide (ImI), and cyanoguanidine diiodide (DYI) are selected to elucidate their impact on mitigating surface defects at the interface between the perovskite and the HTM. The ÀC≡N and ÀC═NH functional groups present in DYI can interact with the uncoordinated Pb 2þ in perovskite and in turn will reduce the nonradiative recombination, while the iodide will serve as a reservoir for ions and will fill the vacancy originated from ion migration. The ÀC≡N and ÀC═NH functional groups in DYI can donate the electron instantly and strong coordination effect with Pb 2þ ; arguably, this will retard perovskite's tendency for oxidation. The PSCs passivated with DYI achieved a boosted PCE of 23.04%, owing to an upgraded fill factor (FF) of 80.65% and an open-circuit voltage (V oc ) of 1119 mV. In comparison, the control PSC measured a V oc of 1077 mV and an FF of 75.84%, achieving an overall PCE of 20.44%. Moreover, the DYIpassivated PSCs showed enhanced operational stability compared to the control when stored under dry air conditions. By employing an array of techniques, we uncover the impact of the passivator on the structural and optical properties of perovskite and noted that DYI passivation suppresses nonradiative recombination and increases charge carrier mobility compared to PEAI and ImI. 
 Results and Discussion Thin films of CsFAMAPbI 3 were deposited followed by the passivators molecules (DYI, PEAI, and ImI) from isopropanol solutions by spin coating. In the diffraction pattern, peaks at 2θ = 14.04°, 19.87°, 24.39°, 28.20°, 31.58°, 34.71°, 38.73°, 40.30°, and 42.82°match with (100), (  110 ), (  111 ), (  200 ), (  210 ), (  211 ), (220), and (300) planes of and are the characteristics peak of hybrid halide perovskite, respectively. The peaks at 2θ = 12.73°c orrespond to the characteristics peak of PbI 2 , and we noted small shifts in the diffraction patterns of PEAI-and DYIpassivated perovskites. The absence of the peaks (2θ = <10°) suggests the passivating molecule did not form the layered perovskite structure; thus, it will not increase the quantum and dielectric confinement of the perovskite thin films.  [24, 25]  Moreover, the intensity of the PbI 2 peak (2θ = 12.7°) reduces and is found to be lowest for DYI and follows the trend, DYI < PEAI < ImI < control (Figure  S1 , Supporting Information), while the diffraction peak intensities of the (100) and (  200 ) crystal planes in DYI-passivated perovskite show increment, indicating improved crystallization and change in the local environment of surface (Figure  S1 , Supporting Information). To access the chemical interaction between the perovskite and passivator molecules, we deduce electrostatic potential (ESP) and the molecular dipole moment of methyl pairs to NH-related molecules, by performing density functional theory calculations. In the ESP (Figure  1c ), the electron-deficient region (positive region) is mainly distributed in the amine group and the electron-donating substituents on the benzene ring. Equally, the amine fraction of PEAI, the CÀH of ImI, and the ÀC≡N of DYI in the acceptor moiety exhibit a high-density electronic cloud (negative region), which provides optimal conditions for coordination with insufficiently coordinated Pb 2þ cations, while the nitrogen site is in contrast to the π-conjugated system. The effective coupling of intermolecular orbitals allows the transfer of electrons from the donor moiety to the acceptor moiety. This effect can further intensify the interaction between ionic defects with insufficient coordination in perovskite crystals.  [26, 27]  DYI possesses significant advantage due to the imine (ÀC═NÀ) and cyno (ÀC≡N) functions which create a pronounced negative potential, while the C─N bond shows a positive potential surface because of the inductive effect. The increase in electron-donating ability of DYI will allow a finer defect passivation. The UV-vis absorption spectra of passivated perovskite film (Figure  2 ) display similar absorption as of the pristine perovskite. However, steadystate photoluminescence (PL) exhibits a change in emission intensity, as compared to the pristine perovskite. The emission intensity peak increases with PEAI and DYI, while with ImI the PL intensity suppresses as compared to the pristine perovskite. This suggests the impact of organic passivators on the optoelectronic properties of perovskite. The higher PL intensity shown by PEAI-and DYI-passivated perovskite suggests a reduction in nonradiative recombination losses. To optimize the DYI effect, we screened the precursor concentration from 1 to 5 mg mL À1 (Figure  S2a , Supporting Information). Expectedly, the thickness of the passivators has no bearing on the absorption of the perovskite, and the steady-state PL of perovskite/DYI displayed a similar emission peak at 800 nm but with a change in peak intensities. The optimal DYI passivation is noted to be at 2 mg mL À1 (Figure  S2b , Supporting Information), where it shows maximum PL intensity. Further, with the deposition of the HTM and for perovskite/DYI/Spiro, configuration of the PL intensities of the DYI-passivated are quenched compared to the pristine perovskites, suggesting effective carrier separation and transport at the perovskite-HTL interface, potentially reducing nonradiative recombination losses. PEAI and DYI reduce the nonradiative recombination on the perovskite surface, while ImI alters the perovskite surface and induces defects at the perovskite/Spiro interface. To understand the underlying passivation mechanisms on perovskite facets, it is vital to identify and analyze the specific facets present on the surface of the perovskite thin film. The PEA þ ions contain double bonds with delocalized π electrons in their benzene rings, while the ImI ions are composed of single bonds only, and DYI could interact with both (-NH 3 þ ) 2 terminals via hydrogen bonding. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy experiments showed transmission bands at 1100 and 900 cm À1 correspond to C-N stretching and around 3450-3200 cm À1 to N-H stretching, originating from the FA þ /MA þ cation (Figure  3a ). The signal detected at around 1712.2 cm À1 represents symmetric C═N stretching from FA þ in the perovskite.  [28, 29]  The C-N stretching vibration peak shifts from 1352 to 1354 cm À1 with PEAI and ImI and to 1354.2 cm À1 for DYI, indicating the interaction with perovskite. Similarly, the N-H stretching shifts from 3263 (pristine) to 3266, 3264, and 3269 cm À1 with PEAI, ImI, and DYI, respectively. This is attributed to the presence of hydrogen bonding between the iodide and the surface passivators.  [30]  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data for Pb 4f and I 3d are derived from the overall survey spectra (Figure  3c, d ). The characteristic peaks of Pb 4f 5/2 and 4f 7/2 in the pristine perovskites appear at 143.49 and 138.64 eV, respectively. After DYI passivation, the peaks shifted to the lower binding energy with a value of 143.37 and 138.50 eV, respectively. Similar shifts were observed in the I 3d 3/2 and I 3d 5/2 from 630.95 and 619.44 to 630.73 and 619.27 eV, respectively, indicating that the binding capacity of the iodide and lead atoms on the perovskite surface has changed due to the interaction between the passivation layer and the PbI 2 .  [31] [32] [33]  Moreover, the existence of Pb 0 in perovskite thin films can hinder the crystallization process, adding shallow defects and lowering the trap activation energy. This leads to deteriorated PCE and the stability of the perovskite film.  [34] [35] [36]  The presence of the DYI layer alters the Pb chemical  environment and hinders metallic Pb (Pb 0 ) formation (Figure  3c ), and the concentration of Pb 0 decreases from 5.26% in the control film to 3.76%. To evaluate the effectiveness of the developed passivator on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, planar n-i-p devices have the configuration FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. As anticipated, the PSCs with DYI passivation gave a higher performance compared to the pristine, PEAI, and ImI passivation. The J-V curves are shown (Figure  4a ), and it can be deduced that the passivators improve the device FF, and PEAI and DYI (81.47 and 80.65, respectively) gave high FF, suggesting their suitability over ImI. The difference in PCE between PEAI and DYI is mainly related to higher V oc obtained by DYI (1119 mV) based on PSC. A compact and large perovskite grain formation is formed after passivation, which will allow the homogeneous deposition of the subsequent Spiro-OMeTAD layer, leading to an effective hole separation and extraction with the DYI passivation. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) (Figure  4b ) reaches a value of 81.8% for the control PSC, and it shows an increment for passivated PSC, to 86.96%, 87.32%, and 89.18% with PEAI, ImI, and DYI, respectively. The calculated values of integrated current ( J sc ) from the EQE are 22.37, 22.44, 23.40, and 24.47 mA cm À2 for control, PEAI, ImI, and DYI, respectively. Figure  4c -f illustrates the statistical distribution of the PCE, V OC , short-circuit current density ( J sc ), and FF. The forward and reverse J-V scans are also represented (Figure  S3 , Supporting Information) to gaze anomalies in J-V measurements. We noted negligible hysteresis in passivated devices which is ascribed to complex interfacial interactions that can diminish over time. While the passivated device showed reduced nonradiative recombination and improved stability, it can increase temporal variation in J-V and FF characteristics. Surface topography (Figure  5 ) reveals that the perovskite microstructure is influenced by the passivating molecule and exhibits variations in grain distribution. The pristine perovskite (Figure  5a ) and the ImI-passivated present different grains and sizes, suggesting the interaction with the ImI allows the modification in the grain texture (Figure  5b ), while uniform and compact grain with PEAI and DYI are noted. The use of a multifunctional additive with amino and cyano groups having lone pair electrons can interact effectively with the Pb-I and iodide, allowing the formation of compact and dense perovskite thin films having low trap density and improved carrier lifetime. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images on a large-scale bar (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information) show that PEAI produces grains of variable sizes, with visible grain   boundaries (Figure  S4c , Supporting Information). The DYIpassivated perovskite thin film (Figure  5d ) shows a uniform grain size, to the reference and PEAI. The DYI also tends to crystallize in the grain's boundary, which allows for reducing the gaps by filling the grain boundaries and minimizing the defect density. The histogram of grain size (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information) derived (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information) suggests a large mean grain size for DYI-passivated perovskites. The cross-sectional image of the fabricated PSC (Figure  S6e , Supporting Information) showed a perovskites thickness of 428 nm. The surface roughness is measured by scanning force microscopy (Figure  S6 , Supporting Information), and the passivators impact the roughness of the perovskite films. Lower root mean square (RMS) values of 25.5 nm for the pristine to 24.19, 24.52, and 23.07 nm for PEAI, ImI, and DYI, respectively, are measured, suggesting the role of DYI in forming a dense, compact, and uniform microstructure. This stems from the favorable crystallization with DYI, which in turn will be beneficial for the interfacial contact between the perovskite and the hole transport layer to facilitate effective hole extraction. We carried out electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in dark conditions to deduce the charge dynamics in the PSCs. The EIS data is then fitted (Figure  6a ) with an equivalent circuit comprising a series resistance (R s ), a charge transport resistance (R ctr ), and a recombination resistance (R rec ) at the interface between the perovskite and the hole transport layer. Additionally, two constant phase elements (Capacitors C1 and C2) were included in parallel to account for carrier diffusion in the perovskite and selective layers to estimate the value of R ctr and R rec . For the charge transfer resistance (R ctr ), DYI passivation demonstrates a higher reduction in resistance from 512.3 to 280 Ω at higher applied voltages (0.9 V) compared to the control PSC (Figure  6b ). This indicates that the passivation of deep-level defects in the perovskite bulk enhances charge transport at the interface between the perovskite and hole transport layer (Perovskite/HTL). Under similar bias conditions, PEAI and DYI passivation featured a higher R rec than control PSCs at all the applied voltages up to 0.9 V (Figure  6c , S7, Supporting Information). The DYIbased PSC demonstrates a significant enhancement in recombination resistance (R rec ) at 0.9 V, rising from 383.3 to 585 Ω compared to the control PSC. This improvement is attributed to reduced charge annihilation at the interface and more efficient charge extraction (Figure  6c ). To deduce the leakage current and carrier recombination in PSCs with different passivation, dark J-V measurements (Figure  S8a , Supporting Information) showed that the reverse current of PSCs treated with PEAI, ImI, and DYI is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to pristine PSCs. To estimate the defect state density, hole-only devices were fabricated with the structure ITO/PEDOT/perovskite(PEAI/ImI/DYI)/ Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, and the space-charge limited current (SCLC) curves were analyzed (Figure  S8b-d , Supporting Information). The dark J-V curves can be categorized into three regions: ohmic, trap-filled limit (TFL), and Child region.  [30]  The voltage at the intersection of the Ohmic and TFL regions (V TFL ) is directly proportional to the defect density (N t ) as follows:  [37]   N t ¼ 2ε 0 ε r V TFL qL 2 (1) where ε 0 represents the vacuum permittivity (ε 0 = 8.86 Â 10 À14 F cm À1 ), q is the elementary charge (q = 1.60 Â 10 À19 C), L indicates the thickness of the perovskite film (L = 428 nm) and ε r is the relative permittivity of the perovskite. The density of the trap (N t ) is proportional to the V TFL . The V TFL of the control PSC decreases from 0.95 to 0.72, 0.86, and 0.82 V with the passivation of PEAI, DYI, and ImI, respectively, suggesting the traps can be effectively filled by passivators (Figure  S8b-d , Supporting Information). The fabricated PSCs were stored in a desiccator without encapsulation (Figure  S9a , Supporting Information). After 60 days of storage, the passivated PSCs maintained over 83% of their initial efficiencies, whereas the control PSC was only able to retain 77% of their initial efficiencies during the same period. After 120 days, the PCE showed significant differences among the samples stored in dry air. The control PSC exhibited a PCE of 0.41%, while PEAI, DYI, and ImI passivation showed PCE values of 14.69%, 15.43%, and 6.29%, respectively. The drastic reduction in PCE of the control PSC is attributed to the degradation of the perovskite layer and thus the deterioration of electrical properties. The passivated perovskites (PEAI and DYI) effectively acted as barriers, mitigating the diffusion, and subsequently retained their structural integrity and black color (Figure  S9b , Supporting Information).  [20] [21] [22] 36, 38]  The perovskite film was tracked through UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Figure  S10 , Supporting Information), showing a notable decrease in the absorption for the pristine and ImI-passivated films, as compared to the PEAI-and DYI-passivated perovskites. While both PEAI and DYI show a slight decrease after 20 days of storage under ambient conditions. Measurements performed after 60 days of storage show a rapid decrease in the absorption for the reference and ImI-passivated films (complete degradation and acquired yellow color), while the PEAI-and DYI-passivated perovskite thin films maintain their absorbance, indicating a barricading effect against moisture and oxygen. Both PEAIand DYI-passivated films show a slower degradation and remain black. 
 Conclusion In summary, we shed light on the role of passivation selection in enhancing PSCs by selecting three different passivators (PEAI, ImI, and DYI) in FA-rich perovskite, revealing their impact on grain size, grain boundary defects, and microstructure. The use of a multifaceted additive with amino and cyano groups interacts with the uncoordinated Pb 2þ , allows the formation of compact and dense grains, and reduces the nonradiative recombination. This attests to the ability of cyanoguanidine diiodide to improve the charge carrier transfer between the perovskite and Spiro-OMeTAD. With the use of cyanoguanidine diiodide passivators, the fabricated solar cells showed improved structural stability and measured a PCE of 23.04% as compared to the control device which measured 20.44%. 
 Experimental Section Materials: The chemicals were purchased: lead iodide (99.99%) from Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI), cesium chloride (99.99%) (ThermoFisher), formamidinium iodide (99.99%), methylammonium iodide and chloride (99.99%) (Greatcell Solar Materials). The organic salt passivators were purchased from Greatcell Solar Materials except DYI. Chlorobenzene (CB, 99%), isopropanol (IPA, 99.9%), anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.8%), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%) were purchased from Acros Organics. Cyanoguanidinium Diiodide (DYI) Synthesis: Cyanoguanidine iodide salt was synthesized through inverse temperature crystallization of dicyandiamide using hydroiodic acid and hypophosphorous acid (v/v = 10:1) (57%, TCI Chemicals and 50%, Acros chemicals). The obtained precipitate was washed with diethyl ether (Acros Organics) and subjected to multiple recrystallization steps using absolute ethanol. This washing and recrystallization process was repeated several times to ensure purity using the rotavapor. Finally, the resulting crystals were dried under a vacuum for 10 h and stored in an argon glovebox (Figure  S11a , Supporting Information). Device Fabrication: The ITO-coated glasses were sequentially cleaned using ultrasonication with Hellmanex II solution (2 vol% in DI water), followed by deionized water, acetone, ethanol, and isopropanol, respectively, with 20 min for each step. The cleaned substrates were dried with compressed air. Subsequently, the dried substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 30 min before device fabrication. SnO 2 colloidal solution (SnO 2 :H 2 O = 4:1 v v À1 ) was spin-coated on the ITO substrate with 2 steps at 500 rpm for 5 s and 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 140 °C for 30 min. The obtained films were transferred to the glove box (H 2 O level: <0.1 ppm and O 2 level: <1 ppm), then annealed again at 140 °C for 10 min, and the triple-cation perovskite Cs 0.05 FA 0.9 MA 0.05 PbI 3 were deposited in a single step. The perovskite precursor solution at 1.3M in DMF and DMSO (v/v = 4/1), was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s followed by 6000 rpm for 30 s, and 125 μL of chlorobenzene was used as antisolvent in the last 10 s. The as-deposited films were annealed at 100 °C for 1 h and then at 150 °C for 10 min for the surface passivation, PEAI, ImI, and DYI, 50 μL from each solution (2 mg mL À1 in IPA) were spin-coated dynamically on top of the perovskite at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The HTM was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene, doped by 17.6 μL of LiTFSI (520 mg mL À1 in Acetonitrile) and 28.5 μL of t-BP. Next, 35 μL of the HTM solution was dropped on the substrate and spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, an Ag electrode (100 nm) was thermally evaporated under a pressure of 4 Â 10 À6 Torr. Thin Film Characterization: The thin film of perovskite with different passivators was characterized by spectroscopic techniques such as UVvis, FT-IR, PL, SEM, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The absorption spectra and steady-state PL measurements were obtained using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 60 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer) and a fluorescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer 55 Instrument). FT-IR spectra were measured using a Jasco FT-IR-6100 spectrometer in Attenuated Total Reflectance mode (ATR-FTIR). The spectra were recorded over wavelengths ranging from 450 to 4000 cm À1 with a resolution of 1 cm À1 . The surface and cross-sectional images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 SEM, respectively. X-ray diffractograms were recorded using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Bragg-Brentano geometry and a Cu Kα X-ray tube with a wavelength (λ) of 1.5406 Å. The atomic force microscope images were captured using a Park Systems NX10 equipped with a noncontact silicon cantilever. Device Characterization: The photovoltaic characteristics were assessed under irradiation of 1000 W m À2 (AM1.5, 1 sun) using a 3 A Oriel solar simulator from Newport. The device's active area was maintained at 0.09 cm 2 through the use of a black metal mask. Incident photon-tocurrent efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded with a 150 W Xenon lamp connected to a Bentham PVE300 motorized 1/4 m monochromator. EIS measurements were conducted using a Palmsens4 potentiostat over a frequency range of 1 MHz to 1 Hz with a 15 mV perturbation.
