Title: Surface termination passivation of imidazole-based diiodide enabling efficient inverted perovskite solar cells †
N-(3-aminopropyl)-imidazole diiodide (APDI) was introduced on the upper surface of the perovskite for the first time to modulate the terminal groups. The defect traps were suppressed by binding N cations from the APDI with Pb 2+ . Consequently, the optimum APDI-treated device achieved a PCE of 21.41% and exhibited excellent stability.
Metal-halide perovskite materials are widely employed as photosensitive layers for the study of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on exotic semiconductor properties (e.g., tunable bandgap, excellent optical absorption, and high defect tolerance).  1, 2  Presently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction PSCs has increased from less than 4% in 2009 to 25.7%.  [1] [2] [3]  Although the PCE of nip-type (regular) PSCs is always higher than that of pin-type (inverted) PSCs during the same period, the inverted PSCs are gradually receiving more attention owing to their lower preparation energy consumption.  3  In addition, MA-free Cs/FA-based perovskite combines excellent stability, which is a desirable material choice for application in PSCs.  4  The surface of the perovskite film, which is prepared by a solution-based process, suffers from various unavoidable defects (e.g., vacancies, interstitials, anti-site substitutions), resulting from the ionic nature of perovskite materials and the soft crystalline properties.  5  Moreover, the properties of nanoscale-based perovskite films are susceptible to surface effect, making surface modulation engineering an effective means to regulate the chemical environment of the upper surface of perovskite films.  6, 7  Consequently, the presence of the above defects was considered a major factor restricting the further elevation in PSC performance, which not only induced a decrease in PCE by trapping charges to aggravate the nonradiative recombination but also served as the preferential sites for erosion by external factors (e.g., H 2 O, O 2 , and ultraviolet) to accelerate the degradation of perovskite film.  4  To date, studies based on ligand engineering for perovskite surfaces have been broadly reported. For example, Lewis-base molecules with electron-donating groups are frequently employed to reduce uncoordinated Pb 2+ that is considered to be the main source of defects on the perovskite surface due to its lower formation energy.  5, 7, 8  Compared to the ligand engineering realized by molecules with electron-donating groups, the ammonium salt-based modification has the advantage of a convenient and efficient process for the passivation step.  9, 10  Since the work of interfacial modification by phenethylamine iodide (PEAI) was reported, the investigation of modulating the terminal environment of perovskites by ammonium salts had drawn attention. Aminocorannulene iodides were introduced on the surface of the perovskite by Yang et al., leading to a significant reduction of the Pb 2+ traps owing to the favorable coordination ability between R-NH 3 + and Pb 2+ .  11  Simultaneously, ammonium diiodide salts, such as ethane-1,2-diamine diiodide, histamine diiodide, have also been adopted as modifiers to mitigate the defect density of perovskite at the top and bottom interface of PSCs.  12, 13  However, the above ammonium salts have only one functional group binding to the Pb 2+ traps for passivation. Compared to the wide investigation of passivators with single-acting sites, there are few reports on ammonium salts with dual-functional groups of coordination for the surface modulation of perovskite. In this study, we introduced the API (N-(3-Aminopropyl)imidazole) diiodide (APDI) on the upper surface of FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb(I 0.86 Br 0.14 ) 3 film to modulate the terminal chemical environment, and good photovoltaic performance was obtained. Table  S1  (ESI †) lists a comparison of the parameters. The bifunctional groups (CQNH + -and -NH 3 + -) in APDI make it more effective in reducing the Pb 2+ defect on the perovskite surface through bonding to Pb 2+ . Density functional theory (DFT) demonstrated that the N on the imidazole ring in APDI was slightly more inclined to bind to Pb 2+ traps than to N on the branched chain. Moreover, the hydrophobicity of the perovskite films was enhanced by the introduction of APDI with an alkyl chain on the surface. Consequently, the optimum device after APDI modification (target) has an increased PCE, from 20.01% to 21.41%. Additionally, the target devices exhibited excellent stability, maintaining 78% and 90% of the initial PCE after 800 h and 1000 h of aging in air and nitrogen atmospheres, respectively. A reasonable APDI molecule based on interfacial engineering was designed to achieve synergistic enhancement of PSC performance. Unlike the isopropanol solution of APDI, pure API (which exists as a liquid at room temperature) contacting the perovskite causes rapid decomposition of thin films (Fig.  S1a, ESI † ). The molecular structures of API and APDI are shown in Fig.  S1b (ESI † ), and the details of APDI synthesis are in the Experimental Section. The H-NMR results showed that the chemical shifts of H in the iodinated API changed compared to the API. As depicted in Fig.  1a , the differences in chemical shift (Dd H ) between the iodinated API and API at the same position were as follows: Dd Ha = 1.56 ppm, Dd Hb = 0.67 ppm, Dd Hc = 0.87 ppm, Dd Hd = 0.30 ppm, Dd He = 0.35 ppm, and Dd Hf = 0.36 ppm. Among them, the variations in Dd Ha , Dd Hc and Dd Hf were the most significant, indicating that the N in the imidazole ring (CQN-) and branched chain (-NH 2 ) were halogenated. The detailed H-NMR spectra are shown in Fig.  S2  (ESI †). To further analyze the interaction between APDI and PbI 2 in the perovskite, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to obtain the information. As shown in the spectra of N 1s (Fig.  1b ), the peaks at 400.5 eV, 400.1 eV, and 398.1 eV can be attributed to Na, Nb, and Nc in the APDI, respectively; however, the signals of Na and Nc were shifted after introducing PbI 2 , and the Na had a slightly larger offset, which verifies that Na was favored over the Nc to bind to Pb 2+ .  13  By analyzing the H-NMR of APDI and APDI + PbI 2 (Fig.  1a ), the Ha, Hb, and Hc in APDI + PbI 2 demonstrated chemical shift with DdH of Z 0.03 ppm compared to APDI, while the DdH of Hd, He, Hf is B0.02 ppm, suggesting that there was an interaction between N cations from the imidazole ring and branched chain and Pb 2+ . The former is more prone to bind with Pb 2+ . The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the binding energies of -NH 3 + -and CQNH + -with surface Pb 2+ were À1.1 eV and À1.3 eV, respectively, further confirming the above conclusion (Fig.  1c  and d ). The Pb 4f spectra from XPS for the perovskite films before and after being treated with APDI are shown in Fig.  1e . The characteristic signals at 138.8 eV and 143.6 eV belonging to Pb 2+ shifted to 138.3 eV and 143.2 eV, respectively, after ADPI treatment, indicating again that APDI can interact with uncoordinated Pb 2+ defect.  4  The XPS spectrum of C1s (Fig.  1f ) shows the presence of peaks at 286.2 and 284.8 eV, which can be attributed to the CQN and C-C from the FA+. The emerged CQO peak located at 288.0 eV reflects the decomposition of perovskite induced by interaction with air during the process of exposure to ambient conditions. This result implies that the target film may have better resistance to H 2 O or O 2 .  14  To better capture the performance of the perovskite film without (control) and with (target) APDI treatment, various morphologies and optical characterizations were carried out. Top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed no particularly significant difference in the grain sizes of the control and target films (Fig.  S3 , ESI †). However, the contact angle of the control film increased from 57.91 to 76.91 after APDI treatment; this may be due to the presence of alkyl chains in APDI, which increased the hydrophobicity of the film surface (Fig.  S4a, ESI † ). The UV-vis absorption spectra demonstrated that the target film had better light absorption, which indicated that the APDI modification contributed to improving the quality of the perovskite film without a change in the band-gap (Fig.  S4b-d, ESI † ). Moreover, the roughness of the perovskite film was reduced from 10.7 nm to 8.19 nm after APDI modification, as observed in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements (Fig.  S3c , ESI †). The improved surface roughness means that the perovskite/C 60 interface can form better contact, which has the potential to promote efficient charge transport.  14  By steady-state (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), it could be observed that (Fig.  2a ) PL intensity of the target film was significantly enhanced than that of the control film, indicating that the APDI can reduce the nonradiative recombination loss of perovskite by the surface passivation and thus is conducive to improving film quality, which agrees with the results observed from UV-vis. The TRPL spectra were fitted by biexponential function (Fig.  2c  and Table  S2 , details are shown in the Characterization, ESI †), and it is found that the average lifetime (t avg ) of the target film was prolonged, further confirming the significant passivation effect of APDI.  6  Moreover, the defect density of perovskite without and with APDI was quantified by applying the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method.  13  The device structure was ITO/C 60 /perovskite/with or without APDI/C 60 /Au (for more details, see the Characterization in ESI †). As shown in Fig.  2c , the calculated N trap for the control and target devices were 3.82 Â 10 15 cm À3 and 3.03 Â 10 15 cm À3 , respectively. This proved that APDI could effectively reduce perovskite defects by surface passivation, which agreed with the analysis of PL/TRPL results. To clarify the effect of ADPI modification on photovoltaic performance (PV), inverted PSCs with the architecture of ITO/ PTAA/perovskite/C 60 /BCP/Ag were fabricated. Schematic diagrams of the device structure and surface passivation of ADPI are shown in Fig.  3a . The cross-sectional SEM (Fig.  3b ) image of PSC shows a clear compositional structure with a suitable thickness (B680 nm) of the perovskite layer.  11  For the regulation of perovskite surface properties, the concentration of functional compounds is extremely critical. Here, the optimal concentration of APDI (0.3 mg/ml) was determined by the current density-voltage (J-V) test, as shown in Fig.  S5  and Table  S3  (ESI †). From Fig.  3a , it can be observed that compared to the PV parameters of the control device (V oc = 1.097 V, J sc = 22.64 mA cm À2 , FF = 80.56%, and PCE = 20.01%), the performance of the target device is significantly enhanced (V oc = 1.121 V, J sc = 23.29 mA cm À2 , FF = 82.03%, and PCE = 21.41%). Additionally, the average values demonstrated improved PV parameters for the target devices (Fig.  S6  and Table  S4 , ESI †). The MPP (power output at the maximum power point) measurements for the control (19.11%) and target (20.53%) devices are shown in Fig.  3c . The steady-state PCE and J sc of the target devices were higher than those of the control devices, and the values matched with the J-V data. As shown in Fig.  3d , the integrated current (control = 21.75 mA cm À2 and target = 22.33 mA cm À2 ) from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) agrees with the J sc values from the J-V curves. To better understand the charge recombination characteristics of the devices, the V oc and J sc vs. light intensity were studied. The result of J sc vs. light intensity demonstrated (Fig.  S7a , ESI †) a fit slope closer to the value of 1 for the target device (a control = 0.962 and a target = 0.976), which indicated that, compared to the control device, the target device had lower bimolecular recombination. Fig.  4a  shows that the target device had a smaller slope of 1.386 kT/q compared to the pristine one (1.629 kT/q), indicating that the non-radiative charge recombination of the device was suppressed by the surface passivation of APDI. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed that the R s (R 1 ) of the target device was lower than that of the control one, while the R rec (R rec = R 2 + R 3 ) was higher than the control (Fig.  4b ).  15  As shown in Fig.  S7b (ESI † ), the target device also illustrated higher R rec at different bias voltages than the control, which further affirmed the reduced charge recombination at the perovskite/C 60 interface. Furthermore, the Mott-Schottky measurements showed (Fig.  4c ) that the target device had a higher built-in potential (V bi = 1.04 V) than the control one (V bi = 1.01 V), indicating that there was a stronger charge transfer capability at the interface after APDI   treatment.  16  To deeply illustrate the charge transport of PSCs at the perovskite/C 60 interface, we tested the relationship of photocurrent ( J ph ) vs. effective applied voltage (V eff ), as shown in Fig.  S7c  (for more details, see the characterization in ESI †), and the results showed that the exciton dissociation probability (P diss ) value of the target (B91%) device was higher than that of control (B89%), which indicates that the APDI-modified interface was more favorable for charge transfer to the electrode, thus promoting the reduction of charge recombination.  17  Considering the stability of the PSCs, we investigated the decay of the PV parameters of the devices in different environments. The results showed that the unencapsulated target device maintained 90% and 78% of the initial PCE after aging under nitrogen or air for 1000 h and 800 h, respectively, while the control device had only 81% and 62%, respectively (Fig.  4d ). By performing the contact angle test (Fig.  S3 , ESI †), it was clear that the perovskite/APDI films showed stronger hydrophobicity, which may be due to the effect of alkyl chains on the APDI. Therefore, this largely enhances the stability of the target devices in both air and nitrogen atmospheres. The decay trend of the remaining parameters (V oc , J sc , FF) is shown in Fig.  S8  (ESI †). To further investigate the reason for the degradation of device performance, we examined the variation in XRD parameters during the aging of perovskite films before and after APDI treatment. The results (Fig.  S9 , ESI †) showed that the pristine perovskite film exhibited a new signal attributed to the PbI 2 after being aged for 3 days in the air, indicating that the decomposition of perovskite film may be due to the vulnerability of defect sites on the perovskite surface to erosion by external factors. The erosion process of the target film by external factors was delayed based on the improvement of perovskite film quality, which was caused by the surface termination passivation effect of APDI and the presence of alkyl chains in APDI.  18  Overall, we employed an imidazole-based diiodide (APDI) to modulate the terminal environment of the Cs/FA perovskite surface to enhance the inverted PSC performance. Consequently, the APDI-treated device achieved a PCE of 21.41% and exhibited superior stability under air or nitrogen conditions. The reasons for performance enhancement were as follows: (i) the binding of N in APDI and uncoordinated Pb 2+ , which effectively reduces the defect density and the trapassisted charge recombination; (ii) the acceleration of the efficient charge transport at the perovskite/C 60 interface due to the fine interface properties between perovskite/APDI and C 60 ; (iii) the alkyl chains of APDI can enhance the hydrophobicity of perovskite films, thus beneficially reducing the risk of perovskite film being eroded by H 2 O. This study demonstrated a featured recipe for improving PSC performance by introducing ammonium salts with bifunctional groups onto the perovskite surface.

Title: Surface termination passivation of imidazole-based diiodide enabling efficient inverted perovskite solar cells
Experimental Section 
 Materials Poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) amine] (PTAA, 99%), Formamidine hydroiodide (FAI, 99.5%), cesium iodide (CsI, 99.9%), lead bromide (PbBr 2 , 99.99%), lead iodine (PbI 2 , 99.99%), C 60 and bathocuproine (BCP, 99.9%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology (China). Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.7%), isopropanol (IPA, 99.5%) and toluene (PhMe, 99.5%) were purchased from J&K. DMSO-d6 (99.95%) and Chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%) were manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich. N-(3-Aminopropyl)-imidazole (API, 99.5%) was bought from Macklin. All materials were used as received without further purification. 
 Synthesis of N-(3-Aminopropyl)-imidazole Diiodide (APIDI) N-(3-Aminopropyl)-imidazole (200 uL, 1.6 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (25 mL) in a flask. Then, 57% hydroiodic acid solution in water (5.0 ml, 5 mmol) was added slowly under ice water bath, and the mixture solution was stirred at room temperature reacted for 6 h. After the evaporation of solvent, the crude product was washed by ethyl acetate for 3 times to obtain a white solid. Finally, the resulting white powder was placed to Electronic Supplementary Material (ESI) for ChemComm.
dry under vacuum for 72 h at 70 ℃. 
 Device Fabrication Solar cells were fabricated based on the FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb(I 0.86 Br 0.14 ) 3 absorber layer, using the device structure with ITO/PTAA/FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb(I 0.86 Br 0.14 ) 3 /C 60 /BCP/Ag. ITO (indium tin oxide, 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm size, 1.1 mm thickness, 15 Ω/sq sheet resistance) substrates were cleaned by sonication with deionized water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol for 15 min, sequentially, which are then dried with N 2 . Then, the ITO were further treated by O 2 plasma for 6 minutes to remove the residual substances. PTAA (Mn≤6000) was dissolved in toluene (2 mg/ml) and spin-coated at the speed of 6000 rpm for 30 s and then PTAA (toluene) film annealed on the hotplate at 100 °C for 10 minutes. As for the perovskite precursor, we dissolved PbI 2 (493.7 mg), CsI (53.0 mg), PbBr 2 (66.1 mg) and FAI (171.3 mg) in 1 mL of mixed solvent (DMF/DMSO = 4:1, volume ratio). Then 60 μL of precursor solution was spun onto PTAA at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 6000 rpm for 30 s, note that 150 μL of CB was pipetted onto the spinning film at 15 s prior to the end of the second spinning step. Sequentially, the perovskite films were annealed 10 min with 100 °C. Finally, C 60 , BCP and silver were sequentially deposited on top of perovskite films by vacuum evaporation under a vacuum pressure of less than 1 × 10 -4 mbar. The target devices (perovskite surface treated by APDI) were prepared as follows: before depositing C 60 , APDI/IPA solution was spin-coated on the perovskite film surface at 4000 rpm/30 s, and then C 60 /BCP/Ag was deposited sequentially. All spin-coating steps were operated under N 2 atmosphere. The illumination area of devices is 0.0975 cm 2 . 
 Characterization The current density versus voltage (J-V) characteristics of the devices were measured in N 2 atmosphere using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G simulated 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm -2 ) from xenon lamp (Enli Technology Co.,Ltd.). The light source was calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell before the test. UV-vis absorption and transmission spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV2600 spectrophotometer. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained with fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLS980). Time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were measured with Lifespec II (Edinburgh Instrument, U.K.). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a Hitachi SU8010 instrument. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained on a Dimension Icon (Bruker) in tapping mode. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed on a Bruker D8 Advance instrument with a CuKα source (λ = 0.15406 nm). External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by a QE-R3011 instrument (Enli Technology Co., Ltd.). The stability test of devices is traced by storing the devices under the N 2 protection around ~25 °C or ambient condition with high relative humidity of ~50%. The maximum-power output stability of the devices was measured by monitoring the current output at a fixed bias voltage of 0.90 V (Control) and 0.92 V (Target), which is close to their maximum power voltage bias deduced from the reverse-scan J-V curves. XPS measurements were performed by the Thermo Scientific K-Alpha with a source of monochromatic Al-Ka (1486.6 eV). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and Mott-Schottky plots of solar cells were measured on an 608e Electrochemical Workstation (Chenhua, China). Density functional theory, as implemented in Vienna ab initio simulation package, was used to carry out the calculations presented here. The projector augmented wave method was used to treat the effective interaction of the core electrons and nucleus with the valence electrons, while exchange and correlation were described using the generalized gradient approximation of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional. The cut-off energy is set at 400 eV for the plane-wave basis restriction in the calculations. K-points are sampled under the Monkhorst-Pack scheme for the Brillouin-zone integration. K-points were sampled with 3x3x1 mesh. The PL decay curve was fitted using the following equation1 1 : f (𝑡) = 𝐴 1 exp (-𝑡/𝜏 1 ) + A 2 exp(-𝑡/𝜏 2 ) +B where τ 1 is the fast decay process related to bimolecular recombination, and τ 2 is the slow decay process associated with trap-assisted recombination. B is a constant for the baseline offset. A 1 and A 2 are constants representing the contributions of the fast and slow components, respectively. The average PL decay lifetime (τ ave ) can be obtained using the following equation: τ ave = 𝐴 1 τ 2 1 + 𝐴 2 τ 2 2 𝐴 1 τ 1 + 𝐴 2 τ 2 The trap state density can be calculated by V TFL using the following equation  2  : N trap = 2 0 V TFL /(qL 2 ) where  is the relative dielectric charge constant of perovskite,  0 is vacuum permittivity, q is the electric charge, and L is the thickness of perovskite film. The exciton dissociation probability (P diss ) was calculated using the following equation  3  : J ph = J L -J D (Eq. 1); V eff = V 0 -V app (Eq. 2); P diss = J ph /J sat (Eq. 3) where J L is the photocurrent density measured under 1 sun illumination and J D is the current density in the dark, V 0 and V app are the voltage when J ph equals zero and the applied bias, J sat is the saturation photocurrent density. The J sat is mainly related to the absorbed incident photons at high V eff , and it could be defined as the photocurrent, where the photogenerated excitons could be separated into free charge carriers and collected by corresponding electrodes. Therefore, the charge collection efficiency under different V eff could be estimated by equation 3. The slop value of J sc vs. light intensity was calculated using the following equation 4 : J sc  I α where α is an exponential factor related to charge recombination. The slop value of V oc vs. light intensity was calculated using the following equation  5  : V oc = (nkT/q) × ln(I) + constant where n is an ideal factor, K is Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature and q is elementary charge.
