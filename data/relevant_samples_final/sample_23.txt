Title: Passivation of X80 pipeline steel in a carbonate/bicarbonate solution and the effect of oxide film on hydrogen atom permeation into the steel
In this work, passivation of X80 pipeline steel was established at various passive potentials in a carbonate/bicarbonate solution. The passive films were characterized by topographical, compositional, and structural analysis techniques and electrochemical measurements. The effect of the passive film on hydrogen (H) atom permeation was investigated by electrochemical H permeation testing and scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy. The passive films primarily comprise Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 O 4 and FeOOH. In the stable passive region, notably at 0.25 V (saturated calomel electrode, SCE), the formed passive film exhibits the highest film resistance, and the smallest double-layer capacitance and donor density. In contrast, oxide films formed at -0.1 V(SCE) and 0.55 V(SCE), which close to the active-passive transition and the transpassive regions, respectively, differ in their characteristics. The oxide films formed at -0.1 V(SCE) and 0.25 V(SCE) exhibit resistance against H atom permeation, and a superior performance is observed in the film formed at 0.25 V(SCE). The oxide film formed at 0.55 V(SCE) exhibits increased H atom permeation, which is attributed to the degraded structure of the film. Thus, the presence of compact oxide film (scale) on steel surface can effectively inhibit H atom permeation into the steel.
Introduction It is acknowledged that the susceptibility of steels to hydrogen embrittlement (HE) increases with their strength grade  [1] [2] [3] . This causes a significant challenge for high-strength pipeline steels such as X80 steel suffering from the HE failure in environments that generate hydrogen (H) atoms. Internally, a corrosive environment can be generated by water condensation with dissolved gases such as CO 2 and H 2 S on the pipe wall surface. As a result, an acidic electrolyte is produced, where the hydrogen evolution happens, along with the steel corrosion  [4, 5] . Externally, the H atoms can be generated in electrolytes at coating breakages while a cathodic over-protection happens  [6] . Today, the X80 steel is widely used to make natural gas pipelines which transport high-pressure gas across countries and even continents  [7] . The HE susceptibility of X80 pipeline steel in service environments has been paid much attention, attracting wide research interests. It has been well known that the presence of a surface film on steels is effective to prevent permeation of H atoms, after their generation, into the steels. The film includes Zn, Ni, Cu and Al coatings  [8] [9] [10] , corrosion products  [11, 12] , and oxides  [13] . Various oxide films, generating through processes such as anodic polarization or occurring naturally on steel substrate, have been studied regarding their ability to inhibit the penetration of H atoms. It was found  [14]  that the diffusivity of H atoms in TiO 2 film was lower than that in the substrate Ti alloy. The Al 2 O 3 film exhibited a robust resistance to H atom due to the compactness of the film, blocking the permeation of H atoms through the film to reach the substrate in aqueous solutions  [15] . The solubility and diffusion coefficient of H atoms in Er 2 O 3 film were smaller by at least one order of magnitude than those parameters measured in carbon steels  [16] . The Cr 2 O 3 film was also confirmed to effectively impede the penetration of H atoms  [17] . In addition, iron oxides are usually generated on the surface of steel. Iron oxide film was found to prevent the penetration of H atoms in the early work conducted by Casanova and Crousier in 1996  [18] . Prior to pipeline construction, oxide scales (or called mill scales) are generated during the manufacturing stage, and usually present on the pipe steel surface. Depending on the specific manufacturing process and pipe supplier, the oxide scale can have varied compositions and structures. It has been established that the resistance of iron oxides to H atom Abbreviations: AFM, Atomic force microscopy; EDS, Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy; EIS, Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; H, Hydrogen atom; HE, Hydrogen embrittlement; SCE, Saturated calomel electrode; SHE, Standard hydrogen electrode; SKPFM, Scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy; XPS, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. permeation depends on the thickness, composition, and structure of the film  [13, 19] . At different passivation potentials, the morphology and structure of passive films vary, resulting in differences in their physical properties and thus the H permeating behavior  [20] . Thus, passive films (oxide films) with various structures and stabilities can be obtained by passivating the steel at specific passive potentials. The novelty of this work is to explore the essence of oxide films that are formed on a high-strength X80 pipeline steel under various passive potentials in a carbonate/bicarbonate solution in inhibition of H atom permeation. The oxide films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), along with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott-Schottky measurements. Electrochemical H-charging and scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) were employed to determine the H atom diffusion and distribution in the oxide film and X80 steel substrate. An index evaluating the resistance of the oxide film to H atom permeation was proposed, and the inhibiting mechanism was discussed. 
 Experimental 
 Steel and specimen The specimens used in this work were made by an X80 pipeline steel plate, with a chemical composition (wt.%) 0.082 C, 0.147 Si, 1.590 Mn, 0.011 P, 0.035 Cr, 0.214 Mo, 0.203 Ni, 0.045 Al, 0.001 Co, 0.152 Cu, 0.051 Nb, 0.015 Ti, 0.027 V, 0.005 W, 0.001 Pb, 0.003 Sn, 0.034 Ta, and Fe balance. The specimens for preparation and characterization of oxide film were sectioned into the dimension of 10 mm × 10 mm × 10 mm, as shown in Fig.  1a . The specimens for electrochemical H-permeation testing were cut into the dimension of 30 mm × 30 mm × 2 mm (Fig.  1b ). All specimens were ground with SiC papers up to 2000 grits. 
 Passive film preparation The passive film (oxide film) was prepared on the steel specimen by electrochemical anodic polarization of X80 steel in a solution consisting of 0.1 M NaHCO 3 +0.05 M Na 2 CO 3 , with a pH of 9.0. The steel specimen was used as the working electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a Pt plate as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. Prior to anodic polarization, the specimen was cathodically polarized at -1.0 V(SCE) for 5 min to remove any oxide scale and corrosion products. Potentiodynamic polarization was conducted on the WE from -1.0 V(SCE) to 1.0 V(SCE) at a potential scanning rate of 0.167 mV/s  [21] . The passive potentials for oxide film formation on the steel were selected based on the potentiodynamic polarization measurement results. The passivation time was 30 min. Notably, pipelines are pressurized infrastructure. During operation, the pipe steel is always under stress conditions. It is expected that the stress will change both the strength and structure of the passive film, and thus, the H permeation behavior. This work investigated steel passivation under stress-free conditions. The effect of stress on passive film and the H permeation behavior will be investigated in further work. 
 Electrochemical measurements and characterization of the passive film The open-circuit potential of the passivated steel specimen was monitored in a NS4 solution (0.483 g/L NaHCO 3 0.122 g/L KCl, 0.181 g/ L CaCl⋅2H 2 O and 0.131 g/L MgSO 4 ⋅7H 2 O) for about 3600 s until it reached a steady value. The solution was used to simulate the electrolyte trapped under disbonded coating on pipelines  [6] . Moreover, hydrogen evolution is a potential cathodic reaction to generate H atoms during the steel corrosion in the solution. The EIS measurement was performed on the specimen over a frequency range between 10 -2 Hz and 10 5 Hz under a disturbance voltage of 10 mV. After the EIS measurement, the Mott-Schottky curve was measured on the passivated steel specimen within a voltage range of -0.4 V(SCE) to 1.0 V(SCE) under a test frequency of 1000 Hz. To characterize the prepared passive films, an AFM (MFP-3D Origin, Oxford Instruments) was employed to measure the surface roughness of the films. The scanning mode of the probe was set as contact, with a scanning rate of 0.5 Hz and a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels. The films were further characterized using a SEM (ZEISS EV0 MA15) coupled with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to determine the elemental composition of the films. In addition, the chemical valence and composition of the films were measured by an XPS (Thermo Scientific K-Alpha). 
 Electrochemical H-permeation testing The electrochemical H-charging tests were conducted through a Devanathan-Stachurski double-cell. The H-charging cell contained NS4 solution, and the H-detection cell contained 0.1 M NaOH solution. The solutions were deoxygenated with high-purity N 2 (99.999%) for 30 min. The CE and RE were Pt sheets and SCE, respectively. The WE was a steel specimen of 2 mm in thickness and 1.8 cm 2 in area. The oxide film was exposed to the H-charging solution. At the H-detection side, a Gamry Interface 1010E electrochemical workstation was used to apply +300 mV(SCE) on the WE. The NaOH solution was purged with N 2 gas until the background current density was below 0.1 μA/cm 2 . A cathodic current density of 15 mA/cm 2 was applied on the H-charging side of the specimen through a PINE AFRDE5 potentiostat, and the H-permeation current density was continuously measured. The testing temperature was maintained at 20 ± 1 • C. It is noted that, as the NS4 solution concentration changes, the surface condition of the steel will become different. For example, pipeline steels can be passivated in concentrated carbonate/bicarbonate solutions, while it is in active dissolution condition in diluted bicarbonate solution  [6] . As a result, the H-permeating current density changes. Further work will be required to investigate the effect of solution concentration on H permeation behavior, while determining if an optimal concentration exists. 
 Distribution of H atoms in the steel specimen characterized by SKPFM After H-charging, the SKPFM was employed to measure Volta potential of the detection side of the specimen. It is believed that H atoms present on the specimen surface affect the Volta potential  [22] . It is noted that the Volta potential measurement in this work is not subjected to a signal inversion. According to the specification of the equipment, a more positive (or less negative) Volta potential indicates a higher H atom concentration. The SKPFM measurement was conducted by AFM (MFP-3D Origin, Oxford Instruments). The measuring parameters included a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels, a scanning range of 20 μm × 20 μm, and a scanning frequency of 0.5 Hz  [23] . During Volta potential measurements, a voltage of 3 V was applied on the probe tip. The distance between the probe and the specimen surface was maintained at 50 nm. The test was  
 Results 
 Passivation of X80 steel in a carbonate/bicarbonate solution Fig.  2  illustrates the potentiodynamic polarization curves of X80 steel in 0.1 M NaHCO 3 +0.05 M Na 2 CO 3 solution. To ensure the reliability of characteristic potentials in the active, passive and transpassive regions, two measurements were conducted and both results were present. It is seen that the characteristic potentials almost copy each other, while the current density values between two measurements exist some differences. This is probably caused by the varied surface conditions of steel electrode in the measurements. The corrosion potential of the steel in the solution is -0.74 V(SCE). The active-passive transition range is between -0.68 V(SCE) and -0.23 V(SCE). The passive potential ranges from -0.23 V(SCE) to 0.83 V(SCE). To form passive film on the steel, three potentials are selected, namely -0.1 V(SCE), 0.25 V(SCE) and 0.55 V(SCE), representing the passive potentials that are close to the active-passive transition, at the stable passive region, and close to the transpassive region, respectively. It is noted that the selection of the potential of 0.55 V(SCE) considers the potential for the occurrence of oxygen evolution reaction: 4OH -→ 2H 2 O + O 2 + 4e (1) According to Nernst equation (  2 ): E = E 0 OH -/H2 O - 0.0592 4 log [OH -] 4 / p O2 [H 2 O] 2 = E 0 OH -/H2O - 0.0592 4 log [OH -] 4 (2) where E 0 OH -/H2O = 1.229 V (standard hydrogen electrode, SHE), and [OH -] = 10 -3 M in the solution. The potential for oxygen evolution to occur is 0.698 V(SHE), which is 0.457 V(SCE). Thus, the potential of 0.55V (SCE) is chosen, indicating the passive potential while approaching the transpassive region. 
 Characterization of the prepared passive films Fig.  3  shows the AFM topography of the steel specimen free of passive film. The surface roughness of the specimen is 2.02 nm on average. The grooves induced by the polishing process are evident. These grooves are longitudinal in direction, with a maximum roughness of 5 nm. After passivation at various potentials, the passive films on the steel surface are characterized by AFM and the topographic profiles of the films are shown in Fig.  4 . The grooves are not observable, suggesting film formation on the steel surface. Many nanoscale features are detected, and the average and local roughness is shown in Table  1 . These nanofeatures are associated with the formation of passive film  [20] . It is seen that the local roughness (or size) of the nanofeatures on the passive film formed at 0.25 V(SCE) is the greatest, indicating the more rapid growth of the film. The nanofeatures on the film formed at 0.55 V(SCE) is the smallest, showing the reduced growth of the passive film at this potential. The elemental composition of the passive films is shown in Table  2 . The primary elements contained in the films are C, O, Si, Mn, and Fe. At the potential of 0.25 V(SCE), the O content is the greatest, while the Fe content decreases. This result implies that more O participates in the steel passivation, forming thicker film, as compared to the passive films formed at other two potentials. The highest O content in the film formed at 0.25 V(SCE) is also attributed to the increased film-formation rate as the potential increases. When the potential is too positive, such as 0.55 V (SCE), the oxygen evolution reaction may occur, causing the reduced O content in the film. The element C may primarily come from the solution phase as the X80 steel contains a low C content. In the 0.1 M NaHCO 3 +0.05 M Na 2 CO 3 solution, the primary cathodic reaction is the reduction of dissolved oxygen, generating OH -ions. The anodic polarization causes oxidization of the steel to form an initial layer of FeCO 3 : 1/2O 2 + H 2 O + 2e→2OH - (3) Fe + HCO - 3 → FeCO 3 + H + + 2e (4) A further oxidation of FeCO 3 occurs under passivation, forming iron oxides Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 O 4 and FeOOH  [24] : 4FeCO 3 + O 2 + 4H 2 O → 2Fe 2 O 3 + 4HCO - 3 + 4H + (5) 6FeCO 3 + O 2 + 6H 2 O → 2Fe 3 O 4 + 6HCO - 3 + 6H + (6) 4FeCO 3 + O 2 + 6H 2 O → 4FeOOH + 4CO 2- 3 + 8H + (7) The passive film includes two layers. The inner layer is identified as Fe 3 O 4 , while the outer layer consists of a combination of Fe 2 O 3 and FeOOH, as schematically shown in Fig.  6    [25] . During growth of the oxide film and the formation of FeOOH in the outer layer, the internal stress within the film increases, resulting in defects or even cracks in the film. 
 Electrochemical measurement of the passive films The EIS plots, including both Nyquist diagrams and Bode plots, measured on the steel that is passivated at the three passive potentials in NS4 solution are shown in Fig.  7 . As a comparison, the EIS of bare steel is also included. It is seen that the size of the semicircle and the |Z| value are the greatest at the passive potential of 0.25 V(SCE), indicating that a stable passive film is formed on the steel surface. Compared to the results obtained at -0.1 V(SCE), the semicircle size and the |Z| value are the smallest at the potential of 0.55 V(SCE), i.e., the potential close to the transpassive region. Thus, the passive film formed at this potential is the least stable. The measured impedance data are fitted with the equivalent circuit shown in Fig.  7a , where R s is solution resistance, Q f is constant phase element of the passive film, R f is resistance of the passive film, Q dl is CPE of the double-charge layer, and R ct is charge-transfer resistance. The reason for using the constant phase element to replace capacitance is that the surface condition of the steel electrode during corrosion usually makes it deviate from an ideal capacitor. Table  3  shows the fitting impedance parameters under various conditions. The fitting error range is between 3.9 × 10 -4 and 5.7 × 10 -4 . The greatest R f of 694 Ω cm 2 and R ct of 1900 Ω cm 2 are observed at the passive potential of 0.25 V(SCE). At the passive potential of -0.1 V(SCE), the R f and R ct values are 598 Ω cm 2 and 1260 Ω cm 2 , respectively. When the potential is 0.55 V(SCE), the R f and R ct decrease to 343 Ω cm 2 and 1130 Ω cm 2 , respectively. The Mott-Schottky curves of the passive films formed at three potentials are shown in Fig.  8 . Within the linear potential region from 0.5 V (SCE) to 0.9 V(SCE), the Mott-Schottky plots show a positive slope for all the prepared passive films. This result suggests that the passive films are an n-type semiconductor. The donor and acceptor densities of the passive film can be calculated by: 1 C SC = 2 eεε 0 N q ( E -E fb - kT e ) (8) where C SC is the capacitance of the semiconducting film, e is electron charge (1.6 × 10 -19 C), ε is the dielectric constant of the passive film, which is considered as 15.6, ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity constant (8.85419 × 10 -12 F/m), N q is the donor density (1/m 3 ), E is the applied potential (V), E fb is flat-band potential (V), k is Boltzmann's constant (1.38 × 10 -23 J/K), and T is temperature (K). The donor densities of the passive films forming at -0.1 V(SCE), 0.25 V(SCE), and 0.55 V(SCE) are determined as 4.4 × 10 19 cm -3 , 3.0 × 10 21 cm -3 , and 3.8 × 10 19 cm -3 , respectively. There is the greatest donor density in the passive film forming at 0.25 V(SCE). 
 Hydrogen permeation behavior of the passivated steel The electrochemical H-permeation current density curves of X80 steel passivated at various potentials are illustrated in Fig.  9 . The relationship between the sub-surface H concentration, C L , and the steadystate H permeating current density, i c , is defined as  [26] :   
 Table 1 Surface roughness of the passive films at regions A and B, as labelled in Fig.  4 , formed at various potentials.   C L = φ 0 N a D 0 exp ( - 8000 RT ) ̅̅̅ ̅ i c √ ( 9 ) where φ 0 is H permeating constant, D 0 is H diffusivity, and N a is Avogadro constant. Thus, as the H permeating current density increases, the H concentration within the steel increases. Compared to the bare steel, the steady H-permeating current density decreases from 0.87 μA/cm 2 to 0.68 μA/cm 2 and 0.55 μA/cm 2 as the steel is passivated at -0.1 V(SCE) and 0.25 V(SCE), respectively. The results imply that, as the passive film forms and becomes more stable, the blocking effect on H atom permeation increases. However, at the passive potential of 0.55 V(SCE), the Hpermeation current density increased to 0.87 μA/cm 2 , which is like the steady-state H permeating current density measured on bare steel. The result shows that the passive film formed at this potential does not possess sufficient ability to inhibit H permeation. At high passive potentials which are close to the transpassive region, the passive film usually contains appreciable structural defects due to the occurrence of oxygen evolution reaction. According to Eq. (  1 ), the oxygen evolution occurs at 0.457 V(SCE) under conditions in this work. As a result, H atoms can easily permeate into the steel. Notably, the difference in steady-state H permeating current densities measured on the steel passivating at different potentials is small. Considering the continuously increasing H atom content with extended time, the effect of the passive film on reduced H entry in the steel can be realized. 
 Measurements of volta potential of the passivated steel by SKPFM Fig.  10  shows the Volta potential of bare X80 steel before and after Hcharging. It is seen that the H-charging makes the Volta potential of the    steel increase from 0.704-0.884 V to 1.069-1.474 V. The result implies that the presence of H atoms in the steel is associated with an elevated Volta potential. Thus, the SKPMP measurement of Volta potential provides a potential method for H atom detection in steels. Fig.  11  shows the Volta potential measurements on the passivated steel at various passive potentials. Compared with the result in Fig.  11a , the Volta potentials of the passivated steel are more positive, indicating that H atoms can still permeate into the steel even if it is passivated with the presence of a layer of oxide film. When the steel is passivated at -0.1 V(SCE) and 0.25 V(SCE), the Volta potential of the steel after Hcharging, i.e., 0.904-1.236 V and 0.864-1.123 V (Fig.  12a  and b ), respectively, are lower than the Volta potential of the bare steel (Fig.  11b ). Thus, the passive films formed at the two potentials can inhibit the H atom permeation. When the oxide film is formed at 0.55 V (SCE), the Volta potential of the steel ranges between 1.783 V and 2.730 V, which is greater than the Volta potential measured on bare steel, indicating that the passive film forming at this potential is not useful for inhibition of the H atom permeation. 
 Discussion One major finding of this work is that the passive film (namely oxide film), which primarily contains Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 O 4 and FeOOH, present on the steel surface can inhibit the H atom permeation into the steel, while the inhibiting performance depends on the passive potential which affects the morphology and structure of the film. A model illustrating the H atom diffusion and concentration distribution across the oxide film is shown in Fig.  12 . The H atom concentrations at the outer and inner surfaces of the oxide film are denoted as C 01 and C 02 , respectively. The H atom concentration within the film is assumed to follow Fick's first law, i.e., a linear concentration gradient exists across the film. On the Hdetection side, i.e., at the L f + L X80 (where L f and L X80 are the thicknesses of the oxide film and the steel specimen, respectively), the H atom concentration is assumed to be zero. This means all H atoms are oxidized into H + when they arrive at the detection side. The H fluxes in the oxide film (J f ) and X80 steel (J m ) are written as:   J f = D f (C 01 -C 02 ) L f ( 10 ) J m = D m C 0 L m ( 11 ) J eq = J f = J m (12) J f = i p F ( 13 ) where D f is H diffusion coefficient in the film (m 2 /s), D m is H diffusion coefficient in the steel (m 2 /s), L f is thickness of the film (m), L m is thickness of the steel specimen (m), J eq is the equivalent H flux (mol/s). The H diffusion coefficient in the oxide film is different from that in the steel. The H atom concentrations at the interface between the oxide film and the steel are written as C 02 and C 0 , respectively. As there is the same chemical potential of H atoms at the interface, C 0 S m = C 02 S f ( 14 ) φ m = D eff S m ( 15 ) φ f = D eff S f ( 16 ) where S m is H solubility in X80 steel, S f is H solubility in the oxide film, and φ m and φ f are H permeability in X80 steel and the oxide film, respectively. The resistance of the oxide film to H atom permeation is described by the ratio of φ m φ f . The inhibiting performance of the oxide film to H atom permeation is expressed as  [13] : φ m φ f = ( i ∞ pm i ∞ p - 1 ) L m L f (17) A greater value of φ m φ f indicates a greater resistance of the oxide film to H atom permeation. The resistance of oxide film to H permeation as a function of the passive potential is shown in Fig.  13 , where the H diffusivity in the film is also displayed. Moreover, relevant values on bare steel are marked to illustrate the influence of oxide film on H permeation and diffusion. It is seen that the oxide film formed at 0.25 V (SCE) exhibits the greatest resistance to H permeation, and the φ m φ f value is up to 6471. The effective H diffusivity, D eff , is the smallest of 5.33 × 10 -6 cm 2 /s, which is about 27.58% of the D eff measured on bare steel. The oxide film formed at -0.1 V(SCE) also has a good H-permeation resistance, with the φ m φ f value of 5,429, and the D eff of 5.86 × 10 -6 cm 2 /s. However, for the oxide film formed at 0.55 V(SCE), there is no resistance to H permeation, as indicated by a rapid drop of φ m φ f , accompanying with an increase in D eff (9.80 × 10 -6 cm 2 /s). The results show that the oxide film formed at the stable passive potential, i.e., 0.25 V(SCE), can effectively block the H atom permeation through the film. This is owing to the formed passive film and its electrochemical properties. As a comparison, the oxide film formed at 0.55 V (SCE) which is close to the transpassive region is not effective to inhibit the H atom permeation. Generally, the oxide film formed on X80 steel subjected to anodic passivation in NS4 solution primarily contains an inner layer of Fe 3 O 4 and an outer layer of Fe 2 O 3 /FeOOH, as proved by the XPS measurements. This is also consistent with the authors' previous work  [20] . At low passive potentials such as -0.1 V(SCE), the film-formation rate increases with potential, resulting in an increased thickness of the outer layer containing Fe(III). As a result, the passive film formed at 0.25 V(SCE) becomes thicker and exhibits greater film resistance (Table  3 ), more effective to inhibit the H permeation as compared to the film formed at -0.1 V(SCE). It is noted that, as the film thickness increases, the surface roughness also increases, as shown in Table  2 . This reflects that the film growth on the steel surface does not maintain sufficient uniformity. When the steel is passivated at higher potentials, oxygen evolution may happen. The potential for the occurrence of oxygen evolution reaction is 0.425 V(SCE) in this work. When the passivation potential is up to 0.55 V(SCE), both steel oxidation and oxygen evolution occur simultaneously. This causes not only the transformation of outer oxide layer to FeOOH, but also a disturbance to the film formation. As a result, the film thickness reduces, and the defect density increases in the film. Thus, the H permeation is not inhibited effectively by the film. The performance of oxide film for blocking H permeation is related to the structure of the film. Generally, a more compact oxide film results in a greater film resistance. From EIS measurement results in Table  3 , the passive film formed at 0.25 V(SCE) exhibits the greatest film resistance. It is expected that the film is more compact, as compared with the films formed at different potentials. Thus, the blocking effect of the film on H permeation is enhanced. On the contrary, the film formed at 0.55 V(SCE) has the smallest film resistance, which is associated with the least effective performance in blocking H permeation. This discussion is supported by the measured electrochemical H permeating current density on the passivated steel in Fig.  9 . Similarly, a compact oxide film causes a reduction of diffusivity of H atoms in the film  [27] . Thus, the H diffusion is also inhibited with improved structural compactness of the film. As demonstrated by the XPS measurement results, the passive film is predominantly composed of an inner Fe 3 O 4 layer and an outer Fe 2 O 3 / FeOOH layer. At low passive potentials such as -0.1 V (SCE), the film formation rate increases with the potential, resulting in an increased thickness of the outer layer containing Fe(III). For the passive film formed at 0.25 V(SCE), it is expected that the film thickness, resistance, and the structure, as well as the H permeation blocking performance, are better than the film formed at -0.1 V(SCE). At high passive potentials, oxygen evolution reaction potentially occurs. When the steel is passivated at 0.55 V(SCE), the oxygen evolution reaction occurs. The produced oxygen bubbles distort the growth of passive film, degrading the structural compactness. As a result, the blocking performance to H permeation is compromised. Particularly, the H permeation is concentrated at some specific open defects in the film. A high local concentration gradient at the defects may contribute to shortened time lag for H permeation to occur. It must be noted that the explanation is speculative. Further work is required to confirm the preference of H permeation at local defects relative to the entire bare steel surface. 
 Conclusions Under anodic polarization in the 0.1 M NaHCO 3 and 0.05 M Na 2 CO 3 solution, the X80 pipeline steel demonstrates passivation. The resulting passive films primarily comprise Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 O 4 and FeOOH. The thickness, structure, and electrochemical properties of the oxide film are contingent upon the passive potential. In the stable passive region, notably at 0.25 V(SCE), a thick layer (174 nm) of dense oxide film is formed. This film exhibits the highest charge-transfer resistance, and the smallest double-layer capacitance and donor density. In contrast, oxide films formed at -0.1 V(SCE) and 0.55 V(SCE), closer to the activepassive transition and the transpassive regions, respectively, differ in their characteristics. The oxide films formed at -0.1 V(SCE) and 0.25 V(SCE) exhibit resistance against H atom permeation, with superior performance observed in the film formed at 0.25 V(SCE). A permeation resistance ratio, denoted as φ m φ f , is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the oxide film's resistance to H atom permeation. However, the oxide film formed at 0.55 V(SCE) exhibits increased H atom permeation attributed to the presence of defects and cracks on the film. Thus, the presence of oxide scale on steel surface can effectively inhibit the permeation of H atoms into the steel.

 Fig. 5 5 shows the XPS measurement results of Fe 2p and O 1s peaks associated with the composition of the passive films formed at various passive potentials. The passive films mainly consist of Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 O 4 and FeOOH. The intensity of the Fe and O peaks changes with the passive potential. The passive films formed at -0.1 V(SCE) and 0.25 V(SCE) contain more Fe 2 O 3 . At the potential of 0.55V(SCE), the content of Fe 3 O 4 decreases and that of FeOOH increases.
