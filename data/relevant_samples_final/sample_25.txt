Title: Interface passivation for 31.25%-efficient perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells

Silicon solar cells are approaching their theoretical efficiency limit of 29%. This limitation can be exceeded with advanced device architectures, where two or more solar cells are stacked to improve the harvesting of solar energy. In this work, we devise a tandem device with a perovskite layer conformally coated on a silicon bottom cell featuring micrometric pyramids-the industry standard-to improve its photocurrent. Using an additive in the processing sequence, we regulate the perovskite crystallization process and alleviate recombination losses occurring at the perovskite top surface interfacing the electron-selective contact [buckminsterfullerene (C 60 )]. We demonstrate a device with an active area of 1.17 square centimeters, reaching a certified power conversion efficiency of 31.25%. T he deployment of photovoltaics (PV) can be accelerated by maximizing the electrical power produced per unit area because the cost distribution of a PV system is now dominated by the balance of system components (such as the mounting system, wiring, manpower, and inverters) rather than by the cost of the PV panels. This balance of system costs scales roughly with the installed area and favors PV technologies with a high power-to-panel area ratio. However, the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells of 26.8% (1) is approaching the theoretical limit of 29.5%  (2) . The only experimentally validated approach to overcome this PCE limitation under 1-sun illumination conditions consists of combining several complementary photoactive materials (meaning multiple junctions) in a single device  (3) . Among the different types of multijunction designs reported to date, the combination of c-Si with a metal halide perovskite in a tandem solar cell has been the focus of intense research efforts given the potential for both high PCE and low manufacturing costs (4). Metal halide perovskites combine several key properties for effective multijunction PV, including a high absorption coefficient with a sharp absorption edge  (5) , ambipolar charge transport with long diffusion lengths (6, 7), and a compositionally tunable bandgap energy (E g )  (8) . A thin-film perovskite solar cell can be deposited directly on the front side of a c-Si cell to lower thermalization losses and extend the range of achievable PCE to >30%  (3) . The performance potential of monolithic two-terminal tandem architectures is illustrated by reported PCEs as high as 33.7% for 1-cm 2 illuminated areas  (1) . Most of the highefficiency tandem cells reported to date use a Si wafer in which the front surface is mechanically or chemically polished  (9)  or features an adapted submicrometric texture smaller than the perovskite layer thickness (typically from 500 nm to 1 mm)  (10) (11) (12) (13) . This planar or nanotextured front-side topography-wafers used in the PV industry are usually etched to form pyramids of a few micrometers in heightenables the deposition of pinhole-free perovskite films by standard solution-based processes. However, this modification comes at the expense of optical performance because the front side of the tandem is flat, and also when using a submicrometric Si texture, because the latter is planarized by the nonconformal solution-processed perovskite film. Consequently, these cell designs exhibit more reflection losses at the front of the tandem because of an absence of double-bounce effects  (14) . Overall, a pyramidal texture at the front of the tandem device limits reflection losses because it enables the absorption of reflected light in neighboring pyramids, whereas the presence of texture on both sides of the Si wafer improves the trapping of infrared light  (15) . We previously reported a hybrid two-step deposition method combining thermal evaporation and spin coating to conformally coat the perovskite layer on micrometric Si pyramids, resulting in perovskite/c-Si tandems in which both rear and front sides were textured  (16) . Although these tandem cells had a high photocurrent thanks to the front-side pyramidal texture, nonradiative recombination losses were substantial. One challenge is that most top-surface passivation approaches reported to date are not directly applicable to micrometric textures because they involve depositing nanometric organic layers from liquid solutions  (17) (18) (19) . These processing routes usually yield nonconformal (incomplete) coatings on such surface textures. Building on our previous work  (16) , we demonstrate enhanced tandem performance using phosphonic acids in two different roles to passivate interfacial defects: first, as a hole-transport layer (HTL),  [4-(3,6- dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz)  (9)  and second, as a perovskite additive in the form of 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzylphosphonic acid (FBPAc)  (20) . Together with a micrometric texture standard in the c-Si PV industry and an optimization of the layers located at the front of the tandem for further optical gains, these passivation strategies mitigate voltage losses and result in tandem device efficiencies >30%, with an accredited value of 31.25%. 
 Identification and mitigation of voltage losses in perovskite top cells To assess loss pathways triggered by nonradiative recombination, we measured the photoluminescence quantum yield of different layer stacks representative of our p-i-n perovskite solar cells used in tandem cells. We quantified the internal voltage potential (in relative terms), or quasi-Fermi-level splitting (QFLS), created within the cesium formamidinium lead iodide bromide [Cs 0.18 FA 0.82 Pb(I, Br) 3 ] absorber under light excitation (Fig.  1A ). Flat glass/indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates were first coated with a HTL, either 2,2′,7,7′tetra(N,N-di-tolyl)amino-9,9-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-TTB), N4,N4,N4'',N4''-tetra([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-[1,1':4',1''-terphenyl]-4,400-diamine (TaTM), or Me-4PACz (fig.  S1 ). These three materials were selected on the basis of their compatibility with textured surfaces. The first two can be thermally evaporated, and the latter can self-assemble on ITO to yield a conformal coating on textured surfaces  (21) . We then deposited a perovskite thin film using a hybrid two-step deposition method  (16) . Specifically, a CsBr/PbI 2 template was coevaporated on either flat glass substrates or glass/ITO/HTL stacks before spin coating an organo-halide solution consisting of FABr and FAI and, in some cases, with FBPAc. A thermal annealing step in an ambient atmosphere at 150°C converted the films into a perovskite phase (see the experimental section for details). In view of making tandems, a perovskite composition with an optical E g of was selected (fig.  S2 ). Some of these stacks were then completed by a C 60 electron-transport layer (ETL) thermally evaporated in high-vacuum conditions. The QFLS of bare perovskite layers deposited on glass (left column) remains constant when incorporating FBPAc (Fig.  1A ). When inserting the HTL (Fig.  1A , hollow diamond), the addition of FBPAc increases the QFLS slightly with all three HTLs (+20 meV). Overall, QFLS losses relative to the glass/perovskite reference are highest on spiro-TTB (-80 and -45 meV compared with the glass/perovskite reference, without and with FBPAc, respectively), followed by TaTm (-65 and -40 meV), and lowest on Me-4PACz (-25 and -10 meV). These differences suggest improved surface passivation with Me-4PACz  (9) . Without FBPAc, the addition of the C 60 ETL (Fig.  1A , filled diamond) on the perovskite leads to substantial losses in QFLS (-100 to -50 meV in addition to the HTL-induced losses) caused by the formation of trap states in the first monolayer of C 60  (22) . On the other hand, the incorporation of FBPAc in the perovskite film synthesis mitigates some of these ETLinduced losses, resulting in a +100-meV QFLS gain compared with FBPAc-free films. Overall, FBPAc suppresses Pb 2+ /Pb 0 surface defects, as shown by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in Fig.  1B  and figs. S3 to S5. The phosphonic group of FBPAc coordinates with Pb-related defects as also demonstrated elsewhere  (20, 23, 24) , effectively lowering the population of top-surface nonradiative recombination states  (25) . Furthermore, the positive impact of FBPAc is mainly observed when C 60 is present: FBPAc likely separates the perovskite from the C 60 layer, reducing the population of deep trap states forming in C 60 when it is in direct contact with the perovskite  (11, 22) . It is important to note that some effects may affect the QFLS data presented in this work. First, the presence of oxygen and humidity during the annealing step and subsequent photoluminescence measurements may lead to a passivation of Pb-related defects  (26) . Second, x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns show that the addition of FBPAc decreases the fraction of PbI 2 crystalline phases remaining at the end of the crystallization process (Fig.  1C  and fig.  S8 )-an effect that should lower the photoluminescence quantum yield and hence the QFLS of films featuring the additive  (27) . Other effects are less likely to explain the QFLS trends we observed. For example, FBPAc and C 60 do not appear to chemically interact based on additional XPS data (fig.  S6 ). Also, the electronic band structure of uncoated perovskite films treated with the additive shifts by ~0.5 eV because of the strong dipole moment of FBPAc (fig.  S7 ), in line with literature  (28) . However, FBPAc is unlikely to lead to such a conduction band level offset in full devices considering the improved solar cell performance achieved with FBPAc (see below). 
 Modification of the perovskite crystallization kinetics and resulting microstructure To understand the impact of FBPAc on the perovskite crystallization process, grazingincidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed in situ at 150°C starting from a CsBr/PbI 2 template freshly spin-coated with FAI/FABr (Fig.  2A  and fig.  S8 ). Although the crystallization onset of the perovskite (110) and (002) planes (q ~10.1 nm -1 ) (29) is similar with or without the additive, FBPAc slows down the perovskite crystallization rate 100 s into the experiment (Fig.  2A ). The intensity of these perovskite reflections then continues to increase throughout the experiment up to ~400 san effect not observed without the additive. Without FBPAc, the peak intensity stabilizes after 150 s and remains at a lower value. This modification of the crystallization pathway by FBPAc is also observed when analyzing PbI 2 peaks (Fig.  2A ). As in Fig.  1C , their evolution confirms a more-complete conversion of the CsBr/PbI 2 template to a perovskite phase when using FBPAc. Overall, this two-step and globally slower crystallization kinetics with the additive likely originates from the interaction between Pb 2+ and FBPAc  (20, 23, 24) . FBPAc slows down the conversion of the CsBr/PbI 2 template to the perovskite phase because of competition between FBPAc and other perovskite precursors (namely FAI and FABr) for a coordination with Pb 2+  (25, 30) . Advantageously, this difference in formation kinetics results in films with apparently larger and more clearly defined perovskite domains because FBPAc may inhibit the nucleation of new perovskite grains or domains, as shown by top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig.  2B ). Submicrometer dark regions are observed on perovskite films featuring FBPAc (Fig.  2B ). From gas-field ion-source helium and neon ion microscopy coupled with secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) (Fig.  2C  and fig.  S9 )  (31) , these clusters are found to be rich in F and C, which is indicative of the clustering of the FBPAc excess on the perovskite surface. Films processed without FBPAc do not show any clustering and feature a lower amount of F and C on their surface (Fig.  2 , C and D, and The large reduction in QFLS losses suggests that FBPAc is also present in between the surface clusters. This hypothesis stems from the logarithmic dependency between QFLS and surface recombination current (and hence nonpassivated surface fraction, presuming that FBPAc is reducing the surface recombination current by a few orders of magnitude). If FBPAc was present only at the position of the clusters detected by SIMS, meaning that ~90% of the film surface would be free of FBPAc, the difference in QFLS would be limited to ~3 meV [DQFLS = 25.7 meV × ln(1/0.9) ≅ 3 meV]. We observe a gain in QFLS of >50 meV when C 60 is present (Fig.  1A ), highlighting that regions between the clusters also feature FBPAc. Overall, FBPAc passivates Pb-related defects and mitigates the formation of trap states in the C 60 layer by segregating on the perovskite top surface, with the excess forming clusters on the surface. 
 Perovskite single junctions and perovskite/c-Si tandem solar cells These perovskite films were incorporated into ~0.49-cm 2 glass/ITO/HTL/perovskite/ C 60 /bathocuproine (BCP) (or SnO x )/Cu (or Ag) single junctions to validate the improvements induced by FBPAc with current-voltage (J-V) measurements (1000 W/m 2 , AM1.5G spectrum, masked with a 0.25-cm 2 aperture; fig.  S14 ). The open-circuit voltage (V oc ) of the devices improves by 20 to 30 mV when switching from spiro-TTB to TaTm and Me-4PACz and by an extra 40 to 50 mV when adding FBPAc, in line with the QFLS results of Fig.  1A . The corresponding fill factor (FF) also increases on average from ~69 to ~76% when changing the HTL and then to ~78 to 81% with the additive, confirming that the molecule does not lead to the formation of a barrier impeding electron extraction. Overall, the combination of Me-4PACz and FBPAc results in a PCE of up to 19.5%. Varying the concentration of FBPAc from 2.5 to 7.5 mM in the FABr:FAI solution does not affect the performance substantially (fig.  S15 ), which suggests that the excess of FBPAc (Fig.  2B ) does not hinder charge trans-port across the perovskite/C 60 interface. Washing away the FBPAc with an orthogonal solvent mixture results in perovskite cells with a similar V oc to that of untreated films, which confirms that FBPAc affects primarily recombination at the perovskite top surface (fig.  S16 ). We then adapted the perovskite deposition conditions to produce 1-cm 2 tandem cells on silicon heterojunction bottom cells that had pyramids of 2 to 3 mm on both sides of the wafer (Fig.  3A )  (32, 33) . Compared with our previous tandem baseline (  16 ), the perovskite layer was made thicker (from ~650 nm to ~1 mm) to reach current matching conditions with an E g of ~1.7 eV (1.63 eV previously; Fig.  3B ). For that purpose, we deposited a CsBr/ PbI 2 template of 660 nm and adapted the spin-coating parameters to convert the template into a perovskite phase. The front electrode was made transparent by switching to a stack made of C 60 , SnO x , indium zinc oxide (IZO), an Ag grid, and a MgF 2 antireflective coating (see materials and methods and supplementary text for details). A V oc of 1.9 V is obtained with either TaTM or Me-4PACz (fig.  S17 ), which is consistent with single-junction cell results (perovskite top cells in fig.  S14 ; c-Si bottom cell in fig.  S18 ). The FF of TaTm-based tandems is lower than with Me-4PACz (<70% compared with >75%), likely because of the low hole mobility in undoped TaTm  (34) . We also investigated the impact of a slight change in the perovskite E g by changing the FABr:FAI molar ratio from 2 to 1.75 and 1.5 (corresponding to a E g of 1.69, 1.68, and 1.67 eV, respectively). A PCE >30% could be achieved with several of these perovskite compositions, with slight variations in J sc and FF values depending on the top cell E g and the current-limiting subcell (figs. S17 and S19). These tandems remained stable for >360 days when stored at room temperature in N 2 (fig.  S20 ). A selection of these unencapsulated cells were then operated in ambient at their maximum power point at 65°C under a 1-sun illumination (~20 to 30% relative humidity; ISOS-L2 protocol). The most stable device reaches a t 80 of ~66 hours until 80% of its initial PCE is measured (figs.  S21  and S22 ). The degradation rate at 25°C of the FBPActreated tandem stack is similar to that achieved without FBPAc in our previous study (ISOS-L1 conditions; figs. S21 and S22)  (16) . A tandem cell featuring Me-4PACz and FBPAc was sent to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for certification. The certified relative external quantum efficiency (EQE) shown in Fig.  3C  indicates that the tandem was slightly top cell limited and that both subcells produced a J sc > 20 mA/cm 2 . The stabilized J-V properties of the device were measured using the asymptotic maximum power (P max ) scan method in standard test conditions (STC) (25°C, 1000 W/m 2 , AM1.5G   (35) . In agreement with data measured inhouse, the cell reaches a V oc of 1.91 V, a J sc of 20.47 mA/cm 2 , and a FF of 79.8%, which results in a certified PCE of 31.25% (with an aperture area of 1.1677 cm 2 ). 
 Conclusions We identified and mitigated nonradiative recombination losses occurring at the interfaces of perovskite/c-Si tandems featuring Si wafers with a micrometric texture-the standard used in the c-Si PV industry. The use of Me-4PACz reduces voltage losses at the perovskite/HTL interface, whereas the inclusion FBPAc in the perovskite deposition sequence reduces the losses at the perovskite/C 60 ETL interface and leads to more favorable perovskite microstructures with larger domains. From XPS and SIMS imaging, FBPAc is present on the perovskite top surface and coordinates with perovskite Pb-related defects through its phosphonic acid group. Overall, the combination of a c-Si micro-metric texture to improve optical properties, a high-quality 1-mm-thick perovskite absorber deposited conformally on this texture using a hybrid two-step method, and phosphonic groups at both sides of the absorber for improved interface passivation resulted in a tandem with an independently certified PCE of 31.25%. These results demonstrate how c-Si solar cells with a standard industrial micrometric texture can be upgraded to increase their PCE to >30%. Fig. 1 . 1 Fig. 1.

Materials and Methods 
 Perovskite thin-film deposition For layer characterization and single-junction cells, 180 nm of PbI2 (>99.99%, beads from Alfa Aesar) and 18 nm CsBr (>99.99%, Abcr) were co-evaporated in a Lesker mini-Spectros system (at 1 Å/s for PbI2 and 0.1 Å/s for CsBr). A mixture of FABr and FAI in various molar ratios (0.46 M in ethanol, Dyenamo) was then spin-coated onto this template layer. More specifically, 100 µl of the FABr:FAI solution was dynamically dispensed at a spin speed of 4000 rpm for 20-25 s in an inert atmosphere. The layers were then annealed at 150 °C for 20 min in ambient air to crystallize the perovskite absorber (corresponding to a composition of Cs0.18FA0.82Pb(I,Br)3 based on energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy data). To produce tandem solar cells on textured Si, 600 nm of PbI2 was co-evaporated with 60 nm of CsBr and a FABr:FAI solution of 0.72 M was then spun at 2200 rpm on the template. To include 2,3,4,5,6-Pentafluorobenzylphosphonic acid (FBPAc, Sigma Aldrich) in the stack, a stock solution (5 mM of FBPAc in ethanol unless otherwise mentioned in the text) was added directly to the FABr:FAI weighted powder to make the final solution. Perovskite p-i-n single-junction solar cells. ITO-coated glass substrates, purchased from Kintec (Ωsheet = 15 ohm/sq), were sonicated in acetone and then IPA for 10 minutes and treated with UV-O3 before depositing the HTL. For thermally evaporated materials, 18 nm of 2,2′,7,7′-tetra(N,N-di-tolyl)amino-9,9-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-TTB, Lumtec) or 12 nm of N4,N4,N4'',N4''-tetra([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-[1,1':4',1''terphenyl]-4,400-diamine (TaTm, Lumtec) were evaporated at a rate ~ 0.2 Å/s using a homemade system. For the self-assembled monolayer HTL, a stock solution of 1 mM in ethanol of Me-4PACz (Dyenamo) was prepared and sonicated for 15 min. Then, 100 µl of the solution was dispersed on ITO for 30 seconds before spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s. After spin coating, the samples were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The excess and unreacted molecules were washed by dripping 100 µl of ethanol onto the samples, while rotating at 3000 rpm. The perovskite absorber was then deposited using the sequential hybrid two-step method detailed above. C60 (evaporated at 0.1 Å/s until reaching a thickness of 15 nm, from CreaPhys) and then bathocuproine (BCP, thermal evaporation at 0.1 Å/s, 5 nm, Sigma Aldrich) or SnOx (by atomic layer deposition, see tandem experimental details) were deposited to form the ETL stack. The single-junction cells were then completed by thermally evaporating 130 nm of Cu or Ag through a metal shadow mask to have three 0.49-cm 2 cells on the same 2.5 x 2.5 cm 2 substrates. Each individual single-junctions were masked with a shadow mask with a 0.25-cm 2 aperture for current-voltage characterization with the sun simulator. 
 Silicon bottom cells The rear-junction SHJ bottom cells were fabricated using 4", ~200 µm-thick, ~2 Ω.cm ntype float-zone monocrystalline Si wafers. A double-side random pyramidal texture was produced using an alkaline-based solution, followed by a wet-chemical cleaning procedure (final thickness of about 180 µm). The wafers were dipped in a hydrofluoric acid solution for 1 min to remove the native SiOx before depositing thin hydrogenated Si layers using a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system (KAI-M, Oerlikon) set to 200 °C or 175 °C. On the front side, hydrogenated intrinsic and phosphorus-doped amorphous Si (a-Si:H(i) and a-Si:H(n)) depositions were followed by a phosphorus-doped nanocrystalline Si layer (nc-Si:H(n)) deposition. For tandem devices with the TaTm hole transport layers, an additional layer of boron-doped nc-Si:H(p) was deposited to form a tunnel junction  (32) . On the rear side, the deposition of a-Si:H(i) was followed by a nc-Si:H(p) layer  (33) . The rear contact was finalized by sputtering an ITO/Ag stack through a shadow mask, resulting in a contact area (~1.44 cm 2 ) slightly larger than the active area of the completed tandem cell (~1.2 cm 2 ). For Me-4PACzbased tandems, the front side was finalized by sputtering over the full area a thin ITO layer to anchor the phosphonic groups of the self-assembled monolayer. The bottom cell precursors were then annealed at 210 ºC for 30 min in an oven to cure the sputtering damage. Finally, the 4" wafers were laser cut down to 2.5 x 2.5 cm 2 substrates. 
 Perovskite top cells of textured tandems. The optimized HTL and ETL thicknesses were this time 10 nm for TaTm and 10 nm for C60 (as measured using quartz crystal monitors). To form the transparent front electrode, a buffer layer of ~10 nm of SnOx was deposited on C60 by atomic layer deposition using a Picosun R-200 system set to 100 °C using 120 cycles of tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin (100 sccm, 0.3 s pulse, 6.0 s purge) and H2O (200 sccm, 0.1 s pulse, 6.0 s purge). Indium zinc oxide (IZO) was then sputtered in a home-built system through a shadow mask (sheet resistance of 80-90 Ω/sq, thickness of 40-50 nm on flat glass). Then, an 800 nm-thick Ag grid was thermally evaporated at a rate of 2 Å/s through a shadow mask. Finally, an antireflective coating of MgF2 (1-2 Å/s, 85 to 90 nm, Umicore) was thermally evaporated over the active area. The final tandem cell active area, defined by the IZO front electrode was 1.56 cm 2 , while the aperture area was 1.21 cm 2 . Characterization of perovskite layers. Absorbance spectra were recorded using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 950 equipped with an integrating sphere). PLQY data was acquired using a homemade system based on a 514 nm excitation laser, fiber-coupled into an integrating sphere. The spectrum of the emission was measured with an Ocean Optics USB2000, while the emission was collected with a Maya2000 Pro (Ocean Insight), both attached to a bi-furcated fiber (Thorlabs) located such that only directionally homogenized light is collected. The system was calibrated using a two-step procedure at different fixed integration times for either spectrometer (standard settings are 30 ms for the USB2000 and 1000 ms for the Maya2000 Pro). First, we used multiple lasers (450 nm, 514 nm, 808 nm) and a calibrated photodiode (Newport 818UV/DB), and compared the measured intensity to the ones measured with the spectrometer, and second we benchmarked PLQY standard reference samples (Hamamatsu Photonics Inc.). The results were consistent with minimal differences (<5% relative error). The laser intensity was set to mimic 1-sun equivalent excitation conditions for the chosen bandgap (~ 55 mW/cm 2 , attenuation was achieved using a continuous neutral-density filter wheel, Thorlabs) as measured with another photodiode (Hamamatsu S13360) at the position of the sample before the start of each measurement. The fraction of absorbed photons was calculated by consecutively measuring the system without sample and then subtracting residual, reflected excitation when the sample is loaded. The laser spot was ~1 cm 2 and the luminescent yield was calculated with a setup-specific adaptation of the procedure suggested in  (36) . The data provided represents an average of 10-20 consecutive measurements, where the excitation duration was minimized using an automated shutter to exclude effects due to sample heating (i.e., 10-20 s for 10-20 measurements with 1000 ms integration time). XPS depth profiles and UPS measurements were performed using an Axis Supra (Kratos Analytical). XPS measurements were carried out at a 20 eV pass energy, with a step size of 0.1 eV. The samples were electrically grounded to limit charging effects. The O-to-P ratio was calculated based on peak areas after background subtraction. Peak areas were corrected by the respective relative sensitivity factors of O1s and P2p. The XPS depth profiles were obtained using 2 keV argon ions. The sputter rate was calibrated on the perovskite itself, and the following etching steps were subsequently defined: 0, 11.  25, 22.5, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270  nm. The XPS depth profiles were acquired with an 80-eV pass energy with 0.2 eV/step. Due to the Ar + beam induced damage, a low energy electron flood gun was used to charge-neutralize the sample during the measurement. UPS measurements were carried out using the He I radiation, emitting at 21.22eV. The pass energy was set to 10 eV with a step size of 0.025 eV. The samples were electrically grounded to limit charging effects. In all cases, the samples were electrically grounded to limit charging effects. XRD patterns were obtained using an Empyrean diffractometer (Panalytical) equipped with a PIXcel-1D detector with a Cu Kα radiation. GIWAXS data was recorded at the NCD-SWEET beamline (ALBA synchrotron in Cerdanyola del Vallès, Spain) with a monochromatic (λ = 0.953 Å) X-ray beam of 80 × 30 µm 2 [H × V], using a Si (111) channel cut monochromator. The scattered signal was recorded using a Rayonix LX255-HS area detector placed at 241.1 mm from the sample position. The reciprocal q-space and sample-to-detector distance were calculated using Cr2O3 as calibrant. A grazing incident angle of 1° was chosen to ensure full penetration of the X-ray beam through the perovskite layer. A continuous N2 flow over the sample was employed during the measurements. Collected 2D images were azimuthally integrated using PyFAI  (37)  and high-temperature in situ data sets were measured using a calibrated Linkam THMS600 heating stage adapted for grazing incidence experiments. The scan rate was one frame per two seconds, with the sample surface in continuous lateral motion (with respect to the incident beam) to ensure a fresh perovskite thin film surface was probed throughout the in situ time-temperature profiling. High resolution Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) imaging was performed using a helium/neon ion microscope (Zeiss NanoFab, Peabody, USA) coupled with magnetic sector mass spectrometer detection system based on a multi-collector developed at the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology  (31) . SIMS imaging was performed using a 10 keV Ne + primary ion beam with spot control 4 setting. The probe current was 5 pA. The raster size was 8×8 μm 2 . The polarity of the sample was negative (-500 V) and allowed the extraction of negative ions, namely the 19 F -and 12 C2 -fragments of the FBPAc molecule as well as the 81 Br - and 127 I -ions from the perovskite. The images were acquired as a matrix of 256×256 pixels with a 5000 μs dwell time and a 354.374 mT magnetic field. Maps were binned to 128 x 128 pixels (with a linear resampling) to improve the signal to noise ratio, before extracting relevant histograms. A Gemini 2 (Zeiss) scanning electron microscope was used to acquired top-view and crosssectional images of the completed perovskite/silicon tandem cells and the perovskite thin films coated on ITO/glass substrates. 
 Single-junction and tandem solar cells characterization. J-V properties were measured in-house in standard test conditions (STC) using a two-lamp (halogen and xenon) class AAA Wacom sun simulator. Independently certified SHJ cells were used to calibrate our in-house solar simulator. Shadow masks were used to define an illuminated area of 0.25 cm 2 and 1.21 cm 2 for single-junction and tandem cells, respectively. The cells were measured with a scan rate of 100 mV/s (using an integration time of 0.1 s and a delay of 0.1 s for each data point, the voltage step was 0.02 V). A three-point weight maximum power point tracking measurement was performed using an in-house-written LabVIEW code. For tandem cell measurements, the cells were placed on a temperature-controlled stage fixed at 25°C. EQE spectra were measured with a custom-made spectral response set-up, where the devices are irradiated with light chopped at a frequency of 232 Hz and their response measured with a lock-in amplifier. For tandem cells, blue and red light biases were used to saturate the complementary sub-cell. To measure each sub-cell near short-circuit conditions, 0.7 V and 1.15-1.20 V bias voltages were applied to the tandem when measuring the top and bottom cell, respectively. Both EQE and J-V measurements were carried out in ambient condition. 
 Supplementary Text 1 Optimization of the perovskite process parameters. Comparing to our previous work (Ref.  16 ), the Si wafers used here featured smaller pyramids (3-5 μm, instead 5-10 μm) due to a change in the additive used for texturization. Thinner wafers were also used here (about 60 μm thinner), which led to a small Jsc losses in the infrared region (see Fig.  S27 . and Table  S3 ). A perovskite with bandgap of ~1.7 eV was selected in this work (compared to 1.63 eV in Ref.  16 ). To approach current matching conditions between the sub-cells (see Fig.  S27 . and Table  S3 ), we deposited a thicker perovskite (~1 μm instead of 650 nm). To reach this thickness of ~1 μm, 60 nm of CsBr (instead of 40 nm) and 600 nm of PbI2 (instead of 400 nm) were co-evaporated (at rates of 0.1 and 1 Å/s, respectively). A higher concentration of organo-halides (0.72 M instead of 0.513 M) and a lower spin-coating speed (2200 rpm instead of 4000 rpm) were used to fully convert the thicker templates during thermal annealing at 150 °C for 20 min. We note that the concentration of organo-halide solution and the spin-coating speeds were optimized empirically (based on photoluminescence quantum yield and solar cell JV measurements), while keeping the same annealing conditions (150 °C for 20 min). All the thicknesses reported here are the ones on flat substrates. Optimization of the tandem front stack (C60/SnOx/IZO/Ag grid/MgF2). In this work, a thin C60 layer (10 nm instead of 34 nm in Ref.  16 ) was deposited to reduce parasitic absorption losses occurring at wavelengths < 600 nm (see EQE in Fig.  S27 .). We observed a penalty on the cell Voc with C60 layers thinner than ~10 nm. The thickness of the SnOx remained unchanged. The new Ag grid design with a smaller finger pitch (~3.66 mm instead of 4.33 mm, see Fig.  S28 . and Table  S4  for comparison) and a thinner and optically more transparent front IZO layer (40-50 nm with Ωsheet ~80-90 Ω/sq, instead of 110 nm with Ωsheet ~30 Ω/sq) further reduced parasitic absorption losses. The thinner fingers used in the new design (80 μm instead of 200 μm) also reduced the nominal shadow losses (from 2.5 % to 1.2%). 85-90 nm (instead of 170 nm) of MgF2 was used as antireflective coating to maximize the EQE/Jsc of the top perovskite sub-cell. All the thicknesses reported here are the ones on flat substrates.      (38) . For O1s, we note that there is a contribution from atmospheric oxidation (~533.4 eV) and of O from the phosphonic group of FBPAc (~532 eV). Indeed, a quantitative analysis reveals a 3:1 atomic ratio between O1s (~532 eV) and P2p, suggesting that the O1s feature at ~532 eV originates from the phosphonic acid group of FBPAc.   Extracted band levels of perovskite films with respect to the vacuum level based on fittings shown in (A) and (B). Since FBPAc features a strong dipole, the addition of FBPAc in the perovskite film synthesis results in a ~0.5 eV shift of the band levels, consistent with the previous report on the use of the molecule to obtain an electrode with a higher work function  (28) . This could create a carrier extraction barrier/offset (> 200 mV) between the conduction bands of the perovskite and C60 (typical band levels of ~ 3.9-4.1 eV from the vacuum level (  41 )). However, this contradicts the solar cell performance gains achieved with FBPAc (Fig.  S14 ), meaning that band alignment shifts induced by FBPAc are unlikely to play a major role at the device level. (C) The dynamics of the scattered signal of the (001) PbI2 planes (q ~ 8.9 nm -1 ) synthesized without (red) and with (blue) FBPAc. (D) GIWAXS diffractogram, extracted at t = 0 and 450 s, of the perovskite thin films crystallizing without (red) and with (blue) FBPAc at 150 °C. At t = 450 s, the film with FBPAc (blue) has stronger (110) and (002) perovskite peaks (q ~ 10.1 nm -1 ) and a weaker (001) PbI2 peak compared to the film without FBPAc (red)  (29) . The stronger (110)/(002) perovskite scattering signal indicates the formation of larger perovskite grains, which is also in agreement with the observations made by SEM (see Fig.  2B  and S16 ). 19 F -, 12 C2 -, 81 Br -and 127 I -for perovskite films with and without FBPAc. (B) Corresponding histograms of the maps shown in (A) after downsizing the maps from 256x256 pixels to 128x128 pixels (with a linear resampling). Each histogram contains 100 bins. (C) Correlation analysis between pairs of maps of the same samples as those shown in A. These maps are labeled here corr(map 1, map 2), where the counts value in one pixel of map 2 (y axis) is plotted as a function of the counts value found in the same pixel coordinate in map 1 (x axis). A correlation between the presence of F and C can be observed when FBPAc is present, a correlation that is absent without FBPAc (first row). An anticorrelation is observed between C and Br and between C and I when FBPAc is present (second and third rows), highlighting that where C is detected, the halide content is lower. This anticorrelation is not present when FBPAc is absent. The signals of I and Br correlate with each other, irrespective of the presence of the additive (last row).      S10C, or D ). We would also like to note that the appearance of the Pb 0 contribution during sputtering and the weaker C1s signal (Fig.  S11  and S12 ) suggest that the sputtering process induces considerable damage to the perovskite. Overall, these results suggest that FBPAc molecules are present up to about 22.5 nm from the perovskite top surface, a depth that could correspond to the thickness of the FBPAc clusters present on the top surface. FBPAc molecules are mainly localized on the top perovskite surface and are hence likely absent from the perovskite bulk or from the bottom HTL/perovskite interface.

 Fig. S14. Current-voltage (JV) characteristics of perovskite single-junction solar cells. (A-B) Statistics of the current-voltage parameters (efficiency, FF, Jsc, Voc) (A) and current-voltage curves of the champion perovskite single-junction cells of the different cell architectures in 1-sun illumination conditions (B) . The cell designs tested here are ITO/spiro-TTB(or TaTm or Me-4PACz)/Perovskite (without or with FBPAc)/C60/BCP (or ALD SnOx)/Cu (or Ag). (C) External quantum efficiency of the perovskite single-junction cells. We note that the current density (Jsc) slightly improves by ~0.5 mA/cm 2 when TaTm is used as HTL. This is due to the fact that a thinner TaTm was deposited (12 nm instead of 18 nm for spiro-TTB). The thinner HTL layer may lead to the observed improvement in FF compared to the spiro-TTB baseline (see second panel of A). Since charge carrier mobility in an evaporated HTL is typically limited to 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 s -1 , a thinner HTL should reduce series resistance losses  (34) . The aperture area used for JV measurement is 0.25 cm 2 . The acronyms FS and RS in panel (A) stand for forward (Jsc to Voc) and reverse (Voc to Jsc) scan direction, respectively. Fig.  S15 . Effects of the additive concentration on the JV characteristics of perovskite singlejunction cells. The x-axis indicates the molar concentration of FBPAc used when spin coating the organo-halide solution (0.46M of FA + ). The current-voltage parameters (efficiency, FF, Jsc, Voc) of the single-junction perovskite solar cells are statistically similar irrespective of the concentration of FBPAc. This can be largely attributed to the self-aggregation of the unreacted excess FBPAc, which has the tendency to form cluster on the top surface of the perovskite thin films (see Fig.  2B  and S16 ). The aperture area used for JV measurement is 0.25 cm 2 . of single-junction cells using perovskite films synthesized without and with FBPAc, and without and with then washing the FBPAc present on the perovskite surface. We note that the washing step does not impact the performance of cells without FBPAc. However, the washing of films synthesized with FBPAc results in a drop in Voc (and FF) and the device efficiencies then match those of cells without FBPAc. The gain in performance induced by FBPAc is hence mainly resulting from the passivation of the perovskite top surface. Perovskite films synthesized with formamidinium bromide to iodide molar ratios of 2:1, 1.75:1, 1.5:1 yield bandgaps of 1.69 eV, 1.68 eV, and 1.67 eV, respectively. (C) JV parameters (efficiency, FF, Jsc, Voc) of perovskite/c-Si tandem solar cells with TaTm or Me-4PACz as HTL and with various perovskite bandgaps. The wide distribution of efficiencies is originating from various optimizations made over multiple batches of cells. Apart from the perovskite active layer, the thicknesses of C60, IZO, and MgF2 were also re-optimized to maximize performance. A new metal front grid design was also used to further reduce shadow loss. Details about this optimization and a comparison with our previous textured tandems (Ref.  16 ) can be found in Supplementary Text 1.   The tandem cells were stored in a nitrogen-filled glovebox and were periodically taken out for measurement in ambient conditions. All characteristics (efficiency, FF, Jsc, and Voc) are extracted from current-voltage curves measured with a scan rate of 0.1 V/s. Some cells see their Voc and FF change during storage, which may be attributed to various effects, e.g., due to slight differences in the initial chemistry of the perovskite, photo-induced healing of the perovskite absorber  (43)  and/or a reduction of non-radiative recombination occurring in dark conditions due to the redistribution of mobile ions  (44, 45) . Fig.  S21 . Maximum power-point tracking stability of perovskite/c-Si tandem cells. These results were obtained after dark storage in a nitrogen environment of over 1 year. The tandem maximum power point was tracked in ambient condition at 65 °C (for td-cell 1 to 3, ISOS-L2) and at 25 °C (for td-cell4, ISOS-L1). The legend notes the initial efficiencies of tandems at the respective temperatures used for MPP tracking. The best t80 is about 66 hours at 65 °C, (see tdcell 2), while the degradation rate at 25°C is similar, within the investigated timeframe, to that achieved with our previous FBPAc-free baseline, see comparison td-cell 4 and ref16  (16) . We note that the MPP tracking experiments were performed with a AAA solar simulator. JV scans were recorded before, in some cases during, and after MPP stability testing (Fig.  S22 ).   S1  and S2 . A standard scan rate of 0.1 V/s was used.       S4  summarizes the dimensions of the mask aperture, Ag finger(s), and the nominal optical shadow losses of the new and old designs.  Fig. S1 .

For O1s, we note that there is a contribution from atmospheric oxidation (~533.4 eV) and of O from the phosphonic group of FBPAc (~532 eV). Indeed, a quantitative analysis reveals a 3:1 atomic ratio between O1s (~532 eV) and P2p, suggesting that the O1s feature at ~532 eV originates from the phosphonic acid group of FBPAc.

The spectra of the perovskite/C60(3nm) stack feature convoluted contribution of various O and C states observed in bare perovskite films or in perovskite/C60(10nm) stacks.

Since FBPAc features a strong dipole, the addition of FBPAc in the perovskite film synthesis results in a ~0.5 eV shift of the band levels, consistent with the previous report on the use of the molecule to obtain an electrode with a higher work function (28) . This could create a carrier extraction barrier/offset (> 200 mV) between the conduction bands of the perovskite and C60 (typical band levels of ~ 3.9-4.1 eV from the vacuum level (41)). However, this contradicts the solar cell performance gains achieved with FBPAc (Fig.S14), meaning that band alignment shifts induced by FBPAc are unlikely to play a major role at the device level.

The stronger (110)/(002) perovskite scattering signal indicates the formation of larger perovskite grains, which is also in agreement with the observations made by SEM (see Fig.2B and S16).

The normalized integrated intensity is obtained by integrating the F1s contribution after background subtraction (see Fig.S10C, or D). We would also like to note that the appearance of the Pb 0 contribution during sputtering and the weaker C1s signal (Fig.S11 and S12) suggest that the sputtering process induces considerable damage to the perovskite. Overall, these results suggest that FBPAc molecules are present up to about 22.5 nm from the perovskite top surface, a depth that could correspond to the thickness of the FBPAc clusters present on the top surface. FBPAc molecules are mainly localized on the top perovskite surface and are hence likely absent from the perovskite bulk or from the bottom HTL/perovskite interface.

TableS3summarizes the integrated Jsc of the top (Jsc,EQE,top) and bottom (Jsc,EQE,bottom) sub-cells obtained from the relative EQE data shown in Fig.S27, as well as the total Jsc of the tandems (Jsc,EQE,total , defined by Jsc,EQE,top + Jsc,EQE,bottom) and the mismatch Jsc between the top and bottom sub-cells (Jsc,EQE,mismatch , defined by Jsc,EQE,top -Jsc,EQE,bottom). We would like to note that the integrated Jsc are extracted from relative EQE measurements and therefore the comparison is only indicative.
