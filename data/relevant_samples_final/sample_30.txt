Title: Defect passivation via incorporation of sodium thiocyanate for achieving high-performance MAPbI 3 -based perovskite solar cells with enhanced stability
The high density of defects in MAPbI 3 perovskite films brings about severe carrier nonradiative recombination, which lowers the photovoltaic performance and the stability of MAPbI 3 -based perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To tackle this issue, we prepared stable and efficient MAPbI 3 -based PSCs with incorporation of sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN). NaSCN can increase grain size and improve crystallization quality of the perovskite films due to an Ostwald ripening effect of SCN -and surface passivation of Na + which can effectively passivate the defect states and inhibit nonradiative recombination for an ultimate improvement of the device performance and stability. The excellent characteristics lead to a significant enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 18.1 % to 19.4 % both for MAPbI 3 -based and Cs 0.06 MA 0.15 FA 0.79 PbI 2.5 Br 0.5 -based PSCs, respectively. The unencapsulated NaSCN-treated PSCs also shows a improved stability after aging under a relative humidity of 40 ± 5 % for 15 days.
Introduction Organic-inorganic perovskite metal halides such as CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 (MAPbI 3 ) have become a new starting point for fabrication of thinfilm solar cells. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of singlejunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly increased from 3.8 % to 25.7 % since 2009, and the current maximum efficiency of MAPbI 3 -based perovskite solar cells is 22.1 %  [1] [2] [3] . The excellent properties of perovskite materials include but are not limited to adjustable band gap, high optical absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length and simple preparation process, which promises an attractive commercial prospect, but the photovoltaic performance and operational stablity of PSCs are still restricted by the high defects density and nonradiative recombination which is critical for the commercialization of PSCs  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . So far, efforts have mainly made on reducing the defects density and suppressing the nonradiative recombination of perovskites  [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . The vacancy defects of I -and the interstitial defects of Pb 2+ are the two main types of defects in the perovskite lattice that are responsible for trapping charge carriers. It is also found that reduction of defects or ion migration inducing interfacial charge accumulation is the key to promoting device performance  [21] . Therefore, optimization of the perovskite film morphology (such as grain size, surface roughness) and crystal quality is crucial for the passivation of these defects which is significant to obtain high-performance PSCs. Thiocyanate has been demonstrated to improve the crystal quality of perovskite films  [22] [23] [24] . Several additives (e.g. MASCN  [22, 23] , NH 4 SCN  [24] , KI  [25] , TbCl 3  [26] , Pb(SCN) 2  [27, 28]  terephthalic acid  [29] , 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone(DMI)  [30]  and squaraine molecules  [31] ) have been implemented to passivate the defects of perovskite and assist the nucleation and crystal growth during the film fabrication process. Although the introduction of these additives is conducive to obtaining high-quality perovskite films, the stability of the perovskite films still needs to be improved, which further affects the long-term performance of PSCs. On the other hand, it has been reported that Na + may be located at the GBs or surface which results in the acceleration of charge  transportation and an enhanced photovoltaic performance of PSCs. This is mainly due to enhanced hole extraction and suppresed nonradiative recombination induced by incorporation of Na + . It can also regulate the crystallization and nucleation process of perovskites due to stable chemical properties against oxidation and reduction  [32, 33] . It has been proved that adding NaCl to SnO 2 and TiO 2 ETL can passivate the contact area and that the Na + could diffuse into the bulk perovskite, increasing the grain size and passivating the grain boundaries in the perovskite as well, ultimately increase the photovoltaic performance  [34] [35] [36] . Additionally, following the strategy of Na + incorporation in the CIGS solar cells, the enhanced carrier transport of Na-treated devices is attributed to the reduction of defects. This demonstrates that the increase of net hole density and grain boundary potential is ascertained to change with incorporation of Na + which can increase photocarrier concentration and film conductivity  [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . The reported alkali cations sometimes make a limited contribution to the improvement of perovskite film quality. For example, Rb + and Cs + were considered to substitue the Asite cation in perovskite materials for an improved tolerance factor, while K + with a shorter ionic radius is less likely to get into the perovskite molecular structure but treats the trap-assisted defects at grain boundaries only. Furthermore, compared with hygroscopic lithium (Li + ) salts, Na + acts as a better moisture-tolerant passivator which may benefit the crystallization of MAPbI 3 more profoundly. Therefore, we introduced NaSCN as a comprehensive defect controller into the MAPbI 3 perovskite  [33] . Herein, in order to combine the advantages of both Na + and SCN -, sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) was chosen to introduce into the perovskite precursor solution as a comprehensive passivation controller which could enhance the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs by improving the grain size, crystallinity of perovskite films and passivating the surface defects.

 Device fabrication The FTO glasses were cleaned sequentially with detergent, ultrapure water, acetone and ethanol by ultrasound for 15 min. Then the FTO glasses were dried with clean air before use. Before preparing the electron transport layer, the clean FTO is treated with ultraviolet ozone for 15 min and the tin oxide aqueous dispersion is diluted to 7.5 % (wt), then spin coated at FTO (4000 rpm for 30 s) and, heated at 150 ℃ for 30 min after spin coating. The perovskite precursor was prepared by dissolving the mixture of PbI 2 (1.4 M) and MAI (1.4 M) in 1 mL DMF and DMSO blend solvent (DMF:DMSO = 9:1, v-v), at least 1 h stirring. 81 mg NaSCN was dissolved in 1 mL DMF as a storage solution. Then the precursor solution with different concentrations (0, 3, 5 and 8 mmol/L) of NaSCN was deposited at the SnO 2 substrates by spin-coating and annealing at 100 °C for 10 min (4000 rpm for 30 s to which added 120 μL of CB after 6 s). After cooling to the room temperature, 50 μL Spiro-MeOTAD solution (72.3 mg Spiro-OMeTAD, 29 μL 4-tertbutylpyridine, 17.5 μL bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) stock solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) in 1 mL chlorobenzene) was spin-coated on the perovskite films at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 100 nm silver was thermally evaporated onto the HTL layers as a back electrode.

 Results and discussions To understand the effects of NaSCN treatment on the crystallinity properties of MAPbI 3-based perovskite films, we measured the X-ray diffraction of perovskite films with different concentrations of NaSCN (0, 3, 5 and 8 mmol/L). As shown in Fig.  1 (a), several characteristic peaks of MAPbI 3 representing (110), (  210 ), (220) lattice planes can be found at 14.07°, 20.24° and 28.5° in the control films and NaSCN-modified films which are consistent with a previous report  [42] . We also find that the (110) peak intensity of perovskite films increases with the concentrations (0-8 mmol/L) of NaSCN which indicates that NaSCN can improve the crystal quality of perovskite films  [42, 43] . In order to gain insights into the chemical interaction between NaSCN and perovskite films, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement was performed as shown in Fig.  1(b) . The Pb 4f 7/2 and Pb 4 f 5/2 two main peaks are found at 138.29, 143.18 eV of control film and 138.22, 143.08 eV of NaSCN-treated film which shows that the peaks of Pb 2+ slighty shift toward a lower binding energy after being treated by NaSCN. This indicates that the thiocyanate (SCN -) can change the electronic cloud around Pb atoms to lower the oxidation state of Pb which ultimately passivate the uncoordinated Pb 2+ in the MAPbI 3-based perovskite films  [44] . To further investigate the effect of NaSCN on the morphology of perovskite flims, we conducted scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in the Fig.  2(a-d ), the grain size of perovskite is enlarged with the increasing concentrations (0-8 mmol/L) of NaSCN, the grain boundaries (GBs) are also relatively reduced which are regarded as non-radiative recombination centers in perovskite films  [45] . The statistical grain size of the perovskite films derived from the related SEM images also shows the same trend after being treated by different amounts of NaSCN (Fig.  S1  and Fig.  S2 ). We speculate that Na + can act as a nucleation center and promote preferential growth of perovskite grains. It is also likely that the small Na + passivate GBs and SCN -coordinate with Pb 2+ ion to reduces the interaction between Pb 2+ ions and DMSO during the solvent annealing process  [34] . These enables grains with larger size to form a high-quality perovskite film. On the other hand, when introduced 5 mmol/L NaSCN, the morphology of the perovskite grains is complete and continuous without pinholes (Fig.  S3 ). The above results confirm that an appropriate concentration of NaSCN can improve the crystallization of perovskite films which is critical to reduce the formation of defects and the nonradiation recombination in the perovskite layer  [22, 24] . As shown in Fig.  2(e-f ), compared with the control films, the root-mean-squared (RMS) roughness of the NaSCN-treated films is reduced from 28.6 nm to 24.0 nm. This indicates that NaSCN can reduce the surface defects by improving the crystalline quality of perovskite films which is helpful to promote the charge carrier transport and reduce the leakage current  [43] . To figured out the presence and distribution of Na element and SCN -in the perovskite films after adding NaSCN, we further investigated it by the energy dispersive spectra (EDS) mapping mode. To give a reliable estimation, we improved the concentration of NaSCN to 100 mmol/L and the perovskite films was fabricated based on the Si substrates with a pure DMF solvent to rule out sulphur contamination. As shown in Fig.  S4(a-b ), compared to the control films, the Na element and S element both can be found at the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite films treated by 100 mmol/L NaSCN (Table  S1 -S2) which is consistent with above results and several previous reports  [33] [34] [35] [36] . According to the above results and several previous reports, we speculate that a small part of SCN -may interact with MAPbI 3 to form and release HSCN and CH 3 NH 2 gases which can regulate the growth of MAPbI 3 resulting in grains of higher crystal quality, the rest part of SCN -is more likely interacting with I vacancy, leading to a very strong coordination bonding with undercoordinated Pb 2+  [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . To analyze the absorption features of the control perovskite samples and NaSCN-modified perovskite samples, we measured the UV-vis absorption spectra and the tauc-plots as shown in Fig.  3(a)  and Fig.  S5 . We find that with the increasing concentration (0-8 mmol/L) of NaSCN, the absorption intensity of perovskite films are strengthened. When the addition amount of NaSCN is 5 mmol/L, the UV absorption peak of MAPbI 3 perovskite films is the highest in the wavelength range of 400-500 nm which is mainly due to the better crystallinity and smoother surface. Further more, the NaSCNmodified samples has the same absorption property as the control samples in the wavelength range of 500-800 nm which indicates that there is no change in the crystal structure of MAPbI 3 after being treated by NaSCN. As shown in Fig.  S5 , I -/Br -is supposed to be    partially replaced by SCN -as a pseudohalogen and then decrease the band gap of perovskite which is consistent with several previous reports  [52, 53] . The steady-state photoluminescence is measured to evaluate the carrier dynamics of perovskite films. As shown in Fig.  3(b) , by introducing different concentrations of NaSCN, the PL intensity at 720-820 nm wavelength also change significantly, especially when the concentration of NaSCN is 5 mmol/L, the intensity is the strongest, indicating that NaSCN can reduce the defect density of the perovskite films effectively  [29] . We also find it shows a red shift after MAPbI 3 perovskite being treated by NaSCN in Fig.  3 (b) which is consistent with the above results. As shown in Fig.  3 (c), the time-resolved PL (TR-PL) spectra were obtained and fitted following the double exponential decay function below: = + + I t I A exp t A exp t ( ) 0 1 1 2 2 (1) where τ 1 and τ 2 represent fast and slow attenuation component. τ 1 is related to the nonradiative recombination of defects/traps, and τ 2 is related to the radiative recombination of bulk perovskites. We calculated the average carrier lifetime (τ ave ) according to the following equation: τ ave =(A 1 τ 1 2 + A 2 τ 2 2 )/(A 1 τ 1 + A 2 τ 2 ) (2) The fitted result (Table  S3 ) of the NaSCN-treated sample shows a much longer PL decay (τ ave =1059.90 ns) duration than that of the control sample (τ ave =573.45 ns), which attributes to the reduction of non-radiative-recombination. This is consistent with the above results  [54] . We also assembled double electron transport layer devices with the structure of FTO/SnO 2 /MAPbI 3 /PCBM/Ag to calculate the electron trap density. Fig.  4(a)  shows the space-charge-limiting current (SCLC) curves of control films and NaSCN-modified films in the dark state, respectively. The curves can usually be divided into three parts. At the low-voltage region, the current presents a linearly climbing trend as a function of voltage, representing ohmic conduction  [55] . At the high-voltage region, beyond the turning point, the current increases nonlinearly, which is indicative to the fully filled trap state by the mean of carrier injection  [56] . The trap density of states can be calculated from this curve by using the following formula: = V eL N 2 TFL trap 2 0 where L represents the thickness of perovskite films, е represents the amount of charge carried by an electron. The relative dielectric constant of the film is about 35, and the vacuum dielectric constant, ɛ 0 , is 8.854 × 10 -12 F/m  [57] . It can be calculated that the trap-state defects density of control devices is 1.509 × 10 16 cm -3 while the NaSCN-modified devices is only 6.39 × 10 15 cm -3 . It can be clearly seen that compared with the control devices, the defects density of the devices treated by NaSCN is reduced significantly, this means that NaSCN can effectively passivate the carrier trap-state defects density in perovskite films. Fig.  4 (b) shows the relationship between V OC and the light intensities to further investigate the charge carrier recombination dynamics in PSCs. The ideality factors (ƞ) were 1.727 kT/q and 1.304 kT/q of the control and NaSCN-modified PSCs respectively, the lower ƞ of NaSCN-modified PSCs indicates a reduction of trap-assisted nonradiative recombination. As shown in Table  1  and Fig.  5 (a), compared with the best control device which delivers a PCE of 18.1 % (V OC = 1.084 V, J SC = 21.18 mA/ cm 2 , and FF = 78.86 %), the best NaSCN-modified device shows a highest PCE of 19.4 % (V OC = 1.071 V, J SC = 22.84 mA/cm 2 , and FF = 79.20 %). According to the above results, the decreasing V OC may be due to the reduced band gap of MAPbI 3 perovskite after being treated by NaSCN  [52, 53] . The increasing J SC can be attributed to the enhancement of the transportation of carriers, enhanced photo absorption ability, improved crystalline of perovsite films and the decreasing band gap which comprehensively leads to a significant increase of PCE. As shown in Fig.  5(b-e ) and Table  2 , the statistical performance of 20 devices shows a similar trend as their corresponding champion devices mentioned above. Combining with these results, the improvement of devices performance is probably due to the comprehensive passivation effect of SCN -and Na + . Na + is prone to suppress ion migration by filling the vacancies of MA + and interact with the undercoordinated I -anions. This leading to an inhibited interfacial charge accumulation which is confirmed by the reduced hysteresis index shown in Fig.  S6  and Table  S4    [58] . Fig.  5(f)  shows the external quantum efficiency spectrum of the control and NaSCN-modified PSCs. NaSCN-modified devices show a higher EQE values under 600 nm, which is mainly attributed to the enhanced hole extraction and improved crystallinity of the perovskite layer after being treated by NaSCN  [59, 60] . The integrated J SC of the devices are 20.66 mA/cm 2 and 21.15 mA/cm 2 respectively, which is consistent with the J SC from the J-V measurement. We performed electrochemical impedence spectroscopy of the control PSCs and NaSCN-modified PSCs under light illumination and a bias potential (close to V OC ). Fig.  S7  exhibits the Nyquist plots of the control devices and NaSCN-modified devices. The applied equivalent circuit diagram is also shown in the Fig.  S7 . The corresponding circuit elements consist of series resistance (R s ), contact resistance (R ct ) and the corresponding capacitance (C 1 ). The semicircle corresponds to the R ct between the perovskite film and the transport layers. The detailed parameters of the fitted plots are shown in Table  S5 . According to the fitted EIS spectra, after being treated by NaSCN, the R ct was found to decrease from 770.2 Ω to 410 Ω which indicates a faster carrier transport at the interface  [61] . As shown in Fig.  6 (a), the long-term stability of NaSCN-treated PSCs is much better than that of the control PSCs after aging for 15 days in air condition (40 ± 5 %). To futher understand the improved stability of NaSCN-treated devices, the XRD spectra were measured for the control and NaSCN-treated perovskite films before and after aging for 45 h at 65 °C in glove box (N 2 ) (Fig.  S8 ). We find that the NaSCN-treated films have almost the same crystallinity before and after aging for 45 h at 65 °C in glove box (N 2 ), but the main characteristic peaks of control sample shows a decreased intensity which indicates a decreased crystal quality. The enhanced stability mainly due to the increase of grain sizes, passivation of defects and improved crystal quality of perovskite films treated by NaSCN. As shown in Fig.  6(b-c ), the introduction of NaSCN makes the contact angle increases from 44.23° to 47.91° which is consistent with the AFM results. 
 Conclusions In summary, we find that the addition of NaSCN in PSCs can reduce the density of trap states, suppress the nonradiative recombination which can ultimately enhance the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs.

Our research provides a new strategy based on additive engineering for the PSCs community to achieve efficient and stable PSCs.
