Title: Passivator-Assisted Close Space Annealing for High-Performance Wide-Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells

Introduction Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites are fantastic photovoltaic materials, and the single-junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have passed the certified efficiency of 26.14% in recent years.  [1] [2] [3]  Allperovskite double-junction tandem solar cell (TSC), consisting of a wide-bandgap (E g ≈ 1.7 eV) top subcell and a low-bandgap (E g ≈ 1.2 eV) bottom subcell, has emerged as a promising strategy to further improve the device performance surpass the Shockley-Queisser (S-Q) of singlejunction PSCs.  [4, 5]  Acting as the top subcell, wide-E g PSCs play crucial roles in determining the overall efficiencies of TSCs,  [6] [7] [8]  and should be robust enough to survive upon the following deposition of low-E g tin-lead (Sn-Pb) perovskite layer atop.  [9] [10] [11]  Wide-E g PSCs usually suffer from phase segregation due to the large amount of bromine (Br), leading to inferior power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) with huge open-circuit voltage (V OC ) deficits.  [8, 11]  Therefore, managing the crystal growth serves as an effective route to improve the film quality by enlarging the grain size and reducing defects.  [12]  Efforts have been devoted on the optimization and regulation of annealing process, i.e., solvents annealing,  [13]  reducing solvents evaporation rate,  [14]  annealing under volatile organic vapors,  [15]  or baking in orthogonal solvent liquids.  [12]  Moreover, close space annealing (CSA) process has been proposed in our previous work to significantly enlarge the grain size and enhance the film quality.  [16]  Post-treatment with organic molecules on perovskite film surface was proved to be one useful method to improve the photovoltaic performance of wide-E g PSCs.  [17]  For example, ion migration and phase segregation issues in wide-E g perovskite films could be significantly eliminated by posttreatment with 2-phenylethanamine iodide.  [18]  However, most posttreatment processes are solution dripping methods,  [17]  which are timeconsuming and complicated with additional spin-coating and annealing steps.  [19]  In addition, low solubility of some organic passivators in orthorhombic solvents (e.g., iso-propanol) limit their applications on passivating perovskite films.  [20, 21]  Therefore, a controllable passivating strategy that can remove extra liquids is highly desired for enhanced performance and scale-up fabrications of perovskite devices. DOI: 10.1002/solr.202301016 Wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs) play crucial roles in determining the overall efficiencies of all-perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs). Tailoring the grain growth process is a key route to improve the film quality and device performance. Herein, a facile passivator-assisted close space annealing (PA-CSA) strategy to simultaneously enlarge the crystal size and passivate the defects is demonstrated. Filter paper is used as the solvent permeable membrane to slow down the fast crystallization and enlarge the grain size. At the same time, a precisely selected volatile material (fluorizated-phenethylammonium chloride) embedded in the filter paper is employed as the passivator to eliminate defects in wide-E g perovskite film during annealing. The PA-CSA-processed wide-E g PSCs obtain the champion efficiencies of 21.28% (1.68 eV) and 20.24% (1.73 eV), enabling highperformance all-perovskite TSCs with efficiencies reaching 27% in both fourterminal and monolithic two-terminal tandem configurations, respectively. This PA-CSA strategy provides an in situ passivating process for high-performance PSCs and TSCs upon further industrial applications. Volatile nature of organic cations endows them possibility to passivate perovskite films through sublimation;  [22]  however, this has been rarely investigated in terms of the shortage of decomposition and gas releasing of perovskite films under rigorous conditions.  [23]  Nevertheless, the easy evaporation feature of organic precursors makes it possible for the vacuum deposition of perovskites, which is highly compatible with tandem structures due to the removing of liquid solvents.  [24, 25]  Here in this work, we report a novel passivator-assisted CSA (PA-CSA) strategy that can simultaneously improve the crystallinity and passivate defects in wide-E g perovskite films. Fluorizated-phenethylammonium chloride (F-PEACl)-immersed filter papers were used as solvent permeable membrane during annealing process. The as-casted intermediate-phase perovskite film was put with face downward to the filter paper, forming a closed space to limit the fast solvent releasing and merge the neighboring crystals through Ostwald ripening. At the same time, the volatile F-PEACl chemicals would slowly sublimate on the film surface during annealing and then diffuse into the bulk and buried interface to passivate defects. As a result, high-performance wide-E g PSCs with PCEs over 21.28% (1.68 eV) and 20.24% (1.73 eV) were obtained, enabling highperformance all-perovskite TSCs with efficiencies of 26.72% and 26.76% in four-terminal (4-T) and two-terminal (2-T) configurations, respectively. 
 Results and Discussion The FA 0.8 Cs 0.2 Pb(I 1Àx Br x ) 3 -based wide-E g perovskites with different bandgaps were first achieved by tuning the ratio of Br and I halides,  [26]  and the corresponding Tauc plots are displayed in Figure  S1 , Supporting Information. Then, we used PA-CSA method to improve the crystallinity and film quality of wide-E g perovskites, with the fabrication process schematic illustrated in Figure  1a . The detailed methods can be found in experimental section (Supporting Information). Normal annealing (NA)-processed perovskite films were heated with face upward on a hotplate for a certain time as reported.  [18]  For PA-CSA process, F-PEACl molecules were immersed into the filter paper to form a solvent permeable membrane, and the intermediate-phase perovskite film was annealed by rolling over the film surface downward to the filter paper after spin-coating. This process would enlarge grains and passivate defects in the perovskite film. Perovskite grains usually first nucleate at the film surface and then grow to the deep bulk during the releasing of solvents.  [16]  Moreover, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) molecules are preferred to form adducts with Pb 2þ acting as coordinating solvents,  [16]  so that large amount of solvents would remain in the intermediate-phase film after antisolvent washing.  [27]  The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the presence of DMSO molecules in the as-casted films through the observation of S═O vibration peaks (Figure  S2 , Supporting Information).  [28]  This result indicates the possibility to control the perovskite crystallization through the regulation of annealing process. We used in situ transmission measurement to monitor the film growth process through a homemade facility shown in Figure  S3 , Supporting Information. The transmission spectra of perovskite films annealed with NA and PA-CSA protocols are shown in Figure  1b ,c, respectively. The grain growth process was greatly delayed by PA-CSA, confirming the slowed crystallization process. Specifically, the perovskite film with NA treatment has a very short time (≈100 s) of phase transformation from intermediate phase to perovskite phase, while the PA-CSA-based film shows highly prolonged phase conversion time to about 400 s, indicating the slowed solvent releasing process and reduced crystal growth rate. The temperature variation during the measurement process is shown in Figure  S4 , Supporting Information. Before we made the decision to pick F-PEACl as the optimal passivator in our PA-CSA system, we had compared the effects of different chemicals on the passivation of wide-E g perovskites, including phenmethylammonium chloride (PMACl), phenethylammonium chloride (PEACl), and F-PEACl. Morphologies of perovskite films fabricated with NA treatment and PA-CSA treatments employing various passivators are shown in Figure  1d-g . PA-CSA can greatly improve the grain size and reduce the PbI 2 accumulation on the film surface, and F-PEACl-based film shows the best film quality, which might be attributed to the higher electron negativity due to the fluorine presence.  [29]  Figure  1h  shows the X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of perovskite films treated by PA-CSA with different passivators. The F-PEACl-based film shows significantly improved crystallinity with the highest peak intensity. The photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) results further confirmed the effectively reduced defects and suppressed nonradiative recombination in F-PEACl-treated perovskite film, with the highest emission intensity and longest carrier lifetime as shown in Figure  1i ,j and Table  S1 , Supporting Information. Performance of PSCs treated with different passivators via PA-CSA process are displayed in Figure  1k  and S5, Supporting Information. The best performing PSC was achieved with F-PEACl treatment, showing the highly improved V OC and fill factor (FF). The concentration of F-PEACl has been optimized to be 0.8 mg mL À1 (Figure  S6  and S7, Supporting Information). To elucidate the effectiveness of F-PEACl in our PA-CSA strategy, we then investigated the volatile property of F-PEACl, and the corresponding thermogravimetric analysis result is shown in Figure  S8 , Supporting Information. F-PEACl shows slightly weight loss under ≈100 °C heating, and the direct contact between perovskite film and filter paper can give a pathway for the chemical to react with the perovskite (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information). We conducted the PL mapping to investigate the surface homogeneity of perovskite films, as shown in Figure  S10 , Supporting Information. PA-CSA-treated perovskite film has brighter color and uniform response, indicating that there are fewer defects in the film and the quality is significantly improved.  [30]  We previously reported that F-PEA þ cations are efficient passivators for high-performance PSCs due to the favorable formation of highly oriented 2D materials at the substrate side, thus giving gradient energy alignments for fluent charge transfer.  [31, 32]  Here, we did the calculation of the interaction between F-PEACl and perovskite on the surface, and found that the F atom is preferred to adsorb at the I vacancy through physical adsorption,  [33]  thus passivating the halide vacancies (Figure  S11 , Supporting Information). The interaction between inorganic framework and organic cations further confirmed the possible adhesion at the film surface and diffusion of F-PEACl into film bulk and buried interface. We further compared the morphology and optoelectronic properties of perovskite films processed with different annealing methods, including NA, CSA, and PA-CSA. The top-view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of perovskite films and devices with different annealing processes are displayed in Figure  2a-c . Compared with the NA-based sample, the grain size of perovskite films was dramatically enlarged with CSA and PA-CSA treatments. After CSA treatment, the grain size increased to about 610 nm with a high aspect ratio, lying between two charge collection layers without horizontal boundaries. Furthermore, after PA-CSA treatment, the grain grows to even large size of 1200 nm and smooth surface with no excessive bright particles, which should be ascribed to the reaction of F-PEACl with PbI x Br 2-x particles.  [19]  Figure  S12 , Supporting Information, shows that the buried interfaces of perovskite films were also optimized after CSA and PA-CSA treatments, showing homogeneous feature with big grains and no pinholes.  [19]  Figure  2d  demonstrates the XRD results of perovskite films with different treatments. The intensity of (110) diffraction peak of CSA-and PA-CSA-based perovskite films have been highly increased, indicating the improved crystallinity. Moreover, F-PEACl treatment has negligible effect on the perovskite lattice, because no obvious appearance of lowdimensional perovskite can be distinguished from the XRD patterns. We further investigated the distribution profile of I, Br, Cl, and F ions in perovskite film through time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurement, as displayed in Figure  2e . F ions accumulate at the interfaces rather than in the bulk,  [34]  indicating the sufficient passivation at the top surface and buried interface.  [19]  Cl ions distribute uniformly across the whole film thickness, indicating the presence of quadruple halides (F, Cl, Br, and I) in our wide-E g perovskites with less halide vacancies.  [35]  X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results confirmed the presence of F-PEACl in the perovskite films, with the clear F element peak shown in Figure  S13 , Supporting Information. As shown in Figure  2f , the binding energy of Pb 4f peak shift to lower energy after different annealing treatments, indicating the lower density of charged defects due to the elimination of halide vacancies,  [36]  which might be caused by the presence of Cl À or F À ions with enhanced electron negativity.  [37]  The steady-state PL results of perovskite films after different annealing treatments are shown in Figure  2g . PA-CSA process dramatically improves the PL intensity for about one order of magnitude, implying the more effective suppression of nonradiative recombination. The absorbance results of films after different treatments show the same bandgap, indicating the negligible effects on optical bandgap due to the trace amounts of additives (Figure  S14 , Supporting Information). As shows in TRPL results (Figure  2h ), PA-CSA-processed film has the longest lifetime of 497 ns compared to the NA (143 ns) and CSA (263 ns) films, indicating the highly suppressed non-radiative recombination (Table  S2 , Supporting Information). We further investigated the defect density of different perovskite films using space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Figure  2i  and S15, Supporting Information).  [38]  The trap fill limit voltage (V TFL ) values of electron-only devices were obtained to be 1.163, 1.128, and 0.945 V for NA, CSA, and PA-CSA, respectively, corresponding to a trap density of 2.31 Â 10 16 , 2.24 Â 10 16 , and 1.88 Â 10 16 cm À3 (Table  S3 , Supporting Information). The PA-CSA sample has the lowest defect density, demonstrating the most efficient defect passivation capability.  [39]  The current density-voltage ( J-V ) curves and parameters of 1.68 eV PSCs with different annealing treatments are displayed in Figure  3a  and Table  S4 , Supporting Information, respectively. NA-based device has a PCE of 18.57% with a V OC of 1.153 V, a short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 20.11 mA cm À2 , and an FF of 80.1%, while the CSA-treated device has highly enhanced performances with PCE of 20.08%. The PA-CSA-processed PSC has the best PCE of 21.28% with a V OC of 1.248 V, a J SC of 20.77 mA cm À2 , and an FF of 82.1%. All wide-E g PSCs have negligible hysteresis (Figure  S16 , Supporting Information). The statistical results of photovoltaic parameters of PSCs with different annealing treatments are shown in Figure  S17 , Supporting Information, PA-CSA-based PSCs have the highest performance and the smallest deviation, indicating the best reproducibility. External quantum efficiency (EQE) results of different PSCs are shown in Figure  3b . PA-CSA-processed PSC presents the highest EQE response, especially at the long wavelength region, further confirming the suppressed non-radiative recombination due to the sufficient passivation of defects in the perovskite film bulk and rear surface.  [40]  The optical transmittance and reflectance spectra of different perovskite films are displayed in Figure  S18 , Supporting Information, which shows similar reflectance results, indicating that the main reason for the enhanced EQE response should be ascribed to the highly improved film quality and passivated surface, rather than the morphology or optical resonance at the rear surface. We further recorded the steady-state power outputs of wide-E g PSCs following the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) protocol, and the stable outputs are estimated to be 18.5%, 20.0%, and 21.0% for NA-, CSA-, and PA-CSA-treated devices, respectively (Figure  3c ).  [36]  We further checked the long-term stability of wide-E g PSCs in N 2 -filled glove box, and PA-CSA-based PSC kept 95% of its original efficiency after 1008 h storage (Figure  S19 , Supporting Information). Figure  S20 , Supporting Information, shows the optical picture of real devices exposed in air for 7 days, and PA-CSA-treated device has a better ambient stability, which should be related to the passivated surface less vulnerable to oxygen and moisture.  [32]  We conducted the light intensity dependence of J SC and V OC to investigate the charge transfer properties in wide-E g PSCs. The V OC curves as a function of light intensity are depicted in  . The ideal factor value was calculated to be 1.52, 1.30, and 1.21 for NA-, CSA-, and PA-CSA-treated devices, respectively. PA-CSA-processed PSC has the smallest n value compared to the others, indicating the lowest Shockley-Read-Hall recombination,  [41]  in good agreement with the reduced trap density and prolonged carrier lifetime discussed earlier. The J SC curves as a function of light intensity are depicted in Figure  4e . The J SC follows a linear relationship of I α with light intensity. The NA-, CSA-, and PA-CSA-based PSCs have the α values of 0.950, 0.961, and 0.991, respectively, indicating the negligible SCLC in PA-CSA device. Moreover, the PA-CSA-treated device has the lowest dark current (Figure  S21 , Supporting Information), indicating the good film quality with less current leakage.  [37]  We further scrutinized the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of PSCs with different treatments (Figure  4f  ) with equivalent circuit shown in Figure  S22 , Supporting Information. Larger semicircle of Nyquist plot indicates a bigger recombination resistance.  [42]  The NA-treated device has the smallest semicircle, implying the large number of traps in the original film due to the numerous grain boundaries and halide vacancies. The CSA-based PSC shows relatively enlarged semiarch, implying the reduced charge recombination due to the large grains with less grain boundaries. PA-CSA-treated device obtains the largest semicircle, indicating the highly suppressed charge recombination due to the sufficient passivation and reduced trap density in perovskites. Then, we fabricated all-perovskite TSCs with the optimized wide-E g top subcells paired with the 1.25 eV low-E g (FASnI 3 ) 0.6 (MAPbI 3 ) 0.4 bottom subcells. We first constructed 4-T TSCs using a semitransparent 1.68 eV top cell mechanically stacked on a low-E g bottom cells. The scheme picture of our 4-T tandem device is illustrated in Figure  S24 , Supporting Information. The performance of 1.25 eV PSC is 21.16%, as shown in Figure  S25 , Supporting Information. The semitransparent top subcell has an inverted structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/4PADCB/perovskite/C 60 /SnO 2 /ITO, where 4PADCB is (4-(7H-dibenzo[c,g]carbazol-7-yl)butyl)phosphonic acid. Figure  4a  shows that the semitransparent 1.68 eV top subcell has an efficiency of 18.71%, and the filtered 1.25 eV bottom subcell has an efficiency of 8.01%, yielding the performance of 26.72%, higher than the 1.73 eV analogue of 26.18% (Figure  S26  and S27, Supporting Information).  [11]  The corresponding EQE plots of our 4-T TSC are shown in Figure  4b . The 1.68 eV top subcell and the filtered bottom subcell have the integrated current density of 18.78 and 11.61 mA cm À2 , respectively. The steady-state efficiency of the 4-T TSC is shown in Figure  4c . The top and filtered bottom subcells have stable outputs of 18.7% and 8.0%, respectively; therefore, giving the overall steady-state efficiency of 26.7%. Moreover, we fabricated 2-T all-perovskite TSCs with the architecture of ITO/4PADCB/wide-E g perovskite/C 60 /SnO 2 / ITO/PEDOT:PSS/low-E g perovskite/C 60 /BCP/Ag, and the corresponding cross-sectional SEM image is shown in Figure  4d . The top subcell has a wider bandgap of 1.73 eV, because the 1.68 eV wide-E g subcell causes severe current mismatch and low PCE of corresponding 2-T TSC when paired with a 1.25 eV bottom subcell (Figure  S28 , Supporting Information).  [30]  The 1.73 eV based 2-T TSCs have a champion efficiency of 26.76 (26.67)% with a V OC of 2.109 (2.108) V, a J SC of 15.38 (15.41) mA cm À2 , and an FF of 82.5 (82.1)% (Figure  4e ). The power output was recorded to be 26.6% using MPPT method under AM 1.5 G constant illumination, as shown in the inset of Figure  4e . As shown in Figure  4f , the current densities calculated from EQE plots are 15.10 and 14.99 mA cm À2 for top and bottom subcells, respectively, indicating the well-matched current density of two subcells. Figure  4g  shows the stability of the PA-CSA-based TSC, keeping 90% of its initial PCE for 500 h under 1 sun illumination in a N 2 glove box without any temperature cooling units, among the state-of-the-art 2-T all-perovskite TSCs.  [43]   
 Conclusions We fabricated high-quality perovskite absorber layers using a facile PA-CSA process that simultaneously enhances the film crystallinity and in situ passivates the defects. The slowed solvent releasing process facilitates grain growth by merging neighboring crystals into big ones, and the volatile organic passivator can diffuse into the perovskite film bulk and buried surface to eliminate the defects. High-performance wide-E g PSCs with the champion PCEs of 21.28% (1.68 eV) and 20.24% (1.73 eV) were realized, enabling all-perovskite TSCs with PCEs of 26.72% and 26.76% in 4-T and 2-T configurations, respectively. Our PA-CSA strategy provides a feasible method for fabricating high-quality perovskite films and devices upon future industrializations. Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

 Preparation of wide-Eg perovskite films The 1.68 eV FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.8Br0. For NA process, the perovskite films were spin-coated on substrates at 5000 rpm for 60 s with 600 μL diethyl ether dripped on the surface during the spinning. After deposition, the sample was annealed at 65 ℃ for 2 minutes and then 100 ℃ for 10 minutes. For CSA process, the perovskite films were spin-coated on substrates at 5000 rpm for 60 s with 600 μL diethyl ether dripped on the surface during the spinning. After deposition, the sample was rolled over and placed on the filter paper to make the direct contact, and then annealed at 65 ℃ for 2 minutes and then 100 ℃ for 10 minutes. For PA-CSA process, the perovskite films were spin-coated on substrates at 5000 rpm for 60 s with 600 μL diethyl ether dripped on the surface during the spinning.

Low-Eg perovskite film: The low-Eg (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 precursor was spin-coated on substrates at 4000 rpm for 60 s with 600 μL diethyl ether dripped simultaneously during the spinning. The as-deposited film was annealed at 65 ºC for 3 min and then 100 ºC for 7 min. 
 Fabrication of PSCs and tandem solar cells Wide-Eg PSCs: The pre-patterned ITO substrates were cleaned through sonication in deionized water and ethanol sequentially, and then cleaned by UV/Ozone treatment (UVOCS Inc.) for 20 min. The 4PADCB film was spin-coated on the cleaned ITO substrates at 5000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 100 ℃ for 10 min. Wide-Eg perovskite layers were then deposited on the 4PADCB layer with different processes as described above. Then, the samples were transferred into a vacuum chamber for thermal evaporation. C60 (20 nm)/BCP (8 nm)/Ag (100 nm) were sequentially deposited on the perovskite film to complete the solar cell fabrication. Low-Eg PSCs: ITO substrates were treated under UV-ozone for 20 min, and then 20 nm PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated on ITO, followed by annealing at 150 ºC for 20 min in ambient air. The substrates were then transferred into a N2-filled glovebox for the deposition of perovskite films. (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 perovskite absorber layers were spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer at 1000 rpm for 10 s and then 4000 rpm for 60 s. During the spincoating, 600 μL diethyl ether was dropped on the film. The perovskite film was annealed as mention above. After the deposition of perovskite layer, the samples were then put into a high vacuum chamber for the following deposition of functional layers. 20 nm C60 and 5 nm BCP were sequentially evaporated onto the perovskite. 100 nm Ag was finally deposited with an active area of 0.09 cm 2 . At last, the devices were encapsulated with cover glass and UVcurable epoxy. For 4-T solar cells, the device consisted of the top subcell with the structure of ITO/4PADCB/wide-Eg perovskite/C60 (20 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/ITO. The 120 nm ITO electrode was deposited by magnetron sputtering (15 W for 10 min, then 60 W for 30 min). The low-Eg bottom cell was fabricated the same as mentioned above. Squalene oil was used as the light coupling layer between semitransparent top cell and low-Eg bottom cell. For 2-T solar cells, the device structure is ITO/4PADCB/wide-Eg perovskite/C60/SnO2/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/low-Eg perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag. The wide-Eg perovskite top subcell was fabricated using the same method as mentioned above. The interconnecting layer is SnO2/ITO, where 20 nm SnO2 was formed using atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 70 ℃, and the 100 nm ITO layer was deposited by magnetron sputtering at 60 W for 20 min. Deposition of the low-Eg bottom subcell used the same method as described above. The only difference is that the PEDOT:PSS layer was annealed at 100 o C for 10 min. At last, the devices were encapsulated with cover glass and UV-curable epoxy. 
 Film and device characterization The microscopic morphologies were characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (ZEISS, Sigma 300), the accelerating voltage of electron beam was 3 kV. The optical properties including reflectance and transmittance spectra were all measured by spectrometer with a 150 mm InGaAs integrating sphere (PekinElmer, Lambda 1050 S+ UV/vis/NIR). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were scanned from 5°to 60°at a rate of 5°per minute using a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer model on the samples with the structure of ITO/4PADCB/perovskite. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo Scientfic Escalab 250Xi US) was performed using a micro-focus monochromatic Al Kα -ray source, which was corresponded to the instrument resolution of 0.45 eV that was determined by the Ag 3d5/2 peak, and the structure of the tested devices was glass/perovskite. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using Nicolet 6700 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer. Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were performed on perovskite films directly deposited on glasses using flashing light system (FLS980, Edinburgh Inc.). Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurements were performed on a ToF-SIMS.5 instrument from IONTOF, Germany, operated in spectral mode using a 30 keV Bi 3+ primary ion beam. For depth profiling, a 1000 eV O 2+ sputter beam was used to remove the material layer-by-layer in interlaced mode from a raster area of 300×300 µm 2 . Negative ions were collected for depth profile analysis. The mass-spectrometry was performed on an area of 115×115 µm 2 in the center of the sputter crater. For in situ light transmission test, ITO/4PADCB/perovskite structured devices were tested by the home-made system as shown in Figure  S3 , where DC power supply (UTP3303) was used to control the applied voltage, Kaipusen high precision thermometer was used to record the temperature, a halogen light acted as the light source (Ocean Optics, HL-2000), and the fiber optics spectrometer (Ocean Optics, USB4000) was used to test the transmission spectra. J-V curves were measured in air under 100 mW/cm 2 AM 1.5G solar irradiation (SS-F5-3A, Enlitech) with a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter. The light intensity for J-V measurements was calibrated by a standard Si solar cell. The active area of the device determined by an aperture mask was 0.0729 cm 2 . The steady-state efficiencies were obtained by tracking the maximum power point. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were performed from 300 nm to 1100 nm on a QE system (QE-R, Enlitech). The dark current was recorded with a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Agilent, B1500A). Semiconductor parameter analyzer was also used for SCLC measurements, with the voltage swept from -0.1 V to 3 V. For EIS characterizations, electrochemical workstation (CIMPS, Zennium Zahner) was used to test the devices with the structure of ITO/4PADCB/perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag. 
 Calculation Methods All the calculations were performed by using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)  [1] [2]  [3]  in the framework of density functional theory (DFT). The electro-ion interactions were described with the projector augmented wave (PAW)  [4]  approach. The exchange-correlation potential was considered at the level of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) function  [5][6]  . The cutoff energy for plane-wave expansion was 500 eV. The K-point sampling grid was 4 × 8 × 1 for FAPbI2Br of (010 and 101) surface with I vacancy defects. The convergence for force and energy was 0.02 eV/Å and 10 -5 eV, respectively. We set the vacuum thickness greater than 20 Å for avoiding the bonding between the periodic sublayers. The weak Van der Waals bonding in heterostructures was described by adding the Van der Waals dispersion in DFT-D3 approximation.                             2)3 perovskite's precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.6 mmol FAI, 0.2 mmol CsI, 0.2 mmol FABr, 0.8 mmol PbI2 and 0.2 mmol PbBr2 in 1 ml mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO with a volume ratio of 3:1.
