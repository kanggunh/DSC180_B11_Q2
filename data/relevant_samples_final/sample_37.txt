Title: Unified Crystal Phase Control with MACl for Inducing Single-Crystal-Like Perovskite Thin Films in High-Pressure Fusion Toward High Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cell Modules
Perovskite solar cells, recognized for their high photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE), cost-effectiveness, and simple fabrication, face challenges in PCE improvement due to structural defects in polycrystalline films. This study introduces a novel fabrication method for perovskite films using methylammonium chloride (MACl) to align grain orientation uniformly, followed by a high-pressure process to merge these grains into a texture resembling single-crystal perovskite. Employing advanced visual fluorescence microscopy, charge dynamics in these films are analyzed, uncovering the significant impact of grain boundaries on photo-generated charge transport within perovskite crystals. A key discovery is that optimal charge transport efficiency and speed occur in grain centers when the grain size exceeds 10 μm, challenging the traditional view that efficiency peaks when grain size surpasses film thickness to form a monolayer. Additionally, the presence of large-sized grains enhances ion activation energy, reducing ion migration under light and improving resistance to photo-induced degradation. In application, a perovskite solar cell module with large grains achieve a PCE of 22.45%, maintaining performance with no significant degradation under continuous white LED light at 100 mA cm -2 for over 1000 h. This study offers a new approach to perovskite film fabrication and insights into optimizing perovskite solar cell modules.
Introduction Organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been gaining significant attention as a highly promising photovoltaic technology due to their excellent efficiency and solution processability.  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  With a certified efficiency of 25.8%, PSCs are considered among the best-performing solar cell technologies available today.  [6]  Their low-cost and easy-to-manufacture properties and high efficiency make them a prime candidate for widespread adoption in the renewable energy industry.  [7, 8]  However, despite rapid advancements, perovskite polycrystalline film solar cells confront inevitable challenges, including mobile ionic defects from low-temperature solution processes and high-density traps at grain boundaries.  [9] [10] [11]  Compared to polycrystalline films, single-crystal perovskites show lower trap densities, higher carrier mobility, and longer carrier diffusion lengths, offering an opportunity to further improve photovoltaic performance by extending light absorption into the near-infrared spectrum with thicker single-crystal films.  [12] [13] [14]  So far, large-sized mixed halide perovskite single crystals have been grown in solution. However, due to the vertical structure of high-performance perovskite solar cells, where the active layer is sandwiched between transport layers connected to electrodes, these single crystals are not directly suitable for photovoltaic devices.  [15, 16]  The lack of synthesis methods for in situ growth of perovskite single-crystal films on commonly used transport layers and substrates requires additional manufacturing steps.  [12, 17]  These may include thinning or transferring the crystals, potentially causing damage and introducing defects, thereby diminishing their advantages and device performance. To overcome these challenges, Chen et al. successfully grew a 10 μm thick MAPbI 3 single-crystal film (≈37.5 mm 2 ) on a PTAA hole transport layer (HTL) in 2017, achieving a 17.8% efficiency in a perovskite singlecrystal film solar cell device.  [18]  Recently, mixed-cation singlecrystal perovskites have achieved up to 22.8% PCE.  [19]  However, the PCE of single-crystal PSCs is still below the theoretical Shockley-Queisser limit (e.g., ≈31.6% for a 1.5 eV bandgap perovskite absorber).  [20, 21]  Moreover, the effective area of current high-performance perovskite single-crystal solar cell devices is less than 1 cm 2 , limited by isotropic growth in solution and lateral growth constraints once the thickness is limited. The morphology and crystal quality of mixed perovskite single-crystal films on HTL are also crucial for the efficiency and stability of the devices.  [22]  In this research, we developed an innovative approach for fabricating perovskite films. This technique involves utilizing MACl to achieve a uniform grain orientation in the films, followed by a high-pressure process to fuse these grains, resulting in a texture similar to that of single-crystal perovskite. Through visual fluorescence microscopy, we explored the charge dynamics in these films, uncovering that the grain boundaries play a critical role in the transport of photo-generated charges. We found that the most efficient charge transport occurs in grains larger than 10 μm, a finding that redefines existing beliefs about charge transport in perovskite films. Additionally, we observed that larger perovskite grains boost ion activation energy and curb ion migration under light, enhancing the films' resistance to light-induced degradation. This advancement led to a perovskite solar cell module with a PCE of 22.45%, maintaining stability under prolonged exposure to white LED light. Overall, this research provides important insights into enhancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cell modules (PSCMs) and underscore the promise of the CHC method as an effective strategy for developing single-crystal film perovskite solar cells. 
 Result and Discussion The schematic diagram of the CHC program is illustrated in Figure  S1  (Supporting Information). The perovskite film was prepared using the spin-coating anti-solvent method, with a certain amount of MACl doped into the precursor solution. Subsequently, the hydrophobic treated silicon dioxide wafers are tightly adhered to the prefabricated perovskite film, and then sealed sequentially using PTFE film and vacuum bag. The high-pressure cooking process was performed by cooking the membrane in a high-pressure reaction vessel at 100 °C and 10 Mpa N 2 pressure for 6 h, which we previously referred to as the high-pressure cooking process.  [23]  The high-pressure cooking process was repeated three times to produce the CHC perovskite film. The surface morphology of the perovskite films was evaluated using SEM, and the results are shown in Figure  1a, b . The control perovskite film has a relatively rough surface with some micronscale wrinkles. This may be due to the large lattice constant change during the phase transition process from the intermediate phase to the perovskite phase, leading to significant stress. The crystal orientation in this film is somewhat random, and the grain size distribution follows a single peak Gaussian distribution, with an average grain size of 0.23 ± 0.08 μm (Figure  1c ), consistent with previous reports. While the CHC-treated perovskite film surface became remarkably smooth with wrinkles disappearing, and the grain size increased to 7.14 ± 3.68 μm. The maximum grain size of the CHC-treated perovskite film exceeded 20 μm, which is over 38 times larger than that of the control sample. The number of grains in the CHC-treated perovskite film decreased by 560 times under the same effective area compared to the control sample. For a clear comparison, we included topview SEM images of the two types of films at different magnifications in Figure  S2  (Supporting Information). The morphology of perovskite films doped only with MACl, without undergoing the HPC process, was also investigated using SEM (Figure  S3a ,b, Supporting Information). The results showed a slight increase in the average grain size (0.37 ± 0.17 μm) but a significantly rougher surface. To further investigate the impact of different processing methods on the morphology of perovskite films, AFM measurements were conducted, and the results are shown in Figure  1d -i and Figure  S3c -e (Supporting Information). The surface roughness values were estimated to be 10.8, 39.1, and 1.19 nm for the control, MACl, and CHC perovskite films, respectively, which is consistent with our observations from SEM images. The CHC treatment increased the grain size and flattened the perovskite film surface, while MACl doping significantly increased the surface roughness. The height profiles along the surface of perovskites showed maximum height differences of the grain boundary for the three types of perovskite films at ≈40, 100, and 5 nm, respectively. The CHC treatment can significantly decrease surface roughness and the number of grain boundaries, thereby reducing the concentration of deep-level defects, which means that CHC treatment will suppress defects-assisted non-radiative recombination in the perovskite film.  [24]  The cross-section SEM images of CHC perovskite films in Figure  S4  (Supporting Information) show that the films are composed of monolayer perovskite grains. The CHC film has a length-to-height ratio of ≈14.3, and its monolayer structure facilitates the transport and collection of photon-generated charges in monolayer grains without being impeded by grain boundaries. The smooth surface of the CHC perovskite film is beneficial for forming a more uniform and continuous electron transport layer, which can improve device performance.  [25]  To better understand the impact of the CHC process on perovskite nucleation and growth, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) tests were conducted. The XRD patterns (Figure  2a ; Figure  S5 , Supporting Information) revealed distinct and well-defined characteristic perovskite peaks oriented along the (110), (220), and (310) planes for both the control and MACl perovskite films, consistent with previous findings.  [26] [27] [28] [29] [30]  This preference for (110) and (220) crystal orientation is due to the in situ transformation process from PbI 2 to perovskite crystals during the anti-solvent method used for preparing the perovskite films.  [31, 32]  The main peak of (310) may result from the addition of MA + to the precursor solution after the complete dissolution of PbI 2 or because the (310) plane may match the crystal structure of the substrate better.  [33, 34]  Interestingly, after CHC treatment, the perovskite film exhibited preferential orientation along the (110) and (220) planes, exhibiting a texture similar to that of a single crystal. To further investigate the influence of MACl in a sealed, highpressure environment on the growth mechanisms of perovskite grains, we employed SEM to monitor the growth process of perovskite grains under varying parameters during high-pressure treatment. As depicted in Figure  S6  (Supporting Information), the trajectory of perovskite grain growth in the presence and absence of MACl is illustrated. In the absence of MACl, the perovskite grains initially exhibit some larger-sized grains under high pressure, resembling seeds that grow slowly over time. However, grains of different orientations around these seeds seem to act as barriers, impeding rapid growth. Consequently, the final grain size is relatively small, and due to the randomness of growth, the XRD spectra display diffraction peaks of other orientations (Figure  S6e , Supporting Information). In contrast, for perovskite films treated with CHC, no specific seed grains are observed, and the grains appear to grow without significant constraints, exhibiting a rapid growth trajectory over time. This could be due to the incompatibility of MACl molecules with the perovskite structure, possibly being expelled along the (110) plane, promoting preferential orientation along the (110) and (220) planes for larger grain growth.  [34]  In fact, we also tested the XRD patterns of perovskite films with MACl samples (Figure  S5b , Supporting Information), and the results indicate that simply adding a small amount of MACl does not cause significant preferential orientation growth.  [35]  This suggests that a high-pressure and sealed environment can induce a deeper and more prolonged involvement of MACl in the perovskite crystal growth process. Therefore, during the CHC treatment process, MACl can maximize the unification of the grain orientation in perovskite films and then induce more effective and rapid fusion growth of perovskite grains in high-pressure reactions, leading to a perovskite film with a texture to that of a single crystal. Additionally, we conducted grazing incidence wide-angle Xray scattering (GIWAXS) to investigate the crystallization process and orientation features of the CHC perovskite. Figure  2b-d  and Figure  S7  (Supporting Information) show the GIWAXS data obtained from control and CHC perovskite films, including 2D GIWAXS patterns with/without CHC treatment and 1D line cuts extracted from out-of-plane directions. The control perovskite film exhibited characteristic features of the 3D perovskite structure, represented by broad Debye-Scherrer rings. The orientation distribution of crystallites in the control film was isotropic, as indicated by the relatively uniform azimuthal intensity distribution of the diffraction rings (schematic diagrams in Figures 2e; S7, Supporting Information). Note that the control perovskite film contains residual PbI 2 with an evident peak around q = 0.9 Å -1 , which was also observed in the XRD pattern shown in Figure  S5  (Supporting Information). A small quantity of residual PbI 2 mainly comes from the ion escape during the annealing process.  [36]  In contrast, the CHC-treated perovskite film shows no-residual PbI 2 , because of the tight cover by SiO 2 during the CHC treatment process. Besides, the CHC perovskite exhibits a higher diffraction intensity with sporadic, sharp Bragg spots, indicating partial reorientation of the crystallites and leading to a highly oriented perovskite film. The lattice planes schematic diagram for Bragg spots matching of perovskite films after CHC treatment is also presented in Figure  2d  for a clearer illustration. The discrete spots observed at q = 1.0 Å -1 on the qz and qr axes represent lattice planes that are parallel and perpendicular to the surface, respectively, and have a d-spacing of 6.3 Å. It is worth noting that an additional peak is detected at q = 1.0 Å -1 , with a 𝜒 value of 45°, indicating the presence of another grain orientation in the film. This suggests that the CHC-treated perovskite film is still polycrystalline (Figure  2e ), which is not apparent in the XRD patterns.  [37]  Moreover, a discrete diffraction spot is located at q = 1.4 Å -1 with a 𝜒 value of 45°, corresponding to lattice planes inclined at 45°to the surface with a d-spacing value of 4.4 Å. Similarly, another peak observed at q = 1.7 Å -1 with a 𝜒 value of 54.7°corresponds to lattice planes inclined at 54.7°to the surface with a d-spacing value of 3.6 Å. The GIWAXS characterization method is advantageous as it allows all grain orientations to be displayed on a graph. Although perovskite films treated with CHC still exhibit various grain orientations, the significant increase in grain size and the preferential crystal orientation already demonstrate the superiority of this growth process. By meticulously adjusting grain orientation and increasing the number of grain growth cycles, there is a potential to obtain largearea, high-quality perovskite single-crystal films. It has indicated that CHC-treated perovskite films exhibit advantages such as large grain size, high crystallinity, and preferential crystal orientation, all of which indicate good charge transfer properties. To further investigate charge transfer across perovskite grains and charge extraction at the interface, confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope (CLFM), and Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) images were obtained using a multimodule fluorescence microscopic imaging system (Leica Sp8). Compared to traditional steady-state PL spectra and time-resolved PL spectra, CLFM and FLIM enable us to evaluate the PL intensity and PL lifetime distribution of samples at a sufficiently large scale of 100 × 100 μm 2 with fine resolution. Moreover, this system can also help us to understand the polycrystalline perovskite film at a grain scale, allowing for a more comprehensive study of the effects of grain size and crystallization quality on carrier dynamics.  [30, 38]  Figure  3  illustrates the CLFM results of an ETL/CHC perovskite/HTL film. A 600 nm pulse laser was used for the CLFM tests to ensure that the photoluminescence (PL) emission can penetrate deep into the perovskite film. The detection range was set between 700 and 800 nm, which allowed for the collection of most of the PL emissions from the perovskite films (Figure  S8 , Supporting Information). Each pixel in the CLFM image is colored differently to represent different PL intensities (Figure  3a ). The Glow color bar displays the colors corresponding to the PL intensities within the range of 0 to 255. In addition, other color bars were used to color the CLFM image, and their results are shown in Figure  3b, c . Figure  S9  (Supporting Information) shows the FLIM results at the same position, where each pixel is colored differently to represent different PL lifetimes. The spectral color bar provides colors corresponding to PL lifetimes within the range of 0-3 μs (Figure  S9b , Supporting Information). Based on the CLFM and FLIM images, it is evident that perovskite grains of different sizes display significant variations in PL intensities and PL lifetimes. The larger grains (ROI 2) exhibit a lower PL intensity of ≈50 (Figure  3d-g ) and a shorter PL lifetime of ≈0.26 μs (Figure  S9c ,d, Supporting Information) compared to the medium-sized (ROI 3) and small-sized (ROI 4) perovskite grains. The PL lifetime parameters of different grain sizes are summarized in Table  S1  (Supporting Information). This suggests that photo-generated carriers in larger grains undergo more effective and faster carrier transfer within the grains, leading to quicker collection by the ETL and HTL layers. Moreover, the PL intensity of the perovskite grains is closely related to their size. The maximum PL intensity is observed when the grain size is in the range of 0-2 μm, and the PL intensity and lifetime are comparable to those of the control sample (Figures  S10  and S11 , Supporting Information). Furthermore, the large-area statistical results demonstrate that the CHC perovskite film has significantly lower PL intensity and PL lifetime compared to the control film (Table  S2 , Supporting Information), indicating a substantial improvement in charge transfer efficiency and speed due to the distribution of large grains after CHC treatment. As the grain size continues to increase until reaching 10 μm, the PL intensity within the perovskite grains steadily decreases (Figure  3h, i ). Once the grain size exceeds 10 μm, there is no apparent change in the internal PL intensity or lifetime. This suggests that the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite grains, including defect concentration and charge transfer capability, may reach a limiting value as the grain size increases beyond a certain threshold. However, it is worth noting that the PL intensity near the edges of the grains close to the grain boundaries is higher than that at the center of the grains (Figure  3f-h ). This observation indicates that the grain boundaries of polycrystalline perovskite films also affect the charge transfer at the edges of adjacent grains, a conclusion that is supported by the FLIM test results (Figure  S9a , Supporting Information). The influence of grain boundaries on charge transfer can penetrate up to 2 microns into the perovskite grains, which explains why the grain size must be much larger than the thickness of the film to achieve the maximum charge transfer efficiency within the perovskite grains. We also prepared perovskite thin films of other thicknesses using the CHC method, and the results from CLFM further corroborated these findings (Figure  S12 , Supporting Information). Therefore, from the above results, we can conclude that increasing the grain size of perovskite polycrystalline films plays a critical role in improving the photocarrier transfer efficiency of PSCs. The soft ionic crystal structure and ion conduction properties of perovskite materials make ion migration an unavoidable phenomenon in practical applications. Numerous studies have shown that ion migration can cause instability of the perovskite film, leading to film decomposition and device failure. There-fore, suppressing ion migration is crucial in improving the lifetime of perovskite solar cells. In this work, we found that significantly increasing the perovskite grain size can greatly inhibit ion migration. To investigate the photo-stability of perovskite films with different grain sizes, we used fluorescence recovery after the photobleaching (FRAP) technique. In different to our previous work, a higher intensity continuous-wave (CW) laser at 594 nm was used for the bleaching process.  [23]  Figure  4  displays the square FRAP data of control and CHC-treated perovskite films, including CLFM images before, during, and after laser bleaching. We also selected three specific regions of interest (ROIs): the bleached area (ROI 1), an area adjacent to the bleached area (ROI 2), and a region far away from the bleached area (ROI 3), to compare the effects of high-energy laser irradiation on the photostability of perovskite films. In the control film, the ROI 1 region turned blackish-blue after laser bleaching (at the intensity of 8.5 × 10 6 mW cm -2 ), indicating a significant reduction in PL intensity (Figure  4a ). The relevant normalized PL intensity trace of the ROI 1 region (Figure  4b ) showed a decrease in PL intensity to ≈5% of the initial value. After stopping the laser irradiation, the PL intensity in the ROI 1 area underwent two stages of the recovery process: a fast recovery process with a rate of 1.0 s -1 and a slow recovery process with a rate of 0.093 s -1 . On the other hand, the CHC film showed only a slow recovery process with a rate of 0.265 s -1 after laser bleaching (Figure  4e ), and this rate was found to be proportional to the intensity of the bleaching laser (Figure  S13 , Supporting Information). Previous studies have reported that perovskite films may exhibit PL quenching after light exposure, which can be caused by photochemical decomposition, lattice deformation, carrier depletion, and other factors leading to PL-darkness behavior in the perovskite.  [39] [40] [41]  Based on the PL recovery curve, we found that the control perovskite film exhibited a more complex decay behavior under light exposure compared to the CHC perovskite film, and its performance decay behavior was composed of at least two decay processes. In the control perovskite, the PL at ROI 2 area (near bleacharea) exhibited a noticeable reduction in intensity after the laser bleaching process, and the affected area slowly expanded while showing a gradual recovery of PL intensity (Figure  4c ). Since electrons and holes can migrate rapidly in perovskite, depleted carriers recover quickly, within microseconds.  [42]  We inferred that the decrease in PL intensity in the control perovskite film under high-intensity laser may be due to photoinduced ionic migration, resulting from photochemical decomposition. This migration is characterized by diffusion and can recover quickly during the rest.  [43]  We also observed that at ROI 3 (a distance from the bleaching area), the PL intensity was not significantly affected by the laser bleaching (Figure  S14 , Supporting Information), indicating that the lateral migration of ions is limited. Another factor causing PL-weakening is photothermal-induced lattice deformation, which has been reported in our group's previous publications.  [41]  This phenomenon is localized to a single grain and does not diffuse, resulting in a slow recovery process. In contrast, in the CHC-treated perovskite film, PL-weakening was only observed in the illuminated grains, with no significant changes in PL intensity in the surrounding grain edges and boundaries (Figure  4f ). Moreover, by increasing the CW laser intensity to 7.8 × 10 7 mW cm -2 , we observed that PL-weakening still only occurred in the illuminated grains without any diffusion to the surrounding regions (Figure  S12 , Supporting Information). This suggests that CHC-treated perovskite film does not exhibit ionic migration under light exposure, and the observed PL-weakening may be solely attributed to photothermal-induced lattice deformation. Many studies have shown that the migration of ions in perovskite can occur through internal defects in the perovskite grain, including Schottky defects and Frankel defects.  [44]  In addition to internal lattice defects, grain boundaries are also important pathways for ion migration.  [45, 46]  Yang et al. found that the speed of ion migration at grain boundaries is much faster than that inside grains and dominates the process.  [47]  This is because grain boundaries have a relatively open structure, and the ion migration activity is only about half of the bulk material due to the retention of only half of the chemical bonds. Therefore, high defect concentration and more grain boundaries in perovskite films lead to higher instability and easier ion migration under opera-tion. In contrast, according to the results of SCLC tests, the defect concentration of CHC perovskite films with a distribution of large grains is much lower than that of control films (Figure  S15 , Supporting Information). Additionally, perovskite grains in CHC film are compressed and fused during high-pressure treatment, reducing grain boundaries' undulation and width. This means that CHC treatment inhibits the ion migration pathway. Singlegrain dimensional FRAP data can further verify our claim. Figure  S16  (Supporting Information) shows CLFM images of CHC perovskite films before and after the single-grain dimensional FRAP process. When large perovskite grains are irradiated with a higher power density laser, the PL-weakening is also confined to a single grain. We further increase the CW laser intensity to a limit condition (1.5 × 10 8 mW cm -2 ), and the irradiated area will decompose in high-intensity photothermal energy, as shown in Figure  S17  (Supporting Information). It can be observed that the decomposed ions are still unable to escape the confinement of the grain. In the cooling recovery process, the irradiated area cannot return to its original luminescent state, but instead, the broken crystals will recombine and enhance PL intensity (Figure  5a-c ). In contrast, small grains show recoverable PL-brightening (Figure  S18 , Supporting Information) or PL-weakening (Figure  S19 , Supporting Information) at low intensity of bleaching laser (8.5 × 10 6 mW cm -2 ), which again confirms the low light stability of small grains. To further confirm the significant contribution of large grain size in suppressing ion movement, we conducted a series of photoelectronic tests, including steady-state PL spectrum recovery after light soaking, variable temperature electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies, and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurement, to investigate the ion transport kinetics in perovskite films. Figure  5d ,e shows the steady-state PL spectra of control and CHC perovskite films under the dark recovery process, respectively. After 30 minutes of light-soaking (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm -2 ), the intensity of the control PL spectrum decreased to about one-tenth of its original intensity, and the PL peak blue-shifted by 23.6 nm (Figure  5f ). This large blueshift in the PL peak indicates bandgap broadening or distortion compared to the initial film (Figure  S20 , Supporting Information), which should result from bromide segregation induced by iodide migration.  [48, 49]  Furthermore, during the dark-recovery process, the PL peak position quickly returned to its initial position, and then the PL intensity slowly recovered to its initial value. This result is consistent with the FRAP data, where the rapid PL intensity recovery and peak movement correspond to the quick recovery of the ion migration effect, followed by the slow PL intensity recovery corresponding to the slow lattice deformation recovery process. In addition, CHC film did not exhibit ion migration behavior under light illumination, further indicating better photochemical stability of larger grain size. To gain a deeper understanding of ion migration kinetics in perovskite films, we fabricated small-area PSC devices based on two types of perovskite films (detailed device structure and performance are described later) and performed EIS measurements on the devices under dark and AM1.5G illumination conditions. Under dark conditions, the Nyquist plots of the two devices exhibited a single semicircle at different forward bias voltages (Figure  S21 , Supporting Information) and temperatures (Figure  S22 , Supporting Information), indicating that only one type of charge carrier (should be electrons) dominated the charge transport under dark.  [42]  The Nyquist plots of the PSC under illumination showed two different charge transport states, with the semicircle closest to the origin related to the higher frequency spectra and primarily attributable to charge transport impedance. The presence of a linear region far from the origin was attributed to Warburg impedance caused by ion diffusion (Figure  S23a  Supporting Information). The Warburg impedance plot of the same data is presented in Figure  S23b  (Supporting Information), in which the plots of |Z′| and |Z″| as functions of 𝜔 -1/2 in the low-frequency area presents a linear behavior. Both lines have a slope of A W , and the imaginary component intersects the y-axis at zero, providing clear evidence that the linear low-frequency component is caused by Warburg ion diffusion.  [42, 50]  Figure  5g ,f shows the temperature-dependent Nyquist plots of PSCs with control and CHC perovskite films. To evaluate the photoinduced ion migration kinetics, all the Nyquist plots were fitted based on the equivalent circuit model shown in Figure  S23c  (Supporting Information). From the value of T W , we calculated the effective chemical diffusion coefficient (D) using the equation D = (L D ˆ2)/T W , where L D is the effective ion diffusion length (assumed to be equal to the perovskite film thickness).  [51]  At the operating conditions, D was calculated to be ≈2.0 × 10 -11 m 2 s -1 for control and ≈3.6 × 10 -13 m 2 s -1 CHC perovskite, respectively. The E a for ionic diffusion could be determined from its relationship to Tw, as follows Equation  : 1 T w = K B T h a 2 𝛼 L 2 D exp( -E a K B T ), where a represents the lattice parameter of perovskite, 𝛼 is the coordination factor, h is Planck constant, and K B is Boltzmann constant. ln[1/(T T w )] versus 1000/T graph (Figure  5i   on the temperature-dependent Nyquist plots. For the control perovskite, E a was calculated to be 6.2 kJ mol -1 (≈0.06 eV) within a temperature range of 40-80 °C. However, for the CHC sample, E a was 72.0 kJ mol -1 (0.75 eV) at the operating temperature and decreased to 12.3 kJ mol -1 (0.13 eV) at higher temperatures. The ion kinetic parameters of the control and CHC perovskite film are listed in Table  S3  (Supporting Information). The high ionic activity of CHC perovskite implies that its ions are more challenging to migrate compared to the control sample. Furthermore, we estimated the distribution of free ions in the perovskite thin films in the dark environment using the C-V method,  [23]  as shown in Figure  S24  (Supporting Information). The concentration of free ions in CHC perovskite films is significantly lower than that of the control films. These findings suggest that the effective chemical diffusion coefficient of CHC perovskite is much lower than that of the control sample under device operating conditions, with high ionic activity and a low concentration of free ions. These observations are consistent with the fact that CHC perovskite films with large crystal grain distribution exhibit higher stability. To investigate the effect of super large-grain distribution on the photovoltaic performance of inverted PSCs, we fabricated small-area PSCs and mini-PSCMs with the same architecture of ITO/PTAA: F 4 -TCNQ/perovskite/PCBM/Bphen/Al, as shown in Figure  6a . The mini-PSCMs were patterned on a 5 cm × 5 cm substrate using three laser-etching programs (P1-P2-P3, Figure  S25a , Supporting Information) to form 10 independent serially-independent sub-cells connected to form a mini-PSCM in a series structure (Figure  6b ). The J-V curves of the mostefficient control-and CHC-PSCM were compared in Figure  6c . The champion CHC-PSCM showed excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.45% (22.37%) with a high open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 12.03 V (11.98 V), a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 2.37 mA cm -2 (2.35 mA cm -2 ) and a superior fill factor (FF) of 0.794 (0.788) under reverse (or forward) scanning direction. The photovoltaic parameters of CHC-PSCM were significantly improved compared to the control (Table  S4 , Supporting Information). Especially the FF, which approached 80% at an effective area of 14 cm 2 , while the voltage and current showed almost no decay compared to small-area PSCs (Figure  6d ; Table  S5 , Supporting Information). This result is attributed to the more efficient charge transfer and less non-radiative recombination due to the super large-grain distribution in the CHC perovskite film. The statistical histograms of PCE for 30 CHC-PSCMs are shown in Figure  S25b  (Supporting Information), with an average PCE of 21.45 ± 0.45%. We also constructed mini-PSCMs with four and seven sub-cells by adjusting the width of the PSCMs (Figure  S25c ,d, Supporting Information), which exhibited high efficiency of 20.59% and 21.04% (Table  S6 , Supporting Information), respectively. These results demonstrate that CHC treatment significantly enhances the efficiency of PSCMs. The integrated J SC from incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of CHC-PSCs was 22.9 mA cm -2 (Figure  S26 , Supporting Information), while the integrated J SC from CHC-and control-PSCMs were 2.28 and 1.99 mA cm -2 (Figure  6e ), respectively. These values match well with the values captured from the J-V curves. The power output stability of the best-performing control-and CHC-PSCMs is illustrated in Figure  6f . While the control-PSCMs experienced a significant 56.1% PCE loss of exposure to a solar simulator with a light intensity of 100 mW.cm -2 , almost no degradation was observed in the CHC-PSCMs. Moreover, we tracked the PCE of the control-and CHC-PSCMs under 100 mW.cm -2 LED illumination and the results are presented in Figure  6g . After being simply encapsulated, the CHC-PSCMs retained ≈95% of their initial efficiency after 1200 h of continuous illumination, demonstrating outstanding long-term operational stability. Conversely, the control-PSCMs exhibited rapid efficiency decay in the initial stage due to the active ionic migration behavior, followed by a slow recovery and stable operation period. However, after 800 h, the efficiency decreased rapidly, eventually approaching a failure state. By comparing the steady-state output curves and photoluminescence spectra under illumination, we infer that ionic migration in the perovskite film is the main cause of performance degradation, whereas lattice deformation has only a negligible impact on device performance. This needs to be further investigated in our future work. Nonetheless, the distribution of super-large grains in the perovskite film unquestionably improves the stability of the final perovskite solar cell module. 
 Conclusion This research developed an innovative approach for fabricating perovskite films. This technique involves utilizing MACl to achieve a uniform grain orientation in the films, followed by a high-pressure process to fuse these grains, resulting in a texture similar to that of single-crystal perovskite. We explored the charge and ion transport dynamics within these perovskite films and discovered that grain boundaries impact the charge transport properties within adjacent perovskite grains. Optimal charge transport efficiency and rate are achieved at the grain centers only when the grain size exceeds a threshold of 10 μm. This find-ing challenges the traditional belief that the most effective photoinduced charge transport is obtained when grain size exceeds the film thickness, forming a monolayer structure. Furthermore, the presence of large-sized perovskite grains enhances ion activation energy and effectively curbs ion migration under light irradiation, improving the resistance of perovskites to photo-induced degradation. The perovskite solar cell module, incorporating a distribution of super-large grains, attained a PCE of 22.45% and showed no significant degradation under continuous white LED illumination at 100 mA cm -2 for over 1000 h. Overall, our findings offer new perspectives on enhancing the quality of polycrystalline perovskite films. Although CHC-treated perovskite films still exhibit various grain orientations, the marked increase in grain size and preferential crystal orientation underscore the advantages of this growth technique. By further modulating grain orientation and refining the growth process, there is potential to achieve large-area, high-quality perovskite single-crystal films. Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

Experimental section 1. Materials Formamidine hydroiodide (FAI, 99.99%), cesium iodide (CsI, 99.99%), methylammonium bromine (MABr, 99.99%), lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, 99.99%), lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.99%), methylammonium iodide (MAI, 99.99%), Methylamine hydrochloride (MACl, 99.99%) and octadecyltrimethoxysilane (>85.0% GC) were all purchased from TCI. [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), (2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-diylidene)dimalononitrile (F4-TCNQ), Poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA), 4,7-diphenyl-1,10phenanthroline (Bphen) were provided by Nichem Fine Technology Co. Ltd. The solvents used in this work were all purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The FA0.80Cs0.07MA0.13PbI2.64Br0.39 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving FAI (206.4 mg), CsI (27.3 mg), MABr (21.8 mg), PbBr2 (71.6 mg), and PbI2 (601.6 mg) in DMF (0.80 mL) and NMP (0.20 mL). 
 Device fabrication Hydrophobic treatment of Si/SiO2 wafer: After cleaning and drying, the Si/SiO2 wafer was placed under UV-Ozone treatment for 15 min. Next, the Si/SiO2 wafer was annealed in a vacuum oven under octadecyltrimethoxysilane atmosphere at 120 °C for 2 h. The octadecyltrimethoxysilane atmosphere was arranged by dropping 10 μL octadecyltrimethoxysilane into a glass culture-dish. 
 Preparation of control triple-cation perovskite film The perovskite precursor solution was first dropped on ITO/ PTAA: F4-TCNQ surface and then spin-coated at 7000 rpm for 30 s. Afterward, 200 μL of 2-butanol was quickly coated on the wet film for 14-15th seconds during the spin-coating process, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 30 min. 
 Preparation of CHC-treated perovskite film To prepare the CHC-treated perovskite film, 20 mg/ml MACl was added to the perovskite precursor solution. The subsequent steps for preparing the CHC-treated perovskite film were similar to those for the control perovskite film, except that the post-annealing time was reduced to 1 min and subjected to high-pressure cooking. For the high-pressure cooking process, the perovskite film was tightly attached to a hydrophobic-treated Si/SiO2 wafer, and then packaged with a PTFE film and vacuumsealed. The film was then subjected to high-pressure cooking in a reactor at 100 ℃ and 10 Mpa N2 pressure for 6 h, and this process was repeated three times. The high-pressure cooking was carried out using a cylinder filled with nitrogen that provided the necessary pressure. The ITO, HTL, PCBM, Bphen, and cathode were all prepared by the same previously reported methods.  [1]   
 Characterization A sun simulator (Zolix Sirius-SS, AAA) was used to simulate solar irradiation (AM 1.5G, 100mW cm -2 ). The J-V curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter, where the light source output was adjusted by employing a calibrated silicon photodiode (ABET technology). EQE curves were obtained using a homemade system consisting of a power source (Zolix Sirius-SS), a monochromator (Zolix Omni-λ-300), and a source meter (Keithley 2400). SEM images were captured using a cold field emission scanning electron microscope (FEI-Quanta FEG 25), and AFM images were obtained using atomic force microscopy (Bruker dimension icon). The XRD patterns were recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (Ultima IV, RIGAKU, Japan). The Supplementary Tables  Table S1.  The PL lifetime parameters of the perovskite grains from Figure  4g               S1 . The trap densities calculated from the hole-only devices were Nt=1.78×10 15 cm -3 for the control film and Nt=1.29×10 15 cm -3 for the CHC film, respectively. Meanwhile, the electron-only device with CHC perovskite film exhibited a lower trap density of Nt=0.57×10 15 cm -3 compared to the control device with Nt=1.18×10 15 cm -3 , which further confirms the lower defect density of CHC perovskite as observed from the morphology and crystallographic characterization. The lower trap density in the electron-only device can be attributed to the defect passivation of the perovskite surface and grain boundary by the covered PCBM. [Passivation in perovskite solar cells: A review]       To support our ion diffusion degradation mechanism hypothesis further, we modeled the ionic diffusion in the low-frequency regime as a Warburg element (WS), whose impedance is represented in eq 1: 𝑊 𝑠 = 𝐴 𝑤 tanh(𝑗𝜔𝑇 𝑤 ) 𝑃 (𝑗𝜔𝑇 𝑤 ) 𝑃 where AW is the Warburg impedance, TW is the Warburg time constant, and exponent P is   steady PL spectra were collected on a fluorescence spectrometer (OmniPL) with a 600 nm incident laser beam from the air side. Confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscopy measurements including CLFM, FLIM, and FRAP were conducted using a Leica TCS SP8 STED 3X system with an HC PL APO CS2 100×/1.40 OIL objective lens and a time-correlated single-photon counting system PicoHarp 300. This system provided imaging through a point-by-point scanning mode, enabling arbitrary selection of bleaching regions in the sample and free adjustment of laser intensity and action time. A super-continuum visible laser (600 nm, pulse duration <5ps) was used as an excitation light at 80 MHz for confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope imaging and at 2.16MHz for FLIM and TRPL measurements. Additionally, a continuous wave laser (CW) with different intensities was used as a bleaching laser for single-grain scale and square FRAP tests. The emission fluorescence signals of perovskite films were collected by two detectors, a photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector for FRAP and a hybrid detector (HyD SMD) for TRPL and high-resolution CLFM images.
