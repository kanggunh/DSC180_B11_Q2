Title: Enhancing Efficiency of Large-Area Wide-Bandgap Perovskite Solar Modules with Spontaneously Formed Self-Assembled Monolayer Interfaces
Wide-bandgap (WBG)  perovskites play a crucial role in perovskitebased tandem cells. Despite recent advances using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) to facilitate efficiency breakthroughs, achieving precise control over the deposition of such ultrathin layers remains a significant challenge for large-scale fabrication of WBG perovskite and, consequently, for the tandem modules. To address these challenges, we propose a facile method that integrates MeO-2PACz and Me-4PACz in optimal proportions (Mixed SAMs) into the perovskite precursor solution, enabling the simultaneous codeposition of WBG perovskite and SAMs. This technique promotes the spontaneous formation of charge-selective contacts while reducing defect densities by coordinating phosphonic acid groups with the unbonded Pb 2+ ions at the bottom interface. The resulting WBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs) demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 19.31% for small-area devices (0.0585 cm 2 ) and 17.63% for large-area modules (19.34 cm 2 ), highlighting the potential of this codeposition strategy for fabricating high-performance, large-area WBG PSCs with enhanced reproducibility. These findings offer valuable insights for advancing WBG PSCs and the scalable fabrication of modules. P erovskite solar cells (PSCs) have undergone rapid advancement, thanks to their unique properties such as tunable bandgap, high absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length, low exciton binding energy, and more.  [1] [2] [3] [4]  Over the past decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has surged from 3.8% to 26.1%.  [5] [6] [7]  As single-junction PSCs approach their efficiency limit, researchers increasingly focus on perovskite-based tandem cells, such as perovskiteperovskite, 8 perovskite-silicon, 9 perovskite-organic, 10 and perovskite-CIGS 11 configurations. The wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite subcell is a common component in these tandems and crucial for determining tandem device efficiency. Recently, researchers widely employed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as hole transporting layers (HTLs) in middle-bandgap (MBG) PSCs like FAPbI 3 , leading to rapid efficiency breakthroughs.  12, 13  This strategy may extend to WBG perovskites as well, with successful demonstrations of SAMs enhancing WBG PSCs' efficiency.  [14] [15] [16] [17]  However, precise control of SAMs deposition remains a significant challenge for fabricating large-scale WBG perovskites and ultimate tandem modules. Inspired by recent studies on doping SAM molecules into MBG perovskite precursors,  [18] [19] [20]  we propose a facile processing method to simultaneously deposit WBG perovskite and SAMs for large area modules. In our study, we developed a mixed SAMs doping methodology, wherein MeO-2PACz and Me-4PACz are combined in optimal proportions and directly incorporated into the perovskite precursor solution. We found that SAMs descend and anchor onto the ITO during film annealing, providing a well-defined hole transport layer simultaneously. Furthermore, the phosphonic acid groups of the SAMs at the bottom interface coordinate with the unbonded Pb 2+ ions, mitigating defects. Ultimately, the WBG PSCs processed with our codeposition method exhibited a PCE of 19.31% for the small area device (0.0585 cm 2 ) and 17.63% for a 19.34 cm 2 module. These findings highlight the exceptional potential of the codeposition strategy for fabricating high-performance, large-area WBG PSCs and modules. Phosphonic acid SAMs, including 2PACz, MeO-2PACz, and Me-4PACz, chemically adhere to the ITO surface, forming a nanoscale charge-selective contact layer.  21, 22  They are widely used in HTLs because of their high hole selectivity, fast hole
transfer rate, and low interfacial trap state density.  23, 24  Previous research indicates that an optimal combination of MeO-2PACz and Me-4PACz in specific molar ratios offers superior ionblocking capabilities and enhanced interfacial stability, leading to significantly improved performance in MBG PSCs compared to individual SAMs.  25, 26  In our study, we expended this observation to WBG perovskite systems and validated it by assessing the performance of HTLs made from MeO-2PACz, Me-4PACz, and mixed SAMs with various molar ratios through a codeposition approach. Consequently, we determined that mixed SAMs composed of MeO-2PACz and Me-4PACz in a 1:3 molar ratio provided the optimized composition for the HTL in subsequent investigations (refer to Figure  S1 ). We fabricated all the FA 0.8 Cs 0.2 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 WBG perovskite films with a 1.77 eV optical band gap, using the "gas-pumping" one-step method (Figure  S2 ).  27, 28  Detailed information regarding the preparation process is available in the Experimental Section. The target devices were fabricated by codepositing perovskite and SAMs, while the control devices were prepared conventionally, step by step, utilizing the same SAMs and perovskite materials (Figure  1 ). To assess the quality of SAMs using two different methodologies, we conducted atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements. In the control group, mixed SAMs were spin-coated directly onto pristine ITO substrates, followed by an isopropyl alcohol (IPA) rinse. In the target group, SAMs were incorporated into perovskite precursor solutions and deposited onto the substrates, and then the perovskite layer was removed with dimethylformamide (DMF). The specific sample preparation procedure is shown in Figure  S3 . The AFM and KPFM imaging of both groups (refer to Figure  2  and Table  S1 ) revealed significant differences in surface topography and potential compared to the bare ITO surface, confirming the successful attachment of SAMs in both cases. Besides, both groups exhibited nearly identical surface roughness and potential values, indicating that SAMs produced via  codeposition are comparable to, or possibly better than, those from traditional stepwise deposition. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis at various magnifications was conducted to examine the morphological characteristics of the films. The SEM images (Figure  3a, b ) indicate that the target film displays superior uniformity, compactness, and reduced pinholes with grain sizes larger than those of the control film (Figure  S4 ). The control film, however, exhibits more pronounced small white grains, circled in red, identified as excess PbI 2 located at the grain boundaries or surfaces.  29, 30  Cross-sectional SEM images (Figure  S5 ) further reveal closely packed grains in the vertical direction with fewer cavities and grain boundaries in the target film, enhancing carrier transport. Additionally, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements (Figure  S6 ) show that the root-mean-square roughness (R rms ) of the target film (15.48 nm) is significantly lower than that of the control film (17.89 nm), indicating effective reduction of surface irregularities in the perovskite films through the codeposition method. Improved wettability helps to reduce the void at the buried interface, thus improving the quality of perovskite film.  31, 32  We compared the wettability of the control and target via contact angle measurements (Figure  S7 ). The target shows a significantly reduced contact angle of 17.23°, compared with that of 28.98°for the control. This improvement in wettability is expected to substantially improve the quality of the perovskite buried interface and increase the uniformity and reproducibility in film production, thereby facilitating the fabrication of large-area modules. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted to analyze the crystallization of the target and control films. Figure  3d  shows that both films display typical pseudocubic diffraction peaks without peak displacement, indicating that SAMs are not incorporated into the perovskite lattice.  33  However, the target film exhibits increased intensity in the main diffraction peaks of perovskite phases and a noticeable decrease in the peak at 12.88°a ssociated with PbI 2 phases.  34  This suggests a significant reduction in PbI 2 precipitates and an enhancement in perovskite crystalline quality, consistent with the SEM findings. This improvement is largely attributed to the spontaneous formation of SAMs at the ITO/perovskite interface during film annealing. Moreover, the phosphoric acid groups of the SAMs not only anchor to the ITO surface but also coordinate with Pb 2+ at the bottom surface (Figure  3c ), effectively reducing the number of uncoordinated Pb 2+ defect states. XRD patterns of PbI 2 films with mixed SAMs in various molar ratios further confirm the ability of SAMs to suppress uncoordinated PbI 2 (Figure  S8 ). To further investigate the influence of SAMs on perovskite formation, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed. As illustrated in Figure  3e  and Figure  S9 , the Pb 4f 7/2 (137.4 eV) and Pb 4f 5/2 (142.3 eV) peaks of the target film were slightly shifted to a lower binding energy region in comparison with the control film (137.6 and 142.5 eV), which indicates an altered chemical environment of Pb 2+ .  35, 36  Primarily, this alteration can be attributed to the donation of lone pair electrons from the oxygen atoms in the phosphate groups of SAMs to the 6p orbitals of Pb 2+ , leading to a reduction in the Pb 2+ oxidation state.  37  These results The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters further substantiate the effectiveness of SAMs in passivating Pb 2+ defects, highlighting their potential to enhance device performance. The UV-vis absorption spectra (Figure  3f ) suggest enhanced absorption in the target film, likely attributed to its larger grain size and higher crystallinity. Additionally, a slight 5 nm blue-shift in the absorption edge compared to the control film is observed, indicating potentially reduced film defects.  38  This observation is consistent with steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements (Figure  3g ), where the PL emission peak of the target film also blue shifts by 5 nm. However, this shift has a negligible impact on the band gap of the perovskite films, which remains around ∼1.77 eV (Figure  S10 ). Furthermore, the target film displays higher PL intensity compared to the control film, implying lower defect density and reduced nonradiative recombination losses. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were carried out to evaluate charge carrier extraction and lifetimes, as presented in Figure  3h . The decay spectra are fitted by a biexponential decay equation y y A e A e x x 0 1 / 2 / 1 2 
 = + + where A 1 and A 2 are the decay amplitude, and τ 1 and τ 2 are the fast and slow decay lifetime, respectively. Table  S2  lists all of the fitting parameters. Noteworthily, the target film exhibits a longer average carrier lifetime (141.58 ns), almost twice as long as the control film (74.24 ns), which indicates that defectassisted nonradiative recombination in the target film is effectively suppressed due to increased grain size, enhanced crystallinity, and diminished defect density. Defects within perovskite films commonly serve as nonradiative recombination centers for charge carriers.  39  To further quantitatively assess the trap-state density of the devices, hole-only devices with the structure of glass/ITO/SAMs/perovskite/MoO 3 /Ag were constructed for space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) measurements, as shown in Figure  3i . The transition point in the curve from the Ohmic region to the trap-filling region, defined as the trap-filled limited voltage (V TFL ),  40  was measured at 0.184 V for target devices and 0.260 V for control devices. The trap-state density (N t ) can be calculated by the following equation 41 N V eL 2 t 0 TFL 2 = where ε is the relative dielectric constant of perovskite, ε 0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, e is the elemental charge, and L is the thickness of the perovskite film. The calculated trap-state density for target devices was significantly lower at 4.21 × 10 15 cm -3 compared to 5.95 × 10 15 cm -3 for control devices, attributed to the improved grain quality and crystallinity of the films. In the following section, we compared the performance of devices utilizing target and control WBG perovskite films with a device structure of glass/ITO/SAMs & Perovskite/C 60 / BCP/Ag (Figure  4a ). Current density-voltage (J-V) character- The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters istics were measured in both forward and reverse scan directions for both target and control devices, as depicted in Figure  4b , and summarized photovoltaic metrics are provided in Table  1 . The control devices achieved a peak PCE of 18.50%, with 1.294 V V oc , 18.18 mA•cm -2 J sc , and 78.63% FF. In contrast, the target devices exhibited an enhanced PCE of 19.31%, accompanied by 1.313 V V oc , 18.19 mA•cm -2 J sc , 80.84% FF, and nearly negligible hysteresis effects. This significant improvement is attributed to a higher-quality perovskite absorption layer resulting from the codeposition of mixed SAMs and perovskite. Figure  4c  and Figure  S11  present the statistical device parameters of 50 devices fabricated independently under identical experimental conditions. It is evident that the target devices exhibit a narrower PCE distribution compared to the control devices, with an average PCE of 19.02% for target devices, larger than that of the control devices (17.92%), indicating enhanced reproducibility and device performance. Subsequently, external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were conducted to validate the reliability of the J-V data. As shown in Figure  4d , the integrated EQE spectral current for the target and control devices measured 17.71 and 17.66 mA•cm -2 , respectively, closely aligning with the J-V testing outcomes. Furthermore, maximum power point (MPP) tracking of unencapsulated devices under continuous AM 1.5G illumination (depicted in Figure  4e ) revealed that the control devices retained less than 70% of their initial PCE after 260 h, whereas the target devices retained 85% of their initial PCE, demonstrating improved operational stability. To elucidate the carrier transport and recombination mechanisms, light intensity-dependent V oc measurements were performed to ascertain the ideality factor, a critical parameter for understanding defect-assisted recombination in solar cells.  42  A lower value indicates diminished nonradiative recombination. Figure  4f  shows that target devices exhibited a reduced ideality factor of 1.61 K B T/q compared to 2.07 K B T/q for control devices, suggesting that defect-assisted recombination is effectively curtailed and carrier transport efficiency is significantly enhanced in the target devices, primarily reflected  through improved V oc and FF metrics.  43  We further explored the defect-assisted nonradiative recombination V oc losses using external electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQE EL ) measurements. As illustrated in Figure  4g , the EQE EL of the target device at the EL spectral center at 700 nm reached 2.81%. At injection levels near J sc , the target device achieved an EQE EL of 0.60%, nearly double that of the control device at 0.35%, indicating an effective suppression of nonradiative recombination losses in the target devices, consistent with the observed V oc improvement. Whereafter, the nonradiative recombination V oc losses (V OC non-rad ) are quantitatively calculated by the equation listed below  44  V k T q ln(EQE ) 
 OC non rad B EL 
 = where k is the Boltzmann's constant, T is kelvin temperature, and q is the elementary charge. As illustrated in Figure  4h , the target devices experienced lower V oc losses of 133.02 mV compared to 147.03 mV for control devices, providing more compelling evidence of nonradiative recombination suppression. Furthermore, dark current density-voltage (J-V) measurements evaluated the electrical parameters of the devices. As depicted in Figure  4i , the dark J-V curves, plotted on a semilog scale, delineate three regions. Region I provids an indication of the leakage current where the J-V curve demonstrates a nearly linear behavior with a slope about 1/ R sh (R sh is the shunt resistance) when applied external bias changes from negative to low positive voltage.  45  The lower leakage current density suggests that target devices facilitate more efficient hole extraction and mitigate carrier recombination. In region II, the J-V curve reveals an exponential line as the external bias switches from low positive voltage to nearly V oc .  46  According to the Shockley equation, V oc can be assessed using equation V nk T q J J ln oc B sc 0 = i k j j j j j j y { z z z z z z where n is the diode ideality factor, k B is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the elementary charge, J sc is the photogenerated short-circuit current density, and J 0 is the reverse saturation current density. J 0 can be represented as the current density intercept at a V oc of 0 after linear fitting the exponential portion of the dark J-V curve in region II. Compared to the control devices, the J 0 of the target devices is significantly lower contributing to a higher V oc , aligning with J-V test results under standard sunlight. Characterized by an applied external bias exceeding V oc , the J-V response once again demonstrates linear behavior in region III, with a slope of approximately 1/R s (R s is the series resistance).  47  The target devices have smaller R s values than the control devices due to the higher slope in region III, resulting in higher FF and J sc . Building on the demonstrated advantages of the mixed SAMs and perovskite codeposition technique, we fabricated a large-area photovoltaic module consisting of seven subcells. The module has a total illumination area of 19.34 cm 2 , with a geometric filling factor of 95.5%. The subcells are internally connected in series, through a typical P1-P3 laser etching technique.  48  Figures  5a  and 5b  depict the schematic of the laser engraving process and the operational schema of the photovoltaic module, respectively. Our results confirmed the high reproducibility for fabricating large-area modules by a codeposition method, as shown in Figure  S12 . Notably, the champion module achieved impressive V oc , J sc , and FF metrics of 9.28 V, 2.43 mA•cm -2 , and 78.16%, leading to an outstanding PCE of 17.63%, as depicted in Figure  5c . It is important to highlight that this efficiency was calculated over the entire illumination region, including both active areas and inactive interconnects. Figure  5d  shows a realistic image of the large-area photovoltaic module. In summary, we have developed a mixed SAMs doping strategy to enable the one-step codeposition of SAMs layers with WBG perovskite layers. This approach facilitates the spontaneous formation of well-defined SAM HTLs during the perovskite film formation process. Additionally, the functional groups within SAMs can coordinate with unbound Pb 2+ defects at the bottom interface, leading to a significant reduction in the defect densities. Employing this method, WBG PSCs with a bandgap of 1.77 eV achieved an impressive PCE of 19.31%, demonstrating significantly enhanced reproducibility compared to conventional "step-by-step" deposition techniques. Furthermore, our strategy streamlines the fabrication process, resulting in an outstanding PCE of 17.63% for the 19.34 cm 2 WBG perovskite modules. ■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Materials. All of the reagents were used without any additional purification. Lead(II) iodide (PbI 2 , 99.99%), formamidinium bromide (FABr, 99.5%), Fullerene-C60-Ih (C60, >99.5%), 2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethylamine hydroiodide (p-F-PEAI, >98.0%), and 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP, >99.0%, sublimed) were purchased from Xi'an Yuri Solar Co., Ltd. (Xi'an, China). Cesium bromide (CsBr, 99.999%), lead(II) bromide (PbBr 2 , 99.999%), and 2propanol (IPA, 99.9%, anhydrous) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (China). [2-(3,6-Dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (MeO-2PACz, >98.0%) and [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz, >99.0%) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, anhydrous) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%, anhydrous) were purchased from J&K Scientific (Beijing, China). The prepatterned indium-tin oxide (ITO)coated glass substrates (86% transmittance, 15 ohm•sq -1 ) were obtained from South China Xiangcheng Technology Co., Ltd. (China). Preparation of Perovskite Precursor Solutions. For the control perovskite precursor solution, 93.64 mg of CsBr, 219.95 mg of FABr, 80.74 mg of PbBr 2 , and 912.80 mg of PbI 2 were dissolved in a 2 mL mixture of DMF/DMSO with a 10:1 volume ratio. For the target perovskite precursor solution, an additional 0.4 mg of MeO-2PACz and 1.2 mg of Me-4PACz are added to the above-mentioned solution. All solutions were stirred on a 45 °C hot plate overnight and filtered by a 0.22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene membrane before use. Fabrication of the Control and Target Devices. The prepatterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were sequentially washed with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and IPA under ultrasonication for 15 min each and then dried by nitrogen flow. Before the fabrication of the devices, the cleaned substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 20 min. All procedures for device preparation were performed in a nitrogen glovebox. For control devices, the mixed solution of MeO-2PACz and Me-4PACz (0.4 mg•ml -1 in IPA, volume ratio 1:3) was spin-coated on ITO substrates at 6000 rpm for The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters pubs.acs.org/JPCL Letter 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. The perovskite layer was deposited on the ITO/SAMs substrate using a two-step spin-coating procedure at 1000 rpm for 10 s followed by 4000 rpm for 5 s. For target devices, the doped precursor solution was directly deposited on the ITO substrate by the same process. Subsequently, the films were quickly transferred to the vacuum chamber for 5 s of gas-pumping and annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. Next, the p-F-PEAI solution (1.0 mg•ml -1 in IPA) was spin-coated on the films at 5000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min to perform film surface passivation. Finally, the substrates were transferred to the evaporation system. C60 (∼25 nm, 0.2 Å•s -1 ), BCP (∼5 nm, 0.2 Å•s -1 ), and Ag (∼80 nm, 0.8 Å•s -1 ) were sequentially deposited on top of the perovskite by thermal evaporation. Fabrication of the Photovoltaic Modules. The fabrication process for large-area photovoltaic modules bears a similarity to that of small-area devices. Following the cleaning of the ITO-coated glass substrate (6 cm × 6 cm) treated with the P1 laser patterning method, it undergoes a 20 min UVozone treatment. Subsequently, the doped perovskite precursor solution, passivation layer, C 60 , and BCP are sequentially deposited. The deposition method mirrors that used for smallarea devices. Upon completion of the P2 laser etching to create interconnection channels for the subcells, silver electrode deposition is performed, followed by P3 laser etching to achieve interconnection between the subcells. Characterization. The AFM and KPFM images of various samples were acquired using a Bruker Nano Inc. DI Multi Mode 8. For KPFM images, the surface potential difference between the tip and the sample is a relative value, reflecting the average surface potential (SP) distribution of the sample. A gold sample was used to calibrate the work function of the tip prior to the measurement. SEM images of perovskite thin films were obtained using a Utral 55 Electron microscope. XRD patterns of perovskite films were characterized by utilizing an X-pert Powder system. The Agilent Cary 7000 UV-vis spectrometer was utilized to obtain the absorption spectrum. Both PL and TRPL were evaluated by using a custom-built confocal fluorescence system. A 532 nm Continuous Wave (CW) laser and a 515 nm picosecond laser were employed for PL and TRPL measurements, respectively. PL spectra were collected using a spectrometer (Princeton Instruments) equipped with a liquid-N 2 -cooled CCD (PrLoN-IR). TRPL decay curves were captured by utilizing a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) module (PicoHarp 300) and a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detector (IDQ, id100) with an instrument response function of approximately 100 ps. J-V characteristics were measured under an AM 1.5G simulator (EnliTech, Class AAA) in the N 2 -filled glovebox. The light intensity was 100 mW•cm -2 calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell. J-V curves were extracted using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter with a scanning rate of 100 mV•s -1 , voltage steps of 20 mV, and a delay time of 100 ms. Metal masks were positioned in front of the tested devices to control the illuminated area. EQE measurements were performed by using an integrated system (QER3018) from EnliTech. By adjusting the AM 1.5G simulator device, the light source with different light intensities ranging from 0.01 to 1 Sun were obtained to perform the V oc dependence on the light intensity measurements. An in-house developed system, including a spectrograph (QE-65000, Ocean Optics), an integrated sphere, and a photodetector array, was utilized to perform EQE EL measurements. A Keithley 2400 sourcemeter connected to the test system was employed to supply voltage sources and record the injected current.

Title: Name: Peer Review Information for "Enhancing Efficiency of Large-Area Wide-Bandgap Perovskite Solar Modules with Spontaneously Formed Self-Assembled Monolayer Interfaces" First Round of Reviewer Comments
presents a novel co-deposition approach of co-depositing self-assembled monolayer (SAMs) with wide-bandgap perovskite layer in one step, which greatly simplifies the preparation process of perovskite solar cells. This work is interesting and significant. It would benefit the community of perovskite materials and charge transport materials as well as solar cells. Therefore, I would recommend acceptance of this manuscript after addressing the following minor comments/issues. 1. When characterizing SAMs prepared by different strategies using AFM and KPFM, what are the specific preparation procedures for the target group samples? 2. The authors have not provided sufficient details regarding the preparation of large-area modules. The authors should provide a more detailed description in the experimental section to increase the reproducibility of the experiments. 3. Figure 3c: please provide some description of this figure in details. It is suggested to provide further elaboration on it. Additionally, errors in the labeling of Figure 4 are found. Please correct them. 4. Some recent publications on SAMs and wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells are suggested to be cited. 
 Reviewer: 2 Comments to the Author This manuscript extends the mixed self-assembled monolayer (SAMs) doping strategy to large-area wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite photovoltaic modules, resulting in significantly improved film crystallinity and an effectively reduced density of film defect states. The fabricated WBG photovoltaic module with an area of 19.34 cm2 exhibits a remarkable power conversion efficiency
(PCE) of 17.63%. If the following questions can be satisfactorily addressed, publication of this manuscript is recommended. 1. A one-step "gas-pumping" method was employed for perovskite film preparation in this study. It is advisable for the authors to provide a detailed description of this method in the experimental section, thereby furnishing a robust reference for fellow researchers. 2. Notably, in comparison with the control film, the UV-Vis absorption spectra and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the target film exhibited a corresponding blueshift. Elucidation is warranted regarding whether this blueshift phenomenon would affect the bandgap of the film.

 Comment: A one-step "gas-pumping" method was employed for perovskite film preparation in this study. It is advisable for the authors to provide a detailed description of this method in the experimental section, thereby furnishing a robust reference for fellow researchers. 
 1. Reply: We thank you for emphasizing the importance of providing a detailed methodology for the one-step "gas-pumping" method used in our perovskite film preparation. Acknowledging this valuable suggestion, we have added vacuum chamber structure and working principle diagram of the "gas-pumping" one-step method in the revised Supporting Information (Figure  S2 ). We believe that these added details will greatly facilitate fellow researchers in reproducing our work and leveraging the gas-pumping method for their studies. 
 2. Comment: Notably, in comparison with the control film, the UV-Vis absorption spectra and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the target film exhibited a corresponding blueshift. Elucidation is warranted regarding whether this blueshift phenomenon would affect the bandgap of the film. 
 Reply: We appreciate your astute observation concerning the blueshift in the UV-Vis absorption spectra and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the target film compared to the control film. To address this point, we have conducted additional analyses on Tauc plots of absorption spectra of control and target films (Figure  S10 ). We found that this subtle blue shift has almost no effect on the bandgap of the film. This expanded discussion aims to provide a clear understanding of the relationship between the observed blueshift and the bandgap of the films. : Figure 3c: please provide some description of this figure in details. It is suggested to provide further elaboration on it. Additionally, errors in the labeling of Figure 4 are found. Please correct them.
