 TAc-SnO2 solution The SnO2 colloidal solution was diluted with deionized water in a ratio of 1:3. Titanium (IV) isopropoxide (12 g) was mixed with acetic acid (2.4 g). After 10 min, the solution was slowly added drop by drop into 200 g of deionized water. After 12 h stirring at room temperature, the solution was added with 2 g of nitric acid and heated at 80 ℃ for 75 min, resulting in a stable light-blue suspension of TiO2 (TAc). The TAc solution was added into the diluted SnO2 colloidal solution (2.5 wt%) to create the TAc-SnO2 solution. 
 PSC fabrication The fabrication process of PSCs using the solvent engineering method is shown in Fig.  S1 . Patterned FTO glass was sequentially cleaned with ethanol, isopropanol, 
 S3 and O2 plasma. The TAc-SnO2 solution was spin-coated on the FTO glass at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Subsequently, the coated glass was annealed at 185℃ for 1 h to form TAc-SnO2 electron transport layer. CsI (0.087 M), FAI (1.47 M), MABr (0.23 M), PbI2 (1.47 M), PbBr2 (0.23 M) were mixed in the mixture of DMF, DMSO, and acetone in the volume ratio of 7.2:1.8:1. The perovskite precursor solution (70 μL) was spin-coated onto the TAc-SnO2 substrates at 3000 rpm for 35 s in a chamber with approximately 70% RH. At the 12 th s after spin started, a solution of 0.05 vol.% PETA in MA with a small amount of HMPP (400 μL) was quickly dropped onto the coating layer. The sample was then annealed at 100℃ for 1 h and subsequently UV-Cured at 500 mJ • cm 2 . Spiro-OMeTAD (72.3 mg), 4-tBP (28.8 μL), Li-TFSI (17.5 μL, 260 mg • mL -1 in AN), and FK209 (29 μL, 300 mg • mL -1 in AN) were mixed in 1 ml of chlorobenzene. 70 μL of the Spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated onto the top side of the perovskite layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a top electrode of 100-nm thick silver was deposited using thermal evaporation. 
 Characterizations The photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) curves of PSCs were measured under an AM 1.5 condition using a solar simulator (MFS-PV, Hong-Ming Technology) coupled to a source meter (Keithley 2400, Keithley Instruments). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of PSCs was analyzed using an external quantum efficiency measurement system (QE-R, Enli Tech). The perovskite layers were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Miniflex II, Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation, UV-Vis spectra (V770, Jasco), and SEM images (JSM-7600F, JEOL). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and the time-resolved PL (TRPL) emission spectra were measured using a fluorescence spectrometer  Horiba)  equipped with a DeltaTime TCSPC-MCS kit and a 405-nm pulsed LED source. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured in dark and V=VOC conditions using an electrochemical workstation (Zennium, Zahner). Energy levels of perovskites were determined through ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), 
 S4 and elemental analysis and binding energy of perovskites were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These analyses were conducted with an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (PHI 5000 VersaProbe III, ULVAC-PHI) with helium energy (He I) of 21.21 eV. Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM) measurements were performed using a scanning probe microscope (Dimension ICON XR, Bruker).

Title: Pinhole Patching by Free Radicals for Highly Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells Fabricated in High-Moisture Environments
2-Hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone (HMPP) and pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA) are introduced into the perovskite layer via an antisolvent to enhance the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) fabricated in a moisture atmosphere. Interestingly, the free radicals created from the decomposition of HMPP and PETA by irradiating UV light can effectively patch pinholes in the perovskite layer and regrow the crystal to enlarge the grain size. PETA can interact with Pb atoms via its lone pairs of electrons and forms a framework over the perovskite layer by in situ UV polymerization, resulting in a low trap-state density, high charge recombination resistance, long charge lifetime, and reduced hysteresis. Additionally, the PETA framework induces an enhanced driving force for charge separation at the heterojunction of the electron transport layer and the perovskite layer by adjusting the energy level of the perovskite. Consequently, a PSC with a silver top electrode can be fabricated under 70% RH conditions, exhibiting a high efficiency of 19.52% and good long-term stability. This enhancement surpassed most reported values in the literature for PSCs fabricated in a highly moist atmosphere.
■ INTRODUCTION Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been widely recognized as the most promising emerging photovoltaic technology in light of their simple manufacturing process and high power conversion efficiency (PCE).  [1] [2] [3]  The high PCE is mainly attributed to exceptional photovoltaic properties of perovskite crystals, including long carrier diffusion length, high absorption coefficient, and low exciton binding energy.  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]  On the flip side, perovskite crystals are highly sensitive to moisture during fabrication and storage. The ambient moisture accelerates crystal growth that results in poor morphology, incomplete surface coverage, pinholes, and reduced efficiency.  10, 11  Therefore, to solve the moisture issue, most reported PSCs were prepared in a glovebox under a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent moisture damage. Considering the manufacturing cost and commercial application, developing a fabrication process of PSCs under the ambient conditions is highly desirable.  [12] [13] [14] [15]  While some additives have been employed to increase the hydrophobicity or the stability of PbI 2 layers and enable the preparation of PSCs in high-humidity conditions, the strategies are limited to the two-step process.  [16] [17] [18] [19]  Watson's group  20  and Hayase's group  21  have found that acetate demonstrates moisture-absorbing properties owing to its substantial water solubility and high vapor pressure. They have effectively employed acetate as an antisolvent in a single-step process to create dense and uniform perovskite layers even in a moisture atmosphere. Recently, we demonstrated that without the aid of a preheating substrate, only the acetate antisolvent is insufficient to form pinhole-free perovskite layers under a high-humidity atmosphere.  22  In fact, auxiliary tools or processes, such as substrate heating and air-knife flow, are usually inevitable for fabricating perovskite crystals under ambient conditions.  [23] [24] [25]  These tools or processes can accelerate solvent evaporation to form homogeneous and dense perovskite layers. However, it remains a challenge to discover new technologies without any aid for the fabrication of PSCs in a moisture atmosphere to reduce manufacturing complexity and cost. Besides damage in the fabrication process, moisture also gradually degrades perovskite crystals during usage and storage, impacting the long-term stability of PSCs. The addition of polymers has been widely employed to fabricate highly efficient, stable, and hysteresis-reduced PSCs. These approaches include introducing polymers into functional layers, insertion of polymers into interfaces, double-polymer doping, double-position doping, and using polymers as sacrificial templates.  26  Diverse polymers such as PVP, PEG, PEO, PMMA, and PS have been incorporated into perovskite precursor solutions or antisolvents to stabilize perovskite layers against moisture attack.  [27] [28] [29] [30] [31]  By leveraging the hydrophobicity and coordination abilities of these polymers, the polymeradditive strategy not only inhibits the hygroscopicity of amine salts but also passivates grain defects. However, a challenge arises from the fact that perovskite precursor solutions utilize polar solvents, while antisolvents are nonpolar. This limitation leads to a lack of compatible and soluble polymers that can be utilized in either perovskite precursor solutions or antisolvents. The presence of insoluble polymer precipitates could potentially hinder charge transport and compromise the overall functionality. For the reason that polymerization of monomers dramatically reduces their thermodynamic entropy, monomers are much easier to dissolve in solvents than their polymers. Moreover, monomers are more efficient at interfacing with the perovskite at grain boundaries than their polymers due to their higher degree of freedom. For dissolving in solvents, polymers are restricted to being thermoplastic,  32  whereas monomers can undergo in situ polymerization to form a continuous crosslinking network in perovskite layers, featuring better mechanical properties and a more compact interaction with the perovskite. To date, only a limited number of studies have addressed the incorporation of monomers and in situ polymerization within perovskite layers. Most of these studies primarily focused on adding monomers to perovskite precursor solutions.  [33] [34] [35]  However, none has extensively discussed the impact of in situ polymerization on the perovskite layer itself. Incorporating monomers/polymers into precursor solutions might lead to more intricate interactions with the perovskite, including the formation of a macromolecular intermediate phase, a polymer scaffold, and potential retardation of the perovskite phase transition. Conversely, adding these components into antisolvents offers a simpler approach to applying monomers or polymers for stabilizing perovskites. Typically, substrate heating or air-knife flow is necessary to overcome the moisture-related issue for the PSC fabrication under a humidity atmosphere.  25  In this study, we are the first to add UV-curable monomers in an antisolvent to fabricate PSCs in a relative humidity (RH) of 70% without any auxiliary processes or equipment. By utilizing a highly volatile solvent and leveraging free radicals, the resulting PSCs exhibit a low trap-state density, high moisture resistance with a 15% efficiency drop over 600 h, and a PCE of 19.52%. This achievement surpasses a significant portion of previously reported values in the literature for PSCs fabricated under humid conditions. The improvement in long-term stability, efficiency, and manufacturability in high-moisture environments can be attributed to free radical healing, the hydrophobicity of monomers, and the effective coordination of functional groups with lead atoms. The impacts of UV irradiation and initiator/monomer incorporation on perovskite morphology, charge recombination, trap-state density, hysteresis, and energy levels were thoroughly investigated. 
 ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In the fabrication process for PSC devices, we incorporated 2hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone (HMPP) as a photoinitiator and PETA as a monomer onto the perovskite layer through the dripping of an antisolvent followed by exposure to UV light. To assess the individual effects of HMPP/PETA incorporation and UV irradiation on the growth of perovskite crystals under 70% RH conditions, we examined the morphologies of the perovskite layers fabricated under various conditions using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure  1  at higher magnification and Figure  S2  at lower magnification). The HMPP incorporation, HMPP/PETA incorporation (Figure  2 ), or UV irradiation worsens the film coverage and induces some pinholes in the perovskite layer. After UV irradiation, regardless of HMPP or both HMPP/PETA incorporation, the pinholes disappear, and the perovskite layers become pinhole-free again. These results suggest that the incorporation of small molecules may impede the formation of pinhole-free perovskite layers, while the UV irradiation can damage the perovskite crystals. Nevertheless, the free radicals generated by UV light decomposition of HMPP or PETA can repair the pinhole surface of the perovskite layers. The average grain sizes for the different cases, namely pristine, UV irradiation, HMPP incorporation, HMPP incorporation followed by UV irradiation, and HMPP and PETA incorporation followed by UV irradiation (denoted as pristine, UV, HMPP, HMPP-UV, HMPP/PETA-UV, respectively), are as follows: 390.0 ± 56.9, 260.4 ± 49.0, 364.8 ± 50.1, 381.6 ± 50.5, and 466.0 ± 60.7 nm. Compared with the pristine conditions, UV irradiation prunes the perovskite grain, whereas the presence of free radicals increases the grain size by promoting the regrowth of perovskite crystals. We conducted further analysis to examine the influence of the UV dose on morphologies of the perovskite layers. Figure  2  shows the SEM images of the perovskite layers for the pristine, HMPP, and HMPP/PETA samples with various UV irradiation doses. It was observed that HMPP free radicals can effectively repair pinhole issues at a dose of 1.3 J•cm -2 . However, excessive UV dosage (>1.3 J•cm -2 ) leads to the reappearance of pinholes due to the damage of UV light. In contrast, the incorporation of HMPP/PETA exhibits better tolerance to UV light, as pinholes appear only at dosages exceeding 3.9 J•cm -2 . Nonetheless, high UV dosage (>13.0 J• cm -2 ) can significantly decompose perovskite crystals. Figure  3a  reveals the inherent XRD patterns of mixed-cation CsFAMAPbI 3-x Br x for the perovskite layers with and without HMPP/PETA incorporation and UV irradiation. The patterns reveal the characteristic planes (110), (  112 ), (  202 ), (  220 ), (213), (310), (312), (224), and (314), corresponding to the peaks at 13.4, 19.3, 23.9, 27.7, 29.7, 31.1, 34.4, 39.9, and 42.5°, respectively. The peaks at 10.1°are assigned to the MABr crystal induced by the acetone addition in the perovskite precursor solution, which helps in passivating interface/grain boundary defects and suppressing charge recombination.  36  However, the peak intensities slightly decrease owing to UV irradiation, which can be restored by incorporating HMPP/ PETA. Figure  3b, c  illustrates the variation of the peak intensity of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the perovskite crystals at different UV doses. As the UV dose increases, the peak intensity gradually decreases for the pristine perovskite crystals. In contrast, the peak intensity for HMPP/PETA-UV remains unchanged until a dose of 13.0 J•cm -2 . These results are consistent with the SEM observations. Figure  4a  displays the current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the PSCs with TAc-SnO 2 electron transport layers  37, 38  for HMPP/PETA incorporation measured under 1 sun illumination, and the corresponding photovoltaic properties are listed in Table  1 . As expected, only HMPP incorporation leads to deterioration of the photovoltaic performance. However, after UV irradiation, the presence of free radicals turns the efficiency up. The HMPP/PETA-UV cells reveal the highest PCE, in which the champion cell has a V OC of 1.117 V, J SC of 24.08 mA•cm -2 , FF of 72.62%, and PCE of 19.52%. Compared to the pristine PSC, the incorporation of UV-curable monomers results in a nearly 10% enhancement in PCE, primarily due to improvements in V OC , J SC , and FF. To analyze charge transfer within the cells, the EIS measurement of PSCs was performed at V = V OC under dark conditions. Figures  4b  and S3  reveal two semicircles in the Nyquist plot, where the semicircles in the high-and low-frequency regions are associated with the charge transfer resistance (R tr ) and the charge recombination resistance (R rec ), respectively. Compared to the pristine cell, HMPP and PETA incorporations slightly increase the R tr but prominently increase the R rec after UV irradiation (Table  1 ).  HMPP-UV has similar results, but its R rec is smaller than that of HMPP/PETA-UV, indicating that the polymeric network has better performance in suppressing charge combination than the photoinitiator. Although the free radicals and polymeric network somewhat impede charge transfer, they significantly reduce the defects. To gain further insights into the charge transfer mechanism inside the PSCs, the space charge limited current (SCLC) analysis was used to determine   the trap-filled limit voltage (V TFL ) via an electron-only cell with a structure of FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite/PC 61 BM/Ag. Figure  4c  shows that the values of V TFL for the pristine, HMPP, HMPP-UV, and HMPP/PETA-UV are 0.19, 0.24, 0.10, and 0.09 V, corresponding to the trap-state density (n trap ) of 2.27 × 10 15 , 2.58 × 10 15 , 1.05 × 10 15 , and 9.00 × 10 14 cm -3 , respectively. The results align with the EIS analysis and indicate that HMPP or HMPP/PETA incorporation, followed by UV irradiation, reduces n trap and suppresses charge recombination, implying that the free radicals and the polymeric network passivate the defects in the perovskite layer. The reduction of n trap and charge recombination rate also manifests more efficient excitation of electron-hole pairs from the perovskite crystals, as demonstrated in PL spectra (Figure  4d ), ultimately improving the V OC (Table  1 ).  39  The PL blue shifting is attributed to the result of lower trap density.  40, 41  The order of magnitude of blue shifting is in good agreement with the results of the EIS and SCLC analyses. However, why does the HMPP/PETA incorporation result in a better improvement for the perovskite layer compared to HMPP alone? To further investigate the passivation mechanism, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis to comprehend the interaction between the perovskite and HMPP/PETA. Figure  5a  shows two peaks in the XPS spectra of Pb, corresponding to electron states 4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 . A shoulder peak appears on the right side next to each main peak near 135.2 and 140.1 eV in the spectra of the pristine, HMPP, and HMPP-UV perovskites, indicating the presence of some Pb atoms in a high oxidation state. However, the shoulder peaks disappear when PETA is incorporated. Because the PETA features the ketone, ether, and hydroxyl functional groups, we conceive that the lone pairs of these functional groups interact with Pb atoms, leading to a reduction in the oxidation state,  42  as depicted in Scheme 1. The interaction between PETA and Pb atoms not only enhances the growth of perovskite crystals in a high-moisture atmosphere but also passivates existing defects. Figure  S4  shows the forward-scan (FS) and reverse-scan (RS) J-V curves of the PSCs with/ without the PETA network. The hysteresis can be evaluated using the hysteresis index (HI): calculated as HI = (PCE RS -PCE FS )/PCE RS . The HI value decreases from 0.062 to 0.031. Although Habisreutinger et al.  43  suggested that HI might not serve as a reliable scientific indicator of performance enhancement, a low HI value may indicate a reduction in charge accumulation at grain boundaries when the cells possess identical structures and are measured under the same conditions. Compared to the pristine cell, the PETA network reduces the roughness of the perovskite layer from 41.8 to 35.5 nm (Figures  5b  and S5 ) and increases the contact potential difference (decreases the work function) (Figure  S6 ), confirming the interaction between the PETA polymer and perovskite crystals. Additionally, the PETA incorporation increases the average electron lifetime (τ ave ) from 327.8 to 588.0 ns, as calculated from the TRPL spectra (Figure  5c ) using a biexponential decay function with fast (τ 1 ) and slow (τ 2 ) time constants (Table  S1 ). This observation supports the previous analysis that PETA incorporation reduces n trap and R rec . The valence band maximum (VBM) of the perovskite layer with and without PETA polymer incorporation can be determined using the equation VBM = E He -E cutoff + E onset , where E He represents the energy of photons emitted by helium gas (He I) and E cutoff and E onset are calculated from the cutoff region and valence band edge region of the UPS spectra, respectively (Figure  6a, b ).  44, 45  The energy gap can be determined from the UV-vis spectra (Figure  6c ), allowing us to determine the conduction band minimum (CBM) by adding the VBM to the energy gap. All corresponding energy level values are given in Table  2 . Upon observing the energy levels for the PSCs (Figure  6d ), we note that the incorporation of the PETA polymer slightly raises the CBM and VBM of the perovskite (agreeing with the KPFM analysis, shown in Figure  S6 ), increasing the CBM difference between the electron transport layer (ETL) and the perovskite heterojunction from 0.04 to 0.18 eV and reducing the VBM difference between the hole transport layer and the perovskite heterojunction from 1.00 to 0.86 eV. The changes strengthen the attractive force to extract electrons from perovskite to the ETL and reduce the energy loss during hole transfer. Due to a smaller n trap , larger R rec , and greater driving force for charge separation, the PSCs with the PETA incorporation display stronger external quantum efficiency over the range of 300-800 nm compared to the pristine PSC (Figure  6e ). The J SC can also be determined by integrating the IPCE spectra, and the values obtained align well with the measured ones. The presence of the PETA free radicals and polymer network indeed improves the feasibility that PSCs are fabricated in high-moisture atmospheres. Furthermore, the PETA polymer network also enhances the long-term stability of PSCs. Figure  6f  demonstrates that the efficiency of the unencapsulated pristine cell drops to zero after 500 h exposure to the storage conditions of 30 °C and 50% RH, whereas the unencapsulated PSC with PETA incorporation still retains over 83% efficiency after a 600 h test. Nevertheless, an excessive UV irradiation dose will cause a decrease in long-term stability (Figure  S7 ). 
 ■ CONCLUSIONS We discovered that the free radicals generated by UV light can effectively patch up pinholes in the perovskite layer, despite the potential damage caused by the UV light itself. Through in situ polymerization of PETA monomers over the perovskite layer, defects are passivated, resulting in a reduction in n trap , an increase in R rec , and an enhancement of τ ave . The improvement may arise from the repair capability of PETA radicals and the interaction between the functional groups of PETA and the Pb atoms. Additionally, the chemical anchoring of PETA to the Scheme 1. Schematic Representation of the Interaction between the PETA Network and Perovskite Crystals at the Interfaces perovskite leads to an upshift in the energy levels of the perovskite, creating a strong extraction force for charge separation. As a result, we have successfully fabricated a highly efficient PSC with a PCE of 19.52% even under a high humidity of 70% RH. The improvement exceeded the majority of documented values in the literature for PSCs produced under highly humid conditions. The PETA network also acts as a protective barrier, safeguarding the perovskite layer against moisture-induced degradation. The unencapsulated cell retains over 83% efficiency after a 600 h exposure to conditions of 30 °C and 50% RH.
