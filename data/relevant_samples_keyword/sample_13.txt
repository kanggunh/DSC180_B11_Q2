Title: Regulating the crystallization of mixed-halide perovskites by cation alloying for perovskiteorganic tandem solar cells †
Halide segregation and energy loss pose significant challenges for wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells, impairing their photovoltage and device stability. These issues are often exacerbated by inferior film quality and inhomogeneous halide distribution due to unbalanced crystallization processes. To address these challenges, we developed a novel strategy using a cation alloy that not only tailors the lattice properties and crystallization but also effectively passivates the defects. This approach enables homogeneous halide distribution and substantially reduced defect density. These improvements have led to a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.50% with a record open-circuit voltage of 1.35 V for 1.79 eV perovskite solar cells, approaching B90% of its S-Q limit. Furthermore, the champion device could maintain 93% of its initial efficiency after operating at its maximum power point for 500 hours. By integrating these perovskite devices into a monolithic perovskite-organic tandem solar cell (PO-TSC) as the wide-bandgap subcell, we demonstrated a high PCE of 25.54%. This efficiency is among the highest values reported for PO-TSCs, presenting a significant step forward in these promising tandem cells. 
 Broader context The perovskite-organic tandem solar cells (PO-TSCs) have diverse applications, such as high-efficiency photovoltaic devices, wearable electronics, and semitransparent building-integrated photovoltaics. However, serving as the front subcell, the unbalanced crystallization kinetics in mixed-halide wide-bandgap perovskites usually leads to inferior film quality with inhomogeneous halide distribution, resulting in severe energy loss and poor long-term device stability. The multi-functional IA cations with ideal ionic radii can be alloyed within perovskites as A-site, thus homogenizing the halide distribution and stabilizing the lattice structure by modulating the crystallization dynamics of perovskites. Using this strategy, we demonstrate the wide-bandgap perovskite solar cell with a V OC of 1.35 V and impressive long-term operation stability, and the perovskite-organic tandem solar cell with a remarkable efficiency of 25.54%.
Introduction Multi-junction solar cells, particularly two-junction tandem solar cells (TSCs), present a promising avenue to exceed the efficiency limits of single-junction devices.  [1] [2] [3]  By integrating two photoactive layers with complementary absorption spectra, TSCs can efficiently harvest visible and near-infrared photons to substantially reduce thermalization losses.  4, 5  Theoretically, TSCs could achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 45%, far surpassing the B33% limit of single-junction cells.  4, 6  Among the state-of-the-art TSCs, perovskites often serve as the wide-bandgap front sub-cell because of their tunable bandgaps and high absorption coefficients. By alloying various halides (i.e., I, Br, and Cl) at the X-site, the bandgap (E g ) of perovskites can be continuously tuned from 1.25 to beyond 2.0 eV. This flexibility allows perovskites to be paired with diverse narrowbandgap rear sub-cells, like c-Si,  7  copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS),  8  Sn-Pb binary perovskites,  9  and organic semiconductors,  10  to construct TSCs. Despite the great potential, high Br content (420%) in I/Br mixed halide perovskites usually leads to significant photovoltage deficits and compromised long-term device stability.  11, 12  These losses and instability primarily stem from high defect densities and halide segregation, resulting from the unbalanced nucleation rates between I-and Br-components.  13, 14  As Br-based intermediate phases are thermodynamically favored, the intrinsic halide distribution can be inhomogeneous in as-formed perovskites, leading to inferior crystallinity as well.  15  Therefore, the photovoltage plateau is commonly observed in wide-bandgap PSCs with E g above 1.75 eV. Over the past few years, numerous studies have revealed that halide segregation is mostly driven by halide oxidation in perovskite.  [16] [17] [18]  Under the external stimulus, the preferential iodide oxidation occurs in I/Br mixed halide perovskites, forming local concentration gradients of its oxidized species, which in turn trigger halide migration through surfaces, voids, and grain boundaries in perovskites, and eventually forming segregated domains.  17, 19, 20  Therefore, improving the crystallinity and homogeneity of the halide distribution by regulating crystallization kinetics is crucial for further enhancing the device performance. Various strategies have been explored to control the crystallization of wide-bandgap perovskites with mixed halides, including composition engineering,  10, [21] [22] [23]  ligand engineering,  [24] [25] [26]  Lewis base additives,  27, 28  etc. Among these, organic ligands have shown great promise in improving film quality through multiple interactions with perovskite components.  25, 29, 30  However, many of the reported strategies still rely on bulky organic ligands, which would reduce the intrinsic conductivity and lead to the formation of low-dimensional perovskites (LDPs) with random orientation and varied n values (n = 1, 2, 3,. . .) in perovskite bulk.  31, 32  These LDPs also lead to anisotropic charge transport, large exciton binding energy, and photoinduced carrier blocking, all detrimental to efficient charge transport and extraction.  [33] [34] [35]  Here, we report a novel strategy by incorporating imidazolium (IA), a versatile cation, to alloy with the A-site cation in perovskites.  [36] [37] [38]  Leveraging its unique chemical nature, aromatic framework and ideal ionic radius, the IA-alloyed perovskite exhibited improved conductivity and relaxed lattice strain. The in situ photoluminescence studies reveal that our cationic alloy effectively balanced the crystallization rate between I-and Br-components through electrostatic and coordination interactions. This promotes a homogeneous halide distribution to result in superior film quality. Moreover, the IA cation also plays a pivotal role in passivating multiple types of defects within the perovskite. Consequently, the optimized PSC with an E g of 1.79 eV achieved a PCE of 19.50% with an open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.35 V, presenting a notably low energy loss of 0.44 eV. The device also showed remarkable long-term stability, maintaining 93% of its initial efficiency after maximum power point (MPP) tracking for 500 hours. By integrating these semitransparent PSCs with organic rear subcells, we obtained an impressive efficiency of 25.54% in our monolithic perovskite-organic TSCs (PO-TSCs). 
 Results and discussion The ionic radius of A-site cations plays a critical role in determining the lattice structure of metal halide perovskites.  39, 40  The chemical structures of the widely studied A-site cations are depicted in Fig.  1a . According to the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, t = [R A + R X ]/[O2(R B + R X )] (where R A , R B , and R X are the perovskite constituents' ionic radii), the t values of the APbI 1.8 Br 1.2 perovskites with various monovalent cations, including imidazolium (IA), ethyl ammonium (EA), guanidinium (GA), propyl ammonium (PA), butyl ammonium (BA) and phenylethyl ammonium (PEA), were calculated as shown in Fig.  1b . Cations yielding t value between 0.8-1.0 typically favor the formation of 3D perovskite structures (i.e., Cs, MA, and FA cations). On the other hand, when t approximates 1.0, the single cation alone cannot serve as an A-site in 3D perovskites but rather combines with smaller A-site cations (such as Cs, MA) to generate an alloy structure to stabilize the perovskite structure.  36, 41  However, if t 4 1, it will disrupt 3D PbI 6 octahedra networks, leading to the formation of lowdimensional perovskites (LDPs).  42  Hence, the lattice structure of the APbI 1.8 Br 1.2 perovskites with the above cations is depicted in the inset of Fig.  1b . The commonly studied PEA and BA ligands usually lead to the formation of LDPs, whereas EA, GA and IA can theoretically form alloy structure. To experimentally study the lattice structure, thin film X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted on Cs 0.2 FA 0.8 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 perovskites incorporated with various cations. The XRD patterns confirm that proper alloying of IA and GA (o5 mol%) does not result in LDP phase in the films (Fig.  S1a  and b , ESI †), corroborating the previous studies.  [36] [37] [38] 43  In contrast, the introduction of bulky cations, such as PEA and BA, led to the formation of LDP phases with larger interlayer distances (Fig.  S1c  and d, ESI † ). Further investigation of the lattice structure showed that the primary diffraction peaks at 2y of approximately 141 and 281, corresponding to the (100) and (200) lattice planes, respectively. These peaks remained relatively stable upon the introduction of IA and GA (Fig.  S2a, ESI † ). However, following the introduction of bulky cations shifted these peaks towards lower angles, indicating lattice expansion due to the cation-induced lattice distortion.  31, 44  The influence of cations on residual strain was also examined using the Williamson-Hall equation (Note S1, ESI †), with the detailed XRD patterns and linear fitting presented in Fig.  S2a  and b (ESI † ). The positive slope in the fitted curve signifies tensile strain along the out-of-plane direction.  45, 46  Notably, the film incorporating IA exhibited the smallest microstrain among these cations, indicating that IA-alloyed film effectively releases the residual strain (Fig.  1c ), which is beneficial for stabilizing the perovskite lattice.  45  To evaluate the electrical properties of the perovskites with different lattice structures, the conductivity of the films was measured as shown in Fig.  1d  and S2c  (ESI †). The IA-alloyed (target) perovskite film exhibited an 
 Paper Energy & Environmental Science average conductivity of 4.79 Â 10 À5 S cm À1 , which was higher than that of films incorporating other cations. This finding suggests that the films with decreased conductivity are typically associated with the ''insulating'' bulky cations, which can be attributed to random orientation and poor isotropic charge transport in LDPs.  33  Moreover, the R 2 NH and R 2 NH + groups on IA allow it to engage in diverse interactions with perovskite precursors, such as hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, and coordination.  47 1  H NMR spectroscopy was utilized to confirm these interactions as shown in Fig.  1e . The resonance signal of protonated ammonium in FAI was observed at 8.80 ppm. Upon the addition of IA, it splits into two distinct peaks at 8.96 ppm and 8.63 ppm, suggesting that hydrogen bonding interactions change the chemical environments of FA + .  29, 48  Further exploration of these interactions was conducted using highresolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The binding energies of 3d electrons for I À and Br À are observed to shift toward lower energies due to synergistic interactions between the ligand and the mixed halide octahedra, including ionic and hydrogen bonding (N-HÁ Á ÁI/Br), which indicate the variation in their chemical environment (Fig.  1f  and Fig.  S3b , ESI †).  15  Additionally, the binding energy of Pb 2+ 4f 5/2 and 4f 7/2 shifted from 143.40 and 138.60 eV to 143.11 and 138.27 eV in the Pb 4f spectrum, respectively. This shift can be attributed to the coordination interaction between Pb 2+ and lone pair electrons in IA (Fig.  S3a, ESI † ).  49  To understand the impact of these interactions on the formation of perovskite colloids, dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed, revealing the differences in the aggregate size within the perovskite precursor solutions.  31, 50  As depicted in Fig.  1g , in addition to a primary average aggregate size of approximately 1 nm, the IA induced the formation of larger aggregates, increasing from 100 nm to over 200 nm. Typically, the small aggregates in the precursor lead to the multi-directional growth of perovskite crystals, resulting in films with small grain sizes and large numbers of grain boundaries.  50  In contrast, the larger aggregates in the IA-containing precursor increase nucleation density, therefore, facilitating the growth of larger perovskite crystals. This can be confirmed by the large grain sizes and the enhanced crystallinity from the top-viewing scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image and XRD diffraction pattern of the perovskite thin films (Fig.  S4  and S5a, ESI † ). More in-depth insights into how IA cations regulate perovskite crystallization were gained by monitoring the crystallization process during film formation through in situ photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The preparation of perovskite films usually involves spin-coating followed by annealing, corresponding to nucleation and crystal growth phases, respectively. The evolution of PL intensity and peak position during the spin-coating phase (from 0 to 34 s) is illustrated in Fig.  2a  and c . Once the antisolvent was dripped, the PL peak shifted rapidly to B650 nm, indicating the start of nucleation. Owing to the lower formation energy, the Br-rich nuclei exhibited a preferred tendency to form initially.  15  As a result, the peak position of the control film progressively blueshifted throughout the spin-coating process (Fig.  S6a , ESI †). In contrast, the IA-alloyed film exhibited a comparatively stable PL peak, highlighting the role of IA played in balancing the nucleation rates between I-rich and Br-rich components. The stronger PL intensity observed in the IA-based film further supports a higher nucleation density during the spin-coating process, consistent with our DLS results (Fig.  S6c, ESI † ). During the annealing process, the evolution of the PL peak position in both the control and target films shows similar trends over 50 seconds (Fig.  2a  and c ). This process can be divided into three distinct stages based on the variation in PL intensity and peak position (Fig.  S6b  and d , ESI †): (i) iodide diffusion, (ii) mixed halide phase growth, and (iii) phase segregation under laser stimuli. In the initial stage (0-20 s), the PL peak position of both films gradually redshifts to reach its stable emission peak, implying a photo-active phase transition and iodide diffusion. Compared to the steadily increased PL intensity of IA-alloyed film, the PL intensity of the control film shows an additional fluctuation (B10 s). This variation likely results from the faster growth of the I-rich phase, which has a lower activation energy barrier for perovskite growth and strong emission compared to the Br components.  13  During the second stage (20-50 s), the peak positions of both samples were stabilized, but the PL intensity showed fluctuations from decrease to increase, attributed to the ongoing crystal growth. As the solvent evaporates, perovskite crystallites are exposed to the atmosphere and neighboring crystallites, leading to the formation of grain boundaries and rapid PL quenching. Subsequent annealing promotes a secondary growth process where small crystallites merge into the larger entities through Ostwald ripening, again increasing PL intensity.  51, 52  The target film completes Ostwald ripening more rapidly and exhibits higher PL intensity, suggesting that a faster secondary crystal growth produces larger grains. The final stage is marked by phase segregation, and the respective PL spectra were extracted from in situ PL during the annealing process. As shown in Fig.  2b  and Fig.  S6b (ESI † ), the control sample exhibits a distinct double-peak PL shape, which is indicative of halide segregation. Encouragingly, the target perovskite film maintains a stable PL profile demonstrating suppressed halide segregation in perovskites (Fig.  2d  and Fig.  S6b, ESI † ). PL mapping was conducted to further reveal the halide distributions within the perovskite films. As shown in Fig.  2e  and f , the target film shows a symmetric distribution of the weighted PL peak around 693 nm, illustrating a homogeneous halide distribution. The control sample, however, exhibits a wide distribution ranging from 676 to 741 nm which is ascribed to intrinsic phase segregation due to the unbalanced nucleation/crystallization rate between I/Br components. These findings proved that IA-regulated crystallization homogenized the halide distribution, therefore suppressing the formation of narrow-bandgap I-rich region (serving as the recombination center) and wide-bandgap Br-rich region (with deep defect energy levels).  29, 53  Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide more insights into IA-induced crystallization regulation. The lower binding energy between dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and PbBr 2 elucidates the nucleation preference for Br components in the control film. In contrast, the introduction of IA leads to stronger interaction energy in the DMSO-PbBr 2 /IA intermediate phase (À1.02 eV) compared to that of DMSO-PbI 2 /IA counterpart (À0.89 eV), suggesting a reduced nucleation rate for Br components (stage i) (Fig.  S7, ESI † ). Moreover, the synergetic effect of electrostatic and coordination bonding between IA and lattice can also modulate the halide diffusion rate, thus promoting uniform crystal growth (stage ii). To further investigate the impact of IA on the structure stability, two representative perovskite surfaces with different terminations (FAI-and PbI 2rich) were examined. The IA-alloyed FAI-rich surface exhibited higher binding energy (À4.57 eV), enhancing the stability of the target film (Fig.  3a  and b ). Additionally, the passivation effect of IA on deep defects was further assessed, such as iodine interstitial (I i ) and lead interstitial (Pb i ) defects that typically act as nonradiative recombination sites (Fig.  3c  and Fig.  S8a  and b , ESI †). Notably, the introduction of IA effectively passivated the trap states, relocating them within the valence/conduction bands or near the band edges (Fig.  3c ). The interaction between IA and Pb, as supported by earlier discussed XPS results,  54  further corroborates these findings. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were performed on both IA-alloyed and control perovskite films to investigate the defect passivation effect of IA (Fig.  3d ). The fitted results demonstrate the prolonged carrier lifetimes of 34 ns for t 1 and 667 ns for t 2 in IA-alloyed perovskite film, compared to the control sample (t 1 = 30 ns and t 2 = 192 ns). The substantial extension of t 2 suggests a markedly reduced non-radiative recombination within the bulk phase.  55  Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was further utilized to assess the surface potential distribution of the perovskite films. The target film exhibited a narrower potential distribution, aligning with the more uniform halide distribution observed. Additionally, a B60 mV increase in the target film (Fig.  3e  and Fig.  S9a, b, ESI † ) indicates a Fermi level (E F ) closer to the conductive band edge.  3  The higher work function was confirmed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), demonstrating a 0.08 eV shift in E F (Fig.  S9c  and d, ESI † ) consistent with the KPFM results. The more ''n-type'' characteristic suggests the presence of a significant number of electronfilled traps in the target film, contributing to the mitigation of trap-assisted recombination and more efficient electron extraction at the perovskite/electron-transporting materials interface.  56  To quantify the trap-state densities, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was employed, with the corresponding fitted results depicted in Fig.  S10 (ESI † ). Compared to the control film, the electron trap density of the target film decreased from 1.38 Â 10 16 to 9.67 Â 10 15 cm À3 . Similarly, the hole trap density reduced from 1.82 Â 10 16 to 6.22 Â 10 15 cm À3 (Fig.  3f ). These results suggest that crystallization regulation and defect passivation through the versatile cation alloying can effectively lower trap densities, thus suppressing trap-assisted nonradiative recombination losses.  57  In addition, carrier mobilities in the target perovskite were also enhanced, with electron mobility rising from 2.18 Â 10 À4 to 3.28 Â 10 À4 cm 2 V À1 s À1 and hole mobility from 1.28 Â 10 À4 to 1.98 Â 10 À4 cm 2 V À1 s À1 . The increased charge carrier mobilities in the IA-alloyed film should be beneficial for reducing the space charge accumulation at the interfaces. Motivated by the homogeneous halide distribution and suppressed non-radiative recombination enabled by IA alloying, single-junction wide-bandgap PSCs were fabricated with the device structure of glass/ITO/CbzNaph/perovskite/C 60 /bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag, where ITO is indium tin oxide, and CbzNaph denotes a p-type self-assembled monolayer (SAM). The current densityvoltage ( J-V) characteristics of the devices based on the perovskite without and with IA are provided in Fig.  4a . The devices incorporating IA exhibited a PCE of 19.50%, a significant improvement over 18.64% of the control cells, mainly due to the enhanced V OC from 1.31 V to 1.35 V (Fig.  4a  and Table  1 ). The steady-state efficiency of the target devices is 19.21%, which is consistent with the efficiency obtained from the J-V curve (Fig.  S11, ESI † ). Furthermore, the target devices showed negligible hysteresis and excellent reproducibility with an average PCE of 19.00% (Table  1  and Fig.  S11, ESI † ). The integrated short-circuit current density (J SC ) from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) matched well with the value extracted from the J-V curve. The bandgap of the device was determined to be 1.79 eV by differentiating its EQE spectrum, which exhibited an inflection point at 692 nm (Fig.  4b ). Consequently, the V OC deficit (E g À qV OC ) of the target device was calculated to be 0.44 V, approaching 90% of its S-Q limit, which is among the lowest reported values for PSCs with the similar bandgaps (Fig.  4c  and Table  S1 , ESI †). To pinpoint the sources of V OC losses in the devices, a detailed analysis based on balance theory was conducted. The values of the corresponding losses are presented in Fig.  4d  and Fig.  S12  (ESI †), where the calculations and discussions are provided in Note S4 (ESI †). The results highlighted that the lower DV 3 predominantly contributed to higher photovoltage of the target PSCs, further underscoring the reduced defect density in IAalloyed perovskite.  58  We further validated the applicability of our strategy by fabricating PSCs with bandgaps of 1.68 eV and 1.84 eV. All devices demonstrated enhanced photovoltaic performance, as summarized in Table  S4  and Fig.  S13 (ESI † ). Since sub-gap defects and lattice vibrations would lead to energetic disorder, resulting in Shockley-Read-Hall recombination in perovskites, the band tail states were analyzed by calculating Urbach energy (E u ) from Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy-external quantum efficiency (FTPS-EQE), as shown in Fig.  S14 (ESI † ) and Note S3. A lower E u in the target device suggests enhanced lattice stability, consistent with the suppressed non-radiative recombination losses.  31, 58  The Mott-Schottky analysis, shown in Fig.  4e , corroborates this by revealing a higher built-in potential (V bi ) in the target device, which contributes to the improved V OC . Electroluminescence (EL) imaging was also employed to evaluate the film quality at the device level, as shown in Fig.  4f  and g . Under the same voltage bias of 1.45 V, the target devices exhibited higher brightness compared to that of the control devices, indicating less energy loss through non-radiative recombination.  59, 60  Moreover, the long-term operational stability of the devices was investigated. The target device showed significantly enhanced long-term stability, retaining B93% of its initial PCE after 500 h of operation at maximum power point (MPP) under 1-sun illumination (Fig.  4h ). In contrast, the efficiency of control devices degraded by B20% within 400 h. The emerging organic solar cells (OSCs), with flexible molecular design, near-infrared absorption, non-toxicity, and lowtemperature solution processibility, hold significant promise for integration as narrow-E g sub-cells in perovskite-based TSCs. In addition, the perovskite-organic tandem solar cells (PO-TSCs) are uniquely ideal for innovative applications such as wearable and flexible electronics, as well as semi-transparent photovoltaics for building and vehicle integration.  61  Therefore, we further explored the combination of our efficient and stable WBG PSCs with an organic sub-cell, aiming to develop highperformance monolithic PO-TSCs. In this configuration, the PM6:BTP-eC9:PC 71 BM ternary blend was used as the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer in the narrow-bandgap rear subcell (Note S5, ESI †). The device structure of the PO-TSC is depicted in Fig.  5a , where BCP/Au/MoO x functions as the interconnecting layer (ICL). The optimized thicknesses of the perovskite and organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer were approximately 290 nm and 150 nm, respectively, to ensure effective photon utilization and current matching between the two subcells, as illustrated in Fig.  5b . The tandem solar cell achieved an impressive PCE of 25.54% with a high V OC of 2.15 V, J SC of 14.68 mA cm À2 , and a fill factor of 81.03%. It also showed negligible hysteresis and a stable power output of 25.24% (Fig.  5c, d  and Fig.  S15 , ESI †). The champion tandem cell possessed good current matching, where the J SC of 14.67 mA cm À2 and 14.50 mA cm À2 were integrated from the EQE spectra of the perovskite and organic subcells, respectively (Fig.  5e ). An average PCE of 24.94% was calculated from 15 individual tandem cells in different batches, as depicted in Fig.  S16 (ESI † ). Notably, the efficiency obtained in this study is among the highest values reported for PO-TSCs (Fig.  5f  and Table  S2 , ESI †). We evaluated the stability of the unencapsulated tandem cell under MPP tracking, which retained over 80% of its initial PCE after 200 h, as depicted in Fig.  S17 (ESI † ). Although the PCEs of the state-of-the-art PO-TSCs lag those of other TSCs, primarily due to narrow absorption windows in the NIR region, there is significant potential for continuous improvement. With the advancement of photoactive material design, especially non-fullerene acceptors  Energy & Environmental Science Paper (NFAs), and device engineering (e.g., additive treatment, mixedsolvent strategy, and interfacial engineering), these efforts have the potential to significantly improve the NIR photon utilization and PV performance. Meanwhile, with the deepened understanding of the crystallization process and the energy loss mechanisms in WBG perovskites, it is possible to further minimize the V OC losses. We believe that these advancements could pave the way for flexible, lightweight, and low-cost PO-TSCs to surpass the efficiency of other perovskite-based TSCs and achieve an efficiency over 30%. 
 Conclusion We have developed an effective method to simultaneously improve the photovoltage and long-term operational stability in wide-bandgap PSCs. By alloying IA in perovskite lattice, it can effectively regulate nucleation and crystal growth to homogenize the halide distribution and improve the film quality. Meanwhile, this multi-functional cation can act as both a Lewis base and acid to passivate positive and negative charged defects within the perovskites. As a result, the 1.79 eV single-junction PSC exhibited a remarkable V OC of 1.35 V with substantially enhanced device stability, retaining B93% of its initial PCE after long-term operation for 500 h. Moreover, these semitransparent PSCs were integrated with organic rear subcells to fabricate PO-TSCs, achieving an impressive PCE of 25.54%. This study provides significant insights in employing cation alloying for advancing the development of wide-bandgap PSCs through regulated perovskite crystallization and minimized defects.

To gain deeper insights into the sources of photovoltage loss, we calculated the energy loss (eΔV) of the control and target PSCs according to detailed balance theory, which can be expressed as E g -qVoc = eΔV = (eΔV 1 + eΔV 2 + eΔV 3 ), where ΔV 1 is originated from the black-body radiation and the non-ideal EQE above E g , ΔV 2 is ascribed to the energy loss associated with extra thermal radiation in a cell where EQE of PSC extend into the region below E g , and ΔV 3 results from the non-radiative recombination in the device (Figure  S12 ). The details of the calculation can be found in our previous work.  3  Supplementary note 5: The additional experimental details of organic sub-cells and challenges for the PO-TSCs. In the context of PO-TSCs, the choice of a hole-transport layer for the organic sub-cell is a critical consideration. Thermally evaporated molybdenum oxide (MoO x ) stands out as an excellent option, primarily due to its compatibility with the underlying perovskite sub-cell and its ability to offer favorable electrical and optical properties. In this study, we have determined that a thickness of 10 nm represents the optimal value for MoO x . Deviating from this thickness, either in the direction of thicker or thinner films, results in reduced optical transmittance or compromised electrical properties. Notably, we have also identified that a low evaporation rate, specifically 0.05 Å s -1 , improves the film quality of MoO x , consequently contributing to higher device efficiency. In this work, the weight ratio of PM6:BTP-eC9:PC 71 BM in a ternary blend of 1:1:0.2 yielded superior results. It is worth highlighting that in the case of PNDIT-F3N, its limited solubility in methanol necessitated the addition of 0.5 vol% of acetic acid to aid in its dissolution. Importantly, we stress that the incorporation of acetic acid should be conducted outside of a glovebox during organic solar cell fabrication due to the potential influence of its vapor on device performance.

 Preparation of the perovskite precursor solution To prepare wide-bandgap perovskite precursor (Cs 0.2 FA 0.8 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 ) with a concentration of 1.2 M, CsI (0.144 M), CsBr (0.096 M), FAI (0.576 M), FABr (0.384 M), PbI 2 (0.756 M) and PbBr 2 (0.48 M) were dissolved in 1 ml of mixed DMF/DMSO solvent (vol/vol, 4:1). It should be noted that 3.0 mol% of MAPbCl 3 was added. For the target devices, 2 mol% of the IA was added to the perovskite precursor. The solutions were stirred overnight at room temperature, and no filtration was required before use. 
 Preparation of the solution for the organic BHJ layer To prepare the precursor for the organic active layer (BHJ layer), PM6, BTP-eC9 and PC 71 BM with a weight ratio of 1:1:0.2 were dissolved in CF, and the concentration of PM6 was fixed at 8 mg ml -1 . The solvent additive (0.5 vol%) (DIO) was added to the solution, which was then stirred at 40 °C for 2 h before use. 
 Fabrication of single-junction wide-bandgap PSCs The pre-patterned ITO glass substrates were sequentially cleaned by sonication with detergent (Decon 90/deionized water with 1:1/vol: vol), deionized water, acetone and IPA for 15 min, respectively. The cleaned ITO glass substrates were then transferred into an oven at 100 °C for 24 h and treated with O 2 plasma for 10 min before use. The CbzNaph hole-selective SAM (0.75 mg ml -1 in IPA) was spin-coated onto ITO glass substrates at 3,000 r.p.m. (with a ramping rate of 2,000 r.p.m. s -1 ) for 25 s, and subsequently annealed at 110 °C for 15 min. After cooling, the substrates were rinsed with IPA solvent and annealed for another 5 min at 100 °C. The perovskite film was then deposited on the CbzNaph layer by a one-step spincoating method. Specifically, 50 μl of the perovskite precursor was spin-coated at 500 r.p.m. for 4 s, then 4000-6500 r.p.m. (with a ramping rate of 1,500 r.p.m. s -1 ) for 30 s. During the spin-coating process, 200 μl of CB anti-solvent was quickly dripped onto the centre of the perovskite film 10 s before the end of the process and then annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. Next, PI (0.3 mg ml -1 in IPA) was dynamically spin-coated onto the as-formed perovskite at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. All the above spin-coating processes were conducted in an N 2 -filled glovebox with the contents of O 2 and H 2 O < 5 ppm at a controlled temperature of ∼20 °C. Finally, 20-nm C 60 , 6-nm BCP (or 10-nm SnO 2 ) and 100-nm Ag were thermally evaporated in a high-vacuum chamber (<2 × 10 -6 torr) through a metal shadow mask (aperture area, 0.042 cm 2 ), then 100 nm MgF 2 was thermally evaporated onto the glass side of the devices as an antireflection (AR) layer. 
 Fabrication of single-junction narrow-bandgap organic solar cells (OSCs) OSCs with a p-i-n configuration were based on the device structure of glass/ITO/MoO x /PM6:BTP-eC9:PC 71 BM/PNDIT-F3N/Ag. First, 10 nm MoO x was thermally evaporated (at a rate of 0.05 Å s -1 ) on clean ITO substrates in a high-vacuum chamber (<6 × 10 -7 torr). Then, PM6:BTP-eC9:PC 71 BM solution was dynamically cast onto the MoO x layer at 2,500 r.p.m. for 40 s and followed by thermal annealing at 90 °C for 10 min. After cooling, a PNDIT-F3N (0.5 mg ml -1 in methanol with 0.5 vol% of acetic acid) interfacial layer was dynamically spin-coated onto the organic BHJ layer at 1,500 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, 100-nm Ag was thermally evaporated in a high-vacuum chamber (<2 × 10 -6 torr) through a metal shadow mask. 
 Fabrication of the monolithic PO-TSCs (two-terminal configuration) PO-TSCs described in this study, the narrow-bandgap organic subcells were integrated on top of the perovskite subcells. Briefly, after thermal evaporation of BCP in wide-bandgap subcells, 0.5-nm Au (at a rate of 0.05 Å s -1 ) and 10-nm MoO x were thermally evaporated on top of the BCP, respectively, to form an ICL structure for the tandem cells. The organic BHJ layer and interfacial layer were then sequentially spin-coated on MoO x . PNDIT-F3N was dynamically spin-coated on the organic BHJ layer at 1,500 r.p.m. for 40 s. Finally, 100-nm Ag was thermally evaporated through a metal shadow mask. 
 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations For the molecular calculations, the molecular geometries were optimized using ωB97XD For the periodic crystal calculations, the crystal structures were optimized using the projectoraugmented wave (PAW) method as provided by the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional was used. The van der Waals (vdW) interactions were also included in the calculations using the zero-damping DFT-D3 method of Grimme. A uniform grid of 6×6×6 k-mesh in the Brillouin zone was employed to optimize the crystal structures of cubic-phase FAPbI 3 in bulk, 4×4×1 k-mesh for FAPbI 3 slabs, and 2×2×1 k-mesh for IA-passivated FAPbI 3 . The 3×3 FAPbI 3 supercells, containing four or five octahedral layers, were exposed (100) surfaces with both FAI-rich and PbI 2 -rich terminations, as well as a surface iodine interstitial (I i ). The slab replicas were separated by ∼20 Å of vacuum. The energy cutoffs of the wavefunctions were set at 500 eV for the bulk and 450 eV for the slabs and interfaces. Each crystal structure was optimized until forces on single atoms were less than 0.015 eV/Å. The binding energies between FAPbI 3 and IA were calculated as E IA/FAPbI3 (binding) = E (IA/FAPbI 3 ) -E (IA) -E (FAPbI 3 ) where E (IA/FAPbI 3 ) is the total energy for IA passivated FAPbI 3 ; E (IA) and E (FAPbI 3 ) are the energies of isolated IA molecule and FAPbI 3 supercell, respectively. Characterizations 1 H NMR spectra were measured on Bruker AVANCE III 300-MHz and 400-MHz spectrometers. Solution UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained using an Agilent 8454 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were conducted on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation. Transmittance and absorption spectra were conducted on a UVvis spectrometer (PE Lamda 750). tdPL spectra were collected using a home-built facility, where an excitation laser (450 nm) was introduced to the sample through a fiber, and the PL spectra were detected using a detector connected to an Ocean Optics USB2000 spectrometer. XPS was performed on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB XI + X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. Non-monochromatic He I was used as UV light with an energy of 21.2 eV. The top-viewing morphology of the thin-film samples and cross-sectional profile of the tandem cell were conducted by SEM (QUATTRO S). Powder and thin-film XRD characterizations were conducted on a D2 Phaser instrument with Cu Kα (wavelength of 1.5418 Å) radiation. In situ PL spectra were characterized with home-built equipment. An excitation laser (315 nm) was introduced to the sample through a fibre, and the PL spectra were detected by using a detector connected to an Ocean Optics USB2000. PL mapping was collected using a WITec alpha300 M+ confocal microscope. The excitation laser was a diode-pumped solid-state laser (532 nm, Cobolt Laser).                 functional with 6-31+G(d,p) basis set for H, C, N, O, S atoms and LANL2DZ for Pb and I atoms. All the molecular calculations were performed using the Gaussian09 program (D. 01). The binding energies for DMSO/PbX 2 and DMSO-PbX 2 /IA were calculated as E DMSO/PbX2 (binding) = E (DMSO/PbX 2 ) -E (DMSO) -E (PbX 2 ) E DMSO-PbX2/IA (binding) = E (DMSO-PbX 2 /IA) -E (DMSO-PbX 2 ) -E (IA) where E (DMSO/PbX 2 ) is the total energy of DMSO/PbX 2 , E (DMSO-PbX 2 /IA) is the total energy of DMSO-PbX 2 /IA; E (DSMO), E (PbX 2 ), E (DMSO-PbX 2 ), and E (IA) are the energies of isolated DMSO molecule, PbI 2 cluster, DMSO-PbX 2 cluster, and IA molecule, respectively.
