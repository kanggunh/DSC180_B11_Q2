Title: Interfacial engineering by multifunctional ruthenium complex for CsPbI 2 Br perovskite solar cells with a fill factor over 0.82
The interface is of paramount importance in heterostructures, as it can be considered as a device in accordance with Kroemer's dictum. In perovskite solar cells (PSCs), optimizing the interface between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer is known to be an effective method for enhancing PSC device performance. Herein, a metal ruthenium complex coded as C101 is introduced to the perovskite (CsPbI 2 Br)/hole transport layer (PTAA) interface as a "charge driven motor" to selectively extract holes from CsPbI 2 Br and then transfer them to PTAA, minimizing the voltage loss in PSCs. More significantly, the introduction of C101 layer effectively passivates the surface of CsPbI 2 Br film and reduces the defect density of CsPbI 2 Br film due to the covalent bond between the CsPbI 2 Br and the -C=O group in C101. The photovoltaic performance of CsPbI 2 Br PSCs is enhanced by 23.60% upon the introduction of C101 interfacial layer, with the champion CsPbI 2 Br PSC exhibiting a power conversion efficiency of 14.96% in a reverse scan, a short-circuit current of 15.84 mA•cm -2 , an open-circuit voltage of 1.15 V, and a fill factor of 82.03%. Additionally, the introduction of C101 simultaneously enhances the humidity tolerance of CsPbI 2 Br PSCs.
INTRODUCTION Organic-inorganic hybrid halide perovskite materials have emerged as star hybrid semiconductor materials in a variety of optoelectronic devices, including light-emitting diodes (LEDs), photodetectors, and notably, thin film solar cells  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . In 2009, the initial perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by innovatively utilizing perovskite materials as light sensitizer achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of only ~3.8%  [6] . Significant advancements have been made in PSC performance through optimization of perovskite precursor compositions  [7] [8] [9] , antisolvent technology  [10] , perovskite film deposition processes  [11, 12] , and device architecture  [13] . Currently, the PSCs have achieved a PCE of up to 26.1%  [14] , surpassing all other thin film solar cells and establishing themselves as the leading alternative for the new generation photovoltaic devices  [15, 16] . The common perovskite preparation process, which includes solution-processed fabrication and rapid crystallization, often results in unavoidable defects within the bulk and on the surface of the perovskite material  [17] . To mitigate these defects, passivation materials are frequently employed to decrease the defect density in perovskite films. With an overview of the previous studies in all PSCs, it is not difficult to find that the passivation materials for common organic-inorganic or even inorganic perovskite layers mainly focus on monomers  [18, 19] , polymers  [20, 21] , and inorganic oxides  [22, 23] . These materials are typically integrated into anti-solvents or perovskite precursor solutions, effectively slowing down the perovskite crystal growth process through their strong interactions with the Pb-atom and passivating grain boundary defects. Interface is of such an overwhelming importance in heterostructures that it can be regarded as a device in the spirit of Kroemer's dictum  [24] . However, there is a significant drawback associated with the typical passivation materials used for interfacial engineering: their thickness must be ultra-thin (usually thinner than 10 and even 2 nm) and precisely controlled  [25] . Otherwise, thicker film will cause serious decline of photovoltaic performance for PSC devices due to the difficulties in achieving full coverage on the rough perovskite surface and ineffective charge extraction before recombination at the interface caused by the unmatched energy levels. Therefore, developing an effective defect passivation methodology that enables efficient charge extraction at the interface using only one material remains a challenging task. On the other side, the interactions between the perovskite and passivation materials have primarily focused on the weaker interactions, such as hydrogen bonds  [26, 27] , and van der Waals interactions  [28, 29] . The formation of stronger interactions between the perovskite and passivation materials can further ameliorate the perovskite surface properties particularly by reducing the surface defect density of the perovskite film. The utilization of conjugated molecules bearing Lewis base functional groups with relatively matched energy levels might be one way to achieve the desired results. In this study, we intro-duced a heteroleptic ruthenium polypyridyl complex coded C101, which was previously used as a dye sensitizer with two thiocyanate units including a bidentate bipyridine-based auxiliary ligand with two 5-hexylthiophene absorbing antennaes and a bidentate 4,4'-dicarboxy-2,2'-bipyridine-based ligand (see Fig.  1a )  [30] , to the interface of CsPbI 2 Br/Poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) for reducing the surface defect density of CsPbI 2 Br film. The reason for choosing CsPbI 2 Br as a light active layer of PSCs is mainly due to its stronger stability than organic-inorganic hybrid halide perovskite materials  [31, 32]  and its relatively improved light absorption property or crystal phase stability compared to CsPbBr 3 or CsPbI 3  [33, 34] . According to our previous report  [35] , the carboxyl group or -NCS group in C101 would passivate the surface of CsPbI 2 Br film due to predictable strong interaction between the CsPbI 2 Br film and C101, which would decrease the surface defect density of the perovskite film. In addition, the hydrophobic side of the C101 will enhance the moisture stability of the CsPbI 2 Br PSCs on one hand and improve the film-forming property of PTAA on the other hand. To investigate the interfacial modification effect of C101, we employ pristine CsPbI 2 Br without any additive in the traditional sense as a reference. 
 EXPERIMENTAL SECTION 
 Materials Cesium iodide (CsI, 99.9%), lead iodide (PbI 2 , 99.99%), lead bromide (PbBr 2 , 99.99%), and PTAA were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corporation. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%), dimethyl-formamide (DMF, 99%), tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH, 99%), acetonitrile (ACN, 99.8%) and chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The chemical C101 is synthesized according to the previous report  [30] . 
 Fabrication of the control CsPbI 2 Br film TiO 2 was deposited on a pre-cleaned Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate by hydrolytic TiCl 4 solution at 70°C for a duration of 1 h. The CsPbI 2 Br perovskite film was fabricated according to our previous report  [36] . Briefly, a 1 mL anhydrous DMSO solution of CsI (363.7 mg, 1.4 mmol), PbBr 2 (256.9 mg, 0.7 mmol), and PbI 2 (322.7 mg, 0.7 mmol) were mixed and then continuously heated at 60°C for 1 h. Subsequently, a completely clear CsPbI 2 Br precursor solution was formed. This precursor solution was dropped on the FTO/TiO 2 substrate and then spincoated using chlorobenzene as the anti-solvent. The CsPbI 2 Br film was obtained after annealing at 180°C for 20 min. 
 Fabrication of the C101 passivated CsPbI 2 Br film Ruthenium polypyridyl complex solution was prepared by dissolving 6 mg of C101 in ACN/t-BuOH/CB (ACN:t-BuOH:CB = 1:4:8 in volume) mixed solution. The C101 passivated CsPbI 2 Br film was achieved by spin-coating the ruthenium polypyridyl complex solution onto the pre-formed CsPbI 2 Br film. For the control CsPbI 2 Br film or PSC device, the ruthenium polypyridyl complex solution was omitted from the process. 
 PSC device fabrication PTAA as a hole-transport material was spin-coated onto the C101-based CsPbI 2 Br film or the control CsPbI 2 Br film. Subsequently, an 80-nm thick gold counter electrode was thermally evaporated onto either the FTO/TiO 2 /CsPbI 2 Br/C101/PTAA or the FTO/TiO 2 /CsPbI 2 Br/PTAA substrate. 
 Characterization Field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL SU-8020) was employed to measure the surface morphology of the CsPbI 2 Br film with or without C101. A Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer was utilized to measure the absorption spectra of the annealed CsPbI 2 Br films with or without C101. The transient state and steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were conducted on an Edinburgh Instruments Ltd. FLS980 spectrometer. Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of the annealed CsPbI 2 Br perovskite films with or without C101 was tested using a Bruker EQUINX55 spectrometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CsPbI 2 Br films with or without C101 were performed using a Bruker D8 GADDS diffractometer with the Cu Kα radiation. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the samples were tested using Thermo Scientific ESCALAB Xi+. Under AM 1.5 solar simulation (100 mW•cm -2 , SAN-EI, Enlitech), the current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the CsPbI 2 Br PSCs with or without C101 were achieved on a Keithley Model 2400 digital source meter. The integral current density of the CsPbI 2 Br PSCs with or without C101 were obtained from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra using a QTest Station 500TI monochromator. A Zahner Zennium electrochemical workstation was used to measure the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the CsPbI 2 Br PSCs with or without C101 with a frequency range from 4 × 10 6 to 10 Hz and a 50 mV amplitude under dark condition. 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The schematic diagrams illustrating the band alignment in CsPbI 2 Br PSC with C101 are depicted in Fig.  1b . The valence band maximum (VBM) of CsPbI 2 Br and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of C101 were determined to be -5.62 and -5.27 eV, respectively, via UPS, as shown in Fig.  S1a-c . In combination with the optical gap of the CsPbI 2 Br and C101 film (1.92 and 1.73 eV), displayed in Fig.  S1d, e , the conduction band minimum (CBM) of CsPbI 2 Br and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of C101 were deduced to be -3.70 and -3.54 eV, correspondingly. Notably, the HOMO level of C101 aligns with the VBM of CsPbI 2 Br and the HOMO level of PTAA (about -5.2 eV  [37] ). Owing to this matched energy level, holes generated in the CsPbI 2 Br film can be transferred via C101 to PTAA layer. Herein, C101 functions as a "charge driven motor" to extract the generated holes from the CsPbI 2 Br and transfer these extracted holes to PTAA. Cross-sectional scanning SEM images of CsPbI 2 Br PSCs, both without and with a C101 layer, are presented in Fig.  S2 . As observed in Fig.  S2b , the thickness of the C101 layer is approximately 25 nm. Topographic SEM images of CsPbI 2 Br film, with or without C101 layer, at low or high magnifications are exhibited in Fig.  2 . Insignificant changes in grain size and grain boundary within CsPbI 2 Br film were discerned upon the addition of the subsequent C101 layer. It was observed that the thickness of the PTAA layer markedly increased after treatment with the C101 layer, which was resulted from the enhanced filmforming property of PTAA due to the hydrophobic property of C101. As illustrated in Fig.  S3 , the water contact angles for the control CsPbI 2 Br film, the CsPbI 2 Br film with C101 layer, and the C101 film are 34°, 94°, and 128°, respectively. This indicates that the incorporation of a C101 layer on the CsPbI 2 Br film offers protection against water erosion. To investigate the impact of C101 introduction on the surface of CsPbI 2 Br film, absorption spectra of CsPbI 2 Br film with and without C101 layer were evaluated as displayed in Fig.  3a . The absorption intensity of CsPbI 2 Br film with C101 is significantly increased, indicating that the introduction of C101 enhances light absorption of the eventual CsPbI 2 Br PSCs device due to C101 absorption and improved surface quality of CsPbI 2 Br film. The Urbach energies in CsPbI 2 Br films with and without C101 layer as shown in the inset of Fig.  3a  were then investigated to verify the degree of defect density in CsPbI 2 Br films by fitting the linear exponential part of absorption edges according to the Urbach's rule  [38, 39]  resistance, notwithstanding any surface passivation effects. This should lead to a reduced current density at the same voltage in the linear ohmic region and a larger trap-filled bias voltage (V TFL ) between the linear ohmic region and the following trapfilled region. The first kink points, corresponding to V TFL for devices with or without C101 layer, are 0.44 and 0.65 V, respectively. The trap-state density (n trap ) was then calculated as 1.68 × 10 15 and 2.47 × 10 15 cm -3 for the CsPbI 2 Br films with or without C101 layer according to the equation of n trap = (2ε 0 εV TFL )/(eL 2 )  [43] , where ε 0 and ε represent the vacuum permittivity and the relative dielectric constant of CsPbI 2 Br with a value of 8.6  [44] , respectively; e is the elementary charge with a value of 1.6 × 10 -19 C and L is the thickness of the CsPbI 2 Br film. Surprisingly, the introduction of C101 layer results in a decreased V TFL value and therefore a decreased defect density of the perovskite film, although the defect levels are in the same order of magnitude, which indicates that the introduction of C101 layer undoubtedly ameliorate the CsPbI 2 Br film surface due to the passivation effect of carboxy group in C101. These findings align with the previously mentioned Urbach energy results. The time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of CsPbI 2 Br films with and without C101 as illustrated in Fig.  3d  were further measured and the lifetime results of PL decay curves fitted with a biexponential equation were collected in Table  1 . The CsPbI 2 Br film with C101 passivated layer exhibits a shorter average carrier lifetime (10.32 ns) compared to the control CsPbI 2 Br film without C101 layer (20.20 ns). The initial fast decay process (τ 1 ) can be ascribed to the nonradiative carrier relaxation caused by carrier trapping or carrier transfer, while the subsequent slow decay process (τ 2 ) likely originates from the radiative carrier relaxation. A faster decay rate constant k 1 (k = 1/τ 1 , 0.20 ns -1 ) was observed for the nonradiative carrier relaxation in the CsPbI 2 Br film with C101. Thus, combined with the SCLC results, a lower surface defect density in CsPbI 2 Br film with C101 is achieved. The accelerated PL quenching in the CsPbI 2 Br film with C101 can be attributed to the faster carrier (hole) transfer from CsPbI 2 Br to C101, indicating that C101 acts as a "charge driven motor" at the CsPbI 2 Br/PTAA interface. This effect expedites the hole extraction due to the conjugated system in C101, which will be beneficial to enhance the fill factor (FF) of PSCs device. The two dominant sharp diffraction peaks at 14.6°and 29.6°w ere attributed to the (100) and (200) lattice facets of CsPbI 2 Br  [45]  as shown in Fig.  4a .There is no discernible change in the XRD patterns of CsPbI 2 Br films with and without C101 layer. As illustrated in Fig.  4b , the presence of Ru element in energydispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) result is significant, suggesting that C101 is successfully coated on the CsPbI 2 Br film. This is further confirmed by Fig.  4c  with the generation of the Ru 3d 5/2 transition. The electronic states of Pb 2+ were examined using XPS measurements to detect any interaction between the Pb 2+ in the CsPbI 2 Br film and the carboxyl group in C101. As shown in Fig.  4d , two main peaks in the XPS spectrum of the control CsPbI 2 Br film are located at 138.2 and 143.0 eV, corresponding to Pb 2+ 4f 7/2 and Pb 2+ 4f 5/2 transitions  [46] , respectively. Two weak peaks located at 141.9 and 136.7 eV correspond to Pb atom 4f 7/2 and Pb 4f 5/2 transitions, respectively. Upon the   Br film. These findings clearly demonstrate a strong interaction between the -C=O group rather than -NCS group in C101 and CsPbI 2 Br, which is also agreed with the result of the following FTIR results (see Fig.  S6 ). The stretching vibration of -NCS groups in C101 appears at 2101 cm -1 . It is evident that the same vibration peak position persists after passivating the perovskite, indicating no interaction between -NCS group and CsPbI 2 Br, which can be demonstrated by the above XPS result. The -COOH group especially -C=O have been demonstrated to be an effectively passivation unit in PSCs in our previous study  [35] . The symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching vibrations of the carboxyl or carboxylate group in C101 appear at 1477 and 1609 cm -1 , respectively. After treatment with the C101 layer, the asymmetrical stretching vibrations of carboxylate group at 1609 cm -1 are clearly observed. Another vital and strong characteristic peak at 1723 cm -1 was attributed to the stretching vibrations of the carboxyl group in C101, which was drastically weakened and shifted to 1718 cm -1 upon coating on the CsPbI 2 Br film surface. This suggests a strong interaction ascribed to the covalent bond between the carboxyl group in C101 and CsPbI 2 Br in combination with the XPS results. To gain further insight into the C101 as the interfacial layer for CsPbI 2 Br PSCs, we conducted a photovoltaic performance test. The typical J-V curves of CsPbI 2 Br PSCs with and without C101 layer were measured under AM 1.5G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW•cm -2 , as illustrated in Fig.  5a . The key corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table  2 . A PCE of 12.12% was achieved for the control CsPbI 2 Br PSC without C101 layer in the reverse scan, with a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 14.74 mA•cm -2 , an opencircuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.11 V, and a FF of 73.19%. Under the same conditions, a higher PCE of 14.96% was achieved for the CsPbI 2 Br PSC with C101 layer, with a larger J SC of 15.84 mA•cm -2 , a higher V OC of 1.15 V, and a higher FF of 82.03%. The introduction of C101 interfacial layer greatly enhanced device performance. The substantial enhancement in all J SC , V OC , FF, and PCE were attributed to the higher quality CsPbI 2 Br film produced by C101 introduction, which in turn effectively increased charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination in PSCs. Since the value of FF depends on sweep speed  [47] , we also measur the PSC devices at different sweep rates as shown in Fig.  S7 . The FF values for the PSC device without C101 interfacial layer were 75.80 (100 mV•S -1 ), 74.58 (500 mV•S -1 ), 73.60 (1 V•S -1 ) and 72.72 (4 V•S -1 ), respectively. Correspondingly, the FF values for the PSC device with C101 interfacial layer were 82.73 (100 mV•S -1 ), 81.78 (500 mV•S -1 ), 81.11 (1 V•S -1 ), and 80.93 (4 V•S -1 ), respectively. With increasing scan rates, the FF values decreased for both CsPbI 2 Br PSCs with and without C101 interfacial layers. By contrast, the FF value was significantly increased after the introduction of a C101 layer under the same conditions. The corresponding EQEs of the fabricated CsPbI 2 Br PSCs are shown in Fig.  5b . The integrated J SC values of CsPbI 2 Br PSCs with and without C101 were 15.25 and 14.33 mA•cm -2 , respectively, which were consistent with the above J-V results. Further, the J-V curves under forward scan are investigated as shown in Fig.  S8a , and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table  2 . Hysteresis indexes measured for CsPbI 2 Br PSCs with and without C101 are 1.14% and 7.84%, respectively. The significantly lower hysteresis index for CsPbI 2 Br PSC with C101 interfacial layer is most related to the defect density reduction in CsPbI 2 Br film induced by the C101 passivated effect. The stable J max and PCE output curves of CsPbI 2 Br PSCs with and without C101 interfacial layer at maximum power output point under continuous 1 sun irradiation are shown in Fig.  S8b . The CsPbI 2 Br PSC with C101 layer exhibits a stabilized PCE of 14.59% while the control CsPbI 2 Br PSC shows a lower value of 11.93% in about 300 s. Whether CsPbI 2 Br PSCs with or without C101 layer, almost no decrease was discovered, indicating excellent light stability for CsPbI 2 Br PSCs. To confirm the reproducibility, 20 PSC devices were fabricated and the statistical distributions of the key photovoltaic parameters including V OC , J SC , FF, and PCE were represented in Fig.  S9 . Close distributions of all the key parameters for CsPbI 2 Br PSCs with C101 were displayed compared with the control PSCs, revealing highly reproducible upon the addition of C101. The interfacial charge dynamics in CsPbI 2 Br PSC device especially the charge recombination processes were investigated by using EIS measurements under dark conditions  [48] . The EIS results, as illustrated in Fig.  5c , can be fitted using an equivalent circuit model shown in the inset, where R s represents the series resistance, R rec refers to the recombination resistance, and the C rec in parallel with R rec means the capacitance at the interface. The control CsPbI 2 Br PSC without C101 layer exhibits an R rec value of 239 Ω. However, after the introduction of the C101 layer, a significantly larger R rec value of 968 Ω is obtained. This indicates that the C101 layer effectively suppresses interfacial charge recombination in the CsPbI 2 Br PSC owing to the formation of a large charge recombination barrier induced by the higher LUMO level of C101 than that of CsPbI 2 Br, as shown in Fig.  1b  at CsPbI 2 Br/PTAA interface. This is one of the important reasons for the higher V OC value discussed above for the CsPbI 2 Br PSC with C101 layer. Additionally, R s values for the CsPbI 2 Br PSC with and without C101 layer are 11 and 18 Ω, respectively. The relatively lower R s value for the CsPbI 2 Br PSC with C101 layer is beneficial for achieving a higher FF value, which may be attributed to improved interfacial contact after the introduction of the C101 layer, induced by the conjugated system and efficient charge transfer between organic ligands and Ru in C101. Finally, the humidity stability of the CsPbI 2 Br PSCs with or without C101 layer was conducted for approximately 1 month under 35%-45% humidity atmosphere, as shown in Fig.  5d . The PCE declined to nearly 87% for the control CsPbI 2 Br PSCs without C101 layer and more than 91% of the original photovoltaic performance for the CsPbI 2 Br PSCs with C101 layer after 32 days. The superior photovoltaic performance for the CsPbI 2 Br PSCs with C101 layer after prolonged humidity exposure is attributed to the relatively better CsPbI 2 Br film quality and   Figure 1 1 Figure 1 (a) The molecular structure diagram of C101.

 introduction of the C101 layer, new states of -Pb-O-emerge at 138.6 and 143.4 eV, indicating the formation of new Pb-O interactions in the CsPbI 2 Br films with C101 layer induced by strong interactions between the -C=O groups in C101 and CsPbI 2 Br. Additionally, another potential passivation group in C101 is the -NCS group. Multiple peaks can be observed in the XPS spectrum of C101 at energies of 165.0, 164.0, and 162.0 eV, as shown in Fig. S5. These peaks could be attributed to splitting of the lines in the S 2p transitions. There is virtually no change in these energies after coating on the CsPbI 2 Br film, which indicats that -NCS group in C101 does not passivate the CsPbI 2

 Table 2 2 Device performance parameters of CsPbI 2 Br PSCs with and without C101 layer hydrophobicity resulting from the introduction of the C101 layer, as demonstrated in Fig.S3. The thermal stability results of PSCs with and without C101 layer at 50°C under an N 2 atmosphere are shown in Fig.S10. The control CsPbI 2 Br PSC maintains only about 51% of its initial PCE after 292 h, whereas the CsPbI 2 Br PSC with C101 layer can maintain over 83% of its initial PCE. Therefore, the introduction of C101 interfacial layer also enhances the thermal stability of CsPbI 2 Br PSCs, which may be caused by the decreased surface defect density and thus enhanced CsPbI 2 Br active layer quality upon introducing C101.CONCLUSIONSMultifunctional C101 was introduced as "charge driven motor" at the CsPbI 2 Br/PTAA interface. The introduction of C101 layer can decrease the defect density by deactivating the surface of the CsPbI 2 Br film and accelerate the hole-extraction at the CsPbI 2 Br/PTAA interface. This reduction in defect density and acceleration of hole-extraction, coupled with the decreased series resistance, is advantageous for achieving an ultra-high FF value. Additionally, the introduction of C101 enhances the humidity tolerance of the CsPbI 2 Br PSCs due to its external hydrophobic groups. The CsPbI 2 Br PSC with C101 layer demonstrated the highest PCE of 14.96%, which was 23.60% improved compared to the control device, primarily due to the enhanced J SC , V OC , and FF. The use of a metal complex as an interfacial layer is significantly important for further enhancing photovoltaic performance in broad bandgap perovskite-based solar cells.
