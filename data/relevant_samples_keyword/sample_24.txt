Title: Highly efficient perovskite solar cells by building 2D/3D perovskite heterojuction in situ for interfacial passivation and energy level adjustment
Passivating the interfacial defects and reducing the interfacial non-radiative recombination losses are the keys to improving the photovoltaic performance of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Stacking two dimensional (2D) perovskites on 3D perovskite is a promising method for interfacial treatment that improves the stability and efficiency of PVSCs. Herein, we developed conjugated fluorinated benzimidazolium cation (FBIm + ) which can be inserted between 3D perovskite and holetransporting layer (HTL) to form 2D perovskite in situ. The 2D single crystal structures of (FBIm) 2 PbI 4 and (FBIm) 2 PbBr 4 were achieved and confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD), while few single crystals of 2D perovskite based on imidazolium or benzimidazolium anchors have been reported. The 2D perovskite can passivate the interfacial defects, induce better crystallinity and orientation, conduct lower trap density and extend carrier lifetime. Furthermore, the energy level arrangement can be regulated by changing the counterion from iodide to bromide, which can efficiently improve the hole extraction and device performances. As a consequence, the best efficiency of 23.00% for FBImBr-incorporated devices was achieved, while only 20.72% for the control device. Meanwhile, the PVSCs modified by FBImBr displayed excellent environmental stability due to the constructed hydrophobic 2D perovskite layer which can effectively block moisture permeation. This work develops a new path to design novel conjugated organic passivants to form 2D/3D perovskite structures.
Introduction In recent years, organic-inorganic halide perovskite materials have been widely applied in solar cells, photodetectors, photosensitizer and light-emitting diodes because of their excellent light capture capacity and carrier conductivity  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Owing to the enormous potential of PVSCs, they have attracted keen interest as a new generation of photovoltaic technology  [6] . Currently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PVSCs has been promoted from 3.8% to current certified 25.7%  [7, 8] . Although three dimensional (3D) PVSCs achieved outstanding photoelectric performance, the long-term stability under wet, heat, light and other operating environments is still a major obstacle on the road to commercialization of PVSCs  [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Therefore, a lot of methods have been reported to improve the stabilities and performances of devices, containing component adjustment  [17] , additive engineering  [18, 19] , interface engineering  [20] [21] [22] [23] , and others  [24] [25] [26] . Among these methods, interface engineering was considered as one of the most effective strategies for optimizing the efficiency and stability of PVSCs, because the decomposition of perovskites commonly starts from the interface between perovskites and hole/electron transporting layers (HTL/ETL)  [27, 28] . To passivate defects and regulate surface potentials of perovskites, many studies have been carried out on the interface modification of PVSCs, such as organic/polymeric molecules with functional groups, inorganic compounds, and low dimensional perovskites  [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites were one kind of lowdimensional perovskites which has attracted extensive attention due to its excellent stability and water resistance  [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . In order to combine the desired characteristics of 2D perovskite with the superior photovoltaic properties of 3D perovskite, 2D/3D heterostructures were constructed by interface passivation  [40] . Therefore, 2D/3D PVSCs show several advantages: (1) 2D perovskite can inhibit the penetration of H 2 O and ion migration, thus achieving good longterm stability; (2) 2D perovskite can successfully passivate the surface defects of 3D perovskite; (3) the distinct-different energy level can effectively boost the carrier transport and extraction. In 2015, Yao et al.  [41]  employed a polyethylenimine hydriodide (PEI•HI) at the interface between HTL and 3D lead-halide perovskite layer to construct the 2D perovskite (PEI) 2 PbI 4 in-situ, and obtained improved stability and efficiency of PVSCs. Yang et al.  [42]  used cyclohexylethylammonium iodide as surface passivant for interfacial engineering between the perovskite and HTL to form 2D/3D perovskite with outstanding stability, which decreased the trap-assisted recombination and resistance of the interfaces. Recently, Ke et al.  [43]  inserted a multifunctional semiconducting organic ammonium cationic between 3D perovskite layer and HTL to construct into 2D perovskite. The conjugated cations can improve energy level alignment, directly and efficiently extract hole from perovskite, and reduce the interfacial non-radiative recombination. The PVSCs exhibited an excellent PCE and a long-term operational stability with inhibited ion migration. However, most of the current reports about 2D/3D perovskites are focused on non-conjugated primary ammonium terminated passivants. Imidazolium-based cations such as benzimidazolium could also anchor to the Pb-I frame to allow the formation of 2D perovskites  [44] . Compared to organoammonium cations terminated by -NH 3 + groups, the hydrogen bond between imidazolium cations and metal halide sheets is found to be much more symmetrical, which will result in smaller in-and out-of-plane distortions  [45] . In addition, fluoride display effectively enhanced hydrophobicity of the material, and passivate both anion and cation vacancies presented in halide PVSCs  [46] . Herein, we developed highly conjugated fluorinated benzimidazolium halide as passivants for 2D/3D perovskites and obtained the 2D crystal structures of (FBIm)  
 Single crystal growth and characterization The single crystal was obtained from a solution in HBr and H 3 PO 2 aqueous solution by slow cooling of solution. In detail, FBImBr and PbBr 2 (≥99.99%) (molar ratio of 2:1) were dissolved in a mixed aqueous solution of HBr (48% w/w) and H 3 PO 2 (50% w/w). The obtained clarification solution was kept at 100 °C for 2 h, and then cooled to 60 °C at a rate of 5 °C/30 min and left overnight. After that, the solution was cooled to room temperature at the same rate, yielding thin red plates. Single crystals were then analyzed using a Bruker Quest diffractometer (Germany) with a κ geometry, an I-μ-S microsource X-ray tube (Cu Kα radiation, λ=1.54178 Å), laterally graded multilayer (Goebel) mirror for monochromatization, and a Photon2 CMOS area detector. The instrument is equipped with Oxford Cryosystems low temperature device. The examination and data collection were performed at 150 K. Data were collected, reflections were indexed and processed, and the files were scaled and corrected for absorption using APEX3. The space group was assigned and the structure was solved by direct methods using XPREP within the SHELXTL suite of programs and refined by full matrix least squares against F2 with all reflections using Shelxl2018 with the graphical interface Shelxle. 
 Solutions preparation The SnO 2 solution was obtained by diluting 500 μL of the SnO 2 colloid dispersion by three times with deionized water. . The spiro-OMe-TAD precursor solution containing 28.8 μL of tBP and 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI (520 mg in 1 mL of acetonitrile) was added to a CB solution (1 mL) of spiro-OMeTAD (72.3 mg). 
 Device fabrication ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath containing acetone, deionized (DI) water, and isopropanol for 30 min in each step and then dried with a nitrogen (N 2 ) stream followed by air plasma treatment for 3 min. SnO 2 precursor was prepared by mixing the SnO 2 colloidal solution with DI water by a ratio of 1:3. The electron transport layer SnO 2 solution was spin-coated on ITO glass at 3,000 r min -1 for 30 s in air, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 30 min. Perovskite precursor solution were spin-coated on the substrate with two processes of 1,000 r min -1 for 10 s and 5,000 r min -1 for 30 s in the N 2 flowing glovebox. At 10 s before the end of the last spincoating step, 150 μL chlorobenzene solvent was added dropwise onto the substrate. The substrates were then placed onto a hotplate at 150 °C for 10 min and cooled to room temperature. Subsequently, FBImBr or FBImI solutions with different concentrations were respectively spin-coated on the perovskite layer with 3,000 r min -1 for 30 s, heated at 100 °C for 2 min and cooled to room temperature. HTM solution was deposited on top of the perovskite by spin-coating at 3,000 r min -1 for 30 s. After the deposition of spiro-OMe-TAD layer, 10 nm MoO x , then 100 nm Ag was thermally evaporated successively on the top. 
 Characterization The illuminated current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics were characterized using Keithley 2400. The currents were measured under 100 mW cm -2 simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation (Abet Solar Simulator Sun2000). Simulator irradiance was characterized using a calibrated spectrometer and illumination intensity was set using a certified silicon diode. EQE curves were detected on a Stanford Research Systems SR810 lock-in amplifier. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was conducted on SU8020 scanning electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 8 kV. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were measured by Multi-Mode 8-HR (Bruker, Germany). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed with a Rigaku D/Max-B Xray diffractometer with Bragg-Brentano parafocusing geometry, a diffracted beam monochromator, and a conventional cobalt target X-ray tube set to 40 kV and 30 mA. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra were recorded on a SHI-MADZU, UV-2600 spectrophotometer. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured by photoluminescence spectroscopy (FLS920, Edinburgh Instruments Ltd., UK). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured by an FLS920 spectrometer (Edinburgh instruments). The perovskite films were deposited on non-conductive glasses. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were measured with a Bruker VERTEX 70 V. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopic (UPS) were measured by Thermo ESCALAB 250XI using perovskite films spincoated on the glass/ITO/SnO 2 substrates. 
 Computational details The DFT calculations were performed using the SIESTA software with local NAO basis sets, and the interactions between electrons and nuclei are represented by pseudopotentials (PP)  [47] . Scalar-relativistic Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials with nonlinear core corrections were gen-erated using the ATOM program  [48] . The pseudopotentials of PBE exchange-correlation were generated with the following electronic configurations: 6s 2 6p 2 5d 10 5f 0 for Pb, 4s 2 4p 5 4d 0 4f 0 for Br, 5s 2 5p 5 5d 0 4f 0 for I, 2s 2 2p 3 3d 0 4f 0 for N, 1s 1 2p 0 3d 0 4f 0 for H, 2s 2 2p 5 3d 0 4f 0 for F, and 2s 2 2p 2 3d 0 4f 0 for C  [49] . Pseudopotential transferability was tested and optimized by comparing pseudopotential and all-electron calculations such that excited state intrinsic energies differ within 10 mRy. Double-ζ plus polarization (DZP) basis sets were used and optimized in a bulk or dimer setup (such as FAPbI 3 or I 2 ) with basis pressure equal to 0.2 GPa  [50] . The experiment lattice parameters of cubic FAPbI 3 (a=6.362 Å) were adopted  [51] . For consistency, the DZP basis sets were optimized with the crystal structure fully relaxed using Quantum Espresso with PBE pseudopotentials of the SSSP library (version 1.1)  [52] [53] [54] . The SSSP pseudopotentials have been well tested from various sources and provide to date the best agreement with all-electron calculations. The mesh size of the grid is controlled by an energy cutoff, which was 300 Ry here. The 5×5×1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point meshes were used for slab systems under consideration. 
 Results and discussion The molecular structures and the synthetic routes of passivants (FBImBr and FBImI) are shown in Figure  1a  and Scheme S1 (Supporting Information online). The 2D single crystal structures of (FBIm) 2 PbI 4 and (FBIm) 2 PbBr 4 were obtained easily by cooling down method, while there are few reports about single crystals of 2D perovskite based on imidazolium/benzimidazolium anchoring groups  [45, [55] [56] [57] . The crystal structures were measured by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the edge-on views of the realspace structures are shown in Figure  1b, c    1d ). According to the (100) reflection peaks, the layer spaces of the 2D perovskite phases of (FBIm) 2 -PbBr 4 and (FBIm) 2 PbI 4 are calculated by Bragg's Law to be 15.77 and 15.23 Å, respectively, which is largely consistent with their single crystal data. In order to find the optimal concentration of passivants, FBImBr or FBImI solutions in chlorobenzene (CB) and isopropanol (IPA) (CB/IPA =19/1, v/v) with different mass concentrations (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg mL -1 ) were spincoated on the surface of control 3D perovskite layer (Cs 0.05 -FA 0.85 MA 0.10 PbI 3 ). The complete production process is shown in Figure  S3 . As displayed in Tables S2-S4, the PCE of PVSCs shows an increasing trend as the mass concentration of passivants increased from 0.05 to 0.1 mg mL -1 , while further increasing the concentration to 0.2 mg mL -1 results in a PCE decrease. Hence, we set the concentration of all the passivants at 0.1 mg mL -1 for further studies. Figure  2a -c demonstrated the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of perovskite films with or without passivants. The control film surface is compact and the size of grains are ~420 nm. The surface morphology of the perovskite films passivated by FBImBr or FBImI was slightly different from the control perovskite film, since the grain boundaries of 3D perovskite were partly covered by 2D perovskite. Because of the strong interaction between the imidazolium cation and PbI 2  [57] , FBImBr and FBImI can be adhered to the surface and grain boundaries of 3D perovskite film. Moreover, the perovskite films passivated by FBImBr and FBImI exhibit an average grain size larger than 570 nm, which was confirmed by the cross-section SEM images (Figure  S4 ). These results demonstrate that passivants of FBImBr and FBImI can induce the crystal growth of 3D perovskite and enhance its crystallinity  [58] . As seen from atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, the pristine 3D perovskite film displays a root mean square roughness (r.m.s) of 28.7 nm, while the FBImBr-and FBImI-passivated films exhibit a much smoother surface with a r.m.s of 21.9 and 22.0 nm, respectively, because 2D perovskite was formed on the top of 3D perovskite (Figure  S4 ). To determine the formation of passivation layer, the water contact angles of original film and FBImBr-or FBImI-treated films were investigated. The contact angles are 68°and 65°for the passivated films of FBImBr and FBImI, respectively, while the angle is 40°for pristine film (Figure  2d-f ). This result confirms that FBImBr and FBImI passivants can pack on the 3D perovskite surface, and then largely improve the hydrophobicity, which makes the perovskite to be more stable at humid environment. Furthermore, PVSCs with a planar n-i-p configuration were fabricated to study the effect of additional 2D perovskite layer on the photovoltaic performance (Figure  3a ). Figure  S5  presents the device performances of PVSCs with different passivants (FBImBr and FBImI) as the weight ratio increased from 0.05 to 0.2 mg mL -1 . The optimal weight ratio of all passivants spin-coated on the perovskite layer is determined to be 0.1 mg mL -1 as shown in Figure  S5 . The current density-voltage (J-V) curves of these champion PVSCs with or without passivants were presented in Figure  3b . The control device exhibited the PCE of 20.72%, while the FBImBr-and FBImI-based devices acquired relatively superior photovoltaic performances with a PCE of 23.00% and 21.57%, respectively. The improvements of PCEs for the passivated PVSCs are primarily due to the higher FF and V OC , which increased from 75.50% and 1.13 V for control device to 81.80% and 1.17 V for FBImBr-based device, and 78.60% and 1.14 V for FBImI-based device because of the strong passivation of FBImBr and FBImI. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the control and passivated PVSCs were measured to investigate the photon energy response (Figure  3c ). Compared with the control device, FBImBr-and FBImI-based devices exhibited relatively higher EQE. Furthermore, the calculated integrated J SC are in accordance with the J-V measurement values  [59, 60] . The photovoltaic parameters of 20 devices were measured and summarized in Figure  3d  and Figure  S6  to verify the reproducibility of PVSCs. Compared with the control device, FBImBr-and FBImI-based perovskite device displayed reduced deviation and increased median value in PCEs with more excellent reproducibility, revealing that the 2D perovskite layer deposited on 3D perovskites plays a critical role in device performance and reproducibility. This further confirms that the improvement on the PCE of FBImBr-and FBImI-based devices may be ascribed to the enhanced charge carrier lifetime, easy hole extraction and transport, reduced trap-assisted density and non-radiative recombination, which will be discussed below. To further investigate the continuous output of PVSCs, the stabilized maximum power point (MPP) power outputs are shown in Figure  3e . By maintaining the voltage at MPP for 5 min under AM 1.5 illumination, the stabilized PCE of FBImBr, FBImI and control perovskite devices are 22.8%, 21.3% and 20.1%, respectively. We also evaluated the environmental stability of the unencapsulated control and passivated PVSCs by storing the related PVSCs under a condition of 25% relative humidity at 25 °C (Figure  3f  and Figure  S6 ). Consequently, FBImBr-and FBImI-based 2D/3D perovskite devices retained 86% and 84% of the initial PCE after 1,300 h, while the control device maintained only 48% of the original PCE. The better stability of 2D/3D perovskite devices could be attributed to the FBImBr-and FBImI-based 2D perovskite  layer covering the 3D perovskite surface, which was demonstrated to be better hydrophobicity in the water contact angle measurements. The XRD patterns of the perovskite films with or without passivants are presented in Figure  4a . All perovskite films displayed the strong diffraction peaks at 13. ) of FBImBr and FBImI solution was spin-coated on the 3D perovskite surface, 2D perovskite characteristic peaks appeared at low angle region, which confirmed that the 2D perovskite layer was formed (Figure  S7a ). Furthermore, the formation of 2D perovskite layer can also be observed by dipping the pristine perovskite film into FBImBr or FBImI solution for about 6 min. At the same time, the PbI 2 characteristic peak disappeared (Figure  S7b ). All the results implied that the 2D perovskite was constructed on 3D perovskite surface. In order to further verify the interaction between the passivants and PbI 2 , 1 H NMR and 19 F NMR spectral measurements were carried out (Figure  4b-e ). In contrast with FBImBr and FBImI, the proton signals of the N=CH-N group in the blend of FBImBr +PbI 2 or FBImI+PbI 2 were shifted from 9.57 to 9.27 ppm and from 9.49 to 9.34 ppm, respectively. Moreover, the F signals moved from -138.28 ppm and -138.58 ppm (for FBImBr and FBImI) to -138.67 ppm and -138.56 ppm (for FBImBr+PbI 2 or FBImI+PbI 2 ). Furthermore, the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were also measured. In Figure  S8 , the characteristic peaks of C=N and C-F groups moved from 1,628.470 and 1,173.321 cm -1 for FBImBr to 1,612.164 and 1,157.015 cm -1 for the blend of FBImBr +PbI 2 , and from 1,634.080 and 1,174.378 cm -1 for FBImI to 1,625.870 and 1,158.644 cm -1 for the blend of FBImI+PbI 2  [61, 62] . All the results further proved the interaction between FBImBr or FBImI and PbI 2 . Figure  4f -g and Figure  S9  show the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) patterns of the perovskite films with or without passivants. There are two distinct peaks at the binding energies of 138.36 and 143.20 eV corresponding to Pb 4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 , respectively, for control 3D perovskite surface. In contrast with the control perovskite film, the FBImBr-and FBImI-based 2D/3D perovskite films exhibited slightly lower binding energies (138.21 and 143.07 eV for FBImBr, and 138.27 and 143.14 eV for FBImI). The down-shifted peaks indicate that the ionic bonds between organic ligands and Pb 2+ caused different chemical states  [63] . Specially, similar behaviors were observed in I 3d XPS spectra. The shift of I 3d binding energy could be attributed to the NH•••I hydrogen interaction, which would further affect the Pb-I bond length and shift the binding energy of Pb 4f. Furthermore, there was a weak F 1s peak for FBImBr-and FBImI-based perovskite film in XPS spectra (Figure  S9 ), which further proves the presence of FBImBr and FBImI passivation layer. These results are in accordance with the XRD results, and confirm that FBImBr and FBImI have been inserted in the perovskite lattice and constructed 2D/3D perovskites. Figure  5a  shows the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra and optical bandgap calculated from a Tauc plot of the perovskite films with or without passivants. All the perovskite films displayed almost the same absorption spectra, which means that the trace amount of 2D perovskites deposited on 3D perovskite surface exhibited a negligible influence on the absorption. Moreover, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was measured to calculate the valence band maximum (VBM) of the perovskite films (Figure  S10  and Table  S5 ). Based on the measurements of UPS and absorption, the energy level diagram of whole PVSCs containing perovskites with or without treatment is shown in Figure  5b . There are a large VBM offset of 0.12 eV between control 3D perovskite and FBImBr-based 2D/3D perovskite, while the offset is 0.09 eV between control perovskite and FBImI-based perovskite. Hence, the 2D/3D perovskite based on FBImBr was easier to extract holes from the 3D perovskites and more efficient to accelerate the transport of holes than that of FBImI  [64, 65] . The charge recombination dynamics of control and passivated perovskite films were investigated by the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) (Figure  5c ) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra (Figure  5d ). FBImBrand FBImI-based 2D/3D perovskite films exhibited PL peaks at about 793 and 792 nm, respectively. Compared to the control film (795 nm), the PL peaks of perovskite films passivated by FBImBr and FBImI blue-shifted slightly, owing to the interaction between the passivants and cornersharing [PbI 6 ] 4-layers. Moreover, the PL intensities of FBImBr-and FBImI-based perovskites are over 2 times higher than that of control perovskite, indicating the excellent morphology of films and decreased non-radiative recombination loss benefiting from the defect passivation of FBImBr and FBImI. The PL decay curves were fitted using the following empirical biexponential dependent equation (Figure  5d )  [66] : y A t A t y = exp + exp + (1) 1 1 2 2 0 where A 1 and A 2 are the relative amplitudes, and τ 1 and τ 2 are the best-fit PL decay times for the fast and slow recombination  [67, 68] . The average lifetimes (τ avg ) for the nonradiative recombination processes were calculated from the following equation  [69] :    A = (2) i i i i avg 2 These data are summarized in Table  S6 . The τ avg for the perovskite films based on FBImBr and FBImI are 290.41 and 275.11 ns, respectively, much longer than that for the control film of 208.85 ns. The longer carrier lifetimes of 2D/3D perovskites demonstrate that FBImBr and FBImI can efficiently passivate the defect state and inhibit the non-radiative recombination in perovskite, in good agreement with the lower trap density of 2D/3D perovskite as discussed below  [70] . To reveal the changes of the 2D/3D perovskites interfacial characteristics, a comparative density functional theory (DFT) study was carried out on pristine FAPbI 3 and FBImBror FBImI-modified perovskite films (Figure  6  and Figure  S11 ). Usually, the FAPbI 3 surface is principally terminated by FAI due to its lowest surface energy (Figure  6a )  [71] . FAI surface defects (Figure  6b ) may be formed due to their relative low formation energy, and should be avoided as FAI defects leads to the formation of electron-trapping states (blue solid line in Figure  6e ). The deep trapping states are not propitious to electron transfer from 2D to 3D perovskite. According to the simulated electrostatic potential surface (EPS) of the FBIm cation in Figure  6f , the NH group site of the FBIm cation, which has a small EPS value, can form a strong interaction with the iodide ions on the perovskite surface, thereby passivating the FAI defects on FAPbI 3 surface. So the formation of FBImI-based 2D/3D perovskite interface can eliminate the electron-trapping states of FAI defects (green solid line in Figure  6e ). Furthermore, the FBImBr-based 2D/3D perovskite interface can not only eliminate the FAI-defect trapping states but also lift the VBM level of the perovskite (pink solid line in Figure  6e ), facilitating extraction of holes from 3D to 2D perovskite, then to the HTL, which is consistent with the UPS measurement. Besides, FBImBr can affect the distribution of LUMO orbitals and reduce the recombination probability of photogenerated carriers (Figure  S11 ), which may be an important factor to improve cell efficiency. As shown in Figure  7a , the 2D/3D perovskite devices based on FBImBr and FBImI displayed lower dark J relative to the control device, which suggests that 2D/3D perovskite active layers represent lower bulk defects and trap density. The low dark J also showed a significant reduction in charge recombination and a great increase in charge extraction  [72] . The dark current-voltage (I-V) curves with an electron-only configuration are exhibited in Figure  7b . According to the equation N t =2ε 0 ε r V TFL /qL , respectively, suggesting the trap-assisted recombination was restrained because of the enhanced crystallinity and impeded ions migration in these 2D/3D  perovskites  [70, 75, 76] . The illumination intensity dependent J-V curves were carried out to reveal the charge carrier recombination losses of perovskite interface (Figure  7c ). There is a linear relationship between V OC and light intensity, and the fitted slopes are 1.96kT/q, 1.99kT/q and 2.13kT/q for FBImBr, FBImI and control PVSCs, respectively, indicates that these devices exist trap-assisted recombination. Compared to the control and FBImI-based devices, the FBImBrbased device displayed a smaller slope. The results verified that the treatment of FBImBr on the top of 3D perovskite is more efficient to suppress the trap-assisted charge recombination, which is in line with the lower trap density. 
 Conclusions In conclusion, we developed a novel passivant with 5,6-difluorobenzimidazolium halide for 2D/3D hybrid perovskites and easily achieved the 2D phase crystal structures with n=1 by cooling down method. The created 2D perovskite on 3D perovskite could induce crystallinity and orientation, reduce trap density, increase carrier lifetime and suppress charge carrier non-radiative recombination loss. Changing the halide counterion of the 5,6-difluorobenzimidazolium cation in 2D perovskite can result in the different energetic alignment at 2D/3D perovskite interface, and then affect the charge density distribution, interfacial recombination, and device performance. As a result, the FBImBr-modified devices displayed a significantly enhanced FF of 81.80% and champion efficiency of 23.00%. Furthermore, 2D/3D PVSCs displayed largely improved device stability. The unencapsulated devices based on FBImBr sustained 86% of their initial PCEs for 1,300 h under 25% relative humidity at 25 °C, while only ∼48% maintained for control device. These results demonstrate that FBIm + ligand could be a class of prominent candidates as passivants for highly efficient 2D/3D PVSCs. Figure 1 1 Figure 1 (a) Chemical structures of FBImBr and FBImI.

No 2D XRD peaks appeared at low angle region after FBImBr and FBImI modification, because of the low concentration of passivants absorbed on the 3D perovskite film. However, relative to the control 3D perovskite film, the 2D/3D perovskite films exhibited obvious decline of the PbI 2 characteristic peak at around 12.7°, which indicates that FBImBr and FBImI reacted with the remaining PbI 2 in perovskite. As high concentration (10 mg mL -1

All the synthetic monomers can be commercially obtained easily, and all the materials were used as received without any purification. ovskite active layer shift close to that of hole-transporting materials. The improved energy level arrangement can expedite hole extract and transfer at the interface between perovskite and HTL, which can efficiently decrease the interfacial non-radiative recombination losses and then improve the cell performances. Consequently, the PVSCs with 2D/3D heterojuction engineering obtained the best PCE of 23.00% with a high open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.17 V and fill factor (FF) of 81.80%. Moreover, FBImBrand FBImI-modified devices exhibit excellent operational stability, which maintain 86% and 84% of initial performance after aging test under 25% relative humidity at 25 °C for 1,300 h, while only ∼48% remained for control PVSCs. 
 . Analyzing from the single crystal structures, the Pb-based FBImBr and FBImI crystals are able to form into 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskite structure. Both (FBIm) 2 PbBr 4 and (FBIm) 2 -PbI 4 crystal structures consist of a corner-sharing [PbBr 6 ] PbBr 4 is slightly smaller than that in (FBIm) 2 PbI 4 crystal structure, which may be in favor of the charge carrier transporting as they are used as passivating layer in PVSCs. We further studied and characterized the crystal texture of these 2D perovskite films by powder XRD (Figure octahedra and the perovskite cavity formed by the adjacent [PbBr 6 ] 4-octahedra in (FBIm) 2 4- or [PbI 6 ] 4-octahedra layer and two head to tail organic ca- tions layers. They belong to the monoclinic crystal system of C2/c space group, with the lattice parameters of a= 36.8447(19) Å, b=5.9009(3) Å, c=23.5986(10) Å, β= 124.869(2)°for (FBIm) 2 PbBr 4 , and a=31.6278(14) Å, b= 6.2745(3) Å, c=12.5649(5) Å, β=108.677(4)°for (FBIm) 2 - PbI 4 . Meanwhile, the resulting 2D perovskites (FBIm) 2 PbBr 4 4- exhibit the Pb-Br bond lengths around 3.0 Å and (FBIm) 2 -PbI 4 exhibit the Pb-I bond lengths around 3.2 Å. The Br-Pb-Br bond angles are 96.5°and 83.7°for (FBIm) 2 PbBr 4 and I-Pb-I bond angles are 95.6°and 84.4°for (FBIm) 2 PbI 4 (Figures S1, S2 and Table S1, Supporting Information online).
