Title: Solar Cells Based on Pb-Free and Perovskite-Inspired Materials: Futuristic of Perovskite Solar Cells
The breakthrough in 2012 showed how nextgeneration solar cells lead to perovskite-based materials and devices. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved power conversion efficiency (PCE) ∼26.1% on rigid and ∼25.09% on flexible substrates. The long lifetime of ∼8760 h is reported for PSCs using Pb-based perovskites as an absorber. However, the question of Pb toxicity in PSCs is still a major issue in the commercialization path. The Pb toxicity and poor stability of Pbrelated materials hinder their industrial applications. The various efforts from the past decade resulted in the development of tin halide perovskites, defect-structured perovskites, double perovskites, and perovskite-inspired materials such as rudorffites. However, the PCE of these newly developed materials falls short of that of the corresponding Pb-halide-based perovskites. Hence, herein, a review of the present status of Pb-free perovskite materials and related solar cell devices will be discussed. Further, the review will summarize the recent developments in perovskite materials free from lead and useful for solar cells. The Sn-, Ge-, Sb-, and Bi-based perovskite materials and their combinations and double perovskites would be explored for their futuristic use in solar cells. In summary, the latest progress, outstanding challenges, and future directions of Pb-free halide perovskites, thin films, and nanocrystals will also be reviewed. The review will focus on Pb-free materials and optical and optoelectronic properties to give directions to the researchers of today and tomorrow who are working in the field and may join the field shortly.
INTRODUCTION Sustainable human development and preserving our planet need green energy for per day rising global energy demands and the existential challenge created by climate change.  1  Solar energy is one of the renewable energy sources which may fulfill the shortage of fossil fuels.  2  Presently, the photovoltaic market is dominated by crystalline silicon-based technology.  3  In terms of efficiency, silicon solar cells are at saturation level as these are approaching the limiting value of ∼33.5%.  4  The efficiency limit coupled with high energy needs and to get rid of CO 2 emissions have driven innovations in this field, resulting in different kinds of device processing and architectures. The overall field of perovskite solar cells started barely some ∼15 years ago, with an impressive improvement of efficiency comparable to single crystalline silicon devices. However, still, the halide-based devices still need to show comparable efficiencies on larger area devices and modules.  5  Despite their significant progress, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) lagged behind silicon and other established technologies in terms of their stability.  6  Moreover, apart from the remarkable progress in single-junction perovskite solar cells, the most favored is the tandem technologies  7  except semitransparent devices  8  integrable to buildings, etc. Colloidal crystals and thin films of halide perovskites have revolutionized the field of light-emitting diodes (LED), solar cells, lasers, and photodetectors as well as detectors for radiation.  9  Researchers of various disciplines are attracted to the field of halide perovskites due to their wonderful optical/ optoelectronic properties. Perovskite materials have been known to mankind since the 19th century. However, the researchers started reinvestigating these materials after the demonstration of their photoactive properties in 2009 in solar cells  10  and light emissions in 2014.  11  Further, the exploitation of these materials is ignited by their performance in solar cells creating major exploitation in terms of their chemistry and optical as well as optoelectronic properties. The innovators working on solar cells, LED, lasers,  12  and X-ray detectors  13  have been attracted to these materials due to the typical properties such as solution processability, high absorption coefficient, tunable band gap, tolerance toward defect, and longer carrier lifetime.  14  The lead halide perovskite-based materials have shown wonderful performance in terms of device efficiency which is approaching ∼26% for single junction devices, and ∼33.9% for silicon-perovskite combinations, competing with the silicon ones.  15  However, the instability and lead toxicity  16  are preventing it from reaching commercial maturity  17  for establishing it as an alternative to silicon-based photovoltaic technology. Hence, the researcher started looking for alternative materials that are very close to the properties of the perovskites but lead-free.  18  The prominent class of materials may be absorbers such as tin, germanium, their derivatives, antimony, and bismuth-based or double perovskites.  19  Researchers have had success in developing various kinds of materials reporting the single junction power conversion efficiency (PCE) ∼ 13.2%.  [20] [21] [22] [23] [24]  The review will provide a timely fresh look at the present status and futuristic approaches for the fast-growing field  25  of lead-free  26  perovskite materials and solar cell devices for their technological use.  27  The review will also discuss the present materials developed  28, 29  and their status of efficiency and stability  30  as well as the general approach  31  for enabling the challenges faced by Pbfree perovskite materials  32  and their respective devices.  [33] [34] [35]  Ultimately, the review will also look into the issue of beyond single junction solar harvesting, and the exploitation of the various opportunities such as tandem  [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41]  photovoltaic, indoor photovoltaic,  42, 43  and building integrated  44  as well as transparent  45  photovoltaic may energize further observation of perovskite materials free from lead for their high photovoltaic performance for the realization of their full photovoltaic potential shortly. This review article will discuss state-of-the-art lead-free perovskite-based photovoltaics concentrating on innovative directions and new strategies leading to further exploration and understanding of efficiency and stability improvements. Moreover, the data on the fundamental properties of Pb-free perovskites such as charge carrier mobility, defect parameters, Urbach energy, or impact of dimensionality will be discussed. The lower knowledge of the fundamental properties of Pb-free perovskite materials is further hampering the progress of device fabrication. This review puts to the fore photovoltaic opportunities for largely unexplored absorbers related to lead-free, which may go beyond single junction outdoor photovoltaic. The exploitation of tandem, indoor, buildingintegrated, and transparent photovoltaics is like an energy capsule for the investigation of Pb-free perovskites beyond the current pattern and toward higher photovoltaic performance. The key outstanding questions regarding absorbers, their charge transport, defect properties, and dimensionality effect will also be discussed in detail. Further, the review will focus in detail on the issues beyond a single junction for the realization of Pb-free perovskite materials' potential for photovoltaic application. Thus, the review readers will see a state-of-the-art current stage of lead-free perovskite solar cell technology and the direction of future research and development. 
 MATERIALS The rising energy demand has accelerated research in the area of energy conversion technologies.  46, 47  The whole globe works in the area of Pb-based perovskite materials  48  and related devices. The Pb-based perovskite materials have better optoelectronic properties due to their favorable optical and electrical properties. A suitable band structure, tunable band gap, and large carrier diffusion length with ultimate charge carrier transfer kinetics are needed for materials to perform as good materials for the conversion of solar energy. The band gap of materials plays a crucial role in the absorption of incident photons on the materials. The incident photon contributes to the generation of electrons and holes only when the energy of the photon is more than the band gap of the materials. The E g of materials in the range of ∼1.1 to ∼1.4 eV is needed for solar cell fabrication. The ionic radius and charge neutrality conditions need to be taken into account for synthesizing a stable perovskite. The factors such as the octahedral factor (O.F.)  49  defined by R B /R x must be between 0.44 and 0.90.  48  Further, the tolerance factor (T.F.) defined by R A + R X /√2[R B + R x ] must be between ∼0.813 and ∼1.107. Ideally, T.F. should be unity and deviation from unity is an indication of unstable structures. The Pb electronic structure  50  plays the main role in obtaining the high value of PCE in Pb-related perovskite materials. Lead lies in group 14 and period 4. Hence, the suitable ions to replace lead may be chosen from group 14 or a neighboring group such as 15. Further, the abundance of materials and cost should also be considered. Eco-friendly and less toxic metals can also be taken into consideration for replacing lead. Such efforts have led to the development of various materials. The Pb 2+ and Sn 2+ have similar electronic configurations, 51 with ionic radii of Sn 2+ ∼ 1.18Å and Pb 2+ ∼ 1.19 Å. The charge balance and coordination can also be satisfied. In the ABX 3 structure, A ∼ MA + , Cs + , FA + and X ∼ Cl, Br -, I -; B is Pb 2+ which can be replaced by Sn 2+ , resulting in various compounds such as MASnI 3 , CsSnI 3 , and FASnI 3 (Figure  1 ) having different device performances. The band gap of Sn-based materials is between ∼0.75 and ∼1.30 eV, making these materials suitable for solar cell applications. The CH 3 NH 3 SnI 3 film-based solar cells  52  have shown a performance of PCE ∼ 6.4% Further, there are various reports on the device fabrication and performance of various Sn-based perovskites and their derivatives. MASnI 3 has a band gap of ∼1.3 eV and is useful for single-junction solar cell fabrication. Further, the tuning of the perovskite band gap can be done by replacing iodine with halogens like Br -and Cl -, which increases the band gap to ∼2.15 eV for MASnBr 3 and ∼3.6 eV for MASnCl 3 . The other important materials are FASnI 3  53  having tolerance factor unity, with specific structural stability concerning MASnI 3 . The FASnI 3 has a band gap of ∼1.4 eV with a tuning capacity with different combinations of cations and halogens ranging from ∼2.4 eV for FASnBr 3 to ∼1.33 eV for FA 0.75 MA 0.25 SnI 3 .  54  It is observed that FASnI 3 , MASnI 3 , and CsSnI 3 have similar photovoltaic characteristics. Their band gap can be tuned by adjusting their halide compositions. The compounds CsSnCl 3 , CsSnBr 3 , or CsSnIBr 2  54  have band gaps of ∼2.80 eV, ∼1.80 eV, and ∼1.63 eV respectively, and are frequently used materials for hole transport in DSSCs. However, Sn-based perovskite materials easily oxidize to Sn 4+ in ambient air. The antioxidizing agents such as SnF 2 are used to stop the easy oxidation of Sn-based perovskites. Apart from these, various other strategies have been used to inhibit the oxidation of Sn-based perovskites. The other additives that are used are gallium (Ga + ) and EDAI 2 , reporting an efficiency of ∼9.6%. Hence, increasing the film quality and hindering the oxygen attack may increase the performance of Sn-based solar cell devices. The PCE ∼ 12.4% with stability of ∼3800 h is reported by using PEA/NH 4 SCN combined with PEA x FASnI 3.  20  As we know, Sn 2+ is unstable and oxidizes to Sn 4+ . Hence, devices based on vacancy-ordered double perovskite semiconductors A 2 SnX 6 need to be investigated for their futuristic developments. As for Ge, its toxicity is low concerning Pb. It can also replace Pb in halide perovskites. The MAGeX 3 (x = Cl, Br, I)  55  have structures and properties similar to that of the MAPbX 3 (x = Cl, Br, I), and the band gap (E g ) of AGeI 3 perovskites was found to vary with A cations. The value of the band gap is larger than that of some of the Pb-related perovskites. Investigations on Ge 2+ -based  55  perovskites showed an efficiency of ∼0.11% for CsGeI 3 and 0.20 for MAGeI 3 , respectively. However, the oxidation of Ge 2+ to Ge 4+ creates an instability issue and hence decreases the interest in these materials for solar cell applications. Further, the mixture of Ge-Sn is seen as an option to replace Ge-based perovskites. These materials are expected to have a band gap of ∼0.9 to 3.15 eV. RbSn 0.5 Ge 0.5 I 3  56  is one such material with a band gap of ∼0.90-1.6 eV, and MASn (1-x) Ge x I 3 (x = 0 to 1) is also one such kind of material having PCE ∼ 6.9%. Moreover, the periodic table position of Sb justifies its toxicity  57  and it has characteristics similar to those of arsenic. Sb is cheaper and less hazardous than Sn and has a lone pair of 6s 2 electrons and hence can serve as a replacement for lead. The general compound is A 3 Sb 2 X 9 (A ∼ MA + or Cs + ; X ∼ I, Br, Cl).  58  The compound Cs 3 Sb 2 I 9 has a band gap of ∼2.05 eV and better stability in ambient conditions. The other materials investigated are (CH 3 NH 3 ) 3 Sb 2 I 9 . The addition of Rb to Sb is also reported to improve the device's performance in solar cell applications. Further, (CH 3 NH 3 ) 2 AgSbI 6  59  is also reported as a light absorber showing the observed E g ∼ 1.93 eV. Anyway, the device performance of Sb substituted perovskites is low in terms of efficiency. Bismuth (Bi)  59  is considered as less toxic in comparison to Sn and Ge elements. Bi has a valence of +3 concerning lead, which has +2. The bismuth-based compounds reported are A 3 Bi 2 X 9 (A ∼ Cs + , MA + , FA + ; X ∼ I -, Br -, Cl -).  60  The compound Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 has shown an efficiency of ∼1.09%. The low efficiency may be due to a higher band gap of ∼2 eV and small dimensions (0D, 1D, and 2D) of these materials. Materials such as CsBi 3 I 10  61  and Ag x Bi y I x+3y (x = 1-3, y = 1-2) 62 have a band gap of ∼1.83 eV, showing the PCE ∼ 5.44%. However, further research work is necessary to make Bi compatible to replace Pb in solar cells. As silver is less harmful concerning Pb, various compounds of silver are also tested for photovoltaic applications. Among all of these compounds, Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 ,  63  Cs 2 AgBiCl 6 ,  64  and (CH 3 NH 3 ) 2 AgBi Br 6  65  are a few that have shown quite interest. These have a band gap ranging from ∼2.19 eV to ∼2.77 eV. Further, the doping strategies may change the photovoltaic performance of these materials. Despite remarkable progress in lead-free perovskite material-based devices, stability issues still hamper the progress of these devices. The stability of Sn/Ge  66  is an open challenge. The Sb-  67  and Bibased compounds have better stability and environmental stability. However, the maximum efficiencies reported for these materials are up to ∼6% and ∼3% only. Many of the challenges need to be overcome to increase the desired efficiency and stability of these materials and related devices. The various reasons for lower performance may be credited to wide/indirect band gap, poor film quality, and large hole and electron effective masses as well as serious charge recombination. A few remedies available are interfacial and surface passivation, band gap engineering, or the addition of a few additives in the precursor solution, which may help in improving the device performance and morphology of these materials. In summary, we may say that solar cells at present are observed as a solution to the energy crisis, which may have been concentrated on perovskites. There has been significant progress in the efficiency of Pb-based perovskite materials. However, the potential for commercialization is hampered due to solar cell device stability as well as Pb toxicity. Further, even after the end-of-life, lead leaching is a major issue and needs care for proper environmental protection. In this direction, some lead-free materials based on Sn, Ge, Sb, and Bi have been investigated experimentally and theoretically given their photovoltaic applications. The photovoltaic devices need Pb- The materials marked with an asterisk (*) exhibit simulated properties, while those marked with a hash (≠) represent perovskite-inspired materials. The materials marked with an asterisk (*) exhibit simulated properties, while those marked with a hash (≠) represent perovskite-inspired materials. free materials for further growth of the field. The Sn-based perovskites have shown an efficiency of ∼13%, which is naturally less than Pb-related materials. As a futuristic approach, we can say that Pb has unbolted the future of Pb-free perovskite materials. Metals such as Sn, Bi, and Sb having low toxicity and lone pair electrons can be processed in the form of single crystal or thin films through cost-effective solution processing techniques. The inferior quality of the device in comparison to Pb-based materials in solar cell devices needs to be resolved. These are the materials with wide band gaps and may be more suitable for tandem solar cell configurations.  [68] [69] [70] [71]  Among all the Pb-free materials available are Sn, Bi (Figure  1 ), and metal halide double perovskites, showing several wonderful properties and applications. Herein, it is important to mention that attractive charge transport properties and a broad absorption range across the solar spectrum are the basic characteristics of hybrid perovskite materials for their better suitability for solar cell applications. However, these absorption and transport properties are afforded by the multiband gap  72  and multivalley nature of the band structure and are characterized by a multitool strategy.  73   
 SOLAR CELL DEVICES OF LEAD-FREE PEROVSKITES The various lower toxic compounds (Table  1  and 2, Figure  2 ) of perovskites were investigated in device operations.  74  The ABX 3 (X = Sn, Ge) has structure and properties almost similar to those of the APbX 3 and has shown theoretical efficiencies exceeding ∼20% under one sun. The PCE of Sn-based perovskites has shown ∼14.81%,  75  which is far behind the lead halide perovskite-based devices. The Sn-based perovskites tested in the p-i-n configuration have shown better stability concerning the n-i-p structure.  76  The p-i-n structure uses PEDOT:PSS, PEG-PEDOT:PSS, NiO   82  exhibited an efficiency of ∼2.43%, with a ∼ V oc of ∼0.98 V and J sc ∼ 3.93 mA/cm 2 along with a fill factor (FF) ∼ 69% showing a stability up to ∼25 days. Recently, a new material CsBiSCl 2 has been synthesized with a bandgap of ∼2.012 eV, which is in a device with a structure FTO/TiO 2 / CsBiSCl 2 /spiro-OMeTAD/Au with a PCE of ∼10.38%, showing a decrease in its efficiency by 3% in 150 days.  59  These double perovskites are shown to have less efficiency concerning the corresponding lead halide perovskites. The double perovskites are shown to have a band gap of ∼2 eV, which is larger than the band gap of ∼1.34 eV for single junction solar cells. Hence band gap engineering has been done on the perovskites to decrease the band gap of the double perovskites. Cs 2 NaBiI 6  83  was designed with a band gap of ∼1.66 eV for solar cell fabrication which shows a stability of 5 months. Further, the vacancy-ordered double perovskites have also been considered and explored for solar cell fabrication. Cs 2 SnI 6  84  has attracted attention mostly due to its lower band gap of ∼1.2-1.6 eV with interesting optoelectronic properties and stability in air. The PCE remains very low <2% which promotes further research. The Cs 2 TiBr 6  85  film shows PCE ∼ 2.15% without C 60 and 3.22% with C 60 , which is only comparable to Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 ; 86 however, with its low PCE of double perovskites, one can overcome the issue of toxicity and instability in the air. Among all, Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 based solar cells have higher PCE values than those of the double perovskites. The gap in the PCE values of experimentally and theoretically calculated double perovskites is the main issue. The large and indirect band gap of Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 makes it unsuitable for industrial solar cells. The strategies such as chemical composition, use of vacancy-ordered double perovskites, and heteroatom doping have been tried to overcome the band gap. The adoption of a multilayer heterojunction or inverted structure with other absorbers may provide a solution to this issue as well. Moreover, machine learning may be a useful tool to predict proper double perovskites for efficient perovskite solar cells.   1  and 2 . The redmarked materials show the highest efficiency. The solar cell of structure FTO/c-TiO 2 /m-TiO 2 /Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 -Ag 3 Bi 2 I 9 /PDBD-T/Au shows an efficiency of ∼3.59%, J sc ∼ 7.65 mA/cm 2 , V oc ∼ 0.78 V and FF ∼ 60, which is one of the best performances of bismuth-related lead-free perovskite materials. Herein, it is important to mention that due to the difference in ionic radius of Cs + and Ag + ions, the system does not form CsAg 2 Bi 2 I 9 and the photoactive layer consists of phase-separated Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 -Ag 3 Bi 2 I 9  87  and the device has better thermal stability and retains 90% of initial efficiency even after heating at ∼85 °C for ∼450 h in the glovebox. The solar cell of the structure of FTO/c-TiO 2 /m-TiO 2 /MA 1.5 Cs 1.5 Sb 2 I 3 Cl 6 / spiro-OMeTAD/Au shows an efficiency of ∼1.53% with J sc ∼ 3.6 mA/cm 2 and FF of ∼68%. Mixed cation engineering  88  is a useful technique for producing perovskite-inspired materials, their devices, and modules to get rid of Pb toxicity and stability issues of Pb-based perovskite solar cells. Briefly, Sn-and Ge-based perovskites and their derivatives are the significant alternative classes to lead halide perovskites in the race for lead-free perovskites, and Sn-based perovskites are remarkable with their PCE exceeding ∼14%. However, these perovskites suffer from severe instability in the air. The undesired oxidation of Sn 2+ to Sn 4+ induces the decomposition of MASnI 3 within seconds. This instability is the main reason for the nonavailability of fully patterned, lead-free, large-area PV modules because the large-laser scriber used for module manufacturing is generally placed outside the glovebox and the scribing process takes a lot of time for the oxidation of Sn 2+ to Sn 4+ . The synthesis of stable SnI 2 using carboxylic acid ligands used as perovskite ink for the fabrication of a Pb-free perovskite solar cell with an efficiency of ∼8.35% on a ∼1 cm 2 active area on the flexible substrate has also been reported recently, which is a matter of attention.  89  The air instability of Sn-based materials and Pb toxicity may be countered by Sbbased materials. These materials are known to be stable and suitable for large-scale module fabrication. A 3 Sb 2 X 9 (A = Cs + , MA + , X = I -, Cl -) crystal structure formation takes place in Sbbased perovskite-inspired materials. The efficiencies reported are ∼2.2% for MA 3 Sb 2 I 9-x Cl x and 3.2% for Cs 3 Sb 2 Cl x I 9-x based cells. The optimized double cation MA 1.5 Cs 1.5 Sb 2 I 3 Cl 6based cells exhibited a remarkable shelf life of ∼1800 h with a module efficiency of ∼1.2%.  24  Hence, the module efficiency needs to be of prime focus for Sb-based technology, whereas stability needs to be an issue for Sn-based solar cell devices. Table  1  summarizes the various parameters of devices fabricated by using Pb-free perovskite materials. Figure  3  describes the materials used in the fabrication of lead-free solar cell devices. Figures  4  and 5  show a typical energy level diagram and schematic of a solar cell device based on lead-free and perovskite-inspired that may be more useful for indoor photovoltaic applications.  42    
 LEAD-FREE PEROVSKITE MATERIALS FOR PEROVSKITE-BASED TANDEM SOLAR CELLS The tandem solar cells  36, [38] [39] [40]  are the ground-breaking technology with high efficiency and low cost along with a simple fabrication process. In all the tandem solar cells, the top wide band gap subcell absorbs high energy photons while the bottom narrow band gap subcell captures low energy photons. The tandem solar cells can be fabricated in various combinations such as (i) silicon-perovskite,  90  (ii) perovskite-CIGS,  91  (iii) all perovskite,  92  (iv) perovskite-organic,  93  and (v) organic-organic.  94  The mixed perovskite based on Sn-Pb with a band gap of ∼1.26 eV can play a role in the development of all perovskite tandem solar cells. The Sn-Pb-based bottom subcells are important for all perovskite tandem device fabrication. However, the fast crystallization of the Sn-Pb film results in a less efficient device concerning only Pb halide-based all perovskite tandem solar cells. The mitigation of the oxidation issue of Sn 2+ in Sn-Pb film can be achieved by creating a Snrich region to counter Sn vacancies originating from Sn 2+ oxidation. The addition of SnF 2 suppresses the formation of undesired phases in Sn-Pb. However, this is not a total solution to stop the formation of undesired phases in Sn-Pb. The unbalanced crystallization as well as natural Sn 2+ oxidation are the issues in both Sn-Pb-based perovskites and tandem solar cells fabricated from these materials. The unbalanced crystallization and natural oxidation of Sn 2+ can also be mitigated by modifying the Sn-Pb system with N-(carboxyphenyl)guanidine hydrochloride (CPGCl). The CPGCl-modified FA 0.7 MA 0.3 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 shows an efficiency ∼23.11% and durability ∼3500 h of self-storages in N 2 a t m o s p h e r e .  9 5  T h e u s e o f C P G C l -m o d i fi e d FA 0.7 MA 0.3 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 shows an efficiency of ∼28.20% in the tandem device structure  96  shown in Figure  6 . In a perovskiteperovskite tandem  97  solar cell the Pb-based wide band gap materials are integrated with Sn-Pb-based narrow band gap materials. Although Pb-based perovskite solar cells have several HTLs, Sn-Pb-based perovskite devices are in constant exploration for suitable HTLs, which is a matter of discussion always.  98  The tandem solar cells of perovskite-organic have reached ∼24%. Further, it is expected that perovskite-organic solar cells will keep improving their performance due to the innovations in wide band gap PSCs, interconnecting layers (ICLs), and narrow band gap organic solar cells (OSCs). The perovskite/organic tandem will continue to improve as organic and perovskite-based solar cells are continuously improving their performance day by day. The long-term stability of the perovskite-organic tandem is affected by the segregation of different phases. Moreover, the Sn-Pb-based perovskite/ organic tandem  99  has the issue of oxidative instability due to Sn 2+ cation consequently affecting stability. Figure  7  shows the energy level diagrams of Pb-free perovskite materials used in the fabrication of silicon-perovskite tandem solar cells. Moreover, Tables  3  and 4  show the device parameters of tandems fabricated using Pb-free and perovskite materials. The theoretical predictions show that Cs 2 SnI 5 Br/SHJ-based tandem solar cells may achieve ∼39.1% efficiency.  100   
 MACHINE LEARNING AND BAND GAP PREDICTIONS OF LEAD-FREE PEROVSKITE MATERIALS The instability and toxicity of halide perovskites can be addressed by replacing Pb 2+ with two kinds of metal cations of different valences. Generally, the double perovskites have a crystal formula of A 2 B 1+ B 3+ X 6 . The aimed band gap of materials for solar cells is generally in the range of ∼1.1-1.8 eV. The band gap tailoring generally depends on trial and error of synthesis and characterization until the desired properties of materials are to the satisfaction of the targeted band gap. The traditional experimental results for synthesizing new double perovskites take a lot of computational effort through DFT, have huge cost computational costs, and require professional skills. Further, machine learning, which is a core component of artificial intelligence (AI)  101  that imitates human learning behavior, can extract information from the data through learning and finally predict the unknown data. In the field of materials informatics, ML is a powerful tool for exploring quantitative structure-property relationships. The band gap of some of the lead-free perovskites predicted by ML is listed in Table  5 . 
 INDOOR PHOTOVOLTAICS AND LEAD-FREE PEROVSKITE MATERIALS The consequences of digitalization are ubiquitous. Every social and industrial area feels it as a driving force. All of this is connected with the rapidly increasing number of smart devices for different kinds of applications, such as for controlling communication and sensing tasks, known as the Internet of Things (IoTs). The IoTs market is expected to be ∼8132 billion USD by 2030 and is expected to reach trillion by 2035.  102  The number of devices has grown from 0.08 billion to 60 billion just from 2003 to 2020. The IoT devices need only a small amount of energy in the range of nW to mW. Selfsufficient power supplies are required for such kinds of smart devices. Options are either to do energy harvesting or to use batteries for it. Batteries are costly or one has to replace them every ∼2-3 years, creating a lot of waste as well as adding to the system cost. The use of toxic chemicals in batteries has provoked scientists to search for alternatives. The conventional way can be availed by using various types of energy harvesting technologies. Among photovoltaics, thermoelectricity, and piezoelectricity, photovoltaics seem to be the best option available for such a solution. The PSC technology is dominating in the field of indoor/ outdoor photovoltaics. However, the presence of Pb makes it unfit for the majority of applications, hence, hindering its proper commercialization. The larger band gap of lead-free perovskites gives low efficiency to the devices based on these materials and hence makes them unfit for a variety of applications in outdoor conditions. The lead-free materials have also shown other applications in the areas of photodetectors, X-rays, and photocatalysis, as well as for indoor solar cell applications. The chalcogen perovskites, Pb-free halide perovskites, and silver bismuth halide are a few lead-free materials that can be explored for the progress of indoor photovoltaics.  103  Table  6  describes the photovoltaic parame-ters (J sc , V oc , FF, and PCE) of a few lead-free 104 materials used for device fabrication for indoor photovoltaic applications. 
 DEGRADATION PHENOMENA OF LEAD-FREE PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS The suitable optoelectronic properties of ASnX 3 materials instead of APbX 3 make them the most favorable Pb-free perovskites for photovoltaic applications. Nonetheless, the notorious oxidation of Sn 2+ to Sn 4+ makes it unstable and leads to poor device performance. Hence, it is important to discuss the degradation phenomena given the tin oxidation and tin vacancy formation of SnO 2 . On the exposure of oxygen, for a compound such as FASnI 3 , the O-O distance of O 2 molecules is elongated. On the simultaneous exposure of light and oxygen the compound (NH 2 ) 2 CHSnI 3 (FASnI 3 ) degrades  105  more severely concerning exposure only under oxygen may be given to superoxide formation due to the reaction between oxygen and photoexcited electrons. The light, water, and elevated temperatures are the basic stimulating factors for device and materials degradation. The degradation of the perovskite can be studied through X-ray and thermogravimetric analysis. The Cs 3 Sb 2 I 9  106  is reported to have two polymorphs known as dimer and layered. The dimer degrades within ∼49 days and layered in ∼88 days, which may be due to diffusion of iodide on exposure to the ambient atmosphere. Compared with the other Pb-free perovskites such as (CH 3 NH 3 ) 3 Sb 2 I 9 , (CH 3 NH 3 ) 3 Bi 2 I 9 , Cs 3 Sb 2 I 9 , Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 , CH 3 NH 3 SnI 3 and CH 3 NH 3 GeI 3 , Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 exhibits a unique dual-ion-migration phenomenon,  107  where metal and halide ions gradually diffuse through the hole-transporting layer (in device structure of Glass/FTO/TiO 2 /Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 /P3HT/Cu, toward P3HT) in the long term operation. This phenomenon leads to degradation of the perovskite and subsequent device failure. The phenomena of dual ion diffusion are in contrast to the widely studied lead halide perovskite degradation through the diffusion of dominating halide ions. The double perovskites such as Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 face dual ion diffusion in a devices' longterm operation, although they have better stability at room temperature than their lead counterparts. The dual ion diffusion originates in Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 due to the low formation energies of Ag + (∼0.895 eV) and Br -(∼0.438/ ∼0.427 eV) vacancies as well as their low diffusion energy barriers. The effects of dual ion diffusion in solar cells can be overcome by using a thick layer of hole-transporting materials. The Cs 2 SnI 6 is observed to be stable below a relative humidity of ∼80%. However, it degrades on exposure to more than ∼80% relative humidity or in aqueous conditions. The step model predicts a pit formation on the surface of the Cs 2 SnI 6 crystal, promoting the dissolution of the crystal, initiating the degradation process of Cs 2 SnI 6 .  108  The characterization tools such as micro-Raman and in situ synchrotron XRD predict that Cs 2 SnI 6 decomposes into CsI and SnI 4 in water, which is evidenced by the formation of Sn(OH) 4 in the solution. The structural defects are also responsible for the degradation of the materials and subsequently devices. The defect-rich regions of the perovskite initiate the degradation of moisture exposure through water permeation along grain boundaries. The inherent ionic vacancies of Sn-Pb perovskites promote inward metal diffusion and, consequently, promote device degradation. The mixed Sn-Pb perovskites suffer from several types of degradation pathways that create an issue in the wider implementation of these materials in tandem photovoltaic applications. Removing the thermally unstable   + I 2 + other byproducts. The degradation  109  of CsBi 3 I 10 is reported to be improved by various passivation strategies. Herein, it is important to mention that various experimental and theoretical  110  research studies have suggested that water/ oxygen-initiated Pb-based perovskite decomposition is induced through vacancy formation. Halide-induced vacancies are the key to the generation of oxide species contributing to degradation  111  and initiating the breakdown of the crystal structure induced by acid-base reaction with MA cation, leading to faster degradation of the perovskite materials as well as their films. The passivation can improve it; however, a particular passivation scheme is still to be established. We observe a lack of proper understanding of the mechanism of degradation of Pb-free (such as Sn-based) materials and devices. Molecular dynamics has played a crucial role in identifying or understanding the effect of humidity on perovskite materials and devices. It is revealed that the halide defect vacancy site is likely to absorb oxygen concerning the pristine defect-free surface, hence drastically accelerating the decomposition of the structure. The molecular dynamics also reveal that halide vacancy defects on the surface of perovskite also modify the band gap by inducing a local state near the minima of the conduction band and hence accelerating the electron-hole recombination. Briefly, for materials such as CsSnI 3 , the oxygen occupies the vacancy at the halide site, initiating the formation of a O-O single bond, resulting in the formation of SnO 2 , creating a vacancy on the Sn site that accelerates the decomposition of the structure. Once the vacancy is created at the halide site (such as iodide), the atoms around the vacancy start moving away, distorting [SnI 6 ] -4 to accommodate the point defects, subsequently distorting the bond length and angle of Sn-I and Sn-I-Sn. Further, the Sn atom near the oxygen atom may repel other Sn atoms due to the extra charge created on the Sn atom, which is near oxygen molecules, creating a thermodynamically unstable structure. Hence the reduction of the density of halide defects is of prime importance for developing a robust perovskite structure with favorable properties for device fabrication. Molecular dynamics  112  and machine learning 113 may prove to be a better tool shortly for developing perovskite materials and devices with desired performance.   
 CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES Long-term stability, upscaling for industrial processing, and environmental impact are some basic challenges faced by the current trend in PSCs. The accidental lead leaching from cells and modules may be the reason for impediment in the commercialization of perovskite-based devices. However, the optimistic thinking suggests that the amount of lead estimated in these technologies is comparable to some technologies already in use, such as in electronic solder wires, fossil fuels, lead-acid batteries, etc. The PSCs processing has a greater environmental impact concerning lead release. The best replacement of Pb by Sn also has a significant environmental impact. The Pb contamination can be reduced by using encapsulation with Pb-absorbing materials. The environmental impact of these materials can be reduced by recycling and reusing Pb-containing materials. Hence, one should be optimistic that Pb in PSCs is not affecting the environment as much as they seem to be doing it. The challenges faced by lead-free halide perovskite-based solar cells are lower efficiency, poorer film quality, and increased carrier recombination. These also have a wider band gap concerning lead-based halide perovskites. The thermodynamic instability of Sn 2+ or Ge 2+ may be the root cause of the lower efficiency and instability. The poor film quality may be due to the faster crystallization process occurring during chemical reactions. The Sb/Bi-based materials as well as perovskite-inspired materials stability along with environmentally friendliness. The substitution of Bi 3+ and Sb 3+ in place of Pb 2+ results in a compound of chemical formula A 3 B 2 X 9 known as lead-plomb-based hybrid materials. These low-dimensional, charge-neutral structures do not have proper photovoltaic properties. Further, limitations are imposed through wide band gaps and instability. The strategies adapted to enhance the photovoltaic properties of these materials are doping ions additives at various sites in the cell structure. Further, the additive strategy is also useful the passivation of defects in perovskite materials in improving the charge transport properties. The passivation is also used to counter the undesirable oxidation of Sn 2+ . Additionally, it is also used in double perovskite materials to passivate defects to improve the film quality and hence the solar cell performance. The silverand copper-based materials need to be investigated to improve the efficiency and stability of solar cells based on lead-free perovskite materials. To counter the lead toxicity in perovskite materials and devices, various categories of lead-like and leadfree materials have developed in the past decade. However, the performance of their devices is short of expectations. The unstable lattice structure distorts the octahedral, resulting in their low structural dimensionality and poor charge transport. Hence, the understanding of crystal structure and its relation with performance may be of very much importance in designing new lead-free perovskite materials for their futuristic application. A proper perspective of cell design of Pb-free perovskite in p-i-n architecture can be stated as (i) selecting or designing HTL materials with a suitable HOMO for extracting holes along with suitable wettability and polarity, (ii) tuning the Pb-free materials film structure for promoting absorption, charge transportation, and suppressing the defects, and (iii) selecting the ETL in such a manner that the LUMO of materials should facilitate electron extraction and prevent O 2 / H 2 penetration. Further, a proper buffer should be used below and above the Pb-free active layer to facilitate light trapping, hole/electron collection, crystallization of the perovskite film, and surface passivation as well as grain encapsulation for fabricating an efficient and durable Pb-free perovskite device. The challenge of device fabrication is the use of toxic chemicals  114  in the fabrication process of PSCs. The heavy use of toxic chemicals needs safety concerns during the handling of dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The working personnel for device fabrication may hurt their health during the handling of this toxic chemical. DMF has been banned in Europe since 2023  115  and may extend to other regions shortly. Hence the PSCs technology is in urgent need of developing better ecofriendly approaches  116  for mitigating the potential health and environmental risks during PSC fabrication. Alternative solvents such as ionic liquids, water, ethanol, triethyl phosphate, and Valero lactone have been tried and are under constant observation. In a nutshell, the combination of theoretical interpretation along with the experiments and the use of modifiable models developed through machine learning and green approaches may address the present issues and challenges of Pb-free and perovskite-inspired materials in predicting solar cell performance and may shape its future developments.

The device of structure Glass/FTO/NiOx/MA Free Sn-Pb perovskite/PCBM/BCP/ Ag shows an efficiency of ∼23% and stability of ∼95% of initial PCE for ∼4320 h with encapsulation and 88% without encapsulation. 77  For (PEA, FA) SnI 3 , 78  PSCs with a high value of PCE ∼ 12.4%, NH 4 SCN as an additive, and ICBA as ETL demonstrate ∼90% of its initial efficiency for over ∼3800 h. Theoretically, 79  it has been shown that CsSnI 3-x Br x can fetch an efficiency of ∼21.68% in the device structure of FTO/ CeO 2 /CsSnI 3-x Br x /CFTS/Au. FASnI 3 shows an efficiency of ∼10.6% in p-i-n configuration, and it retains ∼96% of the initial PCE up to ∼1300 h. The novel functions such as semitransparent flexible 80  devices of Sn-based materials need to be developed to integrate with buildings, wearable electronics as well as Internet of Things (IOTs). 81  Double perovskite-based devices are more famous due to their stability edge over Sn and Ge-based lead perovskites. The Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 82 is more investigated for solar cell applications. Double perovskites are generally tested in the device configuration having the structure substrate/transparent electrode/ETL/ double perovskite/HTL/electrode. The generally used ETLs are TiO 2 (c-TiO 2 ), mesoporous TiO 2 , or SnO 2 . The HTLs used are spiro-OMeTAD, P3HT, and PTAA. The various anode layers are Au, Ag, or Cu.
