Title: Minimization of Energy Level Mismatch of PCBM and Surface Passivation for Highly Stable Sn-Based Perovskite Solar Cells by Doping n-Type Polymer
Developing high-performance and stable Sn-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is difficult due to the inherent tendency of Sn 2+ oxidation and, the huge energy mismatch between perovskite and Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a frequently employed electron transport layer (ETL). This study demonstrates that perovskite surface defects can be passivated and PCBM's electrical properties improved by doping n-type polymer N2200 into PCBM. The doping of PCBM with N2200 results in enhanced band alignment and improved electrical properties of PCBM. The presence of electron-donating atoms such as S, and O in N2200, effectively coordinates with free Sn 2+ to prevent further oxidation. The doping of PCBM with N2200 offers a reduced conduction band offset (from 0.38 to 0.21 eV) at the interface between the ETL and perovskite. As a result, the N2200 doped PCBM-based PSCs show an enhanced open circuit voltage of 0.79 V with impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.98% (certified PCE 11.95%). Significantly, the N2200 doped PCBM-based PSCs exhibited exceptional stability and retained above 90% of their initial PCE when subjected to continuous illumination at maximum power point tracking for 1000 h under one sun.
DOI: 10.1002/smll.202402896 conversion efficiency (PCE), which has experienced a rapid increase from 3.8% to 26.1% in just 14 years.  [1, 2]  Unfortunately, all reported efficient PSCs contain Pb in the perovskite absorber. This restricts the mass production of PSCs due to the toxicity of Pb. To address this issue, a lot of research groups are trying to find ways to replace Pb with metals that aren't harmful, like Sn, Bi, Ge, and Cu without affecting the perovskite absorber's optoelectronic properties.  [3] [4] [5] [6]  Among them, perovskites based on Sn have demonstrated exceptional optoelectronic characteristics, including an optimal narrow bandgap of 1.4 eV, higher carrier mobility, and reduced exciton binding energy.  [7] [8] [9] [10]  However, the Sn-based PSCs show poor device performance and maintain a PCE of below 15%.  [11]  The main reason for limited performance is the low open circuit voltage (V OC ). The high defect density for Snbased perovskites is recognized for their low V OC . The Sn-based perovskite films are susceptible to oxidizing from Sn  2+  to Sn 4+ in ambient or glovebox environments.  [12]  The Sn  4+  is the source of defects in Sn-based perovskite films.  [13]  To address this issue, Mathews et al. employed SnF 2 as an additive to retard Sn 2+ oxidation and established SnF 2 inclusion in precursor solution is crucial for achieving a consistent film structure with reduced Sn 4+ content.  [14]  The rapid crystallization rate of Sn perovskite also has a detrimental effect on surface morphology.  [15]  To retard the crystallization rate and prevent Sn 2+ oxidation, in our previous work, we performed coadditive engineering with N 2 H 5 Cl and enhanced V OC from 0.30 to 0.46 V.  [16]  Alternate studies have used some other methods to reduce the defect density such as perovskite dimensionality manipulation,  [17, 18]  the addition of reducing agents,  [19, 20]  and enhanced the V OC up to 0.6 V.  [21]  In contrast, despite having a bandgap of 1.35 eV, Sn-based PSCs experience a voltage loss of over 0.7 V, which is significantly greater than that of lead perovskites. Another potential reason for the low V OC may be the significantly low energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) commonly used as electron transport layers (ETLs). This limitation in the LUMO energy level restricts the maximum achievable photovoltage.  [22]  For Pb-based PSCs, the exceptional compatibility between PCBM and perovskite has been ascribed to the wellsuited energy levels of PCBM. However, there is a large energy mismatch between PCBM and Sn-based perovskite which leads to inferior V OC for Sn-based PSCs. To maintain consistent device performance, it is crucial to match energy level with perovskite and uniform morphology on the perovskite layer of PCBM film. Furthermore, PCBM is deficient in effective electron-rich centers which are needed to interact with the unevenly distributed, poorly coordinated ion defects on polycrystalline perovskite surfaces.  [23]  In this context, some initiatives have been made for Pb-based PSCs, to enhance morphology and, tune the energy level of the PCBM layer by doping with 1,8-Diazabicyclo [5.4.0] undec-7ene (DBU).  [24]  A PCE of 23.1% was achieved by mixing PCBM with or by 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro1H-benzoimidazole (DMBI).  [25, 26]  Yan et al. demonstrated the blending of PCBM with an insulating polymer (polystyrene) to increase its viscosity for better coverage of PCBM on perovskite film.  [27]  In this regard, Pang et al. used n-type polymer such as poly[N,N‚Ä≤-bis(2octyldodecyl)naphthalene-1,4,5,8 is(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]alt-5,5‚Ä≤-(2,2‚Ä≤bithiophene) (N2200) as a dopant for PCBM to passivate the uncoordinated Pb 2+ ions and minimize energy barrier through its strong acceptor thiophene group.  [28]  Sn-base perovskite films suffer from surface defects and huge energy mismatch with charge transport layers. So, the potential advantages of utilizing N2200 to doped PCBM, such as its ability to passivate the uncoordinated metallic ions, as well as its ability to improve the LUMO of PCBM may be useful for Sn-based PSCs. In this work, we have investigated the doping effects of n-type polymer N2200 in PCBM on its electronic properties used for Sn-based PSCs. We found that the addition of N2200 improved the LUMO of PCBM and was well matched with the Sn-based perovskite LUMO level. In addition, N2200 demonstrated the ability to neutralize defects on the surfaces of polycrystalline perovskite by interacting with free Sn 2+ ions using the loan pair electrons of its functional group. As a result, the Sn-based PSCs fabricated using the optimized process showed a remarkable PCE of 12.98%, slightly exceeding the certified PCE of 11.95%. The primary factor contributing to the increase in PCE was the augmentation of V OC from 0.72 to 0.79 V. Impressively, the PSCs exhibited remarkable operational stability under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) conditions for 1000 h. 
 Results and Discussion Figure  S1  (Supporting Information) illustrates the molecular structure of PCBM and N2200. The N2200 is a copolymer of naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide) (NDI) and bithiophene. The NDI core imparts a highly ùúã-conjugated polymeric backbone and is recognized as a strong electron-withdrawing group, facilitating efficient electron injection and extraction.  [29]  To prepare FASnI 3 films, we used the one-step antisolvent method. We incorporated N2200 into PCBM at different wt% and obtained 1 wt% N2200 was optimum for device performance. For the sake of simplicity, we will now refer to the ETL film that was prepared by using only PCBM as "PCBM", and the ETL film prepared by doping with N2200 as "PCBM:N2200". The effect of N2200 doping on the energy levels of PCBM was examined by using a photoemission yield spectrometer (PESA; Riken Keiki AC-3E) measurement. Figure  1a ,b shows the ionization potentials (IPs) value equivalent to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of PCBM and PCBM:N2200 films. The results from the AC-3E measurement are summarized in Table  S1  (Supporting Information). The addition of 1 wt% N2200 to PCBM shifts the HOMO level from 6.2 to 6.03 eV (Figure  1a, b ). This may be due to the presence of an electron-rich bithiophene group in N2200 acceptor. To find out the LUMO of FASnI 3 , PCBM or PCBM:N2200, we used the equation, LUMO = IPs-E g (bandgap) (Figure  S2  and S3, Supporting Information). The LUMO values of PCBM and PCBM:N2200 were found to be 4.00 and 3.83 eV respectively. The conduction band offset (CBO) at the interface between the ETL and perovskite is reduced from 0.38 to 0.21 eV with N2200 doping in PCBM, as shown in Figure  1c . A low CBO at the interface between the ETL and perovskite layer decreases the amount of energy lost during the transfer of electrons from the perovskite layer to the ETL. This is beneficial for increasing the V OC and decreasing the rate of recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface. To learn more about how photogenerated carriers are transported from FASnI 3 to PCBM and PCBM:N2200, photoluminescence (PL) studies were carried out (Figure  1d ). From the steady-state PL, we observed a rigorous PL quenching for FASnI 3 film with PCBM: N2200. This is due to the fastest charge extraction from the FASnI 3 to PCBM: N2200 ETL. This result is also supported by the TRPL measurement (Figure  1e ). The FASnI 3 /PCBM:N2200 film showed a relatively shorter PL lifetime (1.9 ns) compared to FASnI 3 /PCBM film (2.4 ns). Typically, when there is a strong quenching of PL and a short PL lifetime, it suggests that there is improved electron extraction occurs at the interface between the perovskite and ETL.  [30]  We suppose that this fastest charge extraction was due to the strong electronwithdrawing NDI core. To observe the effect of N2200 doping in PCBM on the conductivity, we performed the direct current conductivity test for indium tin oxide (ITO)/ETL (PCBM or PCBM:N2200)/Ag device. The conductivity from I-V plots was computed using the following formula: ùúé 0 = Id A V (1) Here d represents the thickness of ETL (50 nm), I is the current, V is the applied voltage, and A is the active area. We found that the N2200 doping increases the conductivity of PCBM from 5.9 √ó 10 -3 mS cm -1 to a higher value of 8.7 √ó 10 -3 mS cm -1 (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information). In addition, the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method was involved for electron-only devices (ITO/SnO 2 /FASnI 3 /PCBM or PCBM:N2200/Ag) to obtain the electron mobility for ETL (Figure  2a ). It was found that PCBM:N2200 has an electron mobility of 7.45 √ó 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 S -1 , which is significantly higher than PCBM's electron mobility of 5.21 √ó 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 S -1 . The above results indicate that the doping of PCBM with N2200 enhanced the optoelectronic properties of PCBM which is necessary for optimum device performance. For Sn-based perovskite films, the surface of perovskite contains a lot of free Sn 2+ ions due to the weak bonding between Sn 2+ and I -ions. These free Sn 2+ ions are susceptible to Sn 4+ oxidation causing p-type self-doping which is considered as the main defect for Sn-based perovskite film. The functional group of N2200 polymer contains O and S atoms which possess loan pair electrons that can interact with metallic cation.  [31]  To observe the interaction between Sn 2+ and N2200 polymer, we performed XPS measurements for FASnI 3 and N2200-washed FASnI 3 films. The raw FASnI 3 film exhibits two prominent peaks at 485.2 and 493.6 eV in the Sn 3d spectrum, representing the Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 states, respectively. The peaks for Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 states are the summation of Sn 2+ 3d5/2 and Sn 4+ 3d5/2, and Sn 2+ 3d3/2 and Sn 4+ 3d3/2 respectively. To find out the exact peak position of Sn 2+ and Sn 4+ before and after washing FASnI 3 films with N2200 (1 mg mL -1 ), we deconvoluted the peaks corresponding to Sn 3d5/2 state (Figure  2b ). Upon washing the FASnI 3 film with N2200, the peaks corresponding to Sn 2+ 3d 5/2 state shifted from 486.5 to 485.7 eV and for Sn 4+ 3d 5/2 state moved from 487.5 to 486.7 eV. These peaks shifted to a lower binding energy may be due to the electron cloud transfer from O and S to the Sn 2+ . From the XPS spectra of sulfur (S 2p1/2) and oxygen (O 1s), we observed that the peaks corresponding to S 2p1/2 and O 1s states shifted to higher binding energy (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information). A comparable pattern was also noted for the I 3d peaks, indicating that the peaks at 616.7 and 628.2 eV for the I 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 states, respectively, shifted toward lower binding energy. (Figure  2c ). The interfacial anchoring effect of N2200 in perovskite was observed due to the creation of coordination bonding with free Sn 2+ .  [28]  This type of coordination bonding with Sn 2+ is beneficial for Sn-based perovskite because the free Sn 2+ ions on the perovskite surface are very susceptible to oxidization (to Sn 4+ ). This is consistent with the deconvolution results of peaks corresponding to Sn 3d5/2 state showed that washing FASnI 3 film with N2200 reduced Sn 4+ content from 22.02 to 16.38% (Table  S2 , Supporting Information). To further observe the interaction between N2200 and Sn 2+ , we performed the proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 HNMR) measurement. Due to the lack of a suitable single solvent to dissolve both N2200 and SnI 2 , we performed the 1 HNMR with bithiophene, a part of the N2200 monomer unit containing the main functional group, and SnI 2 (Figure  S6 , Supporting Information). From the 1 HNMR spectra of bithiophene and bithiophene + SnI 2 , we observed that the binding energy of protons for bithiophene shifted to lower values which indicates the creation of a coordination bond between sulfur and Sn 2+ (Figure  S6 , Supporting Information).  [32]  As the bithiophene is a part of the N2200 monomer unit interacting with SnI 2 , the N2200 polymer should also interact with SnI 2 . On the other hand, from the 1 HNMR spectra of N2200, PCBM, and N2200 mix PCBM, we didn't observe any peak shift for N2200 mix PCBM solution (Figure Supporting Information). This indicates that there is no chemical interaction between N2200 and PCBM. In this sequence, a notable PL intensity was observed for FASnI 3 film washed by N2200 (1 mg mL -1 in chlorobenzene (CB)), in comparison to the unwashed FASnI 3 film (Figure  S8 , Supporting Information). This result indicates that washing with N2200 effectively suppresses the surface defects of the FASnI 3 film. We suppose that a similar phenomenon also happens when N2200 doped PCBM is deposited on the Sn-based perovskite film. That means N2200 doping not only tunes the energy level of PCBM film but also effectively passivates the perovskite surface defects. The extent of the ETL coverage on the perovskite layer is crucial for the performance of the PSCs. To observe the effect of N2200 doping in PCBM on the surface morphology, we performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation. We found that the PCBM:N2200 show uniform surface coverage as compared with only PCBM (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information). This may be due to the enhancement of viscosity by the entanglement of the N2200 polymer chains.  [33]  From the water contact measurement, we also observed that the contact angle increases from 93.70 0 to 103.20¬∞for N2200 doping in PCBM indicating the enhancement of hydrophobicity of ETL (Figure  S10 , Supporting Information). These features are needed for stable device performance which makes the device able to protect from the harmful impact of water vapor. To examine the impact of N2200 doping in PCBM on the device performance, we fabricated inverted planar PSCs with the following structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/FASnI 3 /PCBM or PCBM:N2200/BCP/Ag (Figure  S11 , Supporting Information). To fabricate N2200 doped Sn-based PSCs, we optimized the concentration of N2200 to 1 wt% in PCBM. A total of fifteen cells were listed for each batch. The devices based on N2200 doped PCBM exhibited significantly greater reproducibility compared to those based on PCBM (Figure  3b ). The J-V curves of the highest performing PSCs, both in PCBM and with PCBM:N2200, during a forward bias scan under 1 sun are displayed in Figure  3a . The scan ranged from -0.1 to 0.9 V. Table  1  provides a con- cise summary of the key photovoltaic performance parameters. The J-V curves and corresponding parameters of PCBM and PCBM:N2200 based devices both in forward and reverse scans are shown in Figure  S12  and Table  S3  (Supporting Information) respectively. The champion device PCBM-based PSC had a PCE of 11.04% and photovoltaic specs of J SC = 21.90 mA cm -2 , V OC = 0.72 V, and FF = 70. A high PCE of 12.98% was seen for PCBM:N2200-based PSC, with a J SC of 22.5 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 0.79 V, and an FF of 0.73. The devices based on PCBM and PCBM:N2200 demonstrated integrated current densities of 22.17 and 22.41 mA cm -2 respectively based on incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Figure  S13 , Supporting Information). These results are consistent with the J SC values observed in the J-V curves. Among different parameters, the V OC was enhanced significantly with N2200 doping. This may be due to the lower defect density and reduction in CBO of ETL/perovskite interface.  [28]  To gain a deep understanding of the improvement in V OC , we conducted capacitance-voltage (C-V) characterization by using Mott-Schottky analysis, as shown in Figure  S14  (Supporting Information). The built-in potential (V bi ) enhanced from 0.52 to 0.62 V for PSC with N2200 doping in PCBM (Figure  S14 , Supporting Information). The enhanced V bi can inhibit the recombination of carriers at the interface and facilitate the transport of charges, which is associated with the increase in V OC of the N2200 doped PCBM-based PSCs.  [34]  From transient photovoltage (TPV) measurement, we observed a delayed TPV decay for PCBM:N2200-based PSCs (4.25 Œºs) in comparison with PCBM-based PSCs (3.01 Œºs) (Figure  3c ). The prolonged TPV decay signifies an extended lifespan of charge carriers and a diminished rate of recombination in the PCBM:N2200-based PSCs.  [35]  Moreover, the analysis of the decay of transient photocurrent (TPC) can offer insights into the process of carrier transportation in the PSCs. To gain a comprehensive understanding of trap-assisted recombination, specifically Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination, an experimental investigation was conducted to examine the changes in J SC and V OC relative to light intensity. The results are displayed in Figure  3d . The curve slope was obtained from the curve fitting using the following equation  [36]  : V OC = n id k B T q ln ( J SC J O ) (2) In the given context, k B denotes Boltzmann's constant, q signifies the elementary charge, J 0 signifies the reverse saturation current, also known as the leakage current and T represents the absolute temperature. The equation was employed to ascertain the ideality factors (n id ) for the PCBM:N2200 device, yielding a value of 1.68, which is less than the value of the PCBM-based device (1.86). The lower value of n id means less SRH recombination caused by defects.  [37]  Furthermore, there is an inverse relationship between V OC and J 0 , meaning that enhancing V OC necessitates a reduction in leakage current. Figure  S16  (Supporting Information) illustrates the dark currents that correspond to the respective devices. There was a two-order reduction in leakage current between the PCBM-based device and the PCBM:N2200based device. This reduction in current leakage was due to the passivation of the Sn 2+ ions on the FASnI 3 surface by the loan pair electrons of S and O atoms in the N2200 molecule.  [28]  In addition, we conducted electrochemical impedance measurements to observe the impact of N2200 doping in PCBM on the resistance of charge recombination (Figure  S17 , Supporting Information). Upon analyzing the Nyquist plots, we noticed a significant semicircle of greater size, indicating a higher recombination resistance in the device with PCBM:N2200 compared to the PCBM device. This result is consistent with the device's performance as shown in Figure  3a . After being encapsulated in an N 2 glove box, we examined the operational stability of PSCs based on PCBM and PCBM:N2200. The PSCs based on PCBM:N2200 exhibited exceptional durability, maintaining more than 90% of their initial efficiency for 1000 hours under 1sun at MPPT condition. Conversely, the PSCs based on only PCBM experienced a quick performance degrada-tion and collapsed within 270 h (Figure  4a ). The PCBM:N2200based PSCs were sent to the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in Japan for certification. we got a stable certified efficiency of 11.95% on a 0.0887 cm 2 aperture area, as shown in Figure  S18  (Supporting Information). This certified measurement was done after 23.7 min of MPPT with a total illumination time was 168 min. It is important to note that the certified efficiency in question is classified as a quasi-steady-state efficiency. This suggests that the attainment of each point on the I-V curve is contingent upon the maintenance of a constant current within a tolerance of 0.03%, while subjecting the system to a fixed applied voltage. This indicates that PCBM:N2200-based PSC has consistent operational stability. To observe the effect of N2200 doping on the stability, the degradation of PCBM and PCBM:N2200 coated FASnI 3 films were assessed by monitoring the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns over time, as depicted in Figure  S19a ,b (Supporting Information). PCBM and PCBM:N2200 coated FASnI 3 films were exposed to ambient conditions and closely examined how the intensity of the characteristic peaks ((100) or (  200 )) for both of the films varied with time. The PCBM-coated FASnI 3 film exhibited a notably higher rate of decay of (100) peak compared to the PCBM:N2200 coated FASnI 3 film (Figure  4b, c ), indicating that the PCBM:N2200 coated FASnI 3 film had superior stability against oxygen and moisture. The enhanced stability can be ascribed to the greater hydrophobicity (higher water contact  
 Conclusion In this work, we demonstrated the significant improvement in the electrical characteristics of PCBM through the N2200 incorporation. The doping of N2200 in PCBM not only reduces the CBO between PCBM and perovskite but also passivates the FASnI 3 surface defect by coordinating with Sn 2+ . Moreover, the addition of N2200 in PCBM makes the PCBM coverage on the FASnI 3 film more uniform and hydrophobic which effectively prevents the FASnI 3 film from the ambient atmosphere. As a result, the N2200 doped PCBM-based PSC showed remarkable stability for more than 1000 h under MPPT conditions. This study presents a straightforward and efficient method for doping to overcome the difficulties related to PCBM and Sn-based perovskite, offering a resolution for the solution-based fabrication of high-quality ETLs. 
 Experimental Section Materials: In their original state, all chemicals were employed without undergoing any supplementary purification procedures. The substances that were utilized were: formamidinium iodide (FAI, >98%), phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI, >97%), Bathocuproine (BCP), Bithiophene (>98 %), anhydrous solvents of 2-propanol, CB and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. Japan, tin (II) fluoride ((SnF 2 ), >99%), tin (II) iodide ((SnI 2 ), 99.99%), N2200 from Sigma-Aldrich, Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevious PVP Al 4083) from Germany, PCBM, 99.5% from Lumtec Co., Taiwan, and ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI 2 ) were acquired from Merck. Perovskite Film Fabrication: A perovskite precursor, consisting of EDAI 2 , PEAI, FAI, SnI 2 , and SnF 2 in a ratio of 0.01, 0.05:0.94:1:0.1, was mixed with a DMSO solvent at a concentration of 0.9 m. Subsequently, the mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for a period of one hour. Applying the precursor required spin coating, which was done for 12 and 48 s at 1000 and 5000 rpm, respectively. In the subsequent step, a volume of 160 ŒºL of CB was introduced as an anti-solvent at a time interval of 35 s. The substrate was subsequently subjected to annealing at a temperature of 65 ¬∞C for a brief period then an additional 12 min of annealing at 100 ¬∞C. Solar Cell Fabrication: Pattern indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were used to fabricate Sn-PSCs. The ITO glass substrates were subjected to a combination of detergent, DI water, acetone, and isopropanol for cleaning. Every treatment had a duration of 20 min and included the use of sonication. Before the deposition of PEDOT:PSS, the substrates were subjected to a 30 min UV-ozone treatment. On the ITO substrate, the PEDOT: PSS was applied through a spin-coating method, employing a rotational speed of 4000 rpm for a period of 30 s. The PEDOT: PSS films underwent annealing at a temperature of 150 ¬∞C for a period of 20 min, after which they were gradually cooled to reach room temperature. Then perovskite and other subsequent layers were deposited in N 2 filled glove box. The PCBM solution (20 mg mL -1 ) was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 65 ¬∞C for 10 min. To prepare the PCBM:N2200 device, N2200 was mixed into the PCBM solution in different mass ratios. The BCP layer was subjected to a drop-casting process, wherein a solution of BCP with a concentration of 0.1 mg mL -1 was promptly applied. The rotation speed was maintained at 6000 rpm for a period of 30 s and annealed 65 ¬∞C for 10 min. Finally, a layer of silver with a thickness of 100 nm was applied onto the surface using a deposition rate of 0.5 √Ö S -1 for the initial 5 nm, 1 √Ö S -1 for the subsequent 10 nm, and ultimately, 1.5 √Ö S -1 to achieve complete thermal evaporation with a thickness of 100 nm. Characterization: A powder X-ray diffractometer Rigaku RINT-2500 with Cu Kùõº radiation was used to perform the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. An SEM (Hitachi SU-8000) with an acceleration voltage of 2 kV was used to analyze the film morphology and device structure. The Shimadzu UV-vis 3600 spectrophotometer was used to measure the optical absorption spectra. A photoelectron spectrometer AC-3E, manufactured by RIKEN KEIKI CO., LTD., was used to evaluate the HOMO level of FASnI 3 , PCBM, and PCBM:N2200 films. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the FASnI 3 and N2200-washed FASnI 3 films. The PHI Quantera SXM instrument from ULVAC-PHI was utilized for this analysis, with a photon energy of 1486.7 eV and a MgKùõº source. The PL and TRPL were measured using the Hamamatsu C12132 fluorescence lifetime spectrometer. The relationship between current and voltage was assessed by employing a solar simulator designed to generate standard 1 sun (100 mW cm -2 , WXS-155S-10: Wacom Denso Co., Japan). This allowed for the creation of the J-V curves. The IPCE was measured by using the CEP-2000BX device from Bunkoukeiki Co., LTD. The PSCs were measured using PAIOS to obtain dark J-V, Nyquist plot, transient photocurrent decay, and transient photovoltage decay. Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1.

 Figure S15 (Supporting Information) shows that the PCBM:N2200-based PSCs have a faster photocurrent decay (1.71 Œºs) compared to the PCBMbased PSCs (2.01 Œºs), indicating faster carrier transportation in the PCBM: N2200-based PSCs.
