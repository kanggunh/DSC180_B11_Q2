Title: CdS-Based Interface Engineering for 1.7 V Voltage Vacuum-Deposited Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells
All-inorganic cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr 3 ) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained significant attention due to their superior stability compared to that of organic-inorganic hybrid devices. In this study, we employ a vacuum-deposited cadmium sulfide (CdS) interfacial layer to address the challenge of achieving a high open-circuit voltage (V oc ) in vacuumdeposited CsPbBr 3 PSCs. Incorporating a thin layer of CdS between the electron transport layer (ETL) and the inorganic perovskite absorber enhances the V oc to 1.7 V, along with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increase from 7.8% to 8.4%. Moreover, adding this interfacial layer improves the charge extraction by potentially reducing grain boundary recombination centers via enlarging perovskite grain sizes. Our results show the average perovskite grain size increases from 4 μm to 6 μm on CdS incorporated samples compared to the control. This work reveals the potential of using CdS as a passivation layer to improve charge extraction characteristics by minimizing bimolecular recombinations.
INTRODUCTION Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as the most promising third-generation solar cells due to their unique optoelectronic properties and unprecedented rise in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from the initial 3.8% 1 to 26% 2 over the past decade. Most high-efficiency PSCs with PCE > 20% comprise an organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite absorber layer.  3  However, the organic components in highefficiency PSCs are unstable under heat, oxygen, moisture, and light, limiting their practical use. Efforts have been made to create efficient and stable inorganic PSCs by replacing organic cations with inorganic cesium ions (Cs + ). Inorganic perovskites are more stable  4  as they do not decompose easily in heat and moisture, unlike organic perovskites with volatile and hygroscopic organic cations. CsPbI 3 has emerged as the most successful inorganic perovskite with over 20% efficiency.  4, 5  However, it faces stability issues at room temperature, transitioning from the black α-phase at 360 °C to the yellow δ-phase after cooling.  [6] [7] [8]  Bromide-based inorganic perovskites, especially CsPbBr 3 , show promise due to their resilience to heat, moisture, oxygen, and UV irradiation.  [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]  The Goldschmidt tolerance factor (τ) of CsPbBr 3 is 0.92, favorable for stable cubic phase stabilization.  14  Compared to other all-inorganic perovskite counterparts CsPbBr 3 has high electron mobility and electron lifetime.  15  Although CsPbBr 3 has achieved 11.21% PCE,  16  its voltage is somewhat limited, typically in the 1.6 V range. The V OC deficiency with respect to the bandgap (2.3 eV) is ∼0.7 V or about 30%. This deficit in the V oc can be attributed to the losses due to poor passivation of the perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) interface and voltage losses due to poor matching of the valence band of the perovskite to the valence band of the p-heterojunction layer leading to trap states.  17  As widely recognized, the inherent softness of perovskites permits significant lattice distortion closer to the surface and grain boundaries when subjected to thermal stress. This residual stress can adversely affect electron-hole pair transport and extraction properties. Therefore, a surface treatment that tunes the residual stress could improve the film's physical and chemical properties, enhancing the device performance. Various interface defect passivation strategies have been reported for organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells, but this has not been widely explored in all-inorganic PSCs.  [18] [19] [20] [21]  Few efforts have focused on healing inorganic perovskite surfaces by controlling their interfaces with ETL and HTLs. For instance, Zhou et al. achieved a V oc of 1.70 V through interface engineering at the ETL (SnO 2 -TiO x Cl 4-2x )/CsPbBr 3 inter-face with 2D WS 2 nanoflakes.  22  In another study, the same group incorporated 2D Cl-terminated Ti 3 C 2 (Ti 3 C 2 Cl x ) MXene in the bulk of CsPbBr 3 film and achieved the V oc of 1.70 V,  23  the highest reported for CsPbBr 3 PSCs. While several other investigations have focused on interface passivation of CsPbBr 3 PSCs using materials like poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),  24  NiFe 2 O 4 quantum dots,  25  potassium iodide, 26 etc., the V oc achieved in these studies was below 1.7 V. It is worth noting that in most of the research, solution-based deposition techniques were employed for perovskite deposition and defect passivation; posing challenges for transferring these techniques into an industrial setup to achieve production yield and reproducibility. Moreover, CsBr has low solubility in commonly used organic solvents like dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); this makes achieving stoichiometric CsPbBr 3 with traditional spin-coating methods challenging.  27  Physical vapor deposition (PVD) has the advantage of not being constrained by solubility issues and produces films with desired stoichiometry and uniformity across large areas. Here, we investigate the incorporation of the vacuum-deposited CdS layer at the n-i interface (TiO 2 / perovskite) in thermal evaporated CsPbBr 3 . In the past, CdS based passivation has been reported by incorporating CdS in perovskite precursor  28, 29  and ETL; 30 however, they were all solution-processed with organic-inorganic PSCs. In this work, we report a vacuum-deposited interface passivation strategy by ETL interfacial surface engineering. We have achieved an open circuit voltage of >1.7 V, the highest for vacuum-deposited CsPbBr 3 PSCs. Moreover, we demonstrate that the bandgap of the perovskite film depends not only on its composition but also on the substrate on which the film is grown. This allows us to achieve high V oc without changing the perovskite composition. 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We fabricated CsPbBr 3 PSC devices on compact TiO 2 (c-TiO 2 , planar architecture) and c-TiO 2 /mesoporous TiO 2 (m-TiO 2 ) substrates. For n-layer interface engineering, a thin layer of cadmium sulfide (CdS) was thermally evaporated on top of the TiO 2 films before the evaporation of the CsPbBr 3 film. Figures  2 (a ) and (c) show the SEM images of CsPbBr 3 film deposited on planar c-TiO 2 and c-TiO 2 /CdS substrates, respectively. The grain size distribution is also plotted below the respective SEM images in Figure  2  (b) and (d). It is evident from the image that there is a significant increase in the grain size of CsPbBr 3 on c-TiO 2 /In CdS compared to that of the control film (CsPbBr 3 on planar c-TiO 2 ). The bright spots in Figure  2  (a) correspond to the presence of excess Pb in the perovskite absorber layer, which is commonly used for passivation in PSCs. However, it is interesting to note that there is less concentration of excess Pb on the surface of the perovskite deposited on c-TiO 2 /CdS; this can be attributed to a change in the phase of CsPbBr 3 discussed in the subsequent section. Nevertheless, both films exhibit uniformity, as seen in the low-magnification images shown as an inset of SEM images. Figure  3  (a) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of the CsPbBr 3 film deposited on top of the c-TiO 2 and c-TiO 2 /50 nm CdS layer, respectively. The control CsPbBr 3 film shows characteristic peaks at 15.18°and 30.64°, corresponding to (100) and (  200 ) planes, respectively (PDF 00-054-0752), confirming the cubic phase of α-CsPbBr 3 . However, with CsPbBr 3 deposited on a 50 nm CdS layer, we observe additional peaks at 22.8°and 26.42°corresponding to (110) and (111) planes of the cubic phase, respectively. Moreover, additional peaks appear at 24.18°, 25.16°, 37.84°, and 44.5°c orresponding to the (120), (  103 ), (312), and (041) planes of the orthorhombic phase of CsPbBr 3 , respectively (PDF 01-090-0380). To obtain insights about interfacial strain distribution, grazing incident angle XRD (GI-XRD) was performed at different incident angles. Figure  3 (c ) and (d) shows (100) peaks of control CsPbBr 3 and CdS/CsPbBr 3 , respectively. It can be observed that there is a shift toward higher 2θ with a lower grazing incident angle. This indicates the increase in the crystal plane distance in the perpendicular direction of the ETL surface (nλ = 2d sin θ). The d-spacing with the grazing incident angle is plotted in Figure  3 (b) . The shift in this diffraction peak is less pronounced with the CdS interface, suggesting a reduction in the tensile strain at the interface of ETL and CsPbBr 3 . This reduction in tensile strain is expected to decrease strain-induced lattice distortion.  33  Film morphology and crystallinity enhancements are anticipated to improve the effective charge transport and photovoltaic performance of the device. To investigate the chemical states of the CsPbBr 3 film, XPS analysis was performed. The survey scan of CsPbBr 3 films deposited on TiO 2 and CdS is shown in Figure  4 (a) . The Cs 4d core level at 78 and 75.9 eV is depicted in Figure  4 (b) ; it also features a broad peak centered around 69.1 eV, corresponding to the Br 3d core level. The two Pb 4f peaks at 138.8 and 143.7 eV corresponding to Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 core levels, respectively, are shown in Figure  4 (c) . It is important to note that both the control and CsPbBr 3 deposited on CdS have identical spectra and maintain the same stoichiometric elemental ratio. Figure  5  (a) shows the UV-vis absorbance of the CsPbBr 3 film on planar c-TiO 2 and c-TiO 2 /CdS substrates. The control CsPbBr 3 film on planar c-TiO 2 shows a characteristic absorption onset at 527 nm, corresponding to the 2.35 eV band gap. The band gap increases to 2.39 eV with a 20 nm CdS layer and 2.40 eV with a 30 nm CdS layer. With CsPbBr 3 deposited on a 50 nm CdS layer, there is a significant shift in the absorption onset, and the band gap changes to 2.43 eV. This increase in band gap can be attributed to the presence of orthorhombic phases as observed from XRD. It has been reported that the orthorhombic phase of CsPbBr 3 has a higher band gap compared to cubic CsPbBr 3 .  34, 35  The band gap increase in CsPbBr 3 is directly related to the thickness of the CdS layer underneath; a thicker CdS layer results in a higher band gap. This can be correlated to an increase in the orthorhombic phase of CsPbBr 3 . Figure  5  (b) shows the steady state PL of the CsPbBr 3 film on planar c-TiO 2 and c-TiO 2 /CdS substrates. With the CsPbBr 3 film on c-TiO 2 /CdS, there is a blue shift of approximately 12 nm, which aligns with the observed band gap increase from UV-vis spectra. Additionally, there is PL intensity enhancement with perovskite film on the CdS interface. This PL intensity enhancement suggests the reduction in nonradiative recombination, likely due to the suppression of surface defects. Figure  6  (a) shows the light J-V curve of CsPbBr 3 devices fabricated on control (c-TiO 2 ), c-TiO 2 /CdS, and c-TiO 2 /m-TiO 2 /CdS ETLs. There is a significant increase in V oc from 1.59 V for the control device to 1.7 V for the device fabricated on the c-TiO 2 /m-TiO 2 /CdS ETL without losing much J sc . This increase in voltage with the CdS interface can be directly correlated to the increase in the band gap of the CsPbBr 3 . The device performance parameters are listed in Table  1 . The slightly improved device performance with the mesoscopic TiO 2 device can be attributed to the increased interface contact area and better charge-transfer rate compared to compact c-TiO 2 .  36, 37  It is noteworthy to mention that the 0.06 eV increase in band gap with introducing the CdS layer translates to ∼0.1 V V oc improvement; this suggests an overall reduction in the voltage loss in the device. Figure  6 (b)  shows the Incident-Photon-to-Current Efficiency (IPCE) of these devices. The IPCE onset shifts toward lower wavelength with devices fabricated on the CdS interface, and this shift is consistent with the increase in band gap observed from UVvis absorbance analysis. The increase in the IPCE in the 400-500 nm range with the CdS interface can be attributed to the  reduction in bulk defects of the perovskite absorber enhancing the photogenerated charge excitation and collection. To obtain insight into the recombination inside the devices, light-intensity-dependent J-V characteristics were measured. The V oc of the solar cell can be expressed as V oc = (nK B T/q) × 2.303 log(I) + constant, where n is ideality factor, K B is Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, q is elementary charge, and I is the intensity of light. The slope of V oc versus log (I) can be used to calculate the ideality factor of the solar cell. In the absence of trap-assisted recombination, the slope should be K B T/q. Figure 6 (c) shows the dependence of V oc on the light intensity in the devices fabricated on the control (FTO/ cTiO 2 ) substrate and 20 nm CdS on m-TiO 2 (FTO/cTiO 2 / mTiO 2 /CdS). It was observed that PSC with a CdS interface exhibits lower slope of 1.56 K B T/q compared to 2.18 K B T/q for control PSC, suggesting reduction in recombination with CdS interface modification.  38  Figure  6  (d) shows a J sc ∝ I α graph depicting the dependence of J sc on the light intensity, revealing that the exponent α is closer to 1 for devices with CdS interface modification. This suggests a reduction in bimolecular recombination and efficient charge extraction.  39  We performed a subgap quantum efficiency (QE) across the long-wavelength edge to determine the energy band tail states and extracted the Urbach energy as shown in Figure  6  (e) and (f). In the long-wavelength edge with almost constant reflectance, the QE can be expressed as QE = C + hν/E u , where E u is Urbach energy, hν is the photon energy, and C is a constant. Urbach energy is estimated from the linear edge of the log of external quantum efficiency with respect to photon energies, and it is one of the key factors affecting the V oc in solar cells. A high Urbach energy indicates that defect states extend further into the band gap, resulting in increased recombination and , therefore, pinning the quasi-Fermi levels under illumination and limiting the V oc .  9, 40, 41  Additionally, the subgap QE measurement can reveal the midgap defect states in the device, which can be fitted with a Gaussian distribution. To accurately determine the Urbach energy, the effect of midgap states should be subtracted from the original curve as shown in the above-mentioned figures. The measured Urbach energy for the control CsPbBr 3 device on the c-TiO 2 substrate is 25 meV, which drops down to 22 meV with the device with the TiO 2 / CdS substrate. This reduction in Urbach energy further substantiates the improvement in perovskite devices with the CdS interface. Figure  6  (g) shows the statistical distribution of V oc of the CsPbBr 3 PSCs fabricated with control TiO 2 and with a CdS interface. Devices incorporating the CdS interface exhibited a significantly higher V oc compared with the control devices. Specifically, the median V oc for control devices was 1.59 V, while for devices with the CdS interface it increased to 1.69 V. It is important to highlight that the incorporation of a 20 nm CdS layer results in a 0.06 eV band gap shift, which corresponds to an approximate 0.1 V increase in the opencircuit voltage (V oc ). However, this improvement in V oc cannot be attributed solely to the band gap change. The enhanced V oc is also a result of several other factors, including the improved quality of the perovskite film, observed by larger grain sizes, as  well as the reduction of both grain boundary-mediated recombination and bimolecular recombination. This enhancement in V oc contributed to an improved overall device performance. To obtain further insights into the change in CdS interface thickness on the performance of PSCs, devices with different thicknesses of CdS on c-TiO 2 and m-TiO 2 are fabricated. These light J-V data are shown in Figure  7  (a) and (b), respectively. The IPCE data of the device fabricated with CdS on c-TiO 2 and m-TiO 2 is shown in Figure  7 (c)  and (d) , respectively. The data indicated an apparent increase in the band gap with the increase in the thickness of CdS as observed from the IPCE cutoff wavelength. In each case, devices fabricated on m-TiO 2 perform better than those fabricated on c-TiO 2 . This improved performance can be attributed to the superior charge-transfer rate offered by m-TiO 2 compared to that of c-TiO 2 . The optimal thickness of the CdS interface layer was 20 nm; thicknesses exceeding 20 nm resulted in inferior device performance, attributed in part to increased absorbance loss with a thicker CdS layer. The increase in quantum efficiency when using the appropriate CdS layer can be potentially attributed to improvements in interface properties at the n-layer/perovskite interface, a conclusion supported by the lowering of the n value  in the device I-V curve vs intensity data shown in Figure  6  (c). In Table  2 , we show the device performance for various thicknesses of the CdS interlayer. 
 EXPERIMENTAL SECTION 3.1. Materials. The FTO coated glass substrate was purchased from Delta Technologies. Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (97%) and diethylamine (≥99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. CsBr (99.999%) and PbBr 2 (99.999%, ∼10 mesh beads) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The CdS evaporation source was purchased from Stanford Advances Materials. P3HT was purchased from 1-Materials. 3.2. Solar Cell Fabrication. The devices were fabricated in an n-ip planar junction structure, where the light is incident from the n-side. The perovskite material was deposited on a TiO 2 /FTO substrate with CdS layer interposed between the TiO 2 layer and the perovskite layer. A compact TiO 2 (c-TiO 2 ) film was prepared by mixing 0.5 M titanium isopropoxide with 0.5 M diethylamine in an isopropanol solution. This solution was spin-coated onto an FTO substrate at 7000 rpm for 30 s. The coated substrate was then annealed at 500 °C for 2 h. A mesoporous TiO 2 (m-TiO 2 ) layer was deposited by spincoating a diluted paste of Dyesol 18NR-T (prepared by adding 1845 mg of anhydrous ethanol to 307.5 mg of the paste) at 5000 rpm for 30 s. This layer was subsequently annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. A thin layer (10-50 nm) of CdS was evaporated on top of the TiO 2 layers using thermal evaporation at a substrate temperature of 200 °C. The CdS layer was then annealed at 400 °C for 30 min. The perovskite layer was deposited using thermal evaporation by a sequential deposition method from CsBr and PbBr 2 sources, with the PbBr 2 layer being sandwiched between two CsBr layers. The total thickness of the perovskite film was 650 nm. After deposition, the layers were annealed at 450 °C for 20 min, followed by 40 min at 350 °C. The perovskite layer deposition sequence is discussed in our previous work.  9  The player, consisting of P3HT, was spin-coated onto the perovskite layer and annealed at 125 °C. Finally, 50 nm of gold was deposited on the device by using a thermal evaporator with a circular mask, defining an active area of 0.106 cm 2 . 3.3. Characterizations. The morphology of the deposited perovskite layer was obtained from the FEI Quanta-FEG 250, USA field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted using a Siemens D500 X-ray diffractometer, Germany, with a Cu Kα radiation source. Kratos Amicus XPS system, Japan, was used to obtain XPS spectra. An ABET full-spectrum AM1.5 solar simulator, USA, along with a Keithley 236 Source-Measure Unit, USA, was employed to evaluate the electrical performance of solar cells. Quantum efficiency (QE) was assessed by using a custom-built system that incorporated a chopped monochromatic light source, optical filters, and lock-in amplifiers synchronized with the chopped source. 
 CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, our study demonstrates interfacial engineering by incorporating a thin CdS layer to overcome the high voltage loss in all-inorganic CsPbBr 3 perovskite solar cells. This ndoped interfacial layer assists in the formation of larger perovskite grains, reduces grain boundary recombination centers, minimizes bulk defects, and enhances charge extraction efficiency. As a result, we achieved a high V oc of 1.7 V, the highest reported for this material using vacuum deposition. We observed a phase transition in the perovskite from cubic to orthorhombic when grown on the CdS layer and  found that the band gap of the perovskite film is influenced not only by its composition but also by the interfacial layer at the substrate. Notably, the 0.06 eV increase in band gap with the introduction of the CdS layer corresponds to an approximately 0.1 V improvement in V oc , indicating an overall reduction in voltage loss within the device. We also observe higher quantum efficiency and a lower n value for the diode factor when an appropriate thickness of the interfacial CdS layer is used, suggesting a reduction in interfacial recombination at the nlayer/perovskite interface. This work provides the conduit for vacuum-based defect passivation for all vacuum-based inorganic perovskite devices. Figure 1 ( 1 a) shows the fabricated device schematic, and the PSC's energy band diagram with the incorporation of the CdS layer is shown in Figure 1 (b). The energy levels of CdS and CsPbBr 3 are taken from refs 31 and 32, respectively. The favorable energy band alignment with CdS incorporation provides an intermediate energy level and is expected to assist in efficient electron collection from the conduction band.
