Large-Grain Double Cation Perovskites with 18 μs Lifetime and High Luminescence Yield for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells
Recent advancements in perovskite solar cell performance were achieved by stabilizing the α-phase of FAPbI 3 in nip-type architectures. However, these advancements could not be directly translated to pin-type devices. Here, we fabricated a high-quality double cation perovskite (MA 0.07 FA 0.93 PbI 3 ) with low bandgap energy (1.54 eV) using a two-step approach on a standard polymer (PTAA). The perovskite films exhibit large grains (∼1 μm), high external photoluminescence quantum yields of 20%, and outstanding Shockley-Read-Hall carrier lifetimes of 18.2 μs without further passivation. The exceptional optoelectronic quality of the neat material was translated into efficient pin-type cells (up to 22.5%) with improved stability under illumination. The low-gap cells stand out by their high fill factor (∼83%) due to reduced charge transport losses and short-circuit currents >24 mA cm -2 . Using intensity-dependent quasi-Fermi level splitting measurements, we quantify an implied efficiency of 28.4% in the neat material, which can be realized by minimizing interfacial recombination and optical losses.
H alide perovskites offer exciting opportunities to efficiently harvest the energy from the sun either in single junction solar cells or in combination with well-established photovoltaic (PV) technologies as tandem devices.  1  The materials family with chemical structure ABX 3 is intrinsically low-cost, can be easily processed from either solution or low-temperature evaporation, and thus shows significant potential for commercial-scale applications.  2  Halideperovskite-based solar cells are fabricated typically by sandwiching a roughly 500 nm thick perovskite absorber layer between two charge transport layers (TLs), either in the nip-or pin-structure, depending on the arrangement of the pand n-type TL. While perovskite solar cells were first demonstrated in a nip-configuration in a dye-sensitized solar cell,  3  solid-state perovskite cells were established soon afterward in both nip-and pin-structures.  4, 5  Both architectures have been intensively investigated over the last 10 years with nip-cells yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 20% in 2015,  6  which was achieved with the pin-type in 2017.  7, 8  This achievement was attributed mainly to the introduction of various cations and halides into the perovskite lattice. For example, formamidinium (FA), Cs, and Rb have been proposed as alternative or additional cations.  9, 10  At the same time, Br was used in addition to I to tune the band gap energy  10, 11  and to increase the tolerance to oxidation,  12  among other reasons. After passing the 20% PCE landmark, efforts to lower the bandgap of the mixed perovskite compositions have been ramped up to optimize the trade-off between photon absorption and thermalization losses.  13  For lead halide perovskites, this was achieved by increasing the molar concentration of formamindium lead iodide (FAPI).  [13] [14] [15] [16]  We note that incorporation of tin, in particular, mixed Pb/Snbased perovskites, enables much lower bandgaps (∼1.2 eV);  17, 18  however, here, we focus on Pb-based perovskites. Notably, pure FAPbI 3 suffers from the presence of a photoinactive, hexagonal ""yellow"" δ-phase, which is more stable at room temperature compared to the trigonal black αphase.  19  However, these problems were mitigated through various approaches. For example, small amounts of Cs, 20 methylammonium (MA),  15, 21  or MAPbBr 3  13, 16, 22  were used to stabilize the α-phase of FAPbI 3 . In other works, Cl was added to improve the nucleation and crystallization processes, which improved the performance and reproducibility.  [22] [23] [24]  Altogether, these efforts allowed impressive PCE improvements (e.g., 23% in 2018,  16  above 24% in 2019,  25  and 25.5%  26  today) and also led to improved device stabilities, likely due to a decrease of the molar concentration of Br and MA. Compared to one of the best cells in 2016 (ref 9) with a short-circuit current-density (J SC ) of 22.8 mA cm -2 , the performance improvement in the above publications was largely due to a significant J SC increase, e.g., 26.7 mA cm -2 was achieved in ref 25. Most of the top-performing nip-type cells employed perovskites with a molar FAPI concentration of 95% or even more,  13, 16, 22, 23, 25  delivering short-circuit currents of ≥25 mA cm -2 , underlining the importance of lowering the bandgap toward the optimum regime in the Shockley-Queisser (S.-Q.) limit (1.1-1.4 eV). Interestingly, however, these improvements were all achieved in nip-type cells. Similar efforts to lower the bandgap in pin-type cells were not quite as successful. This resulted in a slower increase of the PCE (e.g., 20.4% in 2017  8  to 20.9%  27  in 2018), with only two recent examples with a certified PCE above 22%.  28, 29  In the latter publication, Zheng et al.  29  showed that addition of long surface-anchoring alkylamine ligands promotes favorable grain orientation, which improved the p e r f o r m a n c e o f t r i p l e c a t i o n p e r o v s k i t e s Cs 0.05 (FA 0.92 MA 0.08 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.92 Br 0.08 ) 3 with a bandgap of 1.56 eV as obtained from a Tauc plot. Nevertheless, the J SC (24.1 mA cm -2 ) was slightly lower than in the above-mentioned record nip-type cells (≥25 mA cm -2 ). Similarly, in ref 30, the fabricated low-gap (1.55 eV) double cation/double halide MA 5 FA 95 Pb(I 95 Br 5 ) 3 pin-type cell had a comparatively low J SC (23.5 mA cm -2 ). This raises the important question as to why the formation of low-gap (∼1.53 eV) perovskites with a FAPI concentration of roughly 95% did not yield similar performance improvements in pin-type cells. Clearly, the lower J SC could be related to an imperfect film formation on standard ptype transport layers, such as PTAA or polyTPD, resulting in an inferior perovskite morphology. However, it may also be conceivable that the overall lower performance is related to a higher concentration of interfacial defects and/or due to a more unfavorable energetic alignment between the FA-rich perovskites and the transport layers typically employed in pintype cells, causing more open-circuit voltage (V OC ) losses.  31, 32  Being able to exploit the full potential of almost pure FAPI perovskites in a pin-architecture would greatly increase the possibilities to fabricate efficient and stable perovskite cells as recently demonstrated.  29, 33  Moreover, pin-cells typically require only very thin TLs, e.g., 8 nm of PTAA as a hole TL and 20-30 nm of C 60 as an electron TL  8  or ultrathin (∼1 nm) self-assembled monolayers (ref 30), without the need for chemical-doping or high-temperature treatments during fabrication (100-150 °C). In the present work, we fabricated FA-rich (93%) low-gap double cation pin-type perovskite cells with short-circuit currents of up to 25 mA cm -2 , which are significantly larger than in comparable triple cation perovskite cells. The double cation perovskite is thereby fabricated via a two-step process on a conventional PTAA p-type layer, which resulted in large grains with an average diameter of nearly 1 μm. The resulting perovskite cells enabled not only significant short-circuit current-density (J SC ) improvements but also exceptional fill factors (FFs) of up to 83%. To investigate the reason behind these high fill factors, we measured the FF in the absence of transport limitations via light-intensity-dependent open-circuit voltage measurements. The results demonstrated that the better FF in the double cation perovskite cells is a direct consequence of the optimized charge transport compared to the triple cation cell. Despite these promising results, compared with the radiative V OC limit, the open-circuit voltage losses in the double cation cells were quite significant (∼170 mV). To analyze the recombination losses, we quantified the quasi-Fermi level splitting in various stack layers of the cells following a previously reported approach. We find that both transport layers induce large recombination losses at the p-and the n-interfaces, which exceed the bulk recombination by a factor of 150 in the case of the perovskite/electron TLinterface. Nevertheless, the neat material exhibits an outstanding external photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 20% with an unprecedented charge carrier lifetime of 18 μs. Using intensity-dependent quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) measurements, we quantify a large efficiency potential (implied PCE) of 28.4% in the neat material, and we discuss the necessary steps to realize this potential. Following our recent work on triple cation (TC) perovskite solar cells in a pin-structure, with PTAA and C 60 as hole and electron transport layer, respectively, we first aimed to lower the bandgap to optimize the trade-off between photocurrent collection and thermalization losses. Our reference triple cation p e r o v s k i t e h a s a n o m i n a l c o m p o s i t i o n o f Cs 0.05 (FA 0.83 MA 0.17 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 with a bandgap of 1.63 eV, which we call here 83:17 triple cation.  10  We note that in the literature, different approaches exist to estimate the bandgap of a semiconductor.  34  Here, we follow the method proposed by Kirchartz et al.  35  by taking the peak of the derivative of the EQE. However, we note bandgaps obtained from the Tauc plot result in nearly identical values. Using experimentally measured input parameters, such as the recombination rate constants in the perovskite, interface recombination velocities (S = 100 and 2000 cm/s at the PTAA-and C 60 -interfaces, respectively) and bulk lifetime (τ bulk = 500 ns), energy levels, mobilities, and the perovskite density of states, we were recently able to model these solar cells.  36  In particular, we could reproduce the ideality factor  37  and previously determined interfacial and bulk recombination currents in the 83:17 triple cation cell.  31  Based on this set of simulation parameters, we varied the bandgap of the absorber layer by keeping the energy levels of the transport layers aligned with the perovskite. The results are shown in Figure  1a . Interestingly, for all simulations with realistic recombination properties and as well for optimized recombination parameters (S = 10 cm/s at both interfaces, τ bulk = 10 μs), we found that the optimum bandgap (∼1.36-1.53 eV) is considerably different than expected from the S.-Q. model (1.12-1.4 eV), as indicated by the dashed circles in Figure  1a . Therefore, a slight decrease of the bandgap with respect to methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI, 1.6 eV) would put the bandgap of the cell into an optimal regime for perovskites with finite and realistic recombination parameters. In order to lower the bandgap experimentally, we first increased the ratio of FAPbI 3 vs MAPbBr 3 to 95 and even 100% in triple cation cells Cs 0.05 (FA x MA y ) 0.95 Pb(I x Br y ) 3 by keeping the CsPbI 3 molar concentration at 5%. Doing so lowers the bandgap from 1.63 eV for the 83:17 triple cation to 1.57 eV for the 95:5 triple cation and 1.53 eV for the Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 PbI 3 (100:0 CsFA) perovskite as shown by the Tauc plots in the Supporting Information (Supplementary Figure  S1 ). Figure  1b  shows the obtained photovoltaic performance parameters. Unfortunately, we observe that the short-circuit current does not significantly increase with increasing FA content. In combination with the expected drop in open-circuit voltage with decreasing bandgap, the PCE continuously drops with increasing FAPI content. This rather unsuccessful attempt illustrates the above-mentioned challenges to achieve significant performance improvements in triple cation pin-type perovskite cells by lowering the bandgap <1.6 eV, although this does not mean that it is generally not possible.  28, 29  In order to overcome these limitations, we fabricated lowgap, FA-rich perovskite cells using a two-step fabrication process following the description in ref 22. In particular, Brfree MA 0.07 FA 0.93 PbI 3 double cation (DC) perovskites were prepared with a nominal molar FA concentration of 93%, without considering the MACl. Briefly, in this two-step process, the solution consisting of MA and FA cations is spin-coated on top of the PbI 2 layer, which forms the perovskite layer after the cations diffuse through the PbI 2 (all fabrication details are presented in the Supplementary Methods and a Supplementary Video). The sample is then annealed in air at a relative humidity of roughly 25%, which is critical for obtaining the high PLQY of the neat material, which will be discussed further below in detail (Supplementary Figure  S2 ). It is interesting to note that for this particular perovskite composition, cells based on the two-step interdiffusion method outperformed cells fabricated from identical precursors using a one-step solvent assisted process (Supplementary Figure  S3  and Supplementary Table  S1 ). We also found that adding Br to the double cation perovskite by replacing the MAI precursor with MABr, using otherwise the exact same recipe, did not improve the performance. Nevertheless, in this work, we do not aim to make general conclusions as to whether a double cation perovskite composition is better than a triple cation composition nor that a two-step process is generally better than a one-step process. To analyze the optoelectronic properties of the (two-step) DC system, we first characterized the optical properties of the perovskite absorber layer. Supplementary Figure  S1  shows the Tauc plot of the neat perovskite film, which demonstrates a bandgap of 1.54 eV, which is in agreement with the literature.  15  Notably, the bandgap is close to the Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 PI 3 perovskite (1.53 eV). As shown in Supplementary Figure  S4 , this is also consistent with the peak of the first derivative of the EQE (1.54 eV), which reflects the peak of bandgap distribution and confirms the comparatively low bandgap in the final cell. Moreover, the Urbach tail as estimated by an exponential fit to the EQE tails exhibits a value of 15 meV. The sharp absorption onset corresponds to low radiative recombination losses  38, 39  and underlines the high optoelectronic semiconductor quality suitable for solar cell applications. In the following and throughout the rest of the manuscript, we compare the fabricated double cation cells to 95:5 triple cation cells, as similar compositions [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 :(MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 ] (often without the CsI) have been recently employed in highperformance nip-type cells with PCEs above 23%.  13, 16, 22  As shown in Figure  2a ,b, the two-step process results in much larger apparent grains with an average circular grid diameter of 890 nm as compared to the 95:5 triple cation perovskite with an average disk diameter of 140 nm, which has been prepared by a one-step process. The corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters of the cells are shown in Figure  2c . Compared to the 95:5 triple cation cells, the short-circuit current is significantly higher (up to 25 mA/cm 2 ). Figure  2d  depicts the JV-characteristics of the current record device with a reverse-scan PCE of 22.5% and a forward-scan PCE of 21.8%. In reverse, the device demonstrates a comparatively high FF (82.9%), a high J SC (24.7 mA cm -2 ), and a V OC of (1.098 V). This PCE is slightly lower than the highest reported values for a pin-type structure (22.75% certified).  28  The corresponding external quantum efficiency measurement in the inset demonstrates that the integrated EQE-sun spectrum product (24.5 mA/cm 2 ) matches the J SC within a small error. Supplementary Figure  S5  demonstrates that the stabilized PCE of another high-efficiency cell matches closely the initial PCE. Despite these promising features, the V OC of the DC cell is similar to the TC cell, which however also implies that there is significant room for improvements. This point will be explored further below. Moreover, Figure  2e  shows the maximum power point tracking of a high-performance DC device under constant illumination at 27 °C in a nitrogen controlled atmosphere. The MPP exhibits a PCE above 95% of its initial value for ∼350 h. We note that the DC cell was not encapsulated with SnO 2 on top of C 60 , which can further improve the stability of pin-type cells.  29, [40] [41] [42]  In comparison to the triple cation cells, we found a quite similar stability under MPP conditions in the 95:5 triple cation cell; however, the 83:17 triple cation cells degraded significantly faster (Supplementary Figure  S6 ). Therefore, reducing the amount of MA and Brthereby decreasing the bandgap energyimproved the stability under continuous illumination, which is crucial for further perovskite solar cell development. However, this does not mean that Cs is detrimental for the stability. In order to assess the performance difference between the DC and TC systems, we first performed a comparative analysis of the factors determining the FF of the cell. Not counting the shunt resistance, there are three primary considerations affecting the fill factor.  43  These are (1) the series resistance limitation, which is quite small in our configuration (∼0.25 Ω cm -2 ), (2) the transport limitations due to insufficient mobilities, and (3) the nonradiative recombination losses that govern the dark current, hence also causing FF losses, beyond the fill factor in the radiative limit. To assess these parameters in the two systems, we measured the open-circuit voltage as a function of the illumination intensity (Figure  3a ), which resulted in an ideality factor of ∼1.4 for both cells. Note, the intensity-dependent V OC is equivalent to a seriesresistance-free dark JV-curve.  43  Adding the voltage-independent generation current-density to this dark curve creates a pseudo-JV curve that is only impacted by the nonradiative recombination processes in the cell, hence allowing the impact to be assessed independent of transport losses. This result, shown in Figure  3b  by the dashed lines and summarized in Table  1 , demonstrates that the obtained resistance-free pseudo fill factor (pFF) is around ∼86% in both systems. Notably, the device FF of the DC cell was above 83%, meaning the transport losses in the device are quite small. Interestingly, and as a comparison, the pFF of the 95:5 triple cation cell is also 86% with a device FF of 79%. This highlights similar nonradiative (or ideality factor related) FF losses in these two systems but more transport losses in the triple cation cells. Considering that the transport layers are the same in both cells suggests that the enhanced charge extraction in the double cation cells is related to a higher effective mobility in the DC absorber layer and/or to less charge carrier scattering at the grain boundaries. In order to investigate this, we first characterized the intragrain carrier mobilities in the double cation perovskite layer using time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy (TRTS). We note that charges move only very few nm in response to the THz pulse, and therefore, grain boundaries are not expected to affect the obtained TRTS mobility. These measurements reveal an intragrain mobility sum of ∼35 cm 2 / (V s) (Supplementary Figure  S7a ), which is typical for perovskites (e.g., a mobility sum of ∑μ ≈ 30 cm 2 /(V s) was recently obtained on a 77:23 triple cation perovskite with higher Br content 44 ). These observations indicate that it is likely transport barriers (probably grain boundaries) on larger length scales that are decisive for charge collection, FF, and J SC . Consistent with this, cross-section SEM images reveal larger grains along the vertical (z)-direction in the case of the double cation film, while the grains appears to be broken in the zdirection in the case of the 95:5 triple cation film (Supplementary Figure  S8 ). In addition, using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the THz mobility would be sufficient to avoid charge transport losses in the case of the double cation perovskite. In this case, the charge extraction is then limited by the low mobility in the PTAA layer (Supplementary Figure  S7b ).  8  Finally, we also note that the improved J SC in the double cation cell is likely also a result of the improved collection considering that EQE of the double cation cell is significantly higher than in the 95:5 cell across the whole spectrum (Supplementary Figure  S9 ). Moreover, the double cation has a lower bandgap as compared to our 95:5 cell and has a larger active layer thickness, both of which contribute to the enhanced J SC . Knowing that the V OC is lowered by a nonradiative recombination loss of ∼170 mV in the DC perovskite, we further investigated the devices by measuring the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the individual components of the cell following a previous reported approach.  45  To this end, we prepared different stacks composed of the neat material on glass (""neat""), the perovskite with the electron transport layer (ETL) or the hole transport layer (HTL) attached and the perovskite sandwiched between both TLs (optical pin-stack), and finally a complete cell (with contacts). All samples were illuminated with a 520 nm wavelength laser through the glass or glass/PTAA (PTAA is the less absorbing compared to the ETL). As shown in Figure  4a , in both DC and TC systems, the highest PLQY was obtained in the neat material (2.6% in TC and 20.2% in DC). Notably, as shown in Figure  4b , the high PLQY in the double cation perovskite correlates with a Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) decay time of 18.2 μs in the monoexponential regime, which is superimposed by bimolecular (second-order) recombination at higher excitation fluences and carrier densities up to ∼10 16 cm -3 . We note that the monoexponential TRPL decay time is the minority carrier SRH lifetime in the low-level injection regime, while it is the average electron hole ). We note that a higher shunt resistance is observed in the double cation cell at intensities <10 -3 suns. (b) V OC (I) allows a seriesresistance-free pseudo-JV curve (dashed lines) to be created to estimate the contribution of nonradiative and transport losses to the total fill factor (FF) loss. In comparison to the TC cell, the DC cell has a lower transport loss (i.e., better charge extraction) as visible from the difference of the actual JV curve (solid lines) and the pseudo-JV curve from V OC (I); see also Table  1 . We note that the contribution of nonradiative FF losses is similar in both systems, which is given by the difference between the JV curve in the radiative S.-Q. limit (dotted lines) and the pseudo-JV curves. SRH lifetime in the high-injection regime.  46, 47  Supplementary Figure  S10  shows the initial TRPL amplitude versus the generated carrier density and excitation fluence (nJ cm -2 ), which reveals a switch from low-to high-level injection at a carrier density of around 4 × 10 13 cm -3 . Hence, the background (doping) carrier density is expected to be similar to this value.  47  To our knowledge, this is the longest reported lifetime in the literature with an optical transient measurement. We note a decay time of 8.8 μs have been previously demonstrated for trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) passivated MAPI films. 48 However, to our knowledge, such wellpassivated MAPI/TOPO samples with such long lifetimes have not yet been successfully implemented in devices as TOPO likely impedes charge carrier transfer and/or extraction. Therefore, the double cation absorber layers fabricated here stand out, as they do not require further passivation with (d) Current-density vs voltage (JV) and pseudo-JV (pJV) characteristics obtained from intensity-dependent V OC (I) and QFLS measurements of double cation cells (black line) and partial solar cell stacks (neat material, PTAA/perovskite, perovskite/C 60 , pin-stack). The implied PCE of the neat material is marked (28.4%). (e) Loss mechanism in the double and 95:5 triple cation perovskite cells due to short-circuit current losses (difference between the measured J SC and the J SC with an average EQE of 95%), insufficient charge transport and mobility (as discussed in Figure  3b  or Table  1 ), interface recombination (the difference between the implied efficiency of the neat material and the pinstack), and efficiency potential losses in the neat material with respect to the 95% of the S.-Q. limit. The graph demonstrates that the challenge to realize the PCE potential of the neat double cation material relies largely on the ability to suppress the nonradiative recombination at the interfaces. additional chemicals and can be directly employed in highperformance pin-type cells. In comparison, the lifetime in the neat 95:5 triple cation film is ""only"" 1 μs (Supplementary Figure  S11 ). A further comparison to lifetimes obtained in literature can be found in Supplementary Figure  S12  and Supplementary Table  S2 . In order to better under the reason for the improved carrier lifetime in the double cation perovskite, we performed additional cathodoluminescence measurements, which allow the emission to be resolved with high spatial resolution (∼10-50 nm) yet require a high equivalent carrier generation rate (∼10 5 suns). As shown in Supplementary Figure  S13 , these measurements reveal nonradiative recombination primarily at the grain boundaries in the neat double cation perovskite. Therefore, the differences in the apparent grain size between both perovskites (∼890 vs 140 nm, Figure  2a ) might be related to the difference in the lifetimes of the two systems. Calculating the surface recombination velocity at the grain boundaries (S) via the apparent grain size (d grain ) and the obtained lifetime (τ SRH ) in both systems S = d grain /2τ SRH 49 yields a value of S of ∼2.5 cm/s in the case of the DC perovskite and S ∼ 4.5 cm/s in the 95:5 triple cation perovskite. This analysis would suggest that the recombination speed at the grain boundaries is quite similar in both systems and that the different grain size in these two systems contributes to the difference in the lifetime. Nevertheless, this does not exclude the importance of the perovskite surface in determining the lifetime or the PL yield of the neat material. Despite the high quality of both neat films, the PLQY of the perovskite/C 60 junctions was significantly lower. In the case of TC, the PLQY of the neat material dropped from 2.6 to 0.22% upon the addition of C 60 , i.e., ∼12 times. In the case of DC, the PLQY dropped from 20 to 0.13%, i.e., approximately 150 times. This means that the nonradiative recombination at the C 60 -interface is much more pronounced in the large-grain DC system and exceeds the recombination in the neat DC material by more than 2 orders of magnitude. Notably, in the DC system, the losses at the p-interface are also significant (∼22× reduction of the PLQY compared to the neat), but in the case of the TC perovskite, these losses are minimal. Overall, for both the double and triple cation perovskite, the limiting interlayer is the C 60 -interface. To directly compare the opencircuit voltage potential in the individual stack layers to the V OC of the device, we quantified the QFLS of the stacks from the PLQY using = * k T J J QFLS ln(PLQY / ) B G 0,rad (1) where k B T is the thermal energy, J G is the generation currentdensity, and J 0,rad is the radiative recombination current-density in the dark (see Supplementary Note 1 for more details). As shown in Figure  4c , the highest values were obtained for the DC neat material with a theoretical V OC of 1.23 V that could be obtained in the absence of recombination losses at the interfaces or electrodes. However, the QFLS of the perovskite/ C 60 stack is only 1.1 V, meaning that the voltage loss at the ninterface of the DC cell is as high as 130 mV. Nevertheless, the QFLS of the cell is similar to the corresponding V OC , indicating small energetic offsets between the perovskite and the transport layers and little recombination losses at the electrodes.  31  Having analyzed the primary V OC limitations in the neat perovskite film and at the interfaces, we further investigated the efficiency limiting mechanism across the power-generating JV regime. By using the same approach as shown above to create a pseudo-JV curve from the intensity-dependent V OC of the complete cell, we utilized the intensity dependence of the QFLS to measure the implied PCE of perovskite films on glass as shown in ref 43. To quantify the PCE potential of the neat film, we assume a certain short-circuit current-density that could be potentially reached in complete cells. To this end, we consider that an average EQE above the bandgap of 95% to be the short-circuit current limit of current state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells. Notably, this was already achieved in recent record nip-type cells, with certified PCEs and shortcircuit currents.  23  Figure  4d  depicts these different pseudo-JV curves on partial DC solar cell stacks (neat perovskite, perovskite/TL bilayers, the pin-stack), as well as the JV curve in the S.-Q. limit in comparison to the actually measured JV curve under AM1.5G illumination. Table  2  and Figure  4e  show the calculated pseudo-PCE of each stack in comparison to the measured JV in both studied systems and the losses associated with interfacial charge transport and ""avoidable"" current losses below 95% of the J SC in the S.-Q. limit. We note that the internal quantum efficiency of the DC cell is near unity (Supplementary Figure  S14 ), which implies that the remaining J SC losses are of optical nature. For the neat material, we obtained an efficiency potential of 28.4%, which is the highest reported value for a perovskite material, slightly outperforming the previously reported PCE potential of a potassium passivated triple cation perovskite.  43  However, the perovskite in this study is significantly simpler, with a low amount of MA and without Br, which is beneficial in terms of stability (as also demonstrated above). Overall, the studied double cation composition combines multiple advantages in terms of stability and allows the fabrication of near-ideal solar cells close to the thermodynamic limit. Clearly, engineering of the interfaces and TLs is the most promising pathway to improve the opencircuit voltage and to realize the PCE potential of the neat material. In summary, in this work, we fabricated low-gap (1.54 eV), MA 0.07 FA 0.93 PbI 3 double cation perovskite solar cells in a pintype architecture via a two-step process. With an external PLQY of 20% under a 1 sun equivalent illumination condition and a record lifetime of 18.2 μs, the neat material exhibits an exceptional optoelectronic quality without the need for further passivation. The high PLQY and lifetime can be at least partially attributed to the large average grain size of nearly 1 μm. Compared with FA-rich triple cation perovskites (95:5), the fabricated cells stand out by their short-circuit current density of up to 25 mA cm -2 , their high fill factors reaching values above 83%, as well as significantly improved stability under continuous illumination and maximum power point tracking. A maximum PCE of 22.5% was reached, which is among the highest efficiencies for pin-type solar cells. Using intensity-dependent open-circuit measurements, we were able to pinpoint the FF enhancement in the DC system to an improvement of the charge transport efficiency. The rather large open-circuit voltage losses in the system can be traced back to a 150-fold reduction of the PLQY upon addition of the ETL on top of the perovskite, although the losses at the pinterface were also significant. Interestingly, the losses at the ninterface were significantly larger in the large-grain (∼1 μm) DC system as compared to the TC system with smaller grains (∼100 nm). Using intensity-dependent QFLS measurements, we quantified the implied PCE of the neat double cation layer to be 28.4%, therefore enabling the possibility to create nearideal single junction solar cells in terms of performance. This efficiency can be reached under the following conditions: (1) interfacial recombination losses are minimized with respect to bulk recombination losses, (2) an average EQE of 95% above the bandgap can be achieved through a reduction of optical losses, and (3) the hole transport layer mobility can be improved by roughly a factor of 10 to minimize the remaining charge transport losses. Therefore, these results rationalize the huge improvements that were recently achieved in nip-type cells and lay out a clear path for further advancements of pintype cells toward the radiative limit.

 Supplementary Methods Absolute Photoluminescence Measurements: Excitation for the PL imaging measurements was performed with a 520 nm CW laser (Insaneware) through an optical fibre into an integrating sphere. The intensity of the laser was adjusted to a 1 sun equivalent intensity by illuminating a 1 cm 2 -size perovskite solar cell under short-circuit and matching the current density to the under the sun 𝐽 SC simulator (e.g. 22.0 mA/cm 2 at 100 mWcm -2 , or 1.375x10 21 photons m -2 s -1 for a 83-17 triple cation perovskite cell). A second optical fiber was used from the output of the integrating sphere to an Andor SR393i-B spectrometer equipped with a silicon CCD camera (DU420A-BR-DD, iDus). The system was calibrated by using a halogen lamp with known spectral irradiance, which was shone into to integrating sphere. A spectral correction factor was established to match the spectral output of the detector to the calibrated spectral irradiance of the lamp. The spectral photon density was obtained from the corrected detector signal (spectral irradiance) by division through the photon energy ( ), and the ℎ𝑓 photon numbers of the excitation and emission were obtained from numerical integration using Matlab. In a last step, three fluorescent test samples with high specified PLQY ( 70%) supplied from Hamamatsu Photonics where measured where the specified value could be accurately reproduced within a small relative error of less than 5%. 
 Intensity-dependent PL Measurements: The samples were illuminated in the integrating sphere as described above. A continuously variable neutral density filter wheel (ThorLabs) was used to attenuate the laser power in order to measure at different intensities which was monitored using an additional Si photodetector. The samples were illuminated at a given intensity for a variable illumination time using an electrical shutter. The illumination time was set to 1 second for the measurements shown in the main text, however different illumination times were tested which did not significantly impact the obtained ideality factor and pseudo fill factor values. After the specified illumination the PL spectra were recorded by averaging 30 spectra taken using a detector exposure time of 30 µs. Then the electrical shutter was closed, the filter wheel was moved to the next position and the steps were repeated. A custom-built Labview code was written to automate the measurement, and a Matlab code to automate the data evaluation. Device Fabrication of pin-type Cells: Substrates and HTL: Pre-patterned 2.5x2.5 cm 2 15 Ω/sq. ITO substrates (Automatic Research, Germany) were cleaned with acetone, 3% Hellmanex solution, DIwater and iso-propanol, by sonication for 10 min in each solution. After a microwave plasma treatment (3 min, 200 W), the samples were transferred to a N 2 -filled glovebox. The first layer was a PTAA (Sigma-Aldrich) layer with thickness of 8 nm was spin coated from a 2 mg mL -1 PTAA/toluene solution at 6000 rpm for 30 seconds. After 10 min annealing on a hotplate at 100 °C, the films were cooled down to room temperature and a 60 µL solution of PFN-Br (1-Material, 0.5 mg/mL in methanol) was deposited onto PTAA while the substrate was being spun (dynamic) at 4000 rpm for 30 s resulting in a film with thickness below the detection limit of our AFM (< 5 nm). No further annealing occurred. Perovskite solutions: For the double cation perovskite, 2 different solutions were prepared. The first solution was prepared by dissolving 1.5 M PbI 2 (TCI, 691.55 mg) in 1 mL DMF:DMSO (9:1 volume ratio, v:v). Then a solution containing the cations was prepared by dissolving FAI (Dyenamo, 90 mg), MAI (Lumtec, 6.4 mg) and MACl (Sigma-Aldrich, 9mg) in 1 mL Isopropanol (IPA). Both solutions were left under stirring overnight (14h) to completely dissolve the materials. We note that the addition of MACl improves the crystallization of the perovskite film but evaporates in the final annealing step.  1  The triple cation perovskite solution was prepared by mixing two 1.2 M FAPbI 3 and MAPbBr 3 perovskite solutions in DMF:DMSO (4:1 volume ratio, v:v) in a particular ratio (e.g. 95:5). The 1.2 M FAPbI 3 solution was thereby prepared by dissolving FAI (GreatCellSolar, 722 mg) and PbI 2 (TCI, 2130 mg) in 2.8 mL DMF and 0.7 mL DMSO which contains a 10 molar% excess of PbI 2 . The 1.2 M MAPbBr 3 solution was made by dissolving MABr (Dysol, 470 mg) and PbBr 2 (TCI, 1696 mg) in 2.8 mL DMF and 0.7 mL DMSO which contains a 10 molar% excess of PbBr 2 . Lastly, 40 of a 1.5 CsI (Sigma-Aldrich) solution in DMSO (389 µL mg CsI in 1 mL DMSO) was mixed with 960 of the above described mixture of FAPbI 3 and MAPbBr 3 µL resulting in a nominal perovskite stoichiometry of Cs 0.05 (FA 0.95 MA 0.05 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 , respectively. Perovskite film fabrication: For the double cation perovskite, a 2-step interdiffusion method was employed. The first step was the deposition of the PbI 2 layer. This was achieved by dropping 150 µL of the lead iodide solution in a N 2 -filled glovebox and spin-coating at 1500 rpm for 30 s, the films were then annealed at 70 °C for 1 min resulting in a yellow-transparent layer. We note that if the PbI 2 layers are left for too long before proceeding to the next step, the lead iodides appearance would change to a rougher yellow color and the performance of the complete devices would be substantially lower. Afterwards the formation of the perovskite was achieved by dropping 150 µL of the cation solution on top of the lead iodide layer which turned the film into a brown-transparent layer, then rapidly starting the spin-coating at 2500 rpm for 30 s, which resulted in a red film. This was followed by an annealing step at 150 °C for 15 min outside of the glovebox under ambient conditions (at a relative humidity of 25%) which resulted in a dark brown or black perovskite film. For the second-annealing step, a transport-box was used to transfer the samples out of the glovebox and in order to keep the layers in a nitrogen atmosphere right before the annealing on a preheated plate (150 °C). We note that as soon as the perovskite layers gets into contact with air, the crystallization and a phase-change process starts and we noticed that a rapid transfer to the hotplate directly after opening the transport-box was beneficial for the cell performance. A Supplementary Video is available on the publishers webpage that shows the critical fabrication steps. All triple cation perovskite films were deposited by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 40 s and 10 s after the start of the spinning process, the spinning substrate was washed with 300 µL ethylacetate for approximately 1 s (the anti-solvent was placed in the centre of the film). We note, that by the end of the spinning process the perovskite film turned dark brown. The perovskite film was then annealed at 100 °C for 1 h on a preheated hotplate where the film turned slightly more dark. ETL and Top Contact: After annealing, the samples were transferred to an evaporation chamber where fullerene-C 60 (Sigma-Aldrich, 30 nm), 2,9-Dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline BCP (Sigma-Aldrich, 8 nm) and copper (Sigma-Aldrich, 100 nm) were deposited under vacuum (p = 10 -7 mbar). The overlap of the copper and the ITO electrodes defined the active area of the pixel (6 mm 2 ). 
 Intensity-dependent Measurements: Steady-state intensity dependent measurements were 𝑽 𝐎𝐂 𝑉 OC obtained with a 445 nm continuous wave laser (Insaneware) providing a power of 1 W. A continuously variable neutral density filterwheel (ThorLabs) was used to attenuate the laser power (up to OD 6). The light intensity was thereby simultaneously measured with a silicon photodetector and a Keithley 485 to improve the accuracy of the measurement. The measurement was performed by measuring alternating the at a given intensity and a variable exposure time and then the for 1 second 𝑉 OC 𝐽 SC before the filterwheel rotated to the next position. A custom-built Labview code was written to automate the measurement. To check whether the reached steady-state conditions, the temporal 𝑉 OC evolution of the open-circuit voltage and the was recorded with a resolution of 200 ms. Moreover, 𝐽 SC the exposure time was varied after the value was taken at each intensity step. This did not lead to 𝑉 OC significant changes in the open-circuit voltage or the ideality factor in the relevant intensity regime from the maximum power point to the at 1 sun as shown previously. 2 𝑉 OC 
 Current Density-Voltage Characteristics: -curves were obtained in a 2-wire source-sense 𝐽𝑉 configuration with a Keithley 2400. An Oriel class AAA Xenon lamp-based sun simulator was used for illumination providing approximately 100 mW cm -2 of AM1.5G irradiation and the intensity was monitored simultaneously with a Si photodiode. The exact illumination intensity was used for efficiency calculations, and the simulator was calibrated with a KG5 filtered silicon solar cell (certified by Fraunhofer ISE). The obtained short-circuit current density ( ) is checked by integrating the 𝐽 SC product of the External Quantum Efficiency and the solar spectrum which matches the obtained 𝐽 SC within less than 3%. The temperature of the cell was fixed to 25 °C and a voltage ramp (scan rate) of 67 mV/s was used. 
 Maximum Power Point Tracking: The MPP was measured in a glovebox, using a white LED without UV set to a 1 sun equivalent power by matching the current density of the cell to the under the sun 𝐽 SC simulator. Every 20 seconds, the maximum power output of the cell was checked by varying the applied voltage by ±1 mV. The voltage corresponding to the higher power output was then applied to the cell until the voltage was checked again. The temperature was not controlled during the measurement, however the temperature of the cell did not significantly increase during the measurement ( 27 °C), which was measured with an infrared laser. Cathodoluminescence intensity maps were acquired by means of a Zeiss MERLIN SEM equipped with a SPARC system from Delmic. An aluminum parabolic mirror positioned above the sample focused the light into a photomultiplier tube (Thorlabs, PMT1001) outside the SEM chamber. We minimized the effect of beam damage by measuring under mild beam conditions (50 pA and 3.5 kV) and reduced electron dose (10 nm pixel size and 15 µs dwelling time per pixel). Yet the equivalent carrier generation rate is very high, on the order of 10 26 cm -3 s -1 . 
 Numerical Drift-Diffusion Simulations: The simulations were performed using SCAPS, an open-source code that can be obtained from  https://users.elis.ugent.be/ELISgroups/solar/projects/scaps  upon the conditions requested by the developers Marc Burgelman et al.  3  Simulation parameters are shown in a previous work.  4  Transient PL: TrPL measurements shown in the main text were carried out in a home-built setup using 660 nm excitation laser light from a supercontinuum light source (SuperK). We chose the longer wavelength excitation to avoid effects of charge diffusion from a high to low carrier density region. The excitation pulse had a repetition rate of 32 kHz and the PL emission was collected panchromatically through a photomultiplier and time-correlated single photon counting technique. The fluence was controlled with a tuneable neutral density filter and monitored with a power meter and increased from low to high injection conditions. The measured samples were never exposed to air and encapsulated around the corners of the of the 2.5 x 2.5 cm 2 large substrates using a commercial glue (Bluefixx) so that the glue was not in direct contact with the sample in the center. To minimize the impact of lateral diffusion on the results which may cause an early decay in the transient signal, we have defocused the laser spot to a circular shape with a diameter of 150 µm (where the boundaries are defined by an intensity drop to 1/e 2 as measured with a beam profilometer). Scanning Electron Spectroscopy: SEM images were acquired with a Zeiss Ultra Plus SEM. The grain size was estimated by using a circular test grid where the average diameter was taken as proxy of the grain size. Time-Resolved Terahertz Spectroscopy (TRTS): TRTS spectroscopy allows to measure the transient photo-excited sheet conductivity Δσ S and mobility sum µ ∑ = µ e +µ h of the electron mobility µ e and hole mobility µ h . The terahertz pulses are generated by optical rectification of 800 nm pulses in a ZnTe crystal and guided through the perovskite sample. The transmitted terahertz field T is then measured by electro-optical sampling in a second ZnTe crystal. Additionally, the perovskite samples are photoexcited by pump pulses with a wavelength of 400 nm and a pulse length of ≈150 fs. The photogenerated charge carriers alter the transmission of the terahertz probe pulse by ΔT, which is also detected. The derived pump-induced change in THz transmission ΔT/T is analyzed by the thin-film approximation in equation (  1 ) to obtain the photo-excited sheet conductivity Δσ S , which is the integral of the induced photoconductivity Δσ over the sample thickness d. The other parameters are the speed of light c, the permittivity of the vacuum ε 0 , and the terahertz refractive index of the substrates n sub , which is 1.95 for the used quartz glass substrate. (eq. 1) The transient of the photo-excited sheet conductivity is measured by scanning the delay of the pump pulse by an optical delay line. In this case, the terahertz pulse is sampled at its maximum. Additionally, the full terahertz pulse was scanned by a second delay line at a pump delay time of 10 ps. After both ΔT and T are Fourier-transformed, the photo-excited sheet conductivity spectrum is derived by Equation (1). The sum mobility spectrum is obtained by equation (2) from the photo-excited sheet conductivity, the flux of the pump beam of 7x10 11 photons/pulse/cm 2 , and the reflectance of the pump beam at 400 nm of 25%. The quantum yield of exciton dissociation in such mixed halide perovskites is approximately 1 at room temperature. , Σ𝜇 = 𝜇 e (𝑓,𝑡) + 𝜇 h (𝑓,𝑡) = The gained sum mobility is a spectrum at the frequencies from 0.5 to 2.5 THz, which constitute the terahertz probe pulse. The observed flat frequency-dependence in Figure  S5  indicates no significant difference between the measured terahertz mobilities and the DC-value, which is relevant for the device operation or carrier diffusion. Further details on the TRTS measurement can be found in ref.  5  8.8x10  -6  MAPI/TOPO DeQuilettes D. et al.    S2 . Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1. (a) Numerically simulated power conversion efficiency (PCE) versus band gap energy (E gap ) of the halide-perovskite absorber, assuming aligned electronic energy levels at the perovskite/transport layer-interface for cells with different recombination parameters in the bulk or interfaces (see main text). The dashed circles highlight the bandgap at the peak efficiency. The parameters of the simulation were optimized to describe 83:17 triple cation perovskites including several experimental findings. The trace corresponding to ""bimolecular-only"" considers only radiative recombination but imperfect light absorption and charge transport. (b) Photovoltaic performance parameters of triple cation perovskite solar cells with an increasing molar concentration of FAPbI 3 (FAPI) with respect to MAPbBr 3 , demonstrating a continuous drop in performance due to open-circuit voltage losses and a stagnating short-circuit current-density when decreasing the band gap energy from 1.63 to 1.57 eV. 
 Figure 2 . 2 Figure 2. (a,b) Scanning electron micrographs of double (DC) and triple cation (TC) perovskite films demonstrate a significantly larger apparent grain size in the case of DC (890 nm ±70 nm) as compared to the 95:5 triple cation perovskite (140 ± 14 nm). (c) The average photovoltaic performance parameters of the double cation perovskites highlight a comparatively high FF (81.5%), a high J SC (23.9 mA cm -2 ), and a similar V OC (1.079 V) compared to 95:5 TC perovskite cells. (d) The current-density vs voltage (JV) characteristics of the bestperforming DC perovskite cell demonstrates an efficiency of 22.5% (FF = 82.9%, J SC = 24.7 mA cm -2 , V OC = 1.098 V) in the reverse-scan direction and 21.8% in the forward-scan direction, while the inset shows the external quantum efficiency spectra with an integrated current of 24.5 mA cm -2 . (e) Maximum power point tracking under continuous light illumination (white LED, no UV) shows a relative PCE loss of around 5% after 350 h of operation, which highlights the substantial stability of the DC perovskite under continuous illumination. The initial PCE of the cell was around 21%. 
 Figure 3 . 3 Figure 3. (a) Intensity-dependent V OC (I) demonstrates a similar ideality factor in the double cation (DC) and triple cation (TC) cells (∼1.4). We note that a higher shunt resistance is observed in the double cation cell at intensities <10 -3 suns. (b) V OC (I) allows a seriesresistance-free pseudo-JV curve (dashed lines) to be created to estimate the contribution of nonradiative and transport losses to the total fill factor (FF) loss. In comparison to the TC cell, the DC cell has a lower transport loss (i.e., better charge extraction) as visible from the difference of the actual JV curve (solid lines) and the pseudo-JV curve from V OC (I); see also Table1. We note that the contribution of nonradiative FF losses is similar in both systems, which is given by the difference between the JV curve in the radiative S.-Q. limit (dotted lines) and the pseudo-JV curves.

(b) Intensity-dependent transient PL decay measured on a neat double cation film demonstrating a Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime (decay time) of 18.2 μs at all fluences. (c) QFLS corresponding to the PLQY of the different stacks shown in panel (a).(d) Current-density vs voltage (JV) and pseudo-JV (pJV) characteristics obtained from intensity-dependent V OC (I) and QFLS measurements of double cation cells (black line) and partial solar cell stacks (neat material, PTAA/perovskite, perovskite/C 60 , pin-stack). The implied PCE of the neat material is marked (28.4%). (e) Loss mechanism in the double and 95:5 triple cation perovskite cells due to short-circuit current losses (difference between the measured J SC and the J SC with an average EQE of 95%), insufficient charge transport and mobility (as discussed in Figure3bor Table1), interface recombination (the difference between the implied efficiency of the neat material and the pinstack), and efficiency potential losses in the neat material with respect to the 95% of the S.-Q. limit. The graph demonstrates that the challenge to realize the PCE potential of the neat double cation material relies largely on the ability to suppress the nonradiative recombination at the interfaces.

The resulting crude product was purified by column chromatography with gradient elution from DCM to DCM/EtOAc 9:1 to obtain 2 as a white solid (3.63 g, 55% yield). ).  1   1 Hz, 1H), 4.98 (t, J = 6.1 Hz, 1H), 4.74 (t, J = 5.8 Hz, 2H), 3.70 (q, J = 5.9 Hz, 2H), 1.38 (s, 9H). 
 2-(2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazol-2-yl)ethylammonium iodide (BTaI) HI (57%, unstabilized) was extracted three times with a 9:1 mixture of chloroform and tributyl phosphate to remove impurities. 1.11 mL (8.39 mmol) of this freshly extracted HI was then added with a micropipette to a solution of 2 (1.010 g, 3.81 mmol) in dioxane (25 mL), upon which the color of the mixture changed from colorless to yellow. The reaction mixture was flushed with Ar and was left to react at ambient temperature in the dark for 15 h. The mixture 
 5,6-difluoro-1H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (4) 3 (2.992 g, 20.8 mmol) was dispersed in water (100 mL) and acetic acid (2.4 mL, 42.0 mmol) and was heated under reflux. The mixture was then filtered over a glass filter; the filtrate was slowly cooled down to ambient temperature and was subsequently put in the fridge (5 °C). Meanwhile, sodium nitrite (1.674 g, 24.3 mmol) was dissolved in water (40 mL), and the resulting solution was also put in the fridge. After both solutions had been at 5 °C for 1 h, the sodium nitrite solution was poured into the diamine solution at 5 °C, after which it was slowly brought back to ambient temperature. A precipitate formed, which was filtered off after 1 h.

 2-(5,6-difluoro-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazol-2-yl)ethylamine, Boc protected (5) Boc-ethanolamine (1.203 g, 7.46 mmol) was weighed in a flame-dried 3-neck round-bottom flask, then 4 (1.034 g, 6.67 mmol) and triphenylphosphine (1.957 g, 7.46 mmol) were added. Dry diethyl ether (70 mL) was subsequently added, and the resulting dispersion was sonicated for 1 min to break down 3 to a fine powder. The dispersion was then brought under Ar atmosphere and cooled to 0 °C. DMEAD (1.747 g, 7.46 mmol) was dissolved in a small amount of dry diethyl ether and was added dropwise to the reaction mixture. After DMEAD had been added completely, the reaction mixture was slowly brought back to ambient temperature. The dispersion became a clear solution after about 10 minutes. After 18 h the reaction mixture was extracted with water, and the water fractions were combined and extracted with diethyl ether. The combined ether fractions were dried and filtered, and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting crude product was purified by column chromatography with gradient elution from DCM/EtOAc 9:1 to 8:2 to obtain 5 as an off-white solid (1.220 g, 61% yield). Also Boc-protected 2-(  HI (57%, unstabilized) was extracted three times with a 9:1 mixture of chloroform and tributyl phosphate to remove impurities. 778 µL (5.90 mmol) of this freshly extracted HI was then added with a micropipette to a solution of 5 (0.797 g, 2.68 mmol) in dioxane (10 mL), upon which the color of the mixture changed from yellow to orange. The reaction mixture was flushed with Ar and was left to react at ambient temperature in the dark for 15 h. The mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting solid was sonicated with diethyl ether, filtered, and washed several times with diethyl ether.

 2D perovskite thin films and single crystals 
 Materials: The synthesized organic salts were dried under high vacuum and were stored inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Lead(II) iodide (99.99%) was purchased from TCI Chemicals. Lead(II) bromide (99.998%) was purchased from Puratronic. Both lead salts were stored inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox. HBr (48% in water) was purchased from Fluorochem. HI (57% in water, distilled, unstabilized), tri-n-butyl phosphate (>99%), N,N-dimethylacetamide (99.5%, dried over molecular sieves) and propylene carbonate (99.5%) were purchased from Acros Organics; all other solvents were purchased from Fisher Scientific. 
 Thin films fabrication and characterization: Precursor solutions for thin-film synthesis were prepared by dissolving stoichiometric amounts of the corresponding lead halide and organic halide in a mixture of dry N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dry N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc). The amounts are depicted in Table  S1 . The precursor elements were dissolved at 50 °C and the resulting solutions were filtered through a syringe filter (0.2 µm pore size). The precursor solutions were spin coated on top of quartz substrates, which had been sonicated in dimethyl sulfoxide, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol respectively (15 min each) and had been treated by UV/ozone for 15 min. Spin coating and subsequent hotplate annealing were performed inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox (<1 ppm O2, <1 ppm H2O). Reference thin-films containing only the organic halide were spin coated by omitting the lead halide in the precursor and by drying at 80 °C after spin coating. The resulting perovskite thin-films were stored inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox and were only removed for analysis.  
 Solutions preparation: The SnO2 colloidal dispersion was diluted with 5 parts H2O. PCBA was dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene (0.2 mg mL -1 ). PbI2 (691.5 mg) was dissolved in DMF/DMSO 9:1 (v/v) (1 mL). FAI (90 mg) and MACl (9 mg) were dissolved in 2-propanol (1 mL). BTaX solutions were prepared by dissolving the salts in 2-propanol at concentrations of 1 or 10 mg mL -1 . Li-TFSI and Co-TFSI were dissolved in acetonitrile at concentrations of 500 mg mL -1 . Spiro-OMeTAD (40 mg) was dissolved in o-chlorobenzene (0.5 mL) to which tertbutylpyridine (14.3 μL) and Li-TFSI in acetonitrile (8.8 μL) were added, followed by addition of Co-TFSI in acetonitrile (10 μL) just before spin coating. Device fabrication: ITO was sputtered onto glass substrates with a thickness of 90 nm. Substrates were then cleaned by sonication in acetone (15 min), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (99%, Acros) soapy water (15 min), rinsed with deionized water, and then sonicated again in 2-propanol (15 min). Before spin coating, substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 30 min. SnO2 was spin coated at 2800 rpm for 60 s with 2000 rpm s -1 acceleration and annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. ITO/SnO2 substrates were then transferred to an N2-filled glovebox after treating them with UV-ozone for 15 min. PCBA was spin coated at 2000 rpm for 30 s with 2000 rpm s -1 acceleration and no annealing. PbI2 was spin coated at 1500 rpm for 30 s with 3000 rpm s -1 acceleration and annealed at 70 °C for 1 min. After cooling down, FAI/MACl were spin coated onto PbI2 layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s with 20,000 rpm s -1 acceleration and annealed at 150 °C for 1 min. The passivation layer was dynamically spin coated at 5000 rpm for 45 s. Afterwards, substrates were brought in ambient air and annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. Spiro-OMeTAD was spin coated at 2000 rpm for 50 s with 20,000 rpm s -1 acceleration. No annealing was performed. The layers were then doped in air for 20 min. 10 nm MoO3 and 100 nm Au were thermally evaporated in high vacuum. 100 nm MgF2 was thermally evaporated on the glass side as antireflective coating. 
 J-V characterization: A tungsten-halogen lamp combined with a daylight filter (Hoya LB120) and a UV-filter (Schott GG385) were used to simulate the solar spectrum. The light intensity was calibrated via a Si photodiode. The solar cell area was defined by a black shadow mask with an aperture of 0.0676 cm 2 or 0.1296 cm 2 . J-V measurements were performed with a Keithley 2400 source meter to sweep the voltage from -0.5 V (1.5 V) to 1.5 V (-0.5 V) at a scan rate of 0.25 V s -1 in both reverse and forward scan. Stability measurements were performed in an N2-filled glovebox by keeping the devices at the maximum power point voltage under 1sun illumination and tracking the photocurrent over time. Quasi-Fermi Level Splitting: Absolute photoluminescence spectroscopy was performed using a 455 nm LED (Thorlabs, M455F3-455 fiber coupled LED) source to excite the perovskite film through an optical fiber placed in an integrating sphere (Avantes, AvaSphere-30-REFL) fitted with a 550 nm short-pass filter (Edmund Optics). The excitation intensity was calibrated to 1sun equivalent intensity. The spectrum was measured through an optical fiber connected to a calibrated AvaSpec-HERO spectrometer (Avantes, AVASPEC-HSC1024X58TEC-EVO) using a 550 nm long-pass filter. 
 EQE characterization: Optical characterization: PL spectra were recorded by using an Edinburgh Instruments FLSP920 double-monochromator luminescence spectrophotometer. 
 X-Ray characterization: XRD patterns were recorded by using a Bruker 2D phaser (CuKα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å): measurements were performed in the range 3-40° with a step size 0.02° and collection time of 1 s. 2D GIWAXS measurements were performed with a Ganesha 300XL+ system from JJ X-ray equipped with a Pilatus 300K detector (pixel side 172 µm × 172 µm). The X-ray source was a Genix 3D Microfocus sealed tube X-ray Cu-source with integrated monochromator. The wavelength used was 1.5408 Å. The detector is in a vacuum chamber with sample-to-detector distance (SDD) of 515.4 mm, as calibrated using silver behenate (d001 = 58.380 Å). The angle-dependent 2D GIWAXS was conducted via controlling incidence angle from 0.1° to 0.5° with 0.1° interval. XPS measurements were performed using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha with a 180° double focusing hemispherical analyzer and a 128-channel detector. Monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation was used, and the X-ray spot size was 400 µm. For the surface analysis, a survey spectrum was first measured for 12 scans with a pass energy of 200 eV. High-resolution scan (20 times) of each element was conducted with a pass energy of 50 eV. During the sputtering experiment, the sample was removed layer-by-layer by argon ion etching operated at low current and low ion energy (1000 eV). The sputtering speed corresponds to 0.012 nm s -1 . The crater region generated by argon ions is ~2 × 4 mm 2 . For the depth profiles, snapshot mode was used for each element, and the number of frames was 5 × 1 s. For the depth profile of N 1s, high-resolution scans were used instead of snapshots (20 scans). Spectra were acquired with an iHR320 spectrometer (focal length of 320 mm, 150 gratings per mm blazed at 500 nm, 7000 µm entrance slit) coupled to an Andor 1024 px charge-coupled device (readout rate of 50 kHz, and 4× signal amplification). Measurements were performed at room temperature under a high vacuum. To prevent specimen damage before the measurement, beam focusing was performed away from the areas of interest. All maps were acquired at 3 kV acceleration voltage, 62.5 pA beam current, at 128x128 px resolution in 5.5-μm field of view and 23.8 ms/px acquisition time. These conditions were found to be the optimum balance between electron beam damage and spatial resolution. SE images were acquired after the hyperspectral mapping, at 1024×1024 px resolution and 10 μs/px dwell time. CL maps were background subtracted, processed, and analyzed in LumiSpy 0.2.  6  The artefacts caused by cosmic rays saturating the spectrometer were removed, and the edges of each map were cropped out as they tend to show edge effects and higher CL intensities. Energy bandpass-filtered images were formed by integrating CL intensity over specific energy ranges.

 ■ INTRODUCTION Perovskite solar cells based on formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) as an active layer have recently become a standard baseline to reach a high power conversion efficiency (PCE).  1  This material introduces new challenges in processing, mainly related to stabilizing the photoactive α-phase at room temperature, as the photoinactive δ-phase is thermodynamically more stable.  2, 3  Careful use of additive engineering and a variety of processing methods help to stabilize three-dimensional (3D) perovskite FAPbI 3 in a tetragonal phase with slight octahedral tilting,  4  paving the way for solar cells with narrower band gap compared to MAPbI 3 and with extremely low voltage losses.  [5] [6] [7] [8]  Currently, the state-of-the-art FAPbI 3 films make use of methylammonium chloride (MACl) as additive, with other notable cases using methylene diammonium dichloride.  1, [9] [10] [11] [12]  Such additives induce octahedral tilting, which inhibits the transformation to photoinactive δ-phase.  4  Additionally, these compounds are volatile; thus, they do not remain in the film after thermal annealing and do not impact the optical band gap with the presence of methylammonium (MA) or chloride (Cl) ions. As widely mentioned in the literature, the interface between the perovskite and charge transport layers is of crucial importance to reduce nonradiative recombination losses and achieve high open-circuit voltage (V OC ) with respect to the radiative limit.  13, 14  More specifically, in solar cells with n-i-p configurations, it has been shown that the interface between the perovskite and the 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMe-TAD) hole-transporting layer can be passivated with organic spacers that are able to form two-dimensional (2D) or quasi-2D perovskites.  [15] [16] [17] [18] [19]  These lower dimensional perovskites consist of inorganic layers of lead halide octahedra sandwiched between large organic spacers, which are too bulky to fit into octahedral voids to form a 3D perovskite.  20  Despite the large number of studies published on this topic, no consensus has been reached on the nature of the 2D interlayer found at the perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD interface, its uniformity, and the mechanism behind commonly reported performance enhancement. Moreover, one of the main advantages of employing 2D perovskites is their chemical variability since they can be formed ideally with many bulky organic cations leading to different material properties.  21  Despite this, most studies focus only on a handful of spacers, often based on butylammonium (BA), octylammonium (OA), and phenethylammonium (PEA). Functionalization of PEA with fluorine atoms and subsequent passivation of 3D perovskites have also been shown to improve solar cell PCE and stability toward humidity, mostly by making the film surface more hydrophobic and less subject to the impact of moisture.  22  Exploration of new spacers is however limited, even though it can potentially lead to impactful discoveries. In this work, we explore the use of benzotriazole derivatives as new spacers to form 2D perovskites and we employ them as interlayers in solar cells with FAPbI 3 -rich perovskite films as an active layer. A novel, easy-to-synthesize, and easy-to-functionalize benzotriazole derivative is proposed as an organic cation to form Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites (RPPs) and to passivate 3D perovskites. With a simple passivation strategy, the PCE of solar cells improved from about 20% to almost 22% by enhancing the V OC . Furthermore, by characterizing the 3D/ 2D heterostructure, we elucidated the formation mechanism of the benzotriazole-based RPP and found that a nonuniform layer of 2D perovskites is enough to passivate defects, enhance charge extraction, and decrease nonradiative recombination at the hole transport layer interface. 
 ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis of Benzotriazole Derivatives. Benzotriazole (BTa) is a versatile aromatic building block that allows for facile derivatization for application in perovskite-based solar cells. It is a weak electron acceptor that has already featured in donor-acceptor type conjugated polymers for organic photovoltaics in the past.  23, 24  A benzotriazole derivative has also been recently used for passivation purposes on perovskite solar cells.  25  The benzotriazole unit can be synthesized conveniently from an o-phenylenediamine and sodium nitrite and, since many of these diamines are commercially available, it is straightforward to introduce substituents. For this work, we targeted both pristine benzotriazole and a difluorinated derivative. Through a Mitsunobu reaction, both units were functionalized with a two-carbon alkyl chain containing a tertbutyloxycarbonyl (Boc)-protected amino group. Finally, using either HBr or HI, the amine was deprotected and converted into an ammonium bromide or iodide, respectively. This reaction yields BTaBr and BTaI out of the pristine unit and F 2 BTaBr and F 2 BTaI out of the fluorinated unit (Figure  1a ). Details on the synthesis procedures and characterization can be found in the Experimental Section (Supporting Information). This straightforward three-step process, consisting of core formation, alkylation, and salt formation, can be applied to various o-phenylenediamine derivatives and any alkyl tail lengths, and hence, a multitude of tailored benzotriazole salts can be synthesized. This opens the possibility for benzotriazole derivatives to be used as novel versatile building blocks for (quasi-) 2D perovskites. To verify whether these synthesized benzotriazole salts can be used as organic cations to obtain 2D perovskites, we spincoated thin films from precursor solutions containing a benzotriazole salt and PbI 2 or PbBr 2 in a 2:1 molar ratio. Figure  1b  summarizes the optical properties of lead-based 2D perovskite thin films of two of the benzotriazole salts. Excitonic absorption peaks are located at 523 and 395 nm for (BTa) 2 PbI 4 and (BTa) 2 PbBr 4 , respectively. Similar absorption peaks are reported for the fluorinated derivatives of the salts (Figure  S1 , Supporting Information). These wavelengths match with typical literature values for 2D lead iodide and lead bromide perovskites,  [26] [27] [28]  which indicates that 2D perovskite self-assembly was successful with all salts. The UV-vis absorption spectra of (BTa) 2 PbI 4 and (F 2 BTa) 2 PbI 4 also clearly show excitations to higher Rydberg states at about 350 and 400 nm.  29  Additionally, below 320 nm, the organic layer (benzotriazole unit) contributes to the absorption spectrum. The excitonic photoluminescence (PL) peaks are Stokes-shifted with respect to their corresponding absorption peaks, as expected.  24  The PL spectra of (BTa) 2 PbI 4 and (F 2 BTa) 2 PbI 4 perovskites also show a shoulder at longer wavelengths. The appearance of dual emission peaks for films of hybrid perovskites can arise from self-absorption effects and thin-film cavity effects via interference.  30, 31  Following the work of van der Pol et al.,  31  we investigated the influence of the perovskite film thickness by varying the spin coating speed and found that the intensity ratio of the emission peaks indeed depends on the film thickness, with the long-wavelength shoulder becoming more pronounced for thicker films (Figure  S2 , Supporting Information). This is a strong indication for cavity effects as the origin of the shoulder.  31  The phase purity of the perovskite thin films was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), which clearly shows the (0 0 2l) reflection (l = 1-5 and 1-7) characteristic for a 2D perovskite grown with a preferential orientation of PbX 6 sheets parallel to the surface (Figure  1c ).  32, 33  By using Bragg's law and the position of the first-order reflections, a d-spacing between the sheets of 14.9 and 18.4 Å was calculated for (BTa) 2 PbI 4 and (BTa) 2 PbBr 4 . Similar spacings of 15.0 and 18.7 Å were found for the 2D perovskites containing the fluorinated salts (Figure  S3 , Supporting Information). To further elucidate the perovskite crystal structure, single crystals of all four perovskites were grown. Single crystals were obtained via an optimized solvent conversion-induced rapid crystallization method reported in the literature.  34  Single-crystal structures are shown in Figure  S4  (Supporting Information). Interestingly, the crystal structures of (BTa) 2 PbI 4 and (F 2 BTa) 2 PbI 4 contain organic bilayers of interdigitating benzotriazole cores, whereas (BTa) 2 PbBr 4 and (F 2 BTa) 2 PbBr 4 have an organic bilayer, where the benzotriazole cores of each part of the bilayer do not interdigitate, as is more frequently encountered in the literature for large organic cations.  26, 28, 35  In each case, the d-spacing found in the thin-film XRD matches with the spacing between the PbX 6 sheets inferred from the singlecrystal structure. For (BTa) 2 PbI 4 and (F 2 BTa) 2 PbI 4 that both crystalize in the same orthorhombic space group, d = b/2, while for (BTa) 2 PbBr 4 and (F 2 BTa) 2 PbBr 4 that crystallize in different monoclinic space groups, d = a/2 and d = a, respectively (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information). This shows that the crystal structure in the spin-coated films matches with that of the solution-grown single crystals. We hypothesize that the smaller size of PbBr 6 octahedrons compared to PbI 6 precludes the interdigitation of the BTa and F 2 BTa units in the unit cell.  28  A separate detailed structural study combined with computational modeling is ongoing to fully elucidate these aspects. FAPbI 3 Passivation. Once confirmed that the benzotriazole derivatives are suitable to form 2D perovskites, we employed these molecules as interlayers in solar cells in the ni-p configuration with FAPbI 3 3D perovskites as an active layer. 2D perovskites at the perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interface should provide a passivation effect and lead to optimized band alignment, according to previous reports.  18  The device stack is illustrated in Figure  2a . On top of indium tin oxide (ITO) as transparent conductive oxide, a SnO 2 layer passivated by a monolayer of [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid (PCBA) is used as an electron-transport layer (ETL),  36  Spiro-OMeTAD is used as a hole transport layer (HTL), and a bilayer of MoO 3 /Au as top contact. FAPbI 3 was processed according to a two-step spin coating procedure, where the deposition of the first layer of PbI 2 is followed by the organic components (formamidinium iodide (FAI) and methylammonium chloride (MACl)) and thermal annealing in air. The detailed procedures are described in the Experimental Section (Supporting Information). Benzotriazole salts were spin-coated from solutions of 1 and 10 mg mL -1 in 2-propanol, i.e., concentrations commonly reported in the literature, onto FAPbI 3 . All four benzotriazole derivatives (fluorinated, nonfluorinated, iodide, or bromide anion) were used as the passivation layer, with BTaBr providing the best results in terms of solar cell performance and reproducibility (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information). As a result, we decided to employ BTaBr for the rest of the study. As shown in the current-density/voltage (J-V) curves in Figure  2b , devices without passivation layer display good photovoltaic performances and reach 20.2% PCE in the champion device. Passivation of FAPbI 3 with diluted BTaBr (1 mg mL -1 ) significantly enhances the V OC of the devices from 1.11 to 1.16 V and slightly improves the short-circuit current density (J SC ) and fill factor (FF). As summarized in Table  1 , FAPbI 3 solar cells passivated with BTaBr reach a PCE of 21.8%. The improved performance of BTaBr passivation is reproducible over several devices, as displayed in Figure  S6  (Supporting Information), and is statistically significant (onesample t-test, p-value <0.001). Based on this statistical data, average photovoltaic parameters are reported in Table  1 . When BTaBr passivation is applied using more concentrated solutions (10 mg mL -1 ), the solar cells show a critical loss in FF and overall worse photovoltaic performances because of poor charge extraction, for reasons that will be described below. We compared the photovoltaic performance of FAPbI 3 passivated with either BTaBr or PEAI, as a more conventional organic spacer, and observed a similar increase in V OC compared to the reference device, but a slightly higher PCE because of the enhanced FF when using BTaBr (Figure  S7 , Supporting Information). Figure  2c  shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the solar cells. All devices possess a high EQE with peak values above 95% and an integrated current density (∼24 mA cm -2 ) that closely matches the one obtained via J-V measurements. The passivated device shows a slightly higher EQE compared to the reference. The EQE drops in the green region of the spectrum (below 550 nm), which prevents the devices from reaching J SC > 25 mA cm -2 and PCE > 22%. We attribute this EQE loss, at least in part, to absorption by the ITO bottom electrode (Figure  S8 , Supporting Information). A preliminary study of the stability of the solar cells under illumination held at a maximum power point voltage (V MPP ) is shown in Figure  2d . Cells with and without passivation are stable under ∼24 h continuous illumination. FAPbI 3 retained 98% of the initial PCE, whereas FAPbI 3 + BTaBr 1 mg mL -1 was slightly more efficient (by about 4%) than at the beginning of the measurement. Such an increase might be related to an increase in V OC over time, which would shift the V MPP . Changes of MPP are not taken into account during the measurement, as the V MPP is chosen according to the first J-V measurement and not subsequently tracked. Passivation Effect of BTaBr. The V OC = 1.16 V of the best BTaBr-passivated FAPbI 3 solar cells represents 91% of the radiative limit (1268 mV based on a band gap of 1.55 eV, calculated via inflection point in EQE), indicating small Device layout: ITO/SnO 2 /PCBA/FAPbI 3 /passivation layer/Spiro-OMeTAD/MoO 3 /Au. Champion cell values are in parenthesis. The number of cells fabricated are N = 10 and N = 17 for the reference device and passivated with BTaBr 1 mg mL -1 , respectively. For the 10 mg mL -1 BTaBr passivation, no statistics are reported as few devices were fabricated. Hysteresis indexes for the champion devices are 0.17 and 0.07 for nonpassivated and BTaBr-passivated, respectively. nonradiative losses. To elucidate the effect of the passivation layer on the V OC , we employed absolute photoluminescence (PL) measurements to evaluate differences in the quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) between nonpassivated and passivated FAPbI 3 films. The QFLS of the nonpassivated films is 1161 ± 8 mV, i.e., ∼100 mV below the radiative limit (1268 mV based on a band gap of 1.54 eV) (Figure  3a ). Passivation by BTaBr leads to a small increase (∼4 mV) of the QFLS to 1165 ± 7 mV. The enhancement in QFLS is less than the increase in average V OC measured in devices (∼70 mV, Table  1 ). This suggests that the enhanced V OC might also be related to passivation of the perovskite/HTL interface, rather than of the perovskite film itself. To confirm this, we measured the QFLS and V OC of full devices with and without passivation over time (Figure  3b ). Montoring the V OC and QFLS over time was necessary because when measuring perovskite/Spiro-OMe-TAD films, the absolute PL signal becomes time-dependent and the peaks in the first few seconds, to then stabilize at a lower value (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information). Following QFLS and V OC of complete devices over time, we observed a significant increase of both quantities for the passivated devices by about ∼20 mV (QFLS) and ∼15 mV (V OC ). This suggests that BTaBr can have important passivation properties at the perovskite/HTL interface, in agreement with the consistent increase in V OC observed in the solar cells. A similar increase in the stabilized-QFLS is observed after passivation when using FAPbI 3 /(2D)/Spiro-OMeTAD samples (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information). To further investigate the passivation effect of BTaBr, we employed scanning electron microscopy cathodoluminescence (SEM-CL) hyperspectral imaging (Figure  3c-h ). First, merely from a morphological point of view, new crystallites appear on the surface of FAPbI 3 after passivation with diluted BTaBr (Figure  3c-d ). Such crystallites are more clearly visible in Figure  S10  (Supporting Information). No closed interlayer seems to be formed. Instead, after passivation with a more concentrated BTaBr solution (10 mg mL -1 ), a new layer appears on top of FAPbI 3 , and no perovskite grains can be observed (Figure  S11 , Supporting Information). Figure  3e -f displays the 3D perovskite CL emission intensity maps for the 3D perovskite FAPbI 3 , bandpass filtered at 800 ± 10 nm, before and after passivation with diluted BTaBr. For comparison, PbI 2 emission mapping (using a bandpass filter at 520 ± 10 nm) is shown in Figure  3g ,h. Both CL hyperspectral maps were acquired under the same conditions, so in each image, a more saturated coloring indicates stronger CL. Figure  3e  indicates that before passivation, FAPbI 3 exhibits a low and inhomogeneous CL emission intensity with most grains being relatively nonemissive, and few displaying bright CL emission, sometimes in the proximity of PbI 2 grains. A more detailed image with spectral analysis of different grains is displayed in Figure  S12  (Supporting Information). After passivation, the 3D perovskite CL emission becomes ∼1.5 to 3 times brighter (Figure  S13 , Supporting Information). Additionally, the grain boundaries display stronger emission compared to the nonpassivated film. Such an increase in emission, both intragrain and at grain boundaries after passivation, is in agreement with other reports.  37  Interestingly, for both nonpassivated and passivated films, the grain boundaries do not seem to represent a location with enhanced nonradiative recombination but instead show a relatively high CL emission. This is likely because morphology affects the CL intensity and rougher surfaces (i.e., sharp grain boundaries) can result in brighter CL emission. Just as observed in FAPbI 3 , also the passivated layer displays a relatively high PbI 2 emission, and sometimes, it appears that perovskite emission is stronger at the boundary between the perovskite and PbI 2 . To demonstrate this, we analyzed a passivated perovskite film with higher magnification (Figure  S14 , Supporting Information) and found that emission from the 3D perovskite is indeed brighter when the signal overlaps with PbI 2 emission, which might suggest a passivation effect from PbI 2 itself. The overlap of signals at 800 nm (FAPbI 3 ) and 520 nm (PbI 2 ) is dictated by the fact that SEM-CL can detect emission not only from the surface but up to a penetration depth of ∼60 nm (at 3 kV electron acceleration voltage), meaning that perovskite crystals under PbI 2 superficial grains can be measured. With regard to FAPbI 3 passivated with concentrated BTaBr, despite a drastic morphology change because of the presence of a relatively thick 2D interlayer, we could again identify only bright 3D perovskite emission and emission from PbI 2 grains (Figure  S15 , Supporting Information). In all films, no emission from the 2D perovskite phases could be detected. This could be caused by efficient charge or energy transfer mechanism from 2D to 3D phase, which leads to only emission at ∼800 nm being observed. No signs of beam-induced damage from the 2D emission were detected either (Figure  S13 , Supporting Information). Nevertheless, both QFLS and SEM-CL suggest that BTaBr has a passivating effect, which reduces nonradiative recombination and leads to stronger CL and PL emission and, as a result, an enhanced V OC . 2D/3D Heterostructure. Having established the improvement of solar cell performance after 2D passivation, we aimed to characterize in detail the perovskite/BTaBr heterostructure. To do so, we first employed PL spectroscopy. Emission peaks at 530 and 570 nm, corresponding to 100%-iodide n = 1 (2D, (BTa) 2 PbI 4 ) and n = 2 (quasi-2D, (BTa) 2 FAPb 2 I 7 ) phases, were observed after spin coating diluted BTaBr (1 mg mL -1 ) on top of FAPbI 3 (Figure  4a ). Hence, despite the use of the bromide salt for passivation, only PL from an iodide-based 2D perovskite was observed. In contrast, FAPbI 3 films passivated with concentrated BTaBr (10 mg mL -1 ) did not display such emission peaks, indicating that no iodide-based 2D or quasi-2D perovskite phases were formed in this case. By analyzing the PL emission spectra at shorter wavelengths (Figure  4b ), however, we could identify an emission peak at about 400 nm, which corresponds to (BTa) 2 PbBr 4 , as shown in Figure  1b . The main 3D perovskite emission peak is located at 820 nm, which represents a band gap energy (E g ) of 1.51 eV, in line with the band gap of 1.55 eV obtained via EQE. The XRD patterns of the 3D FAPbI 3 perovskite, without or with BTaBr passivation, show reflections at 2θ = 14 and 28°c orresponding to α-FAPbI 3 (110) and (  220 ) planes (Figure  4c ). Small reflections at 2θ = 11.5°demonstrate the presence of negligible amounts of δ-FAPbI 3 , whereas the reflection at 2θ = 12.7°represents PbI 2 and dominates the whole diffractogram. The XRD pattern of the FAPbI 3 /BTaBr heterostructure showed no reflections at 2θ angles lower than 10°, which are representative of the lower dimensional perovskites, after passivation with the diluted salt (Figure  4c ). It is plausible that the amount of 2D perovskite phase present in these films is too small to be detected using XRD, which is less sensitive than absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy to small amounts of low-dimensional perovskite present in a thin film.  34  On the other hand, a peak at 2θ = 4.8°appeared after passivation with concentrated BTaBr. This peak corresponds to the (BTa) 2 PbBr 4 phase (Figure  1c ). Based on the combination of PL and XRD, we hypothesize that BTaBr first reacts with excess PbI 2 or replaces FA from FAPbI 3 on the surface to form (BTa) 2 PbI 4 , as seen after passivation with the diluted benzotriazole salt. Then, when the concentration of the passivating agent increases, an excess of Br ions replaces I, forming a 100%-Br 2D perovskite structure on top of the 3D perovskite. The presence of Br on the surface is further confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which shows a higher amount of Br with increasing concentration of the passivation salt (Figure  S16 , Supporting Information). To gain more information on the 2D/3D heterostructure and on the presence of PbI 2 detected through XRD (Figure  4c ), we employed angle-resolved grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (AR-GIWAXS). The GIWAXS pattern of the FAPbI 3 films (Figure  5a ) shows an intense Bragg spot at q z = 0.9 Å -1 in the out-of-plane direction, corresponding to PbI 2 crystallites with a significant degree of preferential orientation, consistent with the strong reflection at 2θ = 12.7°in the diffractogram shown in Figure  4c . Hence, the intense peak of PbI 2 in the diffractogram is a consequence of preferential orientation and not only abundance. In contrast, the ring at q = 1 Å -1 shows that FAPbI 3 crystallites are mostly randomly oriented, although a certain degree of preferential orientation is present, as indicated by the higher intensity at about -45, 0,   and 45°with respect to q z . Passivation with diluted BTaBr does not give rise to additional features compared to the reference film (Figure  S17 , Supporting Information). Angle-resolved GIWAXS allows us to characterize the film at different depths, as the penetration of the X-rays in the film is dependent on the angle of incidence. We performed such a measurement on FAPbI 3 passivated with concentrated BTaBr. AR-GIWAXS with 0.1°incidence angle (probing the very top surface of the film) displays a Bragg spot at q z = 0.45 Å -1 and a less intense one at 0.35 Å -1 (Figure  5b ). These peaks likely correspond to I-and Br-rich 2D perovskites, respectively. It is unclear why we can discern both I-and Br-rich 2D perovskites via GIWAXS, whereas both XRD and PL hinted at the presence of only (BTa) 2 PbBr 4 . A possible explanation could be the presence of a more complex heterostructure, described as FAPbI 3 / (BTa) 2 PbI 4 /(BTa) 2 PbBr 4 . In such a case, the I-based 2D interlayer would likely not be visible in the PL because of efficient energy transfer to 3D but visible via GIWAXS. The main spot at 0.45 Å -1 resembles a half-ring, indicating that the 2D crystals possess a certain degree of disorder with random orientation along the q z plane. By increasing the incidence angle (until 0.5°, at which the whole film thickness is probed), the abovementioned PbI 2 and FAPbI 3 peaks appear as in the reference film (Figure  5c ). This is in line with the presence of a superficial 2D perovskite layer on top of FAPbI 3 . Interlayer Characterization. We further characterized the heterostructure via XPS. First, we quantified the atomic concentrations of the elements composing the perovskite layer. As displayed in Table  2 , the concentration of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) at the surface increases with increasing BTaBr concentration. This indicates the presence of passivating molecules on the perovskite surface. Similarly, the bromine (Br) concentration increases from 1.2 to 5.7 at %, indicating a Br-richer surface, ideally because of the replacement of iodine(I) from (BTa) 2 PbI 4 and conversion to (BTa) 2 PbBr 4 , as described above. As expected, the iodine concentration decreases with increasing passivation. By analyzing the N 1s spectrum and its depth profile, obtained via argon ion sputtering at low rates to avoid loss of features in the spectra (see the Experimental Section for more details), we gained more information on the formation of a 2D perovskite layer on top of the 3D one. First, nonpassivated FAPbI 3 shows a single peak slightly above 400 eV for N 1s (Figure  6a ). Then, once BTaBr is spin-coated onto the 3D layer, the films display a double peak in the same region. Here, the peak at ∼400 eV contains the contributions from both FAPbI 3 and BTaBr, whereas the higher energy peak at ∼402 eV is only related to BTaBr. In pure BTaBr, the ratio between the low-and high-energy peaks is equal to 1.2, whereas it goes from 1.9 to 1.2 in the case of BTaBr 1 and 10 mg mL -1 deposited onto FAPbI 3 , respectively. These results indicate that BTaBr is present in both cases on top of the 3D perovskite but in different amounts. It seems that the XPS signal in the case of BTaBr 10 mg mL -1 originates prevalently from the 2D interlayer, whereas for the diluted BTaBr salt, there is a significant contribution from FAPbI 3 as well. XPS is a surfacesensitive technique and we therefore speculate that after spin coating diluted BTaBr onto FAPbI 3 , the passivation layer might be either not closed or in the order of a few nm in thickness, thin enough to pick up signals from the underlying perovskite layer. On the contrary, when passivating with concentrated BTaBr, mostly the 2D layer is probed, indicating the formation of a much thicker interlayer that would negatively affect charge transport, as is indeed observed in the FF loss in the solar cell performance. The depth profile gives additional valuable information on such an interlayer. After passivation with BTaBr 1 mg mL -1 , the high-energy peak related to BTaBr decreases with increasing sputtering time, in line with a gradual removal of the passivation layer (Figure  6b ). The low-energy peak, related to perovskite and BTaBr, shifts to higher binding energy over time and becomes equivalent to the one of pure FAPbI 3 . Again, this seems to indicate the presence of a rather thin film of BTabased 2D perovskite or only sparse 2D crystallites on the surface, which would corroborate what was observed in SEM images. By analyzing the atomic concentration variation of the sample with 1 mg mL -1 passivation, we found that the concentrations of iodine increase and those of nitrogen decrease over sputtering time (Figure  6c ). In comparison, the concentrations of I and N are stable in the reference film (Figure  S18 , Supporting Information). The atomic concentration of nitrogen seems to follow three regimes, where first it decreases sharply, then linearly, and finally, it stabilizes and remains constant. In the first regime (till ∼1000 s sputtering time), the concentration of BTaBr molecules decreases fast, indicating direct removal of the interlayer. In the second regime (till ∼4000 s), the concentration of nitrogen decreases more gradually; this might indicate that BTaBr molecules penetrate the perovskite bulk, possibly forming (BTa) 2 FAPb 2 I 7 , and such a removal is slower and happens together with the sputtering of the 3D perovskite layer. Finally, in the final regime, the concentration becomes constant, which indicates the presence of a conventional FAPbI 3 layer. The N 1s spectra in these three regimes are displayed in Figure  S19  (Supporting Information). We additionally measured the thickness of the sputtered area after ∼790 cycles of 10 s via a profilometer and found the thickness to be 93 nm. The etching rate on the perovskite was thus calculated as 0.012 nm s -1 . With this information, we calculated that the 2D interlayer is in the order of 12 nm, whereas the penetration of the BTaBr molecules goes as deep as ∼48 nm. For FAPbI 3 passivated with BTaBr 10 mg mL -1 , the two N 1s peaks are still visible even with rougher sputtering conditions and indicate the presence of a thicker 2D interlayer (Figure  S20 , Supporting Information). The same rougher sputtering conditions for FAPbI 3 + BTaBr 1 mg mL -1 removed all BTaBr molecules after only one cycle. This confirms the presence of a much thicker 2D interlayer when passivating with concentrated BTaBr. 
 ■ CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, we introduced a novel benzotriazole-based cation to form 2D and quasi-2D perovskites and showed that it is beneficial to passivate the surface of FAPbI 3 perovskites with such a cation to enhance solar cells parameters. A solar cell based on FAPbI 3 passivated with an optimal amount of BTaBr reached almost 22% PCE. Mainly, V OC increase is behind the enhancement of photovoltaic performance. By using QFLS and SEM-CL, we demonstrated that BTaBr indeed passivates FAPbI 3 and reduces nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/HTL interface. With a variety of characterization methods, we provided insights into the formation of a 2D interlayer. We showed that 2D perovskites, either iodide-or bromide-based, are formed even with low amounts of spacers, but the nature of the resulting layer can vary. Low concentration of the 2D spacer leads to the formation of iodide-based 2D and quasi-2D perovskites. It is likely that such a low concentration does not lead to the formation of a closed 2D interlayer but rather results in sparse crystallites of 2D perovskites being formed on the surface of the 3D perovskite, which are still beneficial to reduce nonradiative recombination and enhance device performance. With increasing concentration of BTaBr, a thicker 2D, bromide-based perovskite layer is formed, which is detrimental for charge extraction. With this study, further knowledge on the formation of 3D/2D heterostructures is developed. Furthermore, the easy-tofunctionalize nature of benzotriazole cations suggests that such spacers could pave the way to functionalized 2D interlayers that could push the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells even further.

 For EQE measurements, a modulated (Oriel, Cornerstone 130) tungsten-halogen lamp (Philips Focusline, 50 W) was used light source. The signal was amplified via a current preamplifier (Stanford Research, SR 570) and measured by a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research, SR 830). Based on a calibrated silicon reference cell, the EQE is then calculated from the spectral response signal. An additional 530 nm LED (Thorlabs) was used to generate a photocurrent in the solar cell during the EQE measurement, which is close to the current measured during J-V measurements, to mimic 1-sun condition.

By changing theITO thickness, going from 90 nm (reference device) to 50 nm, we could enhance the EQE in the abovementioned region, although the higher sheet resistance of ITO led to a slight FF loss and overall comparable performances with the reference. Higher JSC values are also achievable by increasing the perovskite layer thickness, although we found that morphology issues, such as increased roughness of the active layer, become significant and lead to performance losses.

Materials. Colloidal tin oxide solution (SnO2, 15% in H2O) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Methylamine (40% in methanol, ca. 9.8 mol/L) was purchased from TCI. Potassium iodide (anhydrous, 99%), lead(II) nitrate (ACS reagent, ≥99%), acetic acid (>99%), formamidine acetate (99%), hydriodic acid (contains no stabilizer, distilled, 57 wt.% in H2O, 99.99% trace metals basis), hydrochloric acid (ACS reagent, 37%), N,N-dimethylformamide (anhydrous, 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (anhydrous, ≥99.9%), chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8%), diethyl ether (contains 1 ppm BHT as inhibitor, anhydrous, ≥99.7%) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Spiro-MeOTAD was purchased from Merck. PbI2 (95%) for powder synthesis was purchased from Kanto Chemical Co., Inc. Acetonitrile (HPLC) for the powder synthesis was purchased from DeaJung Chemicals. All the purchased chemicals were used as received without further purification. Synthesis of PbI2. Lead iodide (PbI2) was synthesized by reacting KI with Pb(NO3)2, where the aqueous
III-V Multijunction Cells (2-terminal, monolithic) LM = lattice matched MM = metamorphic IMM = inverted, metamorphic Two-, three-, and four-junction (concentrator) Three-junction or more (non-concentrator) Two-junction (non-concentrator) KI solution (23.2 g KI in deionized water (DI water)) and the aqueous Pb(NO 3)2 solution (33.1 g Pb(NO3)2 in DI water) were mixed with vigorous stirring at room temperature for 4 h, which was followed by adding acetic acid (20 mL) and additional DI water (2 L) and then heated at 90 °C for more than 24 h. The supernatant liquid was removed, and the precipitate was recrystallized by cooling down. The recrystallized golden crystals were filtered and rinsed with DI water several times. Finally, the product was dried at 85 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h and then stored in Ar filled glove box. Synthesis of FAI and MACl. Formamidinium iodide (FAI, HC(NH2)2I) was synthesized by reacting 15 g of formamidinium acetate with 30 mL of hydroiodic acid in a round-bottomed flask in an ice bath for 2 h. Dark yellow precipitate was recovered by evaporating at 60 ºC for 1 h. Resulting product was dissolved in ethanol and recrystallized in diethyl ether, which was repeated for three times. methylammonium chloride (MACl, CH3NH3Cl) was synthesized using methylamine and hydrochloric acid in a similar way with FAI. The final white precipitates were dried at 50 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h and then stored in Ar filled glove box. Synthesis of FAPbI3 powder. For FAPbI3 powder synthesis, 7.66 g of FAI was added into Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 mL acetonitrile (ACN) under vigorous stirring and then the synthesized PbI2 or low-grade (95% purity) commercial PbI2 (15.67 g) (PbI2:FAI = 1:1.3) was slowly added together with extra 50 mL ACN. The brown precipitate appeared after addition of PbI2. After vigorous stirring for 24 h, the powder turned gradually bright yellow. Then the powder was washed with ACN and diethyl ether for six times. The final product was dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h and then stored in Ar filled glove box. The yield was 93%. (Caution: in case of scale-up, rotary evaporator is recommended to dry the powder instead of using a vacuum oven.). The FAPbI3 powder is also commercially available from ShareChem Co., Ltd. Solar cell fabrication. F-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated conductive glasses (T18VU70, 12-13 Ω/sq, AGC Fabritech Co., Ltd.) were cleaned by detergent, followed by ultrasonic treatment in ethanol for 20 min. UV/ozone (UVO) treatment was conducted for 60 min prior to use. SnO 2 film was deposited on the FTO substrate by spin-coating the commercial SnO2 colloidal solution (diluted with DI water to adjust to 4 wt%) at 4000 rpm for 20 s, which was annealed at 185 °C on a hotplate for 30 min. The FAPbI3 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing 663 mg of the synthesized FAPbI3 powder and 71 μL of DMSO (molar ratio 1:1) in 568 μL of DMF with different molar ratio (0 mol%, 10 mol%, 20 mol%, 30 mol% and 40 mol%) of MACl (optimal was 20 mol%). For the conventional precursor mixture solution, except for using the synthesized powder, PbI2 (Alfa Aesar, 99.9985%) and the synthesized FAI were dissolved. The solution was spin-coated at two consecutive steps of 1000 rpm for 5 and 5000 rpm 20 s. During the second spin-coating step, 1 mL of diethyl ether was quickly dripped on the rotating substrate (5000 rpm) at 17 s to obtain an adduct intermediate film. The adduct films were annealed at 150 °C on a hotplate for 10 min. The spiro-MeOTAD layer was formed on the perovskite layer by spin-coating of 20 μL of the stock solution comprising 50 mg spiro-MeOTAD in 0.55 mL chlorobenzene including 19.5 μL t-BP (tert-butylpyridine) and 11.5 μL Li-TFSI solution (540 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%)) at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, Ag electrode with a thickness of ca. 150 nm was deposited on top of the spiro-MeOTAD layer under 4×10 -7 torr using a thermal evaporator. The as-fabricated PSCs were stored in the desiccator overnight before the current density-voltage (J-V) measurement. Characterizations. J-V curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under the simulated one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW/cm 2 ) using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A class AAA) equipped with 450 W Xenon lamp (Newport 6280NS), in which light intensity was adjusted by NRELcalibrated Si solar cell with KG-2 filter. Solar cells were covered with a metal mask with an aperture area of 0.125 cm 2 during the measurement. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by either an EQE system (PV measurement Inc.) equipped with a 75 W Xenon source lamp (USHIO, Japan) or a QuantX-300 Quantum Efficiency System (Newport) equipped with 100 W Xenon lamp. EQE data were collected at DC mode without bias light. The absorbance of the perovskite film was measured by UV-vis spectrometer (Lambda 45, Perkin-Elmer). Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) was measured using a fluorescence spectrometer (Quantaurus-Tau C11367-12, Hamamatsu). Perovskite films were photo-excited with a 464 nm laser pulsed at the frequency of 10 MHz. The PL was detected by high sensitivity photon counting near-IR detector. Timeresolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured using a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system by FluoTim 200 (PicoQuant) with 500 kHz repetition rate. The perovskite films were excited by 375 nm laser source, and then the emitted PL from the samples was collected by a photon multiplier tube (PMT) detector (PMA 182, PicoQuant-GmbH) at 800 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) data were collected from a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer, where Cu Kα radiation was used (λ = 1.5406 Å) and a scan rate was 4º/min with 0.02º/step. GIXRD were measured with the incident angle of 1º, 2º, 3º and 4º in the range of 5º -40º with 0.01º/step. The GIXRD penetration depth depending on incidence angles was calculated from eq 1, 1 τ1/e = sin θ/μ (1)  where τ1/e is the depth at which the intensity of radiation on a material is attenuated to 1/e (37%) and μ is the linear absorption coefficient, μ = μmρ (μm is the mass absorption coefficient and ρ is the mass density). ρ for cubic unit cell crystal structure could be calculated using eq 2, ρ = M/(a 3  NA) ( 2 ) where M is the molar mass of FAPbI3 (632.98 g/mol), NA is Avogadro's number (6.022  10 23 ), a is the edge length of unit cell (a = 6.35694 Å for cubic FAPbI3 determined from XRD analysis). The mass density ρ was calculated to be 4.092 g/cm  3  . According to the NIST standard reference database,  2  the μm of FAPbI3 is 246.9 cm 2 /g at 8000 eV photo energy. According to the eq 1, the penetration depth τ1/e of FAPbI3 under incidence angle of 1°, 2°, 3°, 4°and 5° are 172.7 nm, 345.4 nm, 518.0 nm, 690.5 nm and 862.7 nm, respectively. Light-intensity-dependent photocurrent mappings (PCM) were obtained using an atomic force microscope (AFM, NX10, Park System) equipped with a white LED light source (maximum power: 3.3 W), where light intensity was modulated from 0% (dark) to 20% (0.66 W), 40% (1.32 W), 60% (1.98 W) and 80% (2.64 W). The sub-mode of the PCM was Variable-Enhanced Conductive AFM (VECA) using the cantilever (SD-CDTP-NCHR) and 1 V DC bias voltage was applied to the substrate. The current images were obtained under the ambient condition. The depth profile of the perovskite film on FTO substrate was recorded using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS, model TOF-SIMS 5 of ION-TOF, Germany) in negative polarity. The pulsed primary Bi + ion source was operated at 25 keV and pA scale on a 40 μm  40 μm area to bombard the sample surface to produce secondary ions. The sputtering was performed with a Cs + ion beam operated at 1 keV and 45 nA on a 150 μm  150 μm area. Defect density was estimated using hole-only devices with the structure of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au. The devices were measured from -0.1 V to 2 V in the dark. The observed response was analyzed according to space-charge-limited current (SCLC) theory. Defect density (Ndefects) was estimated using the relation VTFL = eNdefectsd 2 /2r0,  3  where VTFL is the trap-filled-limit voltage, e is electron charge (1.602  10 -19 C), r is relative dielectric constant, 0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.8542  10 -14 F/cm) and d is the perovskite film thickness. The dielectric constant was calculated using the equation of r = Cd/A0, where C is capacitance at high frequency (~10 4 Hz) and A is area.  4, 5  Raman spectra were collected in back-scattering geometry. The 514.5 nm (2.41 eV) line of an Ar ion laser was used as an excitation source. The laser beam was focused on the surface of the solution in a petri-dish by a 50× microscope objective lens (0.8 NA). The scattered light was collected and collimated by the same objective in the backscattering geometry. The scattered signal was dispersed by a Jobin-Yvon Horiba iHR550 spectrometer (2400 grooves/mm) and detected with a liquid-nitrogencooled back-illuminated charge-coupled-device (CCD) detector. To approach the low-frequency range below 100 cm -1 , volume holographic filters (Optigrate) were used to clean the laser line and reject the Rayleigh-scattered light. The laser power was kept below 100 μW in order to avoid local heating. Surface and cross-sectional morphologies were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JSM-7600F, JEOL). Absorption spectra were measured using an UV/visible spectrometer (Lambda 45, Perkin Elmer). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the cross-sectioned full cells were obtained using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM-2100F) at an acceleration voltage 200 kV. The specimens for TEM were prepared by vertical etching using focused ion beam (FIB) equipm ent (JEOL JIB-4601F) with the cell structure glass/FTO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD. Before preparing the specimens, Pt and carbon layers were deposited on the spiro-MeOTAD layer to protect the samples from milling damage. A thick plate was extracted from the bulk sample at 30 kV and 3,000~30,000 pA, which was welded on Cu grid (omniprobe grid) by using probing system. The thick plate was first thinned at 30 kV and 50~1,000 pA and then lower current of 10~30 pA. Finally, the specimen was completed by thinni ng at lower voltage of 1 kV and 30~50 pA after beam showering at 3 kV and 10~30 pA. MACl were added into the perovskite precursor solution to fabricate the perovskite film. From the XRD pattern in Figure  S2a , the peaks at 11.7 o correspond to δ-phase, where the 20 mol% MACl doped perovskite film shows almost no δ-phase. The appearance of δ-phase is indicative of degradation due to α → δ phase transition under humidity condition (fresh samples did not show δ-phase). Thus the suppression of δ-phase for the 20 mol% MACl doped perovskite film indicates that α-phase is relatively stable for this content. The (100) peak position at 13.92 o for α-phase FAPbI3 is not altered by the MACl content, which indicates that MA ion might not be involved in the crystal lattice. However, in Figure  S2b  and S2c of the UV-vis absorption and PL spectra, the PL peak and UV-vis absorption are shift to lower wavelength, indicative of a partial substitution of FA + with MA + in FAPbI3.  6  The optical bandgap of 0 mol%, 10 mol%, 20 mol%, 30 mol% and 40 mol% are 1.527 eV, 1.539 eV, 1.545 eV, 1.539 eV and 1.539 eV, respectively. PL peak is shift from 818 nm to 802 nm with MACl addition. However, it is noted that the EQE onset edge position is observed at about 840 nm regardless of MACl content (Figure  S2d ).  might be related to difference in composition along the film depth. Figure  S3a  shows the grazing incidence angle (ω)-dependent XRD patterns of the annealed FAPbI3 film formed from the synthesized powder with 20 mol% MACl, where the depth in perovskite film can be increased with ω as illustrated in Figure  S3b .  7  The penetration depth τ1/e of FAPbI3 under incidence angle of 1°, 2°, 3°, 4°and 5° are 172.7 nm, 345.3 nm, 517.9 nm, 690.2 nm and 862.4 nm, respectively. As shown in Figure  S3a  and S3b, the (100) peak is deconvoluted into two peaks at 13.86° (red color) and at ~14.0° (blue color). The detailed parameters are summarized in the Table  S1 . The red peak corresponds to FAPbI3 but the blue peak might be related to incorporation of smaller MA in the larger FA site. The peak position at 13.86° is unchanged with increasing ω, however, another peak (blue color) shifts from 14.10° to 14.02°. In addition, the peak area ratio of red to blue is increased from 0.88 to 1.18 as the incidence angle is increased from 1° to 5°. This indicates that the underlying MA-incorporated phase is probably located on the surface of the film rather than on the bottom of the film. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) is decreased with increasing ω, which underlines that the FAPbI3 perovskite grain size is increased going from top surface to the bulk film. From the PL measurement illuminated on different side in Figure  S3c , no change in PL emission peak position is observed regardless of illumination side for the FAPbI3 film without MACl (Figure  S3d ). On the other hands, a slight change in PL peak position is observed for the 20 mol% MACl case, where the glass side illumination results in PL emission at a slightly longer wavelength, which is indicative of difference in composition between top and bottom of the film. According to GIXRD and illumination-side-dependent PL, MACl assists to increase grain size of FAPbI3 and exists near the surface of FAPbI3 rather than incorporation into bulk FAPbI3, which can explain the reason why the onset wavelength in EQE together with the (100) peak position in XRD were unchanged with MACl. We also measured time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) to investigate the position of residual Cl inside the film. As shown in Figure  S4 , due to MA cation located near perovskite surface, the Cl content decreases going from the to p to the bottom in the perovskite layer. However, the Cl content sharply increases when approaching the SnO2 layer, which indicates that most of Cl is located near SnO2 layer and this location of Cl was reported to improve stability. 8        H ybrid organic-inorganic all-solid-state perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are currently attracting increasing interest because of their low cost and high performance. A surge of recent research activity in PSCs has been triggered by the first report of a solid-state PSC with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7% and a 500 h stability without encapsulation,  1  following two seed reports on perovskite-sensitized solar cells.  2, 3  Rapid progress in PCE has been made, and most of the PCEs over 20% are based on mixed-cation and mixed-anion perovskites comprising formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) as a major component.  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]  By far, the certified record PCE of 25.2% 10 surpasses PCEs of copper-indium-gallium-selenide (CIGS) and CdTe solar cells. Because the Shockley-Queisser (S-Q) limit efficiency is over 30% based on the bandgap energy of 1.6 eV,  11  further improvement in PCE is expected. FAPbI 3 is currently one of the most promising perovskite materials for high-efficiency solar cells owing to its optimal bandgap of 1.47 eV, high absorption coefficient exceeding 10 4 cm -1 , and a carrier diffusion length of a few hundred micrometers.  12, 13  However, the photoactive ""black phase"" (αphase) is less stable under ambient conditions because its photoinactive ""yellow phase"" (δ-phase) is more favorable.  14  A partial substitution of FA + with MA + or Cs + was reported to be an efficient way to stabilize the α-phase of FAPbI 3 at ambient conditions,  8, [15] [16] [17] [18]  which however leads to increasing the bandgap energy and thereby narrowing the absorption spectrum. Nonreproducibility in photovoltaic performance in PSCs has been often reported, which might stem from the precursor preparation and film formation procedure when using PbI 2 (usually high purity ∼99.99%).  5, 7, 17, 19, 20  This conventional ""precursor mixture"" method is likely to cause the fractional deviations in stoichiometry because of impurity and/or nonperovskite phase, leading to low reproducibility.  21  In addition, using the expensive PbI 2 is not a cost-effective way to scale up PSCs. Thus, a cost-effective approach is also required to guarantee the reproducibility of high-efficiency PSCs. The perovskite powder approach is more beneficial for reproducibility of photovoltaic performance of PSCs than the precursor mixture method because the underlying nonstoichiometry of the resulting perovskite film can be avoided. Perovskite powders were reported to be synthesized by either mechanochemistry or wet chemistry methods.  19, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26]  The mechanochemically prepared MAPbI 3 powder was used as a precursor for the coating solution, which resulted in a PCE of 17.5%, which was better than the PCE obtained from the precursor mixture of MAI and PbI 2 .  22  The grinded or ballmilled powder of perovskite with mixed cation and/or mixed anion showed a PCE of about 19%.  23  Perovskite powders were synthesized by wet chemistry based on antisolvents  24  or lowsolubility solvents such as 2-proponal,  25  acetonitrile,  26  or 2methoxyethanol.  19  Among the reported PCEs based on the synthesized FAPbI 3 crystal or powder,  5, 8, 19, 27  powder-based PSCs achieved a certified PCE of around 23%.  5, 19  However, these perovskite powders were synthesized using a costineffective high-purity PbI 2 and production yield was low. In our previous report,  26  we first attempted to synthesize highyield MAPbI 3 and FAPbI 3 powders in acetonitrile using lowgrade PbI 2 at room temperature. We obtained α, δ, and α/δ mixed-phase FAPbI 3 powders by controlling the ratio of PbI 2 to FAI. However, the average PCE of FAPbI 3 PSCs was still as low as 17.21% because of the phase purity issue. Thus, an advanced method is required to synthesize pure δ-phase FAPbI 3 powder for higher PCE reproducibly, which has been successfully performed via a synthetic procedure including a washing process. Here we report the materials and methods for reproducible high-efficiency PSCs based on the room-temperature-synthesized FAPbI 3 powder using homemade or inexpensive lowgrade PbI 2 . The average PCE of 20.71% is achieved from the 130 devices based on the synthetic powder-based FAPbI 3 films fabricated in different batches, and the quasi-steady-state PCE of 21.07% is certified. The photovoltaic performance and reproducibility of the powder-based devices are compared with those of the expensive high-grade PbI 2 (99.9985%) based the precursor mixture-based conventional method, from which the former is confirmed to be much superior to the latter. Synthesis and Properties of FAPbI 3 Powder. Because the quality of PbI 2 varies from different batches and the high-purity (99.9985%) PbI 2 is still cost-ineffective,  26  the cost-effective materials leading to reproducible high efficiency are highly required for commercialization. Figure  1a  shows a schematic procedure of synthesizing FAPbI 3 powder at room temper-  
 ACS Energy Letters Letter ature, where the quality of FAPbI 3 powder is found to be independent of the PbI 2 purity. As compared to our previous report,  26  we have synthesized FAPbI 3 using homemade PbI 2 and improved purity of FAPbI 3 powder by modifying the synthetic procedure (see Experimental Section in the Supporting Information for more details). To further reduce the material cost, PbI 2 is synthesized by reacting potassium iodide (KI) with lead(II) nitrate (Pb(NO 3 ) 2 ) and recrystallization. Chemical reaction of the synthesized PbI 2 with FAI produces the yellow FAPbI 3 powder with yield ∼93%. From the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, the synthesized PbI 2 shows a pure hexagonal system with space group of P3m1, along with hexagonal plate morphology (Figure  1b, d ). The synthesized yellow FAPbI 3 powder is determined to be hexagonal system with P6 3 mc space group (Figure  1c ), corresponding to the δphase, and an asymmetric rod-type morphology is observed (Figure  1e ). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in Figure  S1a  shows that the synthesized FAPbI 3 powder loses FAI at 304-363 °C. On the other hand, FAI starts to be evaporated at the lower temperature of 234 °C for the conventional precursor mixture (FAI and PbI 2 mixed), which is attributed to the decomposition of the unreacted free FAI to FA, followed by a weight loss corresponding to loss of HI molecules.  28  In addition, a single endothermic peak appears at 178 °C for the synthesized FAPbI 3 in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), whereas two endothermic peaks along with multiple exothermic peaks are detected for the precursor mixture (Figure  S1b ). The complex DSC profile for the precursor mixture is due to the large specific surface area induced by nonstoichiometric reaction to form δ and α phases.  29  TGA and DSC studies reveal the thermodynamic phase purity of the synthesized FAPbI 3 . The yellow powder shows high stability at ambient temperature, which is beneficial for long-term storage and commercialization. Single Powder versus Conventional Precursor Mixture. When preparing the coating solution, methylammonium chloride (MACl) is added for the purpose of enhancing the crystallinity and grain size of the perovskite.  27, 30  The 20 mol % MACl is optimal concentration, which is determined from the results of the dependence of photovoltaic performance on the MACl concentration (Figures  S2-S4  and Table  S1 ). It is noted in terms of the role of the additive MACl that MACl contributes to increasing the crystallinity and exists near the surface of FAPbI 3 rather than incorporation into FAPbI 3 . It is observed from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra that the onset wavelength of about 840 nm is not changed even after addition of MACl. The FAPbI 3 film characteristics and its photovoltaic performance are compared between the synthesized powder-based coating solution and the conventional precursor mixture-based one (PbI 2 with purity of 99.9985% is used for the precursor mixture method). The XRD pattern reveals that the powder-based solution produces a pure αphase FAPbI 3 film but the δ-phase FAPbI 3 at 11.4°and the unreacted PbI 2 coexist in the precursor mixture-based film (Figure  2a ). The absorption coefficient, obtained from UV-vis  
 ACS Energy Letters Letter spectra, is compared in Figure  2b . The sharp shoulder without a tail near the optical bandgap (1.55 eV) region is observed for the powder precursor case, while an additional absorption tail (called the Urbach tail) appears after the bandgap for the conventional precursor case. Absence of an Urbach tail for the powder-based FAPbI 3 film is indicative of no deep trap states, whereas a distinct Urbach tail for the conventional precursor mixture-based FAPbI 3 film underlines the presence of deep trap states.  31, 32  Little difference in Raman spectra (Figure  S5 ) is found, which indicates that the main chemical species in the solution are the same. In the Raman spectra for films, the powder-based FAPbI 3 shows the main peak position of 235 cm -1 , while a redshift to 226 cm -1 for the precursor mixturebased perovskite film is attributed to the small amount of δphase FAPbI 3 .  14, 33  Panels c and d of Figure  2  show steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL), where TRPL fitting results are obtained using a biexponential decay equation,  34, 35  and average lifetime (τ ave ) is estimated using a time constant and weight factor (Table  S2 ).  36  The steady-state PL intensity of the powder method is markedly higher than that of the conventional one. τ ave is also significantly enhanced from 142 to 306 ns, which implies that the FAPbI 3 film fabricated from the single powder-based solution has many fewer defects than the one using the conventional precursor mixture. We further measure the photocurrent mapping of the films formed on the FTO substrate using photocurrent atomic force microscopy (AFM),  37  where white light with different intensity (0%-80%) is illuminated on the film under bias voltage of 1 V (Figure  3 ). The two perovskite films show a similar morphology but a large difference in the surface photocurrent (Figure  3a, b ). Contrary to a large inhomogeneity in the surface photocurrent of the precursor mixture-based film, a highly homogeneous photocurrent is detected from the powder-based FAPbI 3 film. In Figure  3c , the average photocurrent of the perovskite film based on the powdered FAPbI 3 is higher than that of the one based on the conventional precursor in the dark conditions (0% light intensity). As LED light intensity increases from 20% to 80% of the maximum power, the powder-based FAPbI 3 film shows uniform current output at the given light intensity, while a large variation in current response is observed for the conventional precursor mixturebased one. Besides, the extent of increase in surface photocurrent with light intensity is lower for the powder case than for the precursor mixture one. Because the inhomogeneity of photocurrent is related to different crystal facets and the density of trap states,  37  uniform and steady increase in photocurrent for the powder case underlines that homogeneous crystal facets with controlled trap states are arranged on the surface of the powder-based perovskite film. The homogeneous surface current is attributed to phase stability and low FA defect of the powder-based FAPbI 3 film as confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis in Figure  S6 . It is noted from the TEM studies that the synthesized powder-based FAPbI 3 film in the device contains cubic perovskite α-phases without any sign of degradation and no trace amount of PbI 2 , while the precursor mixture-based one is already shown to be in the middle of degradation without observing the α-FAPbI 3 phase at all during e-beam irradiation of TEM measurements. Photovoltaic Performance and Reproducibility. Photovoltaic performance is investigated using a device structure of glass/ FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag (Figure  S7 ). No significant difference in the perovskite film morphology is observed by the cross-sectional SEM, while photovoltaic performance of the device based on the powder method is significantly higher than that of the one based on the precursor mixture method. Figure  4a  shows the reverse-scanned (RS)  
 ACS Energy Letters Letter and forward-scanned (FS) J-V curves measured under simulated one sun illumination (photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table  S3 ), where the powder-based FAPbI 3 exhibits higher V oc and FF. For the powder method, the RS PCE is 21.72% with J sc of 24.15 mA/cm 2 , V oc of 1.114 V, and FF of 0.808, while the precursor mixture method shows the RS PCE of 17.87% with J sc of 23.48 mA/cm 2 , V oc of 1.052 V, and FF of 0.723. The integrated J sc from EQE shows 24.44 and 23.71 mA/cm 2 for the powder method and the conventional precursor mixture one, respectively, which is well consistent with the measured J sc values (Figure  4b ). Light-dependent J sc and V oc are plotted in Figure  4c ,d to investigate recombination in device.  38  The slope in J sc versus light intensity (Figure  4c ) is calculated to be 1.00 and 1.03 for the powder and the precursor mixture cases, respectively, suggesting good dissociation probabilities at short-circuit conditions, indicative of negligible bimolecular recombination in the devices.  39  Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination is related to the slope of the light-dependent V oc ,  40  where SRH recombination becomes lower as the slope is close to unity. The powder-based device is estimated to be 1.48 kT/q, which is much lower than the 2.25 kT/q for the precursor mixture-based one (k is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, and q the electric charge). The results indicate that the powder-based device exhibits better junction and interfaces because of the highquality FAPbI 3 film with lower trap-assisted nonradiative recombination. The defect density of the powder-based perovskite film is estimated to be 0.84 × 10 16 cm -3 , which is 22% lower than that of the precursor mixture-based film (1.08 × 10 16 cm -3 ) as measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Figure  S8  and Table  S4 ). Little dependency of J-V hysteresis on the scan rate is observed for the powderbased device as compared with the precursor mixture-based one (Figure  4e ,f), which is attributed to fewer defects in the powder-based FAPbI 3 film.  41, 42  Photovoltaic parameters on scan rate-dependent data are summarized in Tables  S5  and S6 . To check the reproducibility of the powder precursor, 130 devices are fabricated in different batches. As shown in Figure  
 ACS Energy Letters Letter 4g, the average PCE of 20.71% is obtained from the reversescanned PCE of 21.30% (J sc = 23.71 mA/cm 2 , V oc = 1.12 V, and FF = 0.803) and the forward-scanned PCE of 20.11% (J sc = 23.70 mA/cm 2 , V oc = 1.09 V, and FF = 0.777). The certified quasi-steady-state PCE from the Newport PV Laboratory as a proxy for National Renewable Energy Laboratory is 21.07% (Figure  S9 ). Because the stability of the device is also an important issue, the stability is roughly estimated by measuring J-V of the devices stored in the dark with the relative humidity of about 20%. As shown in Figure  S10 , the PCE of the device retains 80% of the original PCE after 30 days. To compare the devices' operation stability under illumination, output PCEs are measured at maximum power point tracking under continuous one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW/cm 2 ) in ambient conditions (30% humidity) without any encapsulation for over 60 min. As shown in Figure  S11 , the PCE of the precursor mixture-based device decreases from 17.23% to 10.21% within 67 min, while the powder-based device retains over 92% of the initial PCE (PCE from 21.48% to 19.92%) after 100 min of illumination. This proves that the powder approach is better in stability than the precursor mixture method. For comparison, we also prepared PSC from the FAPbI 3 powder synthesized using the commercial PbI 2 with 95% purity. As shown in Figure  S12 , the FAPbI 3 powder synthesized using the low-grade PbI 2 results in PCEs of 21.96% and 20.54% for reverse and forward scan, respectively. This result indicates that the quality of the synthesized FAPbI 3 is independent of the purity of PbI 2 . We have explored materials for reproducible high-efficiency PSCs. The room-temperature-synthesized FAPbI 3 with δ-phase was found to be superior to the conventional precursor mixture in terms of PCE, reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, and underlying scalability. The reproducibility of photovoltaic performance for the PSCs fabricated based on the synthesized FAPbI 3 powder was attributed to composition stoichiometry and low defects in the resulting perovskite films. Average and certified PCEs of about 21% were obtained from the PSCs using the synthesized FAPbI 3 powder. Because FAPbI 3 was synthesized at room temperature and the synthesized powder was stable, the ""powder method"" is strongly believed to be a highly efficient approach toward the reproducible highefficiency and scalable PSCs and modules.

Effect of Annealing Temperature on Film Morphology of Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Pervoskite Solid-State Solar Cells
Figure S1. UV-vis absorption spectra for mTiO 2 films with pure PbI 2 (black) and perovskite annealed at 200°C (red). The sample annealed at 200°C has higher absorption between 500 and 800 nm due to the contribution from the perovskite in this region.
Introduction In the fi eld of solar energy conversion, thin fi lm solar photovoltaics have been the focus of research and development as a promising more cost-effective alternative to their silicon counterpart. This area of research extends over a wide range of concepts, materials and device mechanisms to achieve effi cient sunlight harvesting. There has been a recent surge of progress in the fi eld of thin fi lm solar cells focusing on the integration of three-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites in solar cell devices. The role of these types of material is reportedly complex; primarily as high extinction light absorbers,  [ 1, 2 ]  with additional contributions as hole  [ 3 ]  and electron transport material.  [ 4, 5 ]  A multitude of different deposition techniques and device architectures have been reported using this class of materials, but there exist basic similarities. Typically the perovskite material is deposited or formed on a type of mesoporous metal oxide scaffold, including nanoparticulate TiO 2 ,  [6] [7] [8]  Al 2 O 3 ,  [ 4, 5 ]  ZrO 2 [ 9,10 ] on top of which a hole transport material (HTM) is deposited. The most common HTM is the amorphous organic semiconductor spiro-MeOTAD  [ 2, 4, 5, 9, 11 ]  but high effi ciencies have also been achieved with polymer type HTMs.  [12] [13] [14]  Furthermore hole conductor free devices have been reported where the gold back contact is thermally evaporated directly on top of the perovskite-sensitized mesoporous TiO 2 fi lm.  [ 7 ]  Due to the recent increase in attention, the properties of the perovskite-based hybrid materials have been intensively investigated. The general formula of these perovskite materials is RNH 3 MX 3 , where RNH 3 (R = C n H 2 n +1 ) is the organic component and MX 3 (M = metal such as Pb or Sn, X = I, Br, or Cl) is the inorganic component.  [ 15 ]  Unlike other composite materials where inorganic and organic components are often either randomly arranged or have short-range order, the hybrid perovskite class of materials display longrange order in the crystal structure.  [ 16, 17 ]  They have long been of interest due to their unique optical, electronic and magnetic properties which can be further tailored by manipulation of the individual organic and inorganic components.  [18] [19] [20]  The solution processability of the organic-inorganic perovskite material is one of its major advantages, the simplest method of deposition requiring only a simple heating step to convert the deposited precursor solution (consisting of the organic and inorganic components) to the crystalline perovskite form. The morphology, stoichiometry and crystallinity of the material greatly infl uences the overall photovoltaic device performance. As such the deposition technique of the material is of crucial importance, as demonstrated by Burschka et al.  [ 8 ]  and Bi et al.,  [ 9 ]  which also includes all the treatments and conditions the material is exposed to as part of and/or following the conversion to the fi nal perovskite form. The quality and nature of the perovskite layer formed is critical for high effi ciency solar cells. Recent reports have demonstrated PCEs of over 15% from a planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell  [ 21 ]  which is attributed to the formation of extremely uniform fl at fi lms of the mixed halide perovskite CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3-x Cl x by vapor deposition. This indicates that the perovskite absorbers can result in high 
 Effect of Annealing Temperature on Film Morphology of Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Pervoskite Solid-State Solar Cells case of high annealing temperatures (>150 °C) the conversion was observed to occur almost instantaneously and in the case for temperatures above 200 °C to quickly convert to yellow. The exact amount of time used for the annealing of the perovskite fi lms at different temperatures is presented in Table  1  . 
 Ultraviolet-Visible Absorption The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the perovskite material deposited on mTiO 2 and annealed at different temperatures are presented in Figure  1  . The samples annealed at 80 to 150 °C show the typical absorption spectrum of the perovskite CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 as reported.  [ 1, 4, 7, 11 ]  Increasing the annealing temperature of the perovskite from 60 to 100 °C shows an increase in the absorbance across the entire spectral range, indicating that the extent of conversion is considerably lower at such low annealing temperatures. This is further highlighted by the extremely low absorbance of samples that were simply dried at ambient room temperatures without further heat-treatment. This latter case demonstrates that removal of the solvent from the fi lm is insuffi cient to form the perovskite from these precursors and that energy is required to drive this conversion. This is confi rmed by the lack of the features associated with the absorbance of PbI 2 corresponding to a peak at 500 nm or the perovskite absorption onset at 770 nm, which indicates that these dried precursor fi lms contain only PbCl 2 and CH 3 NH 3 I. The samples annealed at 80 °C show an additional absorption shoulder at 590 nm. The origin of this feature remains unclear. However it could be related to the broad absorption observed for the samples dried at 60 °C between 570 and 640 nm. Taking this exception into account the samples annealed at 100 °C showed the highest absorbance. Further increasing the annealing temperature leads not only to a decrease in absorbance but also the additional appearance of PbI 2 absorption feature at 500 nm (see Figure  S1  Supporting Information for pure PbI 2 spectra). For samples heated at 200 °C the perovskite characteristics are almost no longer distinguishable and the spectra resembles that of pure PbI 2 with slightly higher PCEs in the simplest planar device confi guration, but is heavily dependent on the nature of the perovskite fi lm formed. In this work the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite used as light absorber is deposited onto to the mTiO 2 by spin-coating from a 1:3 molar ratio solution of PbCl 2 and CH 3 NH 3 I in dimethylformamide (DMF) following the procedure reported by Lee et al.  [ 4 ]  In the standard case these fi lms are subsequently annealed at 100 °C for 45 min leading to the formation of the lead-iodide based perovskite material. Here, we investigate the effect and importance of the annealing temperature during the fi nal conversion step, relating it to the perovskite fi lm morphology and its infl uence on the device working mechanisms. These perovskite fi lms formed are analyzed using ultravioletvisible absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. This exposes the role of the annealing temperature of the perovskite on its fi lm composition and morphology. The variation of the annealing temperature during the perovskite conversion step was correlated with the photovoltaic performance of solid-state solar cells using spiro-MeOTAD as HTM and further examined by impedance spectroscopy (IS) to gain better understanding of the internal electrical parameters under working conditions. 
 Results and Discussion For most of the techniques where the perovskite material is deposited from solution, a subsequent heat treatment of the fi lm is required. This has the dual purpose of removing any excess solvent remaining in the fi lm as well as facilitating the formation of the perovskite crystal structure. Contrary to the case when PbI 2 is used as a precursor as reported by Kim et al.  [ 2 ]  which requires only 10 minutes of heating at 100 °C to complete the conversion to the fi nal perovskite form, when PbCl 2 is used the conversion is complete only after annealing the material for 45 minutes like reported by Lee et al.  [ 4 ]  We investigated the effect of the variation of the annealing temperature of the perovskite fi lms after deposition by spin-coating. The conversion to the fi nal perovskite was regarded as complete once the fi lm showed a stable absorption profi le resulting in a uniform black color. For low temperatures this conversion took considerably longer, 3 h at 80 °C relative to 45 min at 100 °C. At 60 °C, even when left for more than 20 h the conversion was not complete as indicated by poorer fi lm coloration. In the    clear crystalline structure typically observed for such perovskite materials. As the annealing temperature is increased to 80 °C there is a drastic change in the appearance of the fi lm formed. The typical structure of the perovskite is visible. The coverage of the mTiO 2 is much higher and the shape of the individual crystallites is much better defi ned. The fi lm formed upon annealing at 100 °C is relatively similar in appearance to that formed at 80 °C (Figure  2 b, c ) even though the time for the conversion process is longer at 80 °C. Furthermore, the gaps between the perovskite crystallites is slightly larger in the case of 100 °C. Increasing the annealing temperature to 120 °C the morphology of the perovskite adopts a larger individual size for the islands of material (Figure  2 d ). They no longer form a densely interconnected network, but rather larger islands with bigger gaps in between, resulting in seemingly larger uncovered mTiO 2 areas. Here is important to note that it is believed that these ""exposed mTiO 2 "" areas are still covered by a thin layer of perovskite material, hence revealing the structure of the mTiO 2 underneath (see cross sectional image in Figure  2 h ). As the annealing temperature is further increased, the size of perovskite islands becomes larger and furthermore internal structuring becomes discernable (Figure  2 e-g ). This is most extreme at the highest annealing temperature investigated (200 °C). Hence, Figure  2  clearly shows that the morphology of the perovskite fi lm formed is signifi cantly infl uenced by the annealing temperature. light absorption between 600 and 800 nm. This confi rms that the yellow colour of these fi lms is due to the formation of PbI 2 at these high temperatures. This is in agreement with surface photovoltage spectroscopy measurements made by Supasai et al.  [ 22 ]  where the appearance of the PbI 2 bandgap after heating CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 samples above 140 °C was observed. The absorption onset of the perovskite remains constant for samples annealed between 60 and 175 °C, indicating that the optical bandgap of the perovskite is unaffected by the annealing temperatures. This further confi rms that the nature of the perovskite formed is unchanged by the annealing temperature and is found to be in good agreement with the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite. For the samples treated at ambient temperatures (where there is no formation of perovskite) or at very high temperatures (where the formation of PbI 2 is dominant), the perovskite bandgap absorption onset is not visible. 
 Scanning Electron Microscopy The infl uence of the annealing temperature on the morphology and structure of the perovskite layer formed on the mTiO 2 were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For samples annealed at 60 °C no homogeneous fi lm was formed, rather large islands of precursor material (PbCl 2 and CH 3 NH 3 I) are seen ( Figure  2 a ). This is validated as the islands lack the indicates that the conversion, while incomplete, does take place to a small extent at these low annealing temperatures. If we recall the SEM image for the corresponding sample prepared at 60 °C, the islands of material observed can be confi rmed to consist largely of dried precursors, with only a small proportion being converted to perovskite material. Once the annealing temperature is increased to 80 °C, the peaks for the precursors are no longer present and only the peaks for the perovskite material remain. As has been shown by Poglitsch et al.,  [ 26 ]  the CH 3 NH 3 + cation cannot be fi xed in the crystal structure due to the disordered orientation and mobility of the cation in the crystal. As in the case of the SEM images, the XRD diffractograms for the sample annealed at 100 °C shows little difference to the 80 °C sample. As the annealing temperature is increased to 175 °C, the intensity of the perovskite (110), (220), and (330) peaks increases due to an increased conversion rate. From previous work it is known that this perovskite material shows a tendency for preferential orientation with the a -axis.  [ 4, 24, 26, 27 ]  The increase in intensity of the refl ections from the row of reciprocal lattice normal to the fi lm plane suggests increased orientation of the perovskite crystalline domains with increases in annealing temperature. Similar observations were made for AlN fi lms,  [ 28 ]  ZnO fi lms prepared by sol-gel techniques and then exposed to different heat treatments  [ 29 ]  and FePt thin fi lms with face-centered-tetragonal (001) texture.  [ 30 ]  Another origin of the observed increased intensity of the peak intensity may arise from the phenomenon of microabsorption, where larger crystallite phases preferentially interact with the diffracting beam, thus leading to a distortion of the diffraction intensities. For heat treatments at 200 °C the intensity of the perovskite is decreased and is explained by the decrease in material formed at these high temperatures. In addition, for annealing temperatures above 120 °C a set of peaks that have been identifi ed as belonging to PbI 2 appear.  [ 8, 31 ]  Hence, at lower temperatures, the conversion to the perovskite dominates following Reaction ( ) , however at higher annealing temperatures, there is the additional formation of PbI 2 (Reaction 2).  [ 22 ]  + → + PbCl 3CH NH I CH NH PbI 2CH NH Cl (1) + → + + PbCl 3CH NH I PbI CH NH I 2CH NH Cl 2 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 (2) → + + CH NH PbI PbI CH NH HI 3 3 3 2 3 2 (3) The perovskite crystal material has been reported to be stable up to 300 °C, at which point the organic component decomposes, leaving behind the inorganic PbI 2 following Reaction 3 .  [ 14, 32 ]  However recent studies  [ 22 ]  show that the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite begins to transform to PbI 2 at temperatures signifi cantly below 300 °C (140 °C). In this study the perovskite is not yet As the annealing temperature is increased it can be assumed that the rate of perovskite crystallization is similarly increased. High temperatures resulted in the rapid growth from a few nucleation sites leading to the formation of large crystalline islands and the associated large gaps in between. Lower temperatures on the other hand allowed the formation and subsequent crystal growth from a large number of nucleation sites, leading to the formation of smaller islands. 
 X-Ray Diffraction X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted to investigate the nature of the material formed following the annealing process. As expected, low annealing temperatures result in the incomplete conversion to the perovskite ( Figure  3  ). The XRD diffractrograms for samples dried at ambient temperature for > 20 h exhibit a large number of peaks that are mainly attributed to the precursor materials. The presence of PbCl 2 peaks (indicated by circles in Figure  3  and in Figure  S3  in Supporting Information) indicate that simply drying the fi lms to remove the excess solvent is insuffi cient to convert the precursor solution to the desired perovskite material. In addition to the PbCl 2 peaks there are several peaks that remain unidentifi ed. These could be attributed to the possible formation of products such as lead(II) oxychloride  [ 23 ]  arising due to the slow drying in the presence of water. Heating at 60 °C for > 20 h also still shows strong evidence of the presence of these precursor materials. However, in this case, a set of additional peaks appears (indicated by stars), matching those reported for the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 crystallized in the tetragonal perovskite structure.  [ 7, 24, 25 ]  The peaks at 14.17, 28.49, and 43.27° are respectively assigned to the (110), (  220 ) and (330) planes. The presence of these peaks  As the annealing temperature is increased further above 100 °C, the V OC is observed to decrease signifi cantly, leading to a fall in PCE. The J SC remains high up to an annealing temperature of 150 °C (17.96 mA cm -2 ) before it too decreases. This trend can be explained by the formation of PbI 2 at these high temperatures instead of perovskite as seen in the UV-vis and the XRD measurements. As a consequence the light harvesting abilities of the material is reduced, resulting in the decrease in J SC and V OC . The trend in the J SC is refl ected in the UV-vis absorption and the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) (Supporting Information Figure  S4 ) spectra measured for the samples. The IPCE spectral shape is similar for samples annealed at 60 to 100 °C, and in good agreement to that reported for the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite.  [ 8 ]  The intensity of the IPCE response refl ects the amount of perovskite formed and hence is a measure of the extent of perovskite conversion, lowest for devices annealed at 60 °C and highest for 100 °C. Higher annealing temperatures not only lead to a decrease in the IPCE intensity but also to a change in the spectral shape, displaying a decrease in the region between 400 and 650 nm. This is attributed to the competitive light absorption from the additional formation of PbI 2 . 
 Impedance Spectroscopy In order to determine the origin for the decrease in the V OC of the devices as the temperature for the perovskite annealing is increased from 100 °C, impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements were conducted on the completed devices. This technique provides valuable insight into the internal electrical parameters of the solar cells under working conditions. Using the model developed in our previous work,  [ 33 ]  the impedance data were fi tted accordingly. The high frequency feature corresponding to the charge transfer resistance between the back contact and the HTM, as well as any charge transport formed prior to exposure to the annealing temperature and hence there are additional factors to consider. The excess organic CH 3 NH 3 Cl formed in this reaction is believed to sublime, thus leaving only the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite on the mTiO 2 fi lm as observed in the XRD measurements. The rate of sublimation of the organic species CH 3 NH 3 Cl will increase with temperature, as will that of the precursor CH 3 NH 3 I, thus driving Reaction 2 in addition to Reaction 1 . From these measurements it becomes evident that formation of the perovskite fi lms is composed of multiple processes; solvent vaporization, perovskite crystallization and the sublimation of excess organic CH 3 NH 3 Cl need to take place. These processes occur simultaneously and their relative rates determine the composition of the fi nal fi lm and contribute to the different fi lm morphologies observed in the SEM images above. 
 Photovoltaic Performance Solid-state solar cells were fabricated using the perovskite as sensitizer and spiro-MeOTAD as hole-transport material. The perovskite material was deposited as described from solution containing a 1:3 molar ratio of PbCl 2 and CH 3 NH 3 I in DMF and annealed at different temperatures followed by the subsequent deposition of the hole-transport material (HTM) by spincoating. The current-voltage ( J-V ) characteristics measured under standard AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm -2 ) of these devices are presented in Figure  4  , the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of which are summarized in Table  2  . A clear correlation is observed between the annealing temperature of the perovskite and the photovoltaic performance of the devices. Samples that were annealed at 100 °C gave the highest power conversion effi ciency (PCE), 11.66%, as a result of the highest open-circuit potential ( V OC ) and short-current density ( J SC ), 938 mV and 18.37 mA cm -2 respectively. At low annealing temperatures (60 °C) both of these parameters are decreased as a consequence of incomplete conversion to the Table  2 . Photovoltaic performance parameters extracted from J-V measurements under standard AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm -2 ) of devices using different annealing temperatures. All devices were masked to achieve an illuminated area of 0.285 cm 2 .  This exponential behavior of the chemical capacitance is characteristic for such nanostructured materials and has been extensively reported.  [34] [35] [36] [37]  In the region of low forward bias, where the current fl ows over the blocking underlayer, the behavior of the chemical capacitance is similar for all devices, exhibiting a small increase in capacitance with increasing forward bias. As in the other measurements, the samples prepared at 100 °C and 80 °C behave relatively similar, with the exception that at very high forward bias, the chemical capacitance for the device annealed at 100 °C does not continue to increase, but instead shows a leveling off. Increasing the temperature further shows that the chemical capacitance deviates from its exponential increase at progressively lower forward bias. While for samples heated at 175 °C the chemical capacitance still shows some initial increase before remaining constant, annealing the perovskite at 200 °C resulted in the chemical capacitance displaying no considerable increase at all. In the case of bulk heterojunctions devices, the capacitance has been observed to behave similarly, here the decrease of the capacitance at high forward applied bias was attributed to the formation of an injection limitation.  [ 38, 39 ]  These types of devices show Schottky diode behavior at the metal-semiconductor contact. For Schottky diodes, the barrier height of this junction can limit the injection of the minority carrier under moderate to large forward bias thus determining the minority carrier concentration in the bulk semiconductor material.  [ 40 ]  Due to this injection limitation the charge collection is reduced and leads to the formation of a peak in the capacitance instead of increasing indefi nitely with increasing forward bias. Furthermore this might evolve into a strong negative capacitive component.  [ 40 ]  In the systems under consideration here injection of electrons from and to the mTiO 2 is dependent on the energy level alignment between the conduction bands of the mTiO 2 and the perovskite material. The conduction band (CB) energy for the perovskite material has been reported to be only very slightly higher than that of mTiO 2 (-3.93 eV and -4.00 eV below vacuum level for the perovskite and TiO 2 respectively).  [ 2 ]  Hence any upward shift of the CB of TiO 2 or downward shift of the CB of the perovskite would result in an injection barrier and thus prevent charge build up in the mTiO 2 . When high forward bias is applied in the dark, the CB in the mTiO 2 is unpinned. The upward shift of the CB of the mTiO 2 at high forward bias will lead to a misalignment of the energy levels. The behavior of the chemical capacitance was observed to be similar under illumination, while the recombination resistance showed the expected decrease in magnitude (see Supporting Information Figure  S5 ). A misalignment of the bands could possibly arise due to the increasing proportion of PbI 2 that forms with increasing annealing temperature. It is possible that the PbI 2 acts as a sink for charges injected from the perovskite, preventing the buildup within the mTiO 2 and accounting for the energy level misalignment. This is clearly shown in the case for samples annealed at 200 °C which contain a high proportion of PbI 2 . The capacitance does not show any signifi cant increase indicating that there is no injection from and into the mTiO 2 and thus no buildup of charges in the mTiO 2 . resistance within the HTM (if insuffi ciently doped) was found to remain more or less unchanged regardless of the annealing temperature used. This work focused on the intermediate to low frequency region in which the transport and recombination of charges manifests. Figure  5  shows the recombination resistance, R ct and associated chemical capacitance, C μ determined from the impedance measurements conducted on devices in the dark. As can be seen the behavior of the recombination resistance remains relatively similar for all devices, no matter the annealing temperature used. This however is not the case for the chemical capacitance. In the case where the perovskite was heated at 80 °C the chemical capacitance shows the typical behavior expected of such devices. At low forward bias, where the mesoporous TiO 2 is insulating and the charges fl ow through the compact TiO 2 underlayer, the associated capacitance of this interface is low. As the applied bias increases and the mesoporous TiO 2 becomes conductive (usually at an applied bias >400 mV), the chemical capacitance increases exponentially.  
 Conclusions In this work, we investigated the role of the annealing temperature used in the conversion process to form the perovskite material from the deposited precursor solution. This parameter was found to have critical impact on the formed perovskite fi lm morphology and thus the power conversion effi ciency of the solar cells fabricated. The fi lm morphology was examined by UV-vis spectroscopy, SEM imaging and XRD, which all indicate that a minimum temperature of 80 °C is required to suffi ciently form the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite. Using lower temperatures or simply drying the mTiO 2 fi lm after the perovskite precursor solution is deposited leads to incomplete conversion. These low temperatures remove the solvent from the solution, leaving the dried precursors on the fi lm, but are insuffi cient to lead to the perovskite formation, thus indicating that there is an energy requirement (endothermic reaction) to the formation of the perovskite. On the other hand as the perovskite annealing temperature is increased, the fi lm morphology undergoes clear changes forming distinct islands of materials on the surface of the fi lm that display internal structuring as the temperature is increased further. This is accompanied by an increased amount of PbI 2 content in the fi lm, as seen in the XRD measurements and in the UV-vis spectra. These changes in fi lm morphology are correlated with the photovoltaic performance of solid-state solar cells. The highest performance was achieved for devices fabricated using an annealing temperature between 80 and 100 °C, which corresponds to samples that showed complete conversion of the precursors to the perovskite, with no additional PbI 2 formation, as well as a fi lm morphology consisting of a type of interconnected network of perovskite crystallites. Furthermore these conditions showed the highest absorbance (a direct result of the extent of perovskite conversion) leading to the highest shortcurrent density. IS spectroscopy was used to further examine the internal electrical processes within these devices and gain a better understanding of the role of the fi lm morphology and perovskite conversion mechanism on the device performance. A clear trend in the chemical capacitance was observed. Increasing the annealing temperature of the perovskite led to deviation from the typical exponential behavior of the chemical capacitance at high forward bias. This is believed to be due to a misalignment of the energy levels and the formation of a barrier at the mTiO 2 at high forward bias. This effect becomes more dominant and occurs at lower forward applied bias as the annealing temperature is increased, until the capacitance is observed to not increase at all for the devices with the perovskite annealed at 200 °C. This can be correlated with the increasing PbI 2 content within the perovskite material and the increasing size of the perovskite crystallite islands formed on the mTiO 2 fi lm. The formation of PbI 2 at higher annealing temperatures may moreover act as a sink for the charges, thus limiting the injection of charges to and from the mTiO 2 . Hence, in this investigation, we have highlighted the importance of the perovskite formation mechanism on the perovskite fi lm morphology and consequently on the solar cell device performance, through intensive characterization of the perovskite fi lm formed and of the solar cells fabricated. We The peak in the chemical capacitance, before the observed decrease at high forward bias occurs at lower applied potential as the annealing temperature of the perovskite is increased. This indicates that the misalignment of the energy levels and the formation of a barrier at the mTiO 2 occur at lower applied forward bias. The chemical capacitance is directly proportional to the density of trap states (DOS) within the mTiO 2 . Figure  6  shows the electron lifetime plotted against the chemical capacitance, thus allowing for direct comparison of the lifetimes at similar DOS. The electron lifetime, τ n can be determined from the chemical capacitance and the recombination, τ n = C μ × R ct . As can be seen from Figure  6  the electron lifetime decreases as the annealing temperature is increased from 80 to 200 °C. This clearly refl ects the evolution of the opencircuit potential extracted from the J-V characteristics for devices made using increasing annealing temperatures. These displayed an initial increase in V OC as the annealing temperature increased up to 100 °C corresponding to incomplete conversion to the perovskite material at low temperatures. This was subsequently followed by a decrease in V OC as the annealing temperature is further increased. The electron lifetime of the devices was observed to be longest for devices annealed at 80 and 100 °C, steadily decreasing as temperatures increase to 200 °C. Similarly devices treated at 60 °C also showed a lower electron lifetime, arising from the incomplete conversion of the precursors to the perovskite material. From the observations made from the IS measurements it is possible to deduce that the heat treatment of the perovskite precursors at too high temperatures changes the energy levels within the formed perovskite material in such a way as to hinder the electron injection from and into the mTiO 2 at high forward bias. It remains unclear whether this is due to the change in morphology of the formed perovskite fi lm or due to the increasing proportion of PbI 2 formed. Finally the perovskite material itself may infl uence the conduction band position of the mesoporous TiO 2 . (Panalytical) operated in BRAGG-BRENTANO geometry, using a RTMS X'Celerator detector, a ceramic tube (Cu anode, λ = 1.54060 Å) and a secondary graphite (002) monochromator. No further modifi cation was made to mount to the samples and adjustments were made to the automatic divergence slit and the beam mask to account for the dimensions of the sample fi lms. An acquisition time of 7.5 min deg -1 was employed with a step size of 0.008°. Photovoltaic Characterization : The current-voltage characteristics were determined using a digital source meter (Keithley Model 2400) to apply an external potential bias to the solar cells and measuring the generated photocurrent. The emission spectrum from a 450 W xenon lamp (Oriel) was matched to the standard AM1.5G using a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight fi lter (Praezisions Glas & Optik GmbH). The exact light intensities of the measurements were determined using a calibrated Si diode as reference. The IPCE spectra were recorded as a function of the wavelength using a Model SR830 DSP Lock-In Amplifi er (Stanford Research Systems). The excitation beam was provided by a 300 W Xenon lamp (ILC technology), focused through a Gemini-180 double monochromator (Jobin Yvon Ltd.) and chopped at approximately 2 Hz. Impedance Spectroscopy : A Bio-Logic SP300 potentiostat was used to conduct the impedance measurements. A sinusoidal AC potential perturbation of 15 mV was overlaid on an applied DC potential bias over a frequency range of 7 MHz to 0.1 Hz. The applied DC potential bias was step wise changed by approximately 50 mV from 850 to 0 mV. Measurements were conducted in the dark and under illumination using an LED light source. The ZView software (Scribner Associates Inc.) was used to fi t the impedance spectra. have investigated only the infl uence of one parameter, the annealing temperature used in the conversion process in the one-step method from a perovskite precursor solution of PbCl 2 and CH 3 NH 3 I (1:3 molar ratio) in DMF. While the fi lm morphology of the perovskite is highly dependent on the deposition techniques and the precursor solutions used as previously stated, the additional formation of the PbI 2 at higher annealing temperatures and the associated trends observed in the device photovoltaic performance and working mechanisms is believed to be general for the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite, regardless of the deposition process. In order to achieve high power conversion effi ciencies, it is necessary to not only consider the choice of deposition technique, but also the conditions the perovskite fi lm is treated and/or exposed to. In this study the annealing process was found to be critical in the perovskite fi lm formation and consequently on the power conversion effi ciency of the ensuing devices assembled. 
 Experimental Section Materials : All chemicals purchased from Sigma-Aldrich were used as received. The hole transport material, Spiro-MeOTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis( N,N -dip -methoxy-phenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifl uorene) was purchased from Merck and used as received. CH 3 NH 3 I was synthesized in our laboratory. Device Fabrication : The desired electrode confi guration was laser etched onto fl uorine-doped tin-oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates (TEC 15, Pilkington), which were then cleaned by mechanical scrubbing with Hellmanex, ultrasonifi cation and ozone cleaning. The TiO 2 blocking underlayer was deposited by spray pyrolysis at 450 °C of the precursor solution, diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) diluted in ethanol (1:20 volume ratio), using oxygen as a carrier gas. The fi lms were exposed to a TiCl 4 treatment using an aqueous solution of TiCl 4 (20 mM) for 30 min at 70 °C before sintering at 500 °C for 20 min. TiO 2 paste (Dyesol 18NR-T) was diluted by ethanol at 1:3.5 by weight and deposited on the substrates by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s prior to stepwise heating to 500 °C at which they were sintered for 15 min. Immediately afterwards the mesoporous TiO 2 (mTiO 2 ) fi lms were transferred into a dry box and all following deposition processes were conducted under dry atmosphere (less than 5% humidity). The perovskite precursor solution was prepared as reported by Lee et al.  [ 4 ]  PbCl 2 and CH 3 NH 3 I were dissolved in dimethylformamide in a 1:3 molar ratio. This solution was deposited on the mTiO 2 by spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 30 s and then heat treated at different temperatures as described in the manuscript, Table  1  . The hole transport material (HTM) solution consisted of spiro-MeOTAD (0.05 M ) dissolved in chlorobenzene, oxidized by the addition of 5% molar ratio of cobalt(III) dopant, tris(2-(1 H -pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tertbutylpyridine)cobalt(III)-tris(bis(trifluoro-methyl-sulfonyl)-imide)), coded FK209. Finally tert -butylpyridine (TBP) (0.2 M ) and Li[(CF 3 SO 2 ) 2 N] (LiTFSI) (0.03 M ) were added. The HTM solution was deposited on the perovskite sensitized fi lms by spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Thermal evaporation was used to deposit Au (60 nm) for the back contact. The complete device fabrication was conducted under controlled dry conditions with humidity levels of less than 5%.

Gradient Energy Alignment Engineering for Planar Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 23%

Organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have a great potential for commercialization owing to their low cost and superior performance.  [1]  Over the past decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has increased from 3.8%  [2]  to 25.2%,  [3]  approaching the record efficiency of 26.7% of crystalline silicon solar cells,  [4]  and becoming one of the most promising candidates for the nextgeneration efficient and low-cost photovoltaic devices.  [5]  For example, Seok and co-workers introduced additional iodide intoprecursor solutions, resulting in a certified PCE of 22.1%.  [6]  Recently, Kim et al. investigated the effects of methylammonium chloride (MACl) on the performance of perovskite films and fabricated a device that achieved a certified PCE of 23.5%.  [7]  It is important to note that all these efficient devices were fabricated with high-temperature-processed TiO 2 mesoporous structures, thus limiting their widespread application. Developing low-temperature-processed electron-transport layer (ETL)  [8]  for planar structure devices is of great importance.  [9]  Among them, TiO 2 ,  [10]  SnO 2 ,  [11]  and [6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)  [12]  are the most commonly used ones. The lower efficiency of devices based on planar structures is closely related to insufficient charge extraction  [13]  and imperfect interfacial band alignment.  [14]  The insufficient charge extraction between perovskite and ETL can result in charge accumulation, which negatively affects device performance.  [15]  Therefore, sufficient charge extraction is one of the most important contributors for device efficiency.  [16]  Recently, researchers have focused on the use of bilayer ETL,  [17]  and the bilayer stack structure has been demonstrated to be effective for improving device efficiency. As early as 2014,  [18]  Snaith and co-workers have shown that PSCs with C 60 -modified TiO 2 can significantly enhance electron transfer and result in a largely improved performance of 17.3% and a decrease in hysteretic behavior. Petrozza and co-workers demonstrated that insufficient charge extraction from the perovskite film to the ETL can be remedied using a TiO 2 /PCBM bilayer ETL, and a PCE of 17.9% was achieved.  [19]  Recently, Choi and co-workers achieved a PCE of 21.1% using SnO 2 @TiO 2 ETL,  [20]  and Kong and co-workers showed a PCE of 21.4% using the same type of ETL.  [21]  Numerous other efforts have been undertaken to enhance the performance of PSCs with bilayer ETLs, such as SnO 2 @TiO 2 ,  [22]  SnO 2 /PCBM,  [23]   SnO 2 /MgO,  [24]  TiO 2 /In 2 O 3 ,  [25]  MgO/TiO 2 ,  [17]  TiO 2 /ZnO,  [26]  and ZrO 2 /TiO 2 .  [27]  In contrast, the V OC of PSCs generally depends to a large extent on the energy level of the ETL for a specific bandgap material. Well-matched energy alignment between the ETL and perovskite films enhances charge transfer, and reduces interfacial recombination for efficient PSCs.  [28]  Therefore, controlling the energy level of the ETL is also beneficial for improving the performance of PSCs. However, planar devices are still less efficient than mesoporous devices. 
 An electron-transport layer (ETL) with appropriate energy alignment and enhanced charge transfer is critical for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, interfacial energy level mismatch limits the electrical performance of PSCs, particularly the open-circuit voltage (V OC ). Herein, a simple low Here, we introduce a simple low-temperature solutionprocessed In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 bilayer ETL for efficient planar PSCs. We demonstrate that uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films can be obtained by the introduction of In 2 O 3 . The band energy alignment can be also tailored with increased built-in potential, resulting in an enhanced electric field for the separation of carriers and enhanced charge transfer, as well as reduced carrier recombination. The planar PSC utilizing In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 ETL demonstrated a higher efficiency of 23.24% with negligible hysteresis and 22.74% stable power output compared with a SnO 2based device that has an efficiency of 21.42%. In addition, the In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 -based PSC maintains 97.5% of its initial PCE after being stored under N 2 for 80 days without encapsulation and retain 91% of their initial PCE after 180 h under 1 sun continuous illumination.  contact with ITO, improving the electrical performance of resulting devices.  [29]  To further demonstrate the influence of In 2 O 3 , top-view SEM images of the perovskite films were examined. As shown in Figure  1e ,f, uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films with larger grain sizes can be obtained when deposited on the In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 ETL substrate than on SnO 2 ETL. The grain size of perovskite films is increased by an average of around 200 nm (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information) with the incorporation of In 2 O 3 . Pinholes on the surface of the films will reduce the shunt resistance and lead to recombination,  [30]  which are detrimental to the performance of devices. Moreover, the RMS roughness of corresponding films was significantly reduced from 44 to 33 nm (Figure  S5  Uniform and compact perovskite films lay the foundation for efficient PSCs. To better understand the variations in properties of the deposited perovskite films after introducing of In 2 O 3 , XRD was performed. Figure  2a  shows the XRD patterns of the films based on different ETLs. The strong intensity of the XRD peaks is related to better crystallization. So a better crystal film was obtained which is consistent with SEM results. The optical absorption spectra of these two films were measured by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. Figure  2b  shows that the presence of In 2 O 3 does not affect the absorption edge of perovskite films while slightly increasing the absorption intensity. The bandgap of both films extracted from Tauc plots shows an identical value of 1.53 eV (Figure  S7 , Supporting Information). In order to determine the dynamics of charge transfer and the extraction characteristics of different ETLs, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy were performed. As shown in Figure  2c  The radiative recombination rate from photoinduced carriers competing with nonradiative loss  [31]  plays a key role in the recombination process. In Figure  3b  shows the reverse and forward J-V scans of the devices. The device based on In 2 O 3 shows the lowest performance with a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 24.10 mA cm -2 , V OC of 1.10 V, fill factor (FF) of 72.52%, and PCE of 19.21%. SnO 2 ETL-based devices have a typical J SC of 24.26 mA cm -2 , V OC of 1.13 V, FF of 78.14%, and PCE of 21.42% (reverse scanning). By introducing In 2 O 3 , the performance of devices can be improved significantly. Further characterization shows that the optimum concentration of In 2 O 3 precursor solution is 0.05 m (Figure  S10  and Table  S1 , Supporting Information). Devices based on In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 ETL show a J SC of 24.53 mA cm -2 , V OC of 1.16 V, FF of 81.23%, and PCE of 23.07% with negligible hysteresis (Table  1 ). Therefore, our devices have good reproducibility. As shown in Figure  S11  (Supporting Information), 60 devices with different ETLs were fabricated. The PCEs of devices based on SnO 2 ETL range from 18.60% to 21.17%,    S12  (Supporting Information). The results discussed above reveal that device performance improvement is mainly due to the enhancement of FF and V OC . The hysteresis of the devices was also suppressed by the introduction of In 2 O 3 . Previous studies have demonstrated that hysteresis is mainly caused by ion migration  [32]  and charge transfer at the interface.  [4]  In order to further understand the effect of In 2 O 3 , the band structures of In 2 O 3 and SnO 2 were measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS; Figures  S13  and S14 , Supporting Information). The optical bandgap values of In 2 O 3 and SnO 2 determined by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy are 3.8 and 3.9 eV, respectively (Figure  S6a, d , Supporting Information). The calculated conduction band minimum (E CB ) is -4.55 eV for In 2 O 3 and -4.20 eV for SnO 2 (Figure  S14 , Supporting Information). According to previous studies, the E CB of ITO is about -4.7 eV.  [33]  The presence of In 2 O 3 with a deeper conduction band matches SnO 2 and ITO well, which is beneficial to a higher V OC (Figure  3c ). To further elucidate the possible mechanism responsible for the enhancement of V OC and FF, capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements were also taken. As shown in Figure  3d , the device based on the In 2 O 3 / SnO 2 bilayer has a smaller slope in the linear Mott-Schottky curve and the built-in potentials (V bi ) based on In 2 O 3 , SnO 2 , and In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 are ≈915, 935, and 985 mV, respectively. A higher V bi means stronger electric field in the perovskite which is beneficial for enhancing charge transfer,  [34]  resulting in suppressed hysteresis and more efficient devices.  [35]  The performance of PSCs is highly affected by the quality of perovskite films. Excellent contact between interfaces originating from uniform and compact films may be one of the reasons for the higher FF. In order to determine the origin of V OC and FF improvements, the trap density of prepared films with different ETLs was evaluated. So, electron-only devices with the ITO/ETL/perovskite/PCBM/bathocuproine (BCP)/Au structure were fabricated. As shown in Figure  3e , the current density reveals an Ohmic-type response at low bias. The cross point is defined as the trap-filled limit voltage (V TFL ), when the bias voltage is higher than the V TFL . The trap density can be determined by V TFL using the following equation n trap = 2εε 0 V TFL /eL 2 .  [31]  The trap density is proportional to V TFL . The results show that the trap density of film deposited on In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 is lower than that of the film deposited on SnO 2 . This is due to low nonradiative recombination and results in a higher V OC . In addition, the dark J-V curves (Figure  S15 , Supporting Information) of the devices based on SnO 2 and In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 indicate that the J 0 decreased with the presence of In 2 O 3 , which means low leakage current density. Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) determined the dynamics of charge transfer in PSCs.  [36]  It is well known that the high-frequency component represents the transfer resistance (R tr ) and the low-frequency component indicates the recombination resistance (R re ). Small R tr is beneficial to electron extraction, and large R re means less charge recombination.  [37]  Figure  3f  shows the Nyquist plots of cells with different ETLs under dark conditions, and the equivalent circuit diagram and specific parameters of devices based on SnO 2 and In 2 O 3 / SnO 2 are shown in Figure  S16  and Table  S2  in the Supporting Information, respectively. The R re of devices based on In 2 O 3 / SnO 2 is significantly larger than that of SnO 2 , meaning low recombination rates and resulting in enhanced FF and V OC . An optimized device with a PCE of 23.24% was successfully fabricated (Figure  4a ). Significantly, this device demonstrates a high voltage of 1.17 V with only 0.36 V loss in potential. This is one of the highest voltages demonstrated by an n-i-p planar structure (1.53 eV). Moreover, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 -based device was measured (Figure  4b ). The integrated current density is 24.34 mA cm -2 , matching well with the values from J-V characterization. The steady-state efficiency at maximum power point tracking (MPP) of the optimized PSC was also measured. The maximum voltage for the devices with In 2 O 3 is 0.98 V, and the maximum current density is 23.2 mA cm -2 . The corresponding steady-state output PCE was 22.74% (Figure  4c ). The best-performing device was sent to a PV calibration laboratory (Quality supervisionand Testing Center of Chemical and Physical Power Sources of Information Industry, China) for certification. A certified efficiency of 22.54% was demonstrated with a V OC of 1.16 V, J SC of 24.78 mA cm -2 , and FF of 78.23% (Figure  S17 , Supporting Information), making it one of the best planar PSCs. A performance comparison with previous devices based on bilayer ETLs can be found in Table  S3  (Supporting Information). The stability of PSCs is one of the most important criteria for commercialization.  [38]  The device stability was tested under a nitrogen environment (25 °C) without encapsulation, as shown in Figure  4d . After 80 days, the In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 -based PSC still maintains 97.5% of its initial PCE. Compared with SnO 2 -based PSCs which retain only 92.7% of their initial PCE, our results verify the enhanced stability of the new device. Figure  4e  shows the normalized PCE changes over time. It is obvious that after 180 h of continuous illumination, the device based on the In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 bilayer maintains ≈91% of its initial efficiency. While for the same conditions, the device based on SnO 2 maintains only 83% of its initial efficiency. The stability was also tested under ambient air (relative humidity (RH) 75%). After 120 h, the devices based on In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 maintain ≈80% of their initial efficiency and the devices based on SnO 2 only provide 71% of their initial efficiency under the same conditions (Figure  4f ). The same conclusion was also confirmed by thermal stability measurements (Figure  S18 , Supporting Information). The instability of PSCs is due to the decomposition of perovskite materials and organic hole transport layer (HTL). The grain size of perovskite films based on In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 is larger compared to that of SnO 2 (Figure  1 ). The larger grain size of perovskite films may partly suppress the permeation of water at grain boundaries and increase stability. We believe that the stability of perovksite solar cells can be improved further if new HTL materials  [39]  and/or encapsulation methods  [40]  are used. In summary, a simple and effective In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 bilayer ETL was developed for fabricating efficient low-temperature-processed planar PSCs. The presence of In 2 O 3 leads to low trap densities in perovskite films, better energy alignment, and enhanced charge transfer, which result in higher V OC and FF. Eventually, an optimized PCE of 23.24% (certified 22.54%) was obtained with negligible hysteresis. Moreover, the device based on In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 ETL retains 97.5% of its initial efficiency after 80 days in N 2 without encapsulation and maintain 91% of their initial efficiency after 180 h under 1 sun continuous illumination. This work demonstrates that a bilayer ETL can provide sufficient energy alignment and enhanced charge transfer for efficient and stable photovoltaic devices. The efficiency of PSCs can be further improved by optimizing the energy alignment between the interface layers. 
 Experimental Section Materials: Lead iodide (PbI 2 ), bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide lithium salt (Li-TFSI), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) chlorobenzene, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium iodide (MAI), and methylammonium chloride (MACl), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Indium nitrate pentahydrate and 2-methoxyethanol were purchased from Aladdin. Tin(IV) oxide colloid precursor was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Device Fabrication: First, the ITO substrates were cleaned by detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, respectively. The as-cleaned substrates were treated by UV-ozone for 10 min. Then, different concentrations of indium nitrate pentahydrate were spin-coated onto the ITO substrates at 8000 rpm for 30 s then annealed at 180 °C for 40 min in ambient air. After that, the annealed substrates were cleaned by UV-ozone for 10 min. Then, SnO 2 solution was spin-coated onto the substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 150 °C for 20 min. 1.3 m PbI 2 precursor solution was spin-coated onto SnO 2 at the speed of 1500 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 70 °C for 5 min. When the PbI 2 film was cooled down to room temperature, a mixture solution of organic salt (FAI:MAI:MACl = 60:6:6) was spin-coated onto the PbI 2 film at a speed of 1600 rpm for 30 s followed by annealing at 150 °C for 20 min in ambient air (about 40% humidity). Subsequently, Spiro-OMeTAD solution (72.3 mg mL -1 in CB and doped at a molar ratio of 3.3 with Li-TFSI and tBP) was spin-coated onto the perovskite film at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 80 nm of Au top electrode was thermally evaporated under vacuum with a shadow mask. The area of the cells was 0.12 cm 2 ; when measuring, a 0.0887 cm 2 mask was used to define the accurate aperture area for the cells. Device Characterizations: SEM (FEI NanoSEM650) was used to characterize the morphology of the In 2 O 3 , SnO 2 , and perovskite films and also the cross-sectional image of the fully device. The XRD patterns of the perovskite films were performed by Mini Flex 600 (Rigaku D/MAX-2500, Japan). The EQE spectra were conducted in air without encapsulate by the Enli Tec (Taiwan) measurement system. The currentvoltage characteristics of the devices were measured by a Keithley 2400 Source meter under AM 1.5G illumination with a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Enli. Tec., Taiwan). The intensity of the light was calibrated with a KG-5 filter Si photodiode. And the cells were measured with a metal mask (0.0887 cm 2 ) to reduce the influence of the scattered light. The measuring condition was forward scan (0-1.2 V, scan rate 20 mV s -1 , delay time 20 ms) and reverse scan (1.2-0 V, scan rate 20 mV s -1 , delay time 20 ms). The best PSCs were sent to an PV calibration laboratory (Quality supervision and Testing Center of Chemical and Physical Power Sources of Information Industry, China) for certification. The AFM images were characterized by atomic force microscopy (NanoNavi-SPA400, Japan). The PL and TRPL spectra were carried out via a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLS980, Edinburgh Instruments, UK). Figure S1 . S1 Figure S1.

 -temperature-processed In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 bilayer ETL is developed and used for fabricating a new PSC device. The presence of In 2 O 3 results in uniform, compact, and low-trap-density perovskite films. Moreover, the conduction band of In 2 O 3 is shallower than that of Sn-doped In 2 O 3 (ITO), enhancing the charge transfer from perovskite to ETL, thus minimizing V OC loss at the perovskite and ETL interface. A planar PSC with a power conversion efficiency of 23.24% (certified efficiency of 22.54%) is obtained. A high V OC of 1.17 V is achieved with the potential loss at only 0.36 V. In contrast, devices based on single SnO 2 layers achieve 21.42% efficiency with a V OC of 1.13 V. In addition, the new device maintains 97.5% initial efficiency after 80 d in N 2 without encapsulation and retains 91% of its initial efficiency after 180 h under 1 sun continuous illumination. The results demonstrate and pave the way for the development of efficient photovoltaic devices. 
 Figure 1a - 1a d shows the surface morphologies of ITO, ITO/ In 2 O 3 , ITO/SnO 2 , and ITO/In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 , respectively. Compared with bare ITO, the surface of ITO/In 2 O 3 is evidently much smoother. Moreover, ITO/In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 has an improved roughness and much better homogeneity than that of ITO/ SnO 2 . Atom force microscopy (AFM) was conducted to further investigate the roughness of the samples. As shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information), the root mean square (RMS) roughness of these four samples was reduced from 5.5 nm for ITO only to 2.2 nm after spin-coating In 2 O 3 . The roughness of SnO 2 spin-coated on bare ITO decreased from 2.2 to 1.4 nm when In 2 O 3 was introduced. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) verified the existence of the thin In 2 O 3 layer. As shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information), there are distinct diffraction peaks at 30.6°, 35.5°, and 51.0°, indicating the formation of pure In 2 O 3 crystals. The cross-sectional SEM image of the In 2 O 3 film further confirmed its thickness of ≈10 nm (Figure S3, Supporting Information). SnO 2 nanoparticles do not easily form dense films on rough ITO, but sol-gel-processed In 2 O 3 may enhance the physical

 , Supporting Information), which can be attributed to the smoother surface of SnO 2 when In 2 O 3 was introduced to the devices.In order to evaluate the influence of the In 2 O 3 underlayer on light utilization, we measured the optical transmission of the In 2 O 3 film on ITO, as shown in FigureS6(Supporting Information). Unexpectedly, the lowest transmittance is recorded by bare ITO. After depositing In 2 O 3 , SnO 2 , and In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 , the transmittance successively increases, which is due to the decrease of reflected light. 
 , In 2 O 3 does not alter the peak luminescence position. The films based on SnO 2 and In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 ETL exhibited an emission at 800 and 799 nm, respectively. Compared with a glass substrate, both films show a strong quenching effect. The PL spectrum of perovskite film on In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 exhibits decreased intensity compared to the film on SnO 2 ETL, which means faster extraction of charges.

Deep Surface Passivation for Efficient and Hydrophobic Perovskite Solar Cells

Note S1: Space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) technique. The trap densities (N t ) in perovskite films were figure out by the space-chargelimited-current (SCLC) technique.  1  An electron-only device with a glass/ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/PCBM/Ag architecture (Fig.  S2a ) and a glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag hole-only device (Fig.  S2c ) were fabricated. Fig.  S2b  illustrates the dark current-voltage (J-V) characteristics of the pristine and CF 3 PEAI 2D passivated electron-only devices, which shows a linear ohmic region, a trap-filling limited region, and a trap-free child's region. The electron trap density can be calculated with trap-filled limit voltage (V TFL ) from the following equation: (1) 𝑁 𝑡 = 2𝑉 𝑇𝐹𝐿 𝜀 𝑟 𝜀 0 𝑞𝐿 2 Where ε r is the relative dielectric constant of perovskite (ε r = 32), 2 ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, V TFL is the onset voltage of the trap-filled limit region, q is the elemental charge, and L is the thickness of the perovskite film (~ 800 nm). The electron trap density in the 2D passivated perovskite is figured out to be 2.25 10 15 cm -3 , which is × much lower than the pristine (4.5 10 15 cm -3 ) perovskite. Similarly, a hole trap density × of 3.75 10 15 cm -3 and 2.68 10 15 cm -3 are achieved for the pristine and 2D CF 3 PEAI × × passivated films (Fig.  S2d ). The reduced trap state density in the passivated film could be attributed to the high-quality perovskite crystals. It can improve performance and mitigate the hysteresis effect in PSCs. 
 Experiment section Materials: The SnO 2 colloid precursor was purchased from Alfa Aesar. N, Ndimethylformamide (DMF), isopropanol (IPA), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PbI 2 , formamidine iodide (FAI), methylamine hydrobromide (MABr), methylammonium chloride (MACl), PEAI, CF 3 PEAI, and Spiro-OMeTAD were purchased from Xian Polymer Light Technology Corp. All materials were used without any further purification. 
 Fabrication of PSCs: The ITO glasses were ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 10 minutes, respectively. Then the clean glasses were dried in the drying oven and then treated with UV-ozone for 10 min. The SnO 2 colloid precursor was diluted with deionized water in a volume ratio of 1: 6. The electron transport layer (ETL) layer was prepared by spin coating the SnO 2 precursor at 3,000 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 150 o C for 30 min. Before transferred into the glovebox, the substrates were treated with the UV-ozone again. For the perovskite layers, a two-step process was employed. Firstly, PbI 2 (654 mg) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (1 mL, volume ratio at 4:1). After complete dissolution, the PbI 2 solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm pore polytetrafluoroethylene filter and then was spin-coated onto the HTL layers at 1,600 rpm for 20 s and 4,000 rpm for 30 s successively. After then, the PbI 2 film was annealed at 72 o C for 2 min. Later, the mixed cations isopropanol solution (220 mg FAI, 22 mg MABr, and 23 mg MACl dissolved in 1,500 μL isopropanol) was spin-coated onto the PbI 2 layer at 2,000 rpm for 30 s. Then the perovskite films were annealed at 150 o C for 30 min in the ambient environment (40% relative humidity). For the passivation treatment, CF 3 PEAI solutions in isopropanol with different concentrations (1, 2, 5, and 10 mg/mL) were spin-coated onto perovskite films at 4,000 rpm for 30 s, and then the films were annealed at 100 o C for 10 min to form the 2D perovskite. The HTL was then deposited by spin coating at 3,000 rpm for 30 s, and it contains Spiro-OMeTAD (72.3 mg), bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) stock solution (17.5 μL, 520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile), 28.8 μL 4-tertbutylpyridine in the 1 mL chlorobenzene. At last, after being oxidized for 24 h in the desiccator, 80 nm Au film was thermal evaporated as the electrode. using 1 × 1 × 1 k-point grids for the ionic optimization and 3 ×3 ×3 for the density of state, respectively. The self-consistent total-energy difference and the convergence criterion for forces on atoms are set to 10 -4 eV and 0.01 eV/Å, respectively. In all the calculations, the first two layers on the FAPbI 3 slab surface under investigation are fully relaxed, while the positions of other layers at the bottom are kept fixed. A vacuum spacing > 15 Å is used to prevent inter-slab interactions.       Fig. S1 . S1 Fig. S1.

A Thermodynamically Favored Crystal Orientation in Mixed Formamidinium/Methylammonium Perovskite for Efficient Solar Cells
Experimental section 
 Chemicals The commercial chemical materials used were listed as follows: acetone (AR Beijing Chemical Works), ethanol (AR Beijing Chemical Works), isopropanol (99.99%, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), SnO 2 colloid precursor (Alfa Aesa, tin(IV) oxide, 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion), Aminomethane (CP Beijing Chemical Works), Hydrogen iodide (57%, Alfa Aesar), PbI 2 (99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich), N,N-dimethylformamide (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), dimethyl sulfoxide (AR Beijing Chemical Works), isopropanol (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), spiro-OMeTAD (Lumtec), and ITO substrates (Shanghai B-Tree Tech. Consult.). 
 Perovskite precursor solution preparation The methylammonium iodide (MAI), methylammonium iodide (MACl), methylammonium iodide (MABr) and formamidine iodide (FAI) were dissolved in isopropanol (IPA) at a concentration of 70 mg/mL and PbI 2 was dissolved in DMF at a concentration of 500 mg/mL (in a mixture of DMF and DMSO (12:1, v/v). 
 Solar cell device fabrication The ITO substrate was sequentially washed with distilled water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol. Then treated using UV/O 3 for 30 min. The ETL was subsequently coated on ITO
30 min in air. Then the perovskite films fabrication began with the PbI 2 which was spin coated on ITO/SnO 2 with 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 70 C for 20 min in nitrogen glovebox. After the PbI 2 coated substrates cooling to room temperature (25 C) in nitrogen glovebox, mixed organic cation solution was spin coated with 3000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 150 C for 15 min in air. Then the HTM solution was deposited by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The HTM solution, spiro-OMeTAD, doped with 4-tert-butylpyridine and lithium bis (trifluoromethylsulphonyl) imide in ACN in chlorobenzene. Finally, the device was finished by thermal evaporation of Au (100nm) under vacuum. 
 Characterization One dimensional X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra was obtained by using Rigaku D/MAX 2400 diffractometer with Cu K˛ radiation. A cold field-emission scanning electron microscope equipment (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) was adopted to characterize top view morphology of perovskite thin films with different MA ratio. Two-dimensional synchrotron radiation grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) were performed at BL14B beamline, Shanghai synchrotron Radiation Facility with a wavelength of 0.6887 Å to analyze the crystallinity and orientation within the perovskite films. 2D GIWAXS data were acquired by using a MarCCD with a distance c.a. 450mm from the samples. PL testing was based on the FLS980 (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd) with an excitation at 470 nm. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the samples was obtained by an UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer (UV-vis DRS, Japan Hitachi UH4150). The J-V characteristics of photovoltaic devices were measured by using a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated sunlight from an Oriel 300 solar simulator. The effective area of cells discussed in this work was 0.102 cm 2 defined by a mask and the light intensity was calibrated by means of a KG-5 reference silicon solar cell. The IV curve for SCLC measurements was performed with the Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system in the dark and room temperature. The top of perovskite films was deposited 100 nm Au to form the hole-only device. The transient photovoltage or photocurrent (TPV or TPC) decay measurements were obtained by using a pulsed double frequency Nd:YAG laser (Brio, 20 Hz), at 532 nm with an ultra-low light intensity and a sub-nanosecond resolved digital oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO 7104) with input impedances of 1 MW and 50 W, respectively. The dynamics curves were recorded on a digital oscilloscope at a 50-Ω (short-circuit condition for TPC) resistor and a mega Ω (opencircuit condition for TPV). 
 Calculation The bulk and surface calculations were performed using the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method, as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.  [1]  The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) formulated by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof   (PBE) was chosen as the exchange-correlation functional.  [2]  The plane-wave cut-off energy was set to 500 eV. Considering the molecular-rotation-induced uncertainties of organic MA and FA, we use Rb and Cs to replace them in order to further simplify the model following previous reported method.  [3]  Cs 0.5 Rb 0.5 PbI 3 was modeled using the 2×2×2 supercell (40 atoms). The k-point meshes of 5×5×1 and 3×3×1 were used in the calculations of PbI 2termiated surfaces for the CsPbI 3 , RbPbI 3 , and Cs 0.5 Rb 0.5 PbI 3 , respectively (see Figure  S1 ). About 15 Å vacuum was added on the top of the slab surface to minimize the interaction between the adjacent slabs. During the structural relaxation, the innermost three atomic layers were fixed at their bulk values, while the other layers were well optimized under sufficient convergence criteria (0.01 eV/Å). The surface energy (E surf ) was calculated on the basis of the bond cleaving and surface relaxation approach,  [4]  following the Equation S1. ( ) ( ) (1) where E cl is bond-cleaving energy and E rel (t) is surface-relaxation energy of a slab with t termination. A detailed explanation for E cl and E rel can be found in the literature.  [5]  Table  S1  The calculated surface energy of PbI 2 -termiated (  001 ) and (  111              A Thermodynamically Favored Crystal Orientation in Mixed Formamidinium/Methylammonium Perovskite for Efficient Solar Cells Ziqi Xu, Zonghao Liu, Nengxu Li, Gang Tang, Guanhaojie Zheng, Cheng Zhu,  Yihua Chen, Ligang Wang, Yuan Huang, Liang Li, Ning Zhou, Jiawang Hong,  Qi Chen, and Huanping Zhou* DOI: 10.1002/adma.201900390 In the past few years, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been widely investigated and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) rocket-boosted from 3.8% to 23.7%,  [1]  originating from the excellent properties of perovskite materials such as appropriate and adjustable bandgap, high absorption coefficient, good charge carrier mobility, long carrier diffusion length, low recombination rate, and high tolerance of chemical defects.  [2]  Among various compositions, hybrid organic-inorganic PSCs based on mixed-cation formamidinium/methylammonium (FA/MA) perovskites have been attractive not only due to higher efficiency, but also better thermal stability, higher phase stability and more robust long-term stability than the FA cation or MA cation only counterparts.  [3]  For instance, MA cation only perovskite, i.e., MAPbI 3 , has a very low tetragonal-to-cubic phase transformation temperature of about 60 °C. FA Crystal orientation has a great impact on the properties of perovskite films and the resultant device performance. Up to now, the exquisite control of crystal orientation (the preferred crystallographic planes and the crystal stacking mode with respect to the particular planes) in mixed-cation perovskites has received limited success, and the underlying mechanism that governs device performance is still not clear. Here, a thermodynamically favored crystal orientation in formamidinium/methylammonium (FA/MA) mixed-cation perovskites is finely tuned by composition engineering. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the FA/MA ratio affects the surface energy of the mixed perovskites, leading to the variation of preferential orientation consequently. The preferable growth along the (001) crystal plane, when lying parallel to the substrates, affects their charge transportation and collection properties. Under the optimized condition, the mixed-cation perovskite (FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl)) solar cells deliver a champion power conversion efficiency over 21%, with a certified efficiency of 20.50 ± 0.50%. The present work not only provides a vital step in understanding the intrinsic properties of mixed-cation perovskites but also lays the foundation for further investigation and application in perovskite optoelectronics. cation only perovskite, i.e., FAPbI 3 , can be easily transformed from a black photo-active perovskite cubic phase to an undesirable yellow photo-inactive nonperovskite hexagonal phase at room temperature.  [4]  As promising candidates to replace MA or FA only perovskites, mixed FA/MA cation perovskites have been widely studied from the perspective of: 1) bandgap tuning;  [4a,5]  2) thermal stability;  [4]  3) phase stability;  [4a,6]  4) morphology,  [7]  leading to the optimized film property and device performance. Apart from the above macroscopic properties, the microstructure of the mixed perovskites especially for the preferred orientation, shows great influence on the properties of charge carrier, such as the recombination, diffusion length, mobilities,  [8]  etc, and the charge transfer at the interfaces.  [9]  Fortunately, the preferred crystal orientation is also expected to be tuned by the MA/FA composition engineering, however, an exquisite control and systematic investigation on the crystal orientation are required to better understand the origin of the crystal orientation and its impacts on optoelectronic properties.  [10]  Efforts were documented to reveal the origin of the crystal orientation, where MAPbI 3 , FAPbI 3 , and MA/FA mixed perovskite were examined intuitively. Take the tetragonal MAPbI 3based perovskite film for example, it was observed that the diffraction intensity along (  110 ) or (  112 ) direction was substantially increased, by employing a facile one-step roll-imprinting method,  [11]  or thermal-gradient-assisted directional crystallization method.  [10]  For the FAPbI 3 perovskite film, the diffraction intensity along (001) direction was substantially increased in most case, as a result of its cubic phase. With respect to MA/FA mixed perovskites, a preferred orientation along (100) and excellent crystallinity were obtained through Sn doping,  [12]  Br doping,  [13]  or the templating effect associated to the specific beneath layer.  [14]  Besides, a preferred orientation along (021) or (012) in mixed FA/MA perovskite film could be achieved by altering organic cation concentration,  [15]  or meniscus-assisted solution printing strategy.  [16]  These suggested that a delicate control of crystal orientation of perovskite was a promising way to modulate the properties of mixed FA/MA cation perovskite films and device performance. However, most of the studies failed to explore the origin of the preferable crystal orientation in FA/MA mixed perovskites. Only recently, a versatile x(FA-PbI 2 )-(1-x)(3MAI-PbCl 2 ) precursor was proven to be able to grow highly oriented perovskite films, which was attributed to the effect from the formation of chlorine-containing intermediates during a topotactic transformation, which was kinetically controlled.  [17]  Still, it is of considerable interest to explore the preferred crystal orientation in the context of thermodynamics, and its effect on film quality and device performance of mixed FA/MA cation perovskites. Different from the impact of kinetics, we systematically investigated the crystal orientation of mixed FA/MA cation perovskites fabricated through a two-step interdiffusion method via composition engineering, and illuminated an unexplored preferred crystal orientation controlled by thermodynamics. The combination of experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicated that the change in the surface energy of FA/MA mixed-cation perovskites was primarily account for the preferable crystal orientation. By systematically investigating the effect of composition engineering on the structure, morphology, crystal orientation and optoelectronic properties of perovskites, we found that the preferable growth along (001) crystallographic plane with 90° azimuth angle, significantly improved their charge transportation and collection properties in the resultant devices. With an optimized composition, the relevant PSCs achieved a PCE over 21%, with a certified efficiency of 20.50%. Here, we fabricated perovskite film by a modified two-step inter-diffusion method.  [18]  First, the lead iodide (PbI 2 ) precursor solution was prepared by dissolving PbI 2 in a mixture of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), where the latter acted as Lewis base to interact with PbI 2 , and thereby control the morphology of the resultant perovskite thin films.  [19]  And then the mixed organic cations precursor solutions were made by dissolving different ratios of formamidine iodide (FAI), methylammonium iodide (MAI), methylammonium bromide (MABr), and methylammonium chloride (MACl) in isopropanol (IPA), where all these components were frequently used to fabricate highly efficient PSCs.  [20]  We intentionally controlled the composition of FA 1-x MA x Pb(I,Br,Cl) 3 perovskites by increasing the concentration of MAI while decreasing the concentration of FAI in the mixed-cation precursor solution without varying precursor concentration and ratio of I, Br, and Cl. The Br and Cl concentration did not increase in the films, as MABr and MACl in the processor solution were fixed. The small amount of MACl was considered to have negligible impact on the perovskite crystal structure, but probably playing a role of optimizing the optoelectronic characteristics for high performance.  [1c]  We accordingly used FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) to denote the chemical formula of perovskite with different MA ratios in this study. The molar ratio of MA and (MA+FA) in the mixed organic cation precursor solution, defined as MA ratio (x), was adjusted from 0.13 to 0.65 for further investigation. The detailed fabrication of perovskite films could be found in the Experimental Section in the Supporting Information. We first investigated the influence of composition engineering on the film quality from the perspective of crystallography. Figure  1  shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the obtained FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskite films with different FA/MA ratios. It was observed that the major peaks of perovskite films were mainly located at 13.98°, 24.36°, 28.20°, and 31.63° that were assigned to (001), (  111 ), (002), and (012) crystal planes of cubic perovskite, respectively. All the perovskite films exhibited black perovskite phase rather than yellow phase, regardless of the varied ratios of FA/MA, which further suggested that the introduction of MA into FAPbI 3 could stabilize its black phase.  [6]  In addition, a slightly shift of the (  001 ), (111), and (002) peaks to higher 2θ value was also observed in the films with higher MA ratios, as shown in Figure  S2  in the Supporting Information, which was likely due to that the substitution of FA + with smaller MA + could shrink the crystal lattice. The difference in full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of all the three crystal planes was negligible with MA ratio increased, as shown in Figure  S3  in the Supporting Information, indicating the comparable crystal size in all samples. To further explore the influence of composition on crystals orientation, we checked the ratios of peak intensity, i.e., (002)/ (001), (  111 )/(001), (  111 )/(002) for FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) films as shown in Figure  1b . It was found that the peak intensity ratio of (002)/(001) almost remained unchanged, and the absolute intensity of both peaks gradually increased upon the MA ratio increasing, indicative of the better crystallinity of the film. In contrast, by increasing the MA ratio from 0.13 to 0.65, the peak intensity ratios of (  111 )/(  001 ) and (  111 )/(002) varied from 1.1 and 1.7, respectively, to almost 0. This observation indicated an apparent preferable growth along (  001 ) and (  002 ) crystallographic planes for mixed FA/MA cation perovskite by increasing the MA ratio. Furthermore, we calculated the microstrain in our perovskite films by analyzing the FWHM in the diffraction patterns according to the modified Williamson-Hall method.  [21]  As shown in Figure  1c , the microstrain in perovskite films decreased with the increase of MA ratio. We confirmed that the introduction of smaller MA + ions into FAPbI 3 could release the lattice strain to enhance phase stability, which was in agreement with previous report.  [22]  To further assess the crystal microstructure of above FA/ MA mixed-cation perovskite samples, especially the crystal orientations in multiple orders,  [23]  we used 2D synchrotron radiation grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement (Figure  2a-h ). As shown in Figure  2a -h, the bright rings at q = 10, 17, and 20 nm -1 (where q was the scattering vector, q = 4π sin θ/λ) were the diffraction patterns for (001), (111), and (002) crystal planes, respectively. The red color regions indicated strong diffraction signals for corresponding crystal planes with a preferred orientation and the light blue colored regions indicated a relative weak diffraction intensity for corresponding crystal planes. It was clearly observed that the diffraction intensities of preferred planes, including both (  001 ) and (  002 ), varied significantly with different MA ratios, according to Figure  2a -h. To better visualize and compare the difference, we calculated the intensity of different crystal planes along different azimuth angles exhibited in GIWAXS, as shown in Figure  3a  and Figure  S4  in the Supporting Information. It was confirmed that the intensity of (001) plane was much higher than those of (  002 ) and (  111 ) plane. Apparently, by increasing MA ratio from 0.13 to 0.57, the intensity of (001) plane was enhanced accordingly, suggesting that crystallization of the crystallographic plane along (001) plane was strengthened. It is noteworthy that a dramatic increase occurred when we enhanced the MA ratio from 0.38 to 0.43. Besides, the intensity of (002) crystal plane also showed an increasing trend promoted by MA ratio enhancement. This GIWAXS result was consistent with XRD result shown in Figure  1b . While further increasing the MA ratio over 0.57, the intensity of (001) plane decreased, which was slightly different from XRD results, as would be discussed later. Nevertheless, the intensity of (111)/(001) remained decreased upon MA ratio increasing in the range of interest, from 0.13 to 0.65 (Figure  3a ). It confirmed the  preferred facet orientation along (001) crystal plane could be achieved by tuning the MA/FA ratio in mixed perovskites. We further attempted to assess the variation of the crystal plane stacking pattern with respect to a certain crystallographic plane in FA/MA perovskite film. Here, the GIWAXS pattern azimuthally along the ring at q = 10 nm -1 in Figure  2 , which was assigned to (001) plane, the dominant diffraction peak of corresponding perovskite structure, was considered as an example. It was observed clearly that when the MA ratio was increasing from 0.13 to 0.65, the stacking patterns changed distinctly. As shown in Figure  3c , with MA ratios from 0.13 to 0.38, the diffraction ring displayed three peaks at around 37°, 90°, and 143°, indicating a relatively disordered stacking as from their identical peak intensities. When the ratio of MA was increased, the peak intensity located at azimuth angle 90° increased significantly, while the intensities of the other two peaks (around 37° and 143°) decreased accordingly. In particular, when MA ratio was increased to 0.43, the diffraction mottling at the azimuth angle of 90° became overwhelming, with other two peaks disappeared. This suggested the occurrence of preferred facet orientation of (001) crystal plane dominantly stack along the face-up direction and also indicated an enhanced long-range crystallinity of perovskite film. The possible crystal stacking pattern of the presented hybrid perovskite materials was illustrated in Figure  3e . This preferred crystal orientation would benefit charge transport process and consequently device performance, as would be discussed later.  [9b,10,17]  We also tried to explore the underlying mechanism for the growth of perovskite films with strengthened preferred crystal orientation induced by MA/FA ratios, which had not been explored. From thermodynamics point of view, we examined the surface energy with respect to the corresponding crystallographic planes to understand whether it impacted the crystal orientation in mixed FA/MA cation perovskites. The surface energies of (  001 ) and (111) planes of perovskites with formula of FAPbI 3 , MAPbI 3 , and FA 0.5 MA 0.5 PbI 3 were evaluated based on DFT calculations (see details in Supporting Information). We simplified the model by using single halide I, as all the mixed perovskite films having the same ratio of Br/I/Cl. The calculation results are shown in Figure  3b  and Table  S1  in the Supporting Information, which are further illustrated in Figure  3d . It was found that when we introduced the MA + cation into FAPbI 3 perovskite, the surface energy of (001) plane was significantly reduced. This decrease indicated the (001) planes were more energetically favorable during crystal growth. It was also in agreement with the above XRD and  GIWAXS results, which indicated that MA incorporation in the FA + -based perovskite could facilitate the crystal growth in (001) plane and thus assisted preferred orientation. However, when the ratio of MA was close to 1, this energy was gradually increased as compared to the lowest surface energy at certain MA ratio. This also supported the mentioned opposite trend of intensity variation with respect to (001) plane by increasing MA ratio over 0.57, as displayed in GIWAXS study (Figure  3a ). In addition, we also derived the surface energy ratio of (  001 )/(111), as shown by the blue line (Figure  3b ). It was observed that this ratio kept deceasing, even the MA ratio was increased to 1. The decreased surface energy ratio of (  001 )/(111) further suggested that the (001) plane became an energetically favorable plane when compared with (111) plane. The results implied that an appropriate ratio of MA incorporation in the FA + based perovskite could promote the crystal growth along (001) plane. This further pointed out that the preferred orientation in the perovskite film was primarily governed by the surface energy, which was controlled by thermodynamics. This was also confirmed that the facilitated grain growth along (001) direction presented in the perovskite films with desired FA/MA ratio during the entire crystallization (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information). The reduction of surface energy by MA incorporation is speculated to be related to the following three aspects: 1) Planar density of atoms: The cation radius of MA + (2.17 Å) is smaller than that of FA + (2.53 Å). According to Bragg's law 2d sin θ = nλ,  [24]  compared to the larger FA + , the smaller MA + ion is more likely to facilitate (001) plane with higher planar density, which leading to a stabilized crystal structure. 2) Crystal symmetry: The tetragonal MAPbI 3 , in contrast to isotropic and symmetrical cubic FAPbI 3 crystal,  [25]  might have a decreased tendency to grow along [111] direction.  [4b]  Thus, the incorporation MA-into FA-based perovskite may effectively facilitate the preferred orientation along (001) plane. 3) Orbital interaction: The partial substitution of FA + with smaller cation MA + would reduce cubo-octahedral volume and thus increase the orbital interaction between Pb and I atoms and modify the local structure of perovskite.  [26]  Specifically, it would adjust the degree of [PbI 6 ] octahedral tilting and induce FA + cation orientation change.  [26b,27]  All these effects may collectively contribute to the increased crystallinity and strengthened preferred orientation in perovskite. Furthermore, the preferred (001) orientation would favor the transport of charge carrier in the bulk perovskite and across the interfaces. The perovskite thin films are anisotropic, and the effective mass of the materials varies obviously with respect to the crystal orientation space axes. Notably, the electron effective mass shows the smallest value along the Z-direction, which is perpendicular to the perovskite (001) plane, suggesting that the most efficient electron transport occurs along the [001] direction in the perovskite film.  [9b]  With respect to charge transport at perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD interface, there is a large electrostatic potential increase and preferential holes distribution at the interface of Spiro-OMeTAD and perovskite along (001) preferred orientation, attracting more holes than electrons and yielding stronger electronic cloud overlapping, which benefits interfacial electron-hole pair dissociation and enhance the efficiency of hole transfer.  [9a]  Furthermore, the re-arrangement of the orientation along the face-up direction (azimuth angle 90°) could also enlarge the effective contact area between (001) plane of perovskite film and carrier transport layers, which could be beneficial for the charge extraction process. Therefore, the combination of preferred growth over (001) planes, and crystal stacking mode with respect to (001) plane were expected to lead to improved device performance, as discussed later. To further investigate whether the introduction of MA + into FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) affected other film qualities, e.g. morphology, coverage and grain size, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed. Figure  4a-h  show the top view SEM images of all the FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskite films with different MA ratios. It was observed that all films were uniform, highly crystalline with almost similar compact texture. Moreover, we compared the grain sizes of all the films, as shown in Figure  S6a  in the Supporting Information. It was found that all the FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskite films showed nearly identical statistic grain size. Besides, we measured the thickness of perovskite films with different MA ratios, as illustrated in Figure  S6b  in the Supporting Information, which did not show any obvious variation. This observation ruled out the apparent film morphological influence on the resulting film quality, and also suggested that the grain size of the FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskite films here was not the key factor that would possibly govern the device performance. Apart from above crystal and morphology properties, we further investigated the influence of introduction of MA + into the FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskites on their optoelectronic properties. As shown in Figure  4i , the ultraviolet-visible (UVvis) spectra showed a 20 nm blueshift upon increasing the ratio of MA in perovskite films from 0.13 to 0.65. This indicated the bandgap increased from 1.51 to 1.54 eV obtained in Figure  4i . The normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskite thin films are also presented in Figure  4j . Accordingly, a blueshift of the emission peak of the FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskites was observed upon increasing the ratio of MA, which derived from the substitution of FA + with MA + in the perovskite lattice.  [6]  In addition, we further checked the Urbach energy (Eu) of the perovskite films with different MA ratios, which would probe the sharp onset of absorption at the direct bandgap, exhibiting significant information about disorders in shallow energy level.  [28]  As shown in Figure  S7  in the Supporting Information, we observed a consistent decrease of Eu values with MA ratio increase to 0.43, which indicated a smaller degree of electronic disorder at the band edge. This variation trend of Eu value obtained was in good agreement with the exhibited preferred orientation by increasing MA ratio, suggesting that the preferred orientation of perovskite film could reduce the disorder and benefit the charge transportation and device performance we exhibited below. Furthermore, we estimated the carrier lifetime of fresh perovskite films with different MA ratios by using time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. All the TRPL spectra of perovskite films could be fitted by biexponential decays (as shown in Figure  S8a , Supporting Information) and the corresponding lifetimes and diffusion lengths were summarized in Table  S2  in the Supporting Information, according to the calculation method.  [29]  The perovskite film with 0.43 MA ratio showed the longest PL lifetime and diffusion length, suggesting that the preferred orientation could effectively suppress the trap-assisted recombination in the bulk and the surface. We further investigated the quenching effect of different perovskite films with electron-transport layer (ETL) SnO 2 , and hole-transport layer (HTL) Spiro-OMeTAD. Similarly, all the TRPL spectra could be fitted by biexponential decays (as shown in Figure  S8b ,c in the Supporting Information) and the corresponding lifetimes and diffusion lengths  [30]  are summarized in Tables  S3  and S4  in the Supporting Information. It was found that the 0.43 MA ratio perovskite film/ SnO 2 sample showed the shortest average PL lifetime (τ avg ), indicating the best carrier extraction capability from perovskite to ETL. For perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD samples case, 0.43 MA ratio perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD sample showed an obvious quenching effect and respectable hole diffusion length. Overall, 0.43 MA ratio perovskite film was considered with excellent carrier extraction capability at both ETL and HTL interfaces, indicating that the preferred orientation could effectively facilitate the carrier extraction. To reveal how crystal orientation of perovskites with different MA ratios in this work interfered the device performance of solar cells, we fabricated devices with configuration of ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au as illustrated in the cross-sectional SEM images in Figure  S9  in the Supporting Information. All fabrication details could be found in Supporting Information. The photovoltaic parameters of PSCs with different MA ratios are shown in Figure  5a  and Figure  S10a-c  in the Supporting Information. Remarkably, the PCEs increased with the MA ratios varied from 0.13 to 0.43, and decreased when further increasing MA ratios from 0.43 to 0.65. Also, the open-circuit voltage (V oc ), short-circuit current density (J sc ) and fill factor (FF) had similar variation trend with PCEs. These changes were consistent with the variation trend of (111)/(001) crystal planes intensity ratio when MA ratio was lower than 0.43. When MA ratio was larger than 0.43, the performance decreased originated from deteriorated optoelectronic properties as discussed later. It had been reported that the spatial heterogeneity of perovskite polycrystalline could significantly affect J sc and V oc of the resulting solar cell devices due to the fact that anisotropic distribution of trap states was orientation dependent.  [8c]  Besides, the mobility of perovskite films is also closely related to the crystal texture, especially the crystal orientation.  [31]  Here, we speculate that the enhanced device performance for MA ratio of 0.43 case mainly originated from the preferable growth along (001) crystalline plane and face-up crystal stacking. This preferred crystal orientation would lead to enhanced long-range crystallinity which was beneficial for the charge transportation across the perovskite bulk layer and also the charge collection at the perovskite/charge selective layer interfaces.  [9b]  Interestingly, the PCEs decreased for the MA ratio larger than 0.43, indicating that the smaller increase of intensity ratio of (001)/(111) crystal planes mentioned above had less impact on device performance of solar cells. This would be explained by the superior intrinsic properties of FAPbI 3 than MAPbI 3 , such as longer carrier lifetime, higher mobility, and larger ion movement barrier for higher performance.  [32]  Therefore, we suggested that preferable growth along (001) crystalline plane with the proper MA ratio around 0.43 would improve the performance of devices. To further confirm the effect of preferred crystal orientation on the charge carrier dynamic within the devices, we carried out transient photovoltage decay (TPV) and transient photocurrent decay (TPC) measurements on the PSCs, and the results are shown in Figure  S11  in the Supporting Information. It was found that the lifetime for device with MA ratio of 0.43 was longer than those for other devices with rest MA ratios. This suggested a substantially suppressed recombination in this perovskite absorber with MA ratio of 0.43, which was consistent with its higher V oc than other cases (Figure  S10a , Supporting Information). It was also observed that the device with MA ratio of 0.43 showed a faster photocurrent decay than devices based on other MA ratios. This observation confirmed that the MA ratio of 0.43 based device possessed a much more efficient charge transportation process, leading to a higher output photocurrent, which was consistent with the higher Jsc than other cases (Figure  S10b , Supporting Information). The better performance on TPV and TPC results with 0.43 MA ratio was probably caused by the preferred orientation that enabled improved carrier flow between perovskite and carrier transport layers, while proper MA ratio (not too high as 0.57) would take advantage of the high carrier mobility of FAPbI 3 . In addition, to further study the charge transportation and charge recombination behavior in the devices, we conducted electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. As shown in Figure  S12  in the Supporting Information, all devices showed a semicircle feature in the Nyquist plots, which were ascribed to the transport resistance of the devices.  [33]  It was observed that the device based on perovskite with the appropriate MA ratio (0.43) showed almost the lowest transport resistance, which further supported that the preferable orientation and proper MA ratio could benefit the charge transport process, leading to the J sc enhancement. Meanwhile, we also calculated the defects density and chargecarrier mobility of perovskite films with different MA ratios from space change limited current (SCLC) measurements as shown in Figure  S13  in the Supporting Information. The perovskite films with MA ratio of 0.43 showed the lowest defects density of 9.2 × 10 14 cm -3 , which was at most 10 times lower than the other perovskites, e.g. with 2.3 × 10 16 cm -3 of 0.2 MA ratio. As discussed above, the reduced defects density was ascribed to that a highly preferred orientation with enhanced long-range crystallinity would reduce the probability of defects formation. Meanwhile, the perovskite with MA ratio of 0.43 also exhibited the highest charge-carrier mobility (0.122 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) than other cases. This improved carrier mobility would also originate from the preferred orientation with enhanced long-range crystallinity enabled a fast charge transport path facilitating the charge transportation, while proper MA ratio (around 0.43) would benefit from the high carrier mobility of FAPbI 3 . Given the above, the improved conductivity combined with suppressed recombination guaranteed an effective carrier transportation and collection in the devices enabled such improved device  performance. These results also further confirmed that a preferential crystal orientation in perovskite films induced by MA incorporation could benefit device performance enhancement. Accordingly, the champion device with MA ratio of 0.43 achieved a best PCE of 21.21% under reverse scan and 20.26% under forward scan, as shown in Figure  5b . One of our devices with MA ratio of 0.43 also achieved a certified efficiency of 20.50 ± 0.50% (Figure  S14 -S18, Supporting Information). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) is shown in Figure  5c , exhibiting an integrated Jsc of 23.7 mA cm -2 , which was in good agreement with the J-V measurements. In addition, the device also showed a stabilized PCE exceeding 20.3% in Figure  5d , which was in good agreement with the J-V scans. In Figure  S10d  in the Supporting Information, we also compared the hysteresis of devices by presenting the Hysteresis-index (H-index) defined as the previous work.  [34]  All the devices with three different MA ratios showed relative low H-index, indicating that hysteresis could be also suppressed by fine tuning the orientation of the perovskites. In summary, we systematically investigated the crystal orientation of mixed FA/MA perovskites fabricated through a two-step interdiffusion method via composition engineering. We also illuminated the origin of preferred crystal orientation from the perspective of thermodynamics by DFT calculation, where the reduction of surface energy for FA/MA mixed-cation perovskites results in the preferable crystal orientation. To our best understanding, this is the first study that reveals the origin for the thermodynamically favored crystal orientation in mixed FA/MA cation perovskites. By systematically investigating the effect of composition engineering on perovskite crystal structure, morphology, bandgap, and crystal orientation, we found that the preferable growth along (001) crystal plane, as well as the face-up crystal stacking of the perovskite crystals significantly affected the charge transportation and collection properties within the devices. With the optimized composition, the mixed-cation PSCs achieved a PCE over 21% and a certificated efficiency of 20.50 ± 0.50% under one sun illumination. It thus sheds light on understanding the intrinsic properties of mixedcation perovskites, which guides further investigation and application in perovskite optoelectronics.

Synthetic Control over Quantum Well Width Distribution and Carrier Migration in Low-Dimensional Perovskite Photovoltaics
Metal halide perovskites have achieved photovoltaic efficiencies exceeding 22%, but their widespread use is hindered by their instability in the presence of water and oxygen. To bolster stability, researchers have developed low-dimensional perovskites wherein bulky organic ligands terminate the perovskite lattice, forming quantum wells (QWs) that are protected by the organic layers. In thin films, the width of these QWs exhibits a distribution that results in a spread of bandgaps in the material arising due to varying degrees of quantum confinement across the population. Means to achieve refined control over this QW width distribution, and to examine and understand its influence on photovoltaic performance, are therefore of intense interest. Here we show that moving to the ligand allylammonium enables a narrower distribution of QW widths, creating a flattened energy landscape that leads to ×1.4 and ×1.9 longer diffusion lengths for electrons and holes, respectively. We attribute this to reduced ultrafast shallow hole trapping that originates from the most strongly confined QWs. We observe an increased PCE of 14.4% for allylammonium-based perovskite QW photovoltaics, compared to 11-12% PCEs obtained for analogous devices using phenethylammonium and butylammonium ligands. We then optimize the devices using mixed-cation strategies, achieving 16.5% PCE for allylammonium devices. The devices retain 90% of their initial PCEs after >650 h when stored under ambient atmospheric conditions.
Methods Materials: All chemicals used are commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich (or otherwise specified) and were used without any additional purification steps: Dimethylformamide anhydrous (DMF, 99%), dimethylsulfoxide anhydrous (DMSO, 99.9%), γ-Butyrolactone (GBL >99%), lead (II) iodide (from Alfa Aesar, 99.999%, ultra dry), lead(II) bromide (from Alfa Aesar, 99.999%), allylamine (98%), hydroiodic acid (57 wt. % in H 2 O, distilled, stabilized, 99.95%), methylammonium iodide (from Dyesol Inc., 99.9%), methylammonium bromide (from Dyesol Inc., 99.9%), formadinium iodide (from Dyesol Inc.), cesium iodide (99.999%), butylammonium iodide (from Dyesol Inc.), phenethylammonium iodide (from Dyesol Inc.), chlorobenzene anhydrous, poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA), phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, 99.5%), 2,2',7,7'-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)9,9'-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). The single fit peak estimates a FWHM that is ~200 meV smaller than the crude fits for PEA and BTA. The addition of a small, slightly blue shifted peak improves the overall fit for ALA, indicating some polydispersity of higher n QWs within this inhomogenously broadened peak. (c) Single and (d) double Gaussian fits for the exciton bleach of PEA. Using a second bluer Gaussian greatly improves the fit, and allows better visualization of the variably quantum confined n = ~6 -8 QWs within this broad peak. (e) Single and (f) double Gaussian fits for the BTA films. In both cases the fit is poor, owing to the very large polydispersity at the exciton peak, and the prominent presence of lower n QWs. With such a low 〈n〉 value, the lowest n peaks such as n1 at 510 nm and n2 at 570 nm become apparent, especially for PEA. ALA features some n1 and n2 QWs, but has a tighter focus on n3 (610 nm), n4 (640 nm) and then larger n (6 -10+) QWs further to the red. PEA exhibits large amplitudes for all peaks ranging between n1 and n10+; the distribution is similar for BTA besides the lack of n1 QWs. Each time trace is normalized to the most negative peak at each time, showing the growth or decay of neighboring peaks with time as charges migrate between QWs. S4

It is seen that ALA 〈n〉 = 3 exhibits brighter diffraction peaks than BTA due to better ordering (higher crystallinity). Compared to BTA, ALA shows a diffraction pattern more characteristic of higher n QWs for 〈n〉 = 10, indicated by the isotropic rings spanning the q r axis rather than distinctive peaks in the spectrum.   a-c ) Time-resolved PL transients with and without quencher layers for ALA, PEA and BTA, respectively. Transients are normalized and then offset for clarity. Layers of PCBM are used for electron quenching, spiro-oMeTAD for hole quenching, and PMMA as a blocking layer for determining quencher free carrier lifetimes. Film thicknesses are determined using AFM (Fig.  S5 ). Note that in most fits, a biexponential function is needed to account for the faster decay component due to scattering of the pump laser. We identify this fast decay as scattering since this signal component's intensity changes intensely with sample angle relative to the detector. Due to the low quantum yield in these samples, the scattering component is always present even with a pump filter before the detector. However, this component is well separated from the carrier lifetimes when it is fit to a common lifetime of 2.5 ns for all samples. The longer secondary lifetime is used in all cases for the ‫ܮ‬ parameters.         
 ■ INTRODUCTION Organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites are solutionprocessed semiconductors with remarkable photophysical and optoelectronic properties. Their composition is readily tuned via precursor stoichiometry during solution-phase processing, enabling perovskite materials with long carrier diffusion lengths and balanced mobilities, 1,2 low defect densities,  3, 4  and tunable bandgaps,  5, 6  giving rise to efficient light-harvesting and lightemitting devices  7  based on these materials. In light of their potential for scalable and inexpensive processing, these materials hold promise for thin film solar cells in view of their impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) that have now exceeded 22%. The stability of perovskite active layers, especially in the presence of moisture which can travel through low-cost flexible encapsulants, remains a priority area for further research and development.  6, 8  Low-dimensional perovskites consist of perovskite quantum wells (QWs) whose lattice is terminated along one axis using bulky organic ligands such as butylammonium (C 4 H 9 NH 3 + ) or phenethylammonium (C 8 H 9 NH 3 + ) (Figure  1a ). This results in quantum confinement within the resultant perovskite domains: the energy levels, as in conventional QWs, vary with the thickness of the nanoplatelets, and hence with the number of monolayers, n, that reside between the bulk-terminating larger ligands. These outer ligands form bilayer interfaces due to van der Waals interactions, creating a stable barrier that protects the perovskite lattice against degradation (Figure  1b ). Previous works have proven that the mixed perovskite QWs are more resistant to moisture and led to better device stability than their 3D counterparts.  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]  The QW width in solution-cast thin films is determined by the ratio of ligand molecules to perovskite A-site cations (typically methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), or cesium (Cs)) in the precursor solution. Higher ratios of ligandto-A-site cation result in lower n values. Due to thermodynamic mixing and the variable formation energy of the QWs, a mixture of QWs with varying widths is created, centered around an n (henceforth referred to as ⟨n⟩, the average QW width).  14, 15  Lower ⟨n⟩ values confer higher stability but lower efficiencies, resulting in a compromise between enhanced device lifetime and device performance by tuning ⟨n⟩.  8  This has been speculated to be due to the insulating nature of the molecular interfaces between perovskite domains.  8, 10, 14  However, transient absorption spectroscopic studies have shown that both electrons and holes are able to transfer between perovskite QWs on a time scale of several picoseconds.  [15] [16] [17]  This indicates that, while overall carrier mobility is slowed, the molecular barrier separating the perovskite QWs does not fully block charge transfer. The slower charge transfer between perovskite QWs may not be the only, or even the principal, cause of lower device efficiency.  8, 10  We sought to determine properties of the low-⟨n⟩ mixed Q2D perovskite thin films that could lead to reduced overall photovoltaic performance and to utilize the resultant insights to address these limitations. QW polydispersity and the resultant nonflat energy landscape is expected to degrade photovoltaic material performance: carriers will funnel down into QWs with the lowest energy bands where, surrounded by a higherbandgap environment, they may to be extracted to the contacts. 
 ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We began our investigations with a study of how the organic ligand influences QW width distribution. The composition of t h e fi l m s s t u d i e d h e r e f o l l o w s t h e f o r m u l a (L) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n-1 , where L is the ligand molecule allylammonium (ALA), phenethylammonium (PEA), or butylammonium (BTA). We select ⟨n⟩ = 10, since it is known to exhibit PCEs in the range 10-12% and maintain ∼90% of this efficiency after 1000 h of aging,  8  giving an opportunity to address and possibly improve the relatively low efficiency in a reasonably stable material. Figure  1c  shows the absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the ⟨n⟩ = 10 films for the three different ligands. The absorption spectra are dominated by the continuum transitions of the higher-n QWs, but excitonic peaks for lower-n QWs are observable. From the absorption onset and band-edge transitions, it is seen that ALA induces the formation of higher-n QWs, and exhibits smaller peaks for the lower-n QWs. The emission spectra for the three ligands are all qualitatively similar, with only the BTA film having a slightly red-shifted PL peak. This would indicate the formation of more 3D perovskite domains in the material, which would have the smallest bandgap and act as a recombination center.  8, 15, 17  Ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy probes the presence of lower-n QWs, since the excitonic resonances are more easily resolved at early delay times without being  obscured by continuum transitions. Figure  2a-c  shows the TA spectra at various delay times for the ⟨n⟩ = 10 ALA, PEA, and BTA films. Negative features correspond to bleached excitonic transitions in the QWs, whereas positive features are caused by blue-shifting of the exciton peak due to hot carriers and manybody effects present at early delay times (0-5 ps).  18  The ALA film features one main bleach peak at ∼750 nm, and vanishingly small amplitudes for lower-n QWs. This is in sharp contrast to the PEA and BTA films, which show peaks for QWs with n as low 2 and 3 in the case of BTA and PEA, respectively. We fit the main exciton bleach (between ∼710 and 750 nm) for the three ligands (Figure  S1 ), and find the fwhm to be ∼200 meV narrower for ALA compared to the two other ligands, showing that, within this inhomogeneously broadened peak, the distribution of QWs (e.g., n = 6-10) is narrowest for ALA. The same relationship between the ligands and the degree of polydispersity is also found in films of ⟨n⟩ = 3 (Figure  S2 ). To assess whether the choice of ligand and QW polydispersity influences crystallinity and ordering of the QWs, we carried out Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-Ray Scattering (GIWAXS) measurements on films of ⟨n⟩ = 3, 5, and 10 using the three different ligands. We show GIWAXS diffraction patterns for the ⟨n⟩ = 3 films here (Figure  2d-f ), since these contain more low-n QWs and exhibit brighter diffraction peaks compared to ⟨n⟩ = 5 and ⟨n⟩ = 10 films (Figure  S3 ). It is possible to identify the morphological composition and orientation of the low-dimensional perovskite films with various ligands. Highly textured spots below 1 Å -1 along q xy = 0 in ALA and BTA films point to the formation of low-n QWs with a high degree of spatial coherence and equally high degree of orientation with ligand bilayers parallel to the substrate. Furthermore, these films (particularly the ALA film) exhibit highly patterned spots for q > 1 Å -1 , evidencing a high degree of orientation of the perovskite unit cell (see Figure  S4  for slices along q z at q xy = 0 for the three GIWAXS images). This observation points to a high degree of order even among larger-n QWs. This trend is decreased in the BTA film along with a concurrent rise in the intensity of the isotropic ring exhibited by disordered crystallites. The PEA film, on the other hand, exhibits weak low-n QW diffraction peaks and broad isotropic rings for q > 1 Å -1 , suggesting a greater disorder of the crystallites. To understand how the QW polydispersity and presence of lower-n QWs in an otherwise homogeneous QW mix may affect transport, we use ultrafast TA to examine the carrier dynamics in highly polydisperse PEA films. ⟨n⟩ = 3 is again chosen to create a larger distribution of different QWs with more distinguishable excitonic resonances, such that it is easier to observe electron and hole transfer between them, and PEA is selected as the ligand, since the energy transfer rates can be compared with previous reports for this exact system.  15  Figure  3a  shows the evolution of the various exciton bleaching peaks following photoexcitation at the n4 resonance (640 nm), where the hole, electron, and exciton transfer are highlighted by the dashed rectangles. Peaks at n2, n3, n5, and the mixture of n6+ begin to grow in within the first tens of picoseconds before the overall spectrum begins to decay due to recombination. Fits to the carrier dynamics are obtained with global analysis (using Glotaran,  19  see the Supporting Information). The three lifetimes used in the fitting are 9, 138, and 4300 ps. The 9 ps component accounts for ultrafast charge transfer, as can be seen from the curves in Figure  3b  (rise times at 610, 666, and 700 nm, corresponding to excitonic bleach of n3, n5, and n6, respectively), whereas the other fast component is attributed to slower transport throughout the film to eventually reach the highest and lowest n QWs. The long ∼4 ns component is attributed to recombination (see Figure  S5  for decay associated spectra for these lifetimes and fit residuals). Transfer from lowto high-n QWs is due to exciton and electron transfer, whereas high-to low-n transfer results from hole migration. This is consistent with the band structure of mixed Q2D perovskites (Figure  3c ) that has been previously determined using UPS on films  15  and single crystals,  11  as well as inferred from TA experiments.  16  Extrapolating the results from ⟨n⟩ = 3 PEA films, we predict that this picosecond hole transfer from high to low n would cause the lower-n QWs to act as shallow traps for holes in the device relevant ⟨n⟩ = 10 films. We sought to determine if the hole-trapping low-n QWs (n = 3-6) that are more abundant in the ⟨n⟩ = 10 PEA-and BTAbased films would be detrimental to carrier transport. PL quenching methods have been used to study transport properties (lifetimes, diffusion lengths, and mobilities) in quantum dot solids and in bulk perovskite thin films.  2, 20  We follow the formalism of Tisdale et al.,  21  which expands upon the 1D PL quenching method to determine diffusion lengths in thin films, and use the same quencher materials as in previously reported quenching experiments for perovskites.  2, 20  Analytical solutions to the 1D diffusion equation and some approximations lead to the following expression of the carrier diffusion length, L D , π τ τ ≈ - ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ L d 2 2 1 D quench which relies only on the film thickness (d), carrier lifetime, and quenched lifetimes for electrons and holes in order to estimate the diffusion length. Small variations in thickness determine the error in estimates of L D and other transport parameters. Figure  S6  shows the fitted transient PL data for three different films with and without the quencher layers. L D for electrons and holes in each film and the parameters used for its calculation are shown in Table  1 . Mobilities are calculated using the diffusion length equation and Einstein relation: τ = L D D μ = D kT q / The ALA-based films have the highest L D and μ, longest lifetimes, and most balanced transport out of the three different ligands. PEA has comparatively large L D for electrons but is significantly limited by hole diffusion, whereas the BTA films exhibit low lifetimes and relatively poor L D for both carriers. Again in the case of BTA, the hole diffusion length is much lower than that of the electron. These findings corroborate our ultrafast TA results, and support the notion that the presence of lower-n QWs in the ⟨n⟩ = 10 films for PEA and BTA should lead to shallow trapping of holes. The PL quenching studies indicate that ALA-based films benefit greatly from the lack of lower-n QWs in these materials, and also suggest that the flattened energy landscape of the more monodisperse QW width distribution assists transport, since the electron mobility of ALA is greater than both BTA and PEA. This is analogous to the influence of bandgap polydispersity on transport and photovoltaic efficiency in quantum dot solids,  22, 23  where a flatter energy landscape and reduced number of shallow traps increases carrier mobility. To examine whether the superior transport properties of ALA films were due to faster charge transfer (as a result of reduced ligand length), we performed TA experiments on mixed low-n films and monitored the lowest energy bleach peak for funneling of carriers (Figure  S8 ). Most notably, ALA and BTA have similar transfer rates despite their different lengths. We also point out that any significantly enhanced electronic coupling from shorter ligands should result in a red-shift of the exciton peaks (as demonstrated in low-dimensional perovskites by Soe et al. using guanidinium as a ligand),  24  yet we do not observe such a red-shift here. We conclude that the small difference in ligand length between ALA, BTA, and PEA is not responsible for the longer diffusion lengths and higher mobilities in ALA films. Anticipating that longer, balanced L D for electrons and holes should lead to increased photovoltaic efficiency, we fabricated solar cells out of the ⟨n⟩ = 10 films for each ligand. J-V curves measured for devices with the three different ligands are shown in Figure  4 , and their characteristics are listed in Table  2 . Out of the three different ligands, the ALA-based films show the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.4% compared to 12.1% and 11.5% for the PEA and BTA films, respectively. While the PEA and BTA devices both possess V OC similar to ALA, they are limited by the fill factor (FF) in the case of PEA and the photocurrent (J SC ) in the case of BTA. We note that the PCE obtained for PEA, and its stability over time when stored under ambient conditions, is very close to that previously reported for nearly identical devices (see ref 8). Owing to the aforementioned performance-stability compromise that follows from the choice of ⟨n⟩, it is important to ensure that the augmented performance of ALA-based films does not arise simply due to these films having a higher ⟨n⟩ QW distribution after being cast into a film (e.g., if ⟨n⟩ = 10 was designated in solution, but a distribution closer to ⟨n⟩ = 20 or 30 actually formed in film due to incomplete ligand incorporation, or the varying solubility between ligands). We rule this out, since the TA peak maximum for the ⟨n⟩ = 10 films is roughly the same (∼750 nm) for all three ligands, indicating that the mixed QWs exhibit a similar degree of confinement and therefore similar ⟨n⟩. We also determined the ligand-tomethylammonium (L:MA) ratios in the films by redissolving them in d 6 -DMSO and then integrating the relevant peaks in 1 H NMR spectra. The L:MA ratios were found to be 0.32:1 (⟨n⟩ = 7), 0:32:1 (⟨n⟩ = 7), and 0.26:1 (⟨n⟩ = 9) for ALA, PEA,   and BTA, respectively (Figures  S9-S12 ). This indicates that the ⟨n⟩ distribution for ALA is not artificially higher than the other ligands. Additionally, the photovoltaic devices have very similar stabilities when stored under ambient conditions, retaining roughly more than 90% of their initial PCEs after 500 h (Figure  S13 ). If the ⟨n⟩ distribution for the ALA films were higher, the increase in performance would be accompanied by a decrease in stability.  8  We thus conclude that the ALA devices' superior performance is derived from the reduced number of lower-n QWs in these films. We also reaffirm the assessment that the lower-n QWs in PEA and BTA films act shallow traps rather than deep traps, since such an abundance of deep traps would be expected to lead to much worse device performances. We speculate that the higher n distribution in ALA films compared to PEA and BTA results from the differences in intermolecular bonding at the QW interfaces. The formation energies for various n value QWs using PEA have been calculated using density functional theory (DFT), and it was determined that lower-n QWs have higher formation energies due to the van der Waals and π-stacking interactions between the PEA moieties, favoring the initial formation of low-n QWs regardless of precursor stoichiometry in solution.  8  BTA molecules also have similar van der Waals interactions to stabilize the interfaces between QWs. Since ALA has only the single CC bond to promote intermolecular interactions between QWs, we suspect that this lowers the formation energy for lower-n QWs, and thus allows for a distribution of QWs that is closer to the originally designated ratio in solution. This would suggest that the loss in formation energy would make these films more unstable and susceptible to degradation; however, our device aging studies indicate that this is not the case. A full understanding of the mechanism that links the choice of ligand with the QW n distribution is an important future direction for this field. The composition of all of the films studied thus far follows the formula (L) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n-1 , i.e. iodine as the halide and MA as the A-site cations. Numerous reports indicate that perovskites with mixed halide (I/Br) and mixed cation (MA, FA, and Cs) compositions achieve higher PCEs.  6, [25] [26] [27]  We fabricated ⟨n⟩ = 10 perovskite devices using a mixed halide (85:15 I:Br) and mixed cation composition (0.14:0.81:0.05 MA:FA:Cs) reported to give efficiencies over 21% in 3D perovskites,  25  using the formula ALA 2 (MA 0.14 FA 0.81 Cs 0.05 ) 9 -Pb 10 (I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 29 . Device performance and hysteresis depended heavily on the halides and solvents used in the precursor solution. In particular, precursor solutions containing dimethylformamide as the primary solvent resulted in much lower performance than a 1:1 mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide and γbutyrolactone, and using a ratio of 0.15:0.85 Br to I also lowered the overall device performance (Figures  S14  and S15 ). However, when Br is removed from this mixture but the mixed cation composition (0.81:0.14:0.05 for FA:MA:Cs) is retained, device performances up to 16.5% could be obtained via an increase in J SC compared to the pure-MA devices (Figure  4 ), with a similar degree of hysteresis (Figure  S16 ). These results, along with more recent reports of mixed cation perovskite QW photovoltaics,  6, 9  indicate the potential of these lower-dimensional perovskite QW photovoltaics to achieve higher efficiencies while maintaining stability. The hysteresis that is present in both the MA-only and mixed cation films needs to be addressed but can be overcome with strategies such as increasing ⟨n⟩ 8 or preheating substrates prior to film deposition (hot-casting).  10   
 ■ CONCLUSION This work illustrates that the choice of organic ligand can be exploited to influence beneficially the distribution in QW widths in low-dimensional perovskites. This control can in turn be used to improve the materials' optoelectronic properties. Within a polydisperse distribution, lower-dimensional QWs can act as ultrafast shallow traps for holes in materials with intermediately high ⟨n⟩. This severely limits hole diffusion lengths, while the nonflat energy landscape similarly slows electron mobility. Materials using the ligand allylammonium (ALA) result in a greatly reduced number of lower-n QWs, and therefore a reduced number of hole traps. Photovoltaics based on ALA perovskite QWs exhibit better efficiency while maintaining stability, indicating that controlling the QW width distribution is crucial to overcoming the performancestability compromise in low-dimensional perovskite devices. 
 ■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Synthesis of Allylammonium Iodide. A typical reaction entailed mixing 7.5 mL of allylamine (5.7 g, 0.1 mol) into 15-30 mL of isopropanol (IPA) cooled in an ice bath. A cold (∼4 °C, stored in a fridge prior) solution of 12.3 mL of 57% HI (0.9 mol of HI) is added dropwise to the cooled allylamine/IPA mixture. This mixture is left to react for 2 h, slowly warming up to room temperature (e.g., allow ice to melt in bath instead of replacing). The solvent is then evaporated under reduced pressure, and the remaining white solid is left to dry for an additional 30 min under mild heating and vacuum (the temperature was maintained at 70 °C max to evaporate any water from the HI solution). The solid is then stirred in diethyl ether for 10-15 min before being filtered and washed five times with more diethyl ether. This washed solid white powder is then recrystallized by dissolving it in boiling IPA and subsequently reprecipitating with diethyl ether. The recrystallized solid is isolated via vacuum filtration, washed an additional three times with diethyl ether, and then held under a vacuum for 16 h before being brought into a nitrogen glovebox for storage and use. Preparation of Perovskite Precursor Solutions. Precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving mixtures of lead(II) iodide (PbI 2 ), lead(II) bromide (PbBr 2 ), methylammonium iodide (MAI), methylammonium bromide (MABr), formadinium iodide (FAI), cesium iodide (CsI), phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI), butylammonium iodide (BTAI), and allylammonium iodide (ALAI) in the solvents DMF, DMSO, or GBL. For the only MA, only I ⟨n⟩ = 10 films, we use the formula ALA 2 MA 9 Pb 10 I 29 , with [Pb 2+ ] = 1.4-1.6 M in a 1:1 mixture of DMSO:GBL. This solvent mixture is used throughout the manuscript unless otherwise stated, and ALA is always interchangeable with PEA or BTA. For the mixed cation, mixed halide ⟨n⟩ = 10 films, we use the formula ALA 2 (MA 0.14 FA 0.81 Cs 0.05 ) 9 Pb 10 -(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 29 , with [Pb 2+ ] = 1.4-1.6 M, and for the mixed cation, only I ⟨n⟩ = 10 films, we use the formula ALA 2 (MA 0.14 FA 0.81 Cs 0.05 ) 9 Pb 10 I 29 . Example of a typical preparation of a 0.5 mL, [Pb 2+ ] = 1.6 M precursor solution: In a nitrogen glovebox, 368.8 mg (0.80 mmol) of PbI 2 , 16.3 mg (0.103 mmol) of MAI, 100 mg (0.58 mmol) of FAI, 9.4 mg (0.04 mmol) of CsI, and 29.6 mg (0.16 mmol) of ALAI are dissolved in 0.5 mL of a 1:1 mixture of GBL:DMSO. This solution is heated to 70 °C and stirred at this temperature for at least 1 h before being cooled to room temperature, and filtered (0.22 μm, PTFE) into a new vial to be suitable for deposition. Deposition of Perovskite Films. A 70-80 μL portion of perovskite precursor solution was dropped onto a substrate for a twostep spinning procedure. The first step was 1000 rpm for 10 s with an acceleration of 100 rpm s -1 , followed by 5000 rpm for 60 s with an acceleration of 800 rpm s -1 . 100 μL of chlorobenzene antisolvent is dropped onto the spinning substrate 30 s into the second spinning step. The substrate is then transferred onto a hot plate at 100 °C to be annealed for 30 min. This procedure is identical for depositing films on glass and on substrates for device fabrication. For films on glass, the substrates are first treated with oxygen plasma for 5 min before spincoating the perovskite. Photoluminescence Measurements. PL measurements were performed using a Horiba Fluorolog Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) system with photomultiplier tube detectors. A pulsed laser diode (507 nm, 110-140 ps pulse width) was used as the excitation source for steady-state and transient measurements. For transient and steady-state measurements, a 200 ns period (0.28 nJ per pulse) was used to capture accurate carrier lifetimes. Photoluminescence Experiments. Films are prepared with identical precursor stoichiometry, but the solutions are diluted to [Pb 2+ ] = 0.85 M in order to obtain thinner (∼200 nm) films. In a nitrogen glovebox, perovskite films are deposited onto glass substrates and annealed following the method described above. After the films have cooled, the quenching layers are deposited using the same spin-coating parameters and solution concentrations as Stranks et al. 20: solutions (in chlorobenzene) of PMMA (10 mg/mL), PCBM (30 mg/mL), and spiro-OMeTAD (65 mg/mL) are prepared. The PMMA and PCBM solutions are spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 20 s, and the spiro-OMeTAD film is spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 20 s. Transient Absorption Measurements. Femtosecond laser pulses of a 1030 nm fundamental beam at a 5 kHz repetition rate were produced using a regeneratively amplified Yb:KGW laser (PHAROS, Light Conversion). Part of the fundamental beam was used to pump an optical parametric amplifier (ORPHEUS, Light Conversion) to serve as a narrowband pump with a tunable wavelength of 320-2200 nm (the pump wavelengths used in this study were 400, 610, and 640 nm), while the other part was focused into a sapphire crystal to generate a white-light supercontinuum probe (400-800 nm window). Both the pump and probe pulses were directed into a commercial transient absorption spectrometer (Helios, Ultrafast). Delaying the probe pulse relative to the pump provides a time window of up to 8 ns, and the time resolution of these experiments was ∼300 fs (estimated by the rise time of signal amplitudes in transient absorption spectra). All measurements were performed using an average power of 20 μW (for all wavelengths) with a spot size of ∼0.40 μm 2 , assuming a Gaussian beam profile. Device Fabrication. Prepatterned indium tin oxide (ITO, TFD Devices) coated glass substrates were sonicated in acetone and isopropanol sequentially for 30 min each before being dried under a flow of nitrogen gas. Titanium oxide (TiO 2 ) nanoparticles prepared according to ref 25 were deposited at 3000 rpm for 30 s with no ramping; this step is repeated twice. The substrates are then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in air, cooled, and then brought into a nitrogen glovebox. The perovskite layer is deposited as described above. After the perovskite layer is annealed and cooled, a solution of spiro-OMeTad (65 mg/mL), doped with 20 μL/mL of tert-butylpyridine and 70 μL/mL of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (170 mg/mL in acetonitrile), is deposited by spinning at 4000 rpm for 20 s with an acceleration of 2000 rpm s -1 . A 120 nm Au contact is deposited by electron-beam evaporation at a rate of 1.0 Å s -1 . Device Testing. The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of the solar simulator (Newport, Class A) at a light intensity of 100 mW cm -2 as checked with a calibrated reference solar cell (Newport). Unless otherwise stated, the J-V curves were all measured in a nitrogen atmosphere with a scanning rate of 50 mV s -1 (voltage step of 10 mV and delay time of 200 ms). The active area was determined by the aperture shade mask (0.049 cm 2 for small-area devices) placed in front of the solar cell. A spectral mismatch factor of 1 was used for all J-V measurements. The dark long-term stability assessment of solar cells was carried out by repeating the J-V characterizations over various times (∼1 week apart each). The devices were stored in a cabinet with dry air with a relative humidity between 30 and 40%. The chamber containing the cells for testing was purged with and maintained under nitrogen flow during the measurements. Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-Ray Scattering (GIWAXS). GIWAXS data was collected at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center in Hsinchu, Taiwan. Two-dimensional scattering was collected at a 2°incidence, with monochromatic 15 keV X-Rays and recorded on a flat panel detector measuring 50 × 50 mm 2 . Samples were measured in air. Data for phenethylammonium samples was collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource at a 2°i ncidence, monochromatic 12.7 keV X-Rays, and recorded on a Rayonix Mx-225 detector measuring 225 × 225 mm 2 . Samples were measured in a chamber filled with helium. All images were calibrated using LaB6 and integrated to 1D patterns using the Nika software package 28 and the GIXSGUI MATLAB plugin.  29  ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI:  Figure S1 . S1 Figure S1. Gaussian fits to main exciton bleaches for 〈n〉 = 10 films of ALA, PEA and BTA. (a) Single and (b) double Gaussian fits to the exciton bleach of ALA. The single fit peak estimates a FWHM that is ~200 meV smaller than the crude fits for PEA and BTA. The addition of a small, slightly blue shifted peak improves the overall fit for ALA, indicating some polydispersity of higher n QWs within this inhomogenously broadened peak. (c) Single and (d) double Gaussian fits for the exciton bleach of PEA. Using a second bluer Gaussian greatly improves the fit, and allows better visualization of the variably quantum confined n = ~6 -8 QWs within this broad peak. (e) Single and (f) double Gaussian fits for the BTA films. In both cases the fit is poor, owing to the very large polydispersity at the exciton peak, and the prominent presence of lower n QWs.

Spin-coated under identical conditions to the 〈n〉 = 10 discussed throughout this work.With such a low 〈n〉 value, the lowest n peaks such as n1 at 510 nm and n2 at 570 nm become apparent, especially for PEA. ALA features some n1 and n2 QWs, but has a tighter focus on n3 (610 nm), n4 (640 nm) and then larger n (6 -10+) QWs further to the red. PEA exhibits large amplitudes for all peaks ranging between n1 and n10+; the distribution is similar for BTA besides the lack of n1 QWs. Each time trace is normalized to the most negative peak at each time, showing the growth or decay of neighboring peaks with time as charges migrate between QWs.

This multiplet is split into two symmetric peaks, but one of them is overlapping with the signal from the ammonium protons, making it artificially larger upon integration (~0.6). Therefore we integrate of the signal as 0.26 and then double it to 0.52 for ratio calculations. Peak for methylammonium is at 2.38 ppm (3H). See Figure SX for ratios.

Methods Chemicals DI water, urea, hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37 wt. % in water), thioglycolic acid (TGA, 98%), SnCl2•2H2O (>99.995%) , dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), diethyl ether, chlorobenzene, chloroform, isopropyl alcohol, lithium Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt (Li-TFSI), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 2,2',7,7'-Tetrakis(N,N -di-p -methoxyphenylamino)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD, LT-S922) and Tris(2-(1H -pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III)Tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide)) salt (Co(III) TFSI) were purchased from Lumtec. Methylammonium chloride (MACl) was purchased from Dyenamo. Formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium bromide (MABr), and n-hexylammonium bromide were purchased from GreatCell Solar Materials. Lead iodide (PbI2) and lead bromide (PbBr2) were purchased from TCI America. Au pellets were purchased from Kurt J. Lesker. 
 Chemical Bath Deposition (CBD) of SnO2 layer The FTO substrate was cleaned by sonicating in Hellmanex solution, DI water, acetone, and IPA for 10 min each. The CBD solution was prepared by mixing 625 mg of urea, 625 μL of HCl, 12.5 μL of TGA, and 137.5 mg of SnCl2•2H2O per 50 mL of DI water. We noticed there is an obvious difference in solubility between low purity (>99.99%) and high purity (>99.995%) SnCl2•2H2O. When dissolved in DI water, prior to adding HCl, the reaction solution with low purity source stays murky while the high purity source dissolves completely to yield a transparent solution. Thus, we strongly suggest using the high purity source (>99.995%). One edge of the FTO substrate was taped with a kapton tape to prevent deposition of SnO2. The FTO substrates and the CBD solution were loaded onto a glass reaction vessel and reacted at 90 °C until the desired pH is reached. Specifically, we used a Hellendahl staining dish with the vessel volume of ~170 mL. Eight 1""x 1"" FTO substrates were vertically placed inside the vessel and 50 mL of the CBD solution were added. The reaction vessel was placed inside a water bath set to a target temperature. The pH of the reaction solution was monitored and the reaction was ended by removing the substrate at the target pH. It took 4 hrs to reach pH 1.5, 6hrs to reach pH 3, and 7 hrs to reach pH 6. The pH was measured after the solution cooled down to room temperature. After the reaction is complete, the SnO2 deposited FTO substrate was removed from the reaction vessel and cleaned via sonication with DI water and IPA for 5min each. Figure  2e  shows the progress of the synthesis of SnO2 via CBD. At the early stage of the reaction (Stage A-i), the SnO2 layer does not fully cover the underlying FTO layer and poor film coverage with shallow valence band results in inefficient hole blocking capability, leading to detrimental interface recombination and poor device performance. When the reaction reaches Stage A-ii, high quality SnO2 layer forms a compact and conformal film, providing sufficient coverage of the underlying TCO. The ideal morphology and chemical composition of SnO2 ETL during Stage A-ii leads to an efficient extraction of the charge carrier from the perovskite layer without energy loss through non-radiative pathways, supported by high FF and VOC, and ultimately the PCE. When the reaction continues past this ""magic region"", the SnO2 layer contains unwanted site defects, as a form of oxygen vacancy, (Stage A-iii) and further the formation of secondary crystal phases (Stage B) inhibit efficient charge extraction and transport.  1, 2  Our results show that careful engineering of the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the ETL film, such as satisfying the coverage needed to prevent interfacial recombination, and suppressing the formation of detrimental defects, along with suppressing the formation of secondary crystal phases, is crucial for fabricating high performance PSCs. 
 Device fabrication The FTO/SnO2 substrate was annealed in an ambient environment (RH 15-30%) at 170 °C for 60 min, followed by spincoating10 mM KCl in DI water at 3000 rpm for 30 sec (2000 rpm ramp) and annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. All SnO2 layers were equally treated with an aqueous solution of potassium chloride as such salts have been reported to reduce hysteresis, interface recombination, and improve luminescence.  [3] [4] [5]  Before perovskite deposition, the FTO/SnO2 substrate was oxygen plasma treated and pumped inside a nitrogen glovebo x. We used a FA-based perovskite composition with excess PbI2 stoichiometry (9 mol%), due to its positive effect in enhancing device performance  6, 7  , and with MACl as an additive, due to its role in stabilizing the intermediate phase and enhancing perovskite orientation.  8, 9  The perovskite solution was prepared by mixing 1.53 M PbI2, 1.4 M FAI, 0.5 M MACl, and 0.0122 M (0.8 mol%)-0.153 M (10 mol%) MAPbBr3 in DMF:DMSO=8:1. The perovskite solution deposited via spin coating at 1000 rpm for 10 sec, and 5000 rpm for 30 sec (both 2000 rpm ramp). 10 seconds into the 5000 rpm setting, 600 μL of diethyl ether solution was deposited onto the substrate. Afterwards, the FTO/SnO2/perovskite substrate was annealed at 100 °C for 60 min. For the 2D perovskite passivation, 10 mM of alkylammonium bromide was deposited at 3000 rpm for 30 sec and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min.  
 Device Characterization Current density-voltage (J-V) curves were recorded using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class AAA, 91195A) and a source meter (Keithley 2420). The illumination was set to AM 1.5G and calibrated to 100 mW/cm 2 using a calibrated silicon reference cell. The step voltage was 10 mV and the delay time was 50 ms. The active area was controlled by using a dark mask with a defined aperture. Long-term stability (Supplementary Figure  23 ) was performed by tracking the maximum power point (MPP) under continuous illumination (Newport, Oriel Class ABA, 94062A, AM 1.5G, 100 mW/cm 2 ), in a nitrogen environment. Our long-term stability follows ISOS-L-1I testing protocol (Light source: solar simulator, temperature: ambient, rel. humidity: ambient, environment/set-up: lightly only, characterization light source: solar simulator, Load: MPP). The stability test was performed without active cooling and the device temperature is measured to be ~45 °C.  10  Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) The SEM images were recorded using a Zeiss Merlin High-resolution SEM and the XRD patterns were collected using a Rigaku SmartLab and a Bruker D8 Discovery Diffractometer with a General Area Detector Diffraction System. 
 Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) CV measurement was performed using potentiostat (AUTOLAB PGSTAT 302N, Metrohm Autolab) with 0.1V/s of scan rate in a three-electrode configuration using a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode, Pt counter electrode, and the synthesized films as working electrode under dark condition. 0.5 M KCl aqueous solution added 0.5 mM potassium ferricyanide and 0.5 mM potassium hexacyano-ferrate was used as the electrolyte. 
 UVVis and photoluminescence measurement UVVis was recorded using Cary UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The PL was recorded using a SpectraPro monochromator and PIXIS CCD from Princeton Instruments with 532 nm exciation using a laser diode from Thorlabs. 
 Electroluminescence (EL) Characterization The devices were encapsulated and the EL was measured under ambient conditions in the dark. The device was voltage driven, and the current was measured simultaneously by a Keithley 2636A sourcemeter. The photocurrent was collected using a calibrated Newport 818-UV/DB Silicon photodetector coupled to a Newport 1835-C Multifunction Optical meter. EL spectra are collected using an Ocean Optics USB 2000 spectrometer using a multimode fiber positioned over the center of the active area. The I-V-Photocurrent sweep was run by a custom Labview code with the sweep rate of 5 mV/s. 
 Transient photovoltage (TPV) and photocurrent (TPC) The photovoltaic devices were electrically connected to a digital oscilloscope (500 MHz, DSO-X 3054A, Agilent) with BNC cables. To obtain charge decay time of open-circuit and charge extraction time of short-circuit, the input impedance of oscilloscope was set to be 1 MΩ and 50 Ω for open circuit condition and short circuit condition, respectively. The TPV and TPC were measured under 0.346 Sun illumination by light source of Xe lamp (Zolix, 150W), and were taken using a nanosecond laser of the 532 nm excitation (EKSPLA, NT342A-10) as a small perturbation. 
 Time Resolved Photoluminescence Time resolved photoluminescence lifetimes were collected using a 532 nm picosecond pulsed diode laser (Picoquant; LDH-P-FA-530-B) adjusted the repetition rate using a pulse generator (Stanford Research; DG535). The excitation power was adjusted using neutral density filters and focused to a spot size of ~100 μm in diameter. The emission from the film was collected and collimated using an off-axis parabolic mirror (Thorlabs; MPD269V) and measured with a silicon single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detector (Micro Photon Devices; $PD-100-C0C). Scattered laser excitation was suppressed using a 532 nm notch filter (Chroma; ZET532NF) and a 550 nm longpass filter (Thorlabs; FELH0550). The 532 nm laser harmonic was suppressed using a 900 nm shortpass filter (Thorlabs; FESH0900). Photon arrival times were recorded using a time-correlated single photon counting card (Picoquant; PicoHarp 300) and all analysis was performed in Matlab. The carrier density was 1.125×10 15 cm -3 . Optical Pump -THz Probe (OPTP) Spectroscopy. The perovskite thin films for OPTP was prepared by using 0.5 M concentration with same spin coating parameters. The time-resolved optical pump and THz probe spectroscopy was performed by utilizing 100-fs laser pulses generated from a 1-kHz Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (Spitfire Ace Pro, Spectra Physics) operating at 800 nm. Optical pump pulses at 400 nm were achieved by second harmonic generation in a beta barium borate (BBO) crystal, whereas THz pulses serving as the probe beam were generated by optical rectification in a 2-mm-thick ZnTe crystal and detected by electro-optic sampling method. The pump-induced THz transmission changes were then measured by using a lock-in-Amplifier (SR830, Stanford Research Systems) depending on the time delay between the pump and probe beams controlled by a motorized stage, while the 400-nm pump pulses were modulated at 190 Hz by the optical chopper. All the measurements were performed under 2% humidity by purging the entire THz beam path with dry air. Supplementary Figure  15 .   Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are an emerging photovoltaic technology with the potential to disrupt the mature silicon solar cell market. Great improvements in device performance over the past few years, thanks to the development of fabrication protocols  [1] [2] [3]  , chemical compositions  4, 5  and phase stabilization methods  [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]  , have made PSCs one of the most efficient and low-cost solutionprocessable photovoltaic technologies. However, the light-harvesting performance of these devices is still limited by excessive charge carrier recombination. Despite much effort, the performance of the best-performing PSCs is capped by relatively low fill factors and high open-circuit voltage deficits (the radiative open-circuit voltage limit minus the high open-circuit voltage)  11  . Improvements in charge carrier management, which is closely tied to the fill factor and the open-circuit voltage, thus provide a path towards increasing the device performance of PSCs, and reaching their theoretical efficiency limit  12  . Here we report a holistic approach to improving the performance of PSCs through enhanced charge carrier management. First, we develop an electron transport layer with an ideal film coverage, thickness and composition by tuning the chemical bath deposition of tin dioxide (SnO 2 ). Second, we decouple the passivation strategy between the bulk and the interface, leading to improved properties, while minimizing the bandgap penalty. In forward bias, our devices exhibit an electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of up to 17.2 per cent and an electroluminescence energy conversion efficiency of up to 21.6 per cent. As solar cells, they achieve a certified power conversion efficiency of 25.2 per cent, corresponding to 80.5 per cent of the thermodynamic limit of its bandgap. SnO 2 -based electron transport layers (ETLs) offer favourable band alignment, while being processable at low temperature  [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]  . Of the various deposition methods, SnO 2 nanoparticle-based ETLs have demonstrated the best performances thus far. However, SnO 2 nanoparticle-based PSCs exhibit relatively low electroluminescence external quantum efficiency (EQE) values, and hence higher open-circuit voltage (V OC ) deficits (defined as the radiative V OC limit minus the high V OC ), compared to TiO 2 -based PSCs 8 , in spite of efforts to eliminate non-radiative recombination pathways  19  . The electroluminescence EQE of a photovoltaic device, determined by measuring the luminescence efficiency under forward bias, is a direct measure of the radiative efficiency of carrier recombination. The electroluminescence EQE can be used to quantify the non-radiative contribution to the V OC deficit via the reciprocity theorem, and is a useful metric for solar cell characterization  11, 20  . Thus, it is crucial to develop strategies that minimize photovoltage losses at the ETL/perovskite interface so as to minimize the V OC deficit, encouraging the search for a different deposition method that can develop the full potential of SnO 2 ETLs. The ideal SnO 2 ETL will generate a high photovoltage and fill factor by having complete and conformal coverage without pinholes, an ideal band alignment to efficiently extract electrons while blocking hole back-transfer, a low defect density to prevent detrimental interface recombinations, and will also be thin enough to promote efficient charge extraction  21  .

 III-V Multijunction Cells As a part of our holistic approach, we first report a facile method of chemically tuning the physical and electronic properties of the SnO 2 ETL via chemical bath deposition. Chemical bath deposition enables uniform and complete coverage of the underlying substrate by depositing a dense and conformal layer  22, 23  . However, a lack of understanding of the complex chemical reactions during SnO 2 chemical bath deposition has prevented the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs. We infer that the 
 Article Sn intermediate species during chemical bath deposition play a crucial part in the quality and the characteristics of the final SnO 2 layer. More specifically, we suggest that the formation of various Sn intermediate species depends on the decomposition pathway of the Sn 2+ precursor (SnCl 2 ), which depends on the pH of the reaction solution  [24] [25] [26]  . 
 Synthesis and characterization of SnO 2 Freshly prepared chemical bath deposition solutions exhibit pH <1 and the pH increases with longer reaction time as urea decomposes and releases OH -(Supplementary Fig.  1 ). We divide the changes in the thin film properties of the SnO 2 layer with reaction time into two main stages as shown in Fig.  1 . Stage A shows the growth of SnO 2 layer with planar morphologies. Within stage A, stage A-i at early reaction times is the most acidic (pH 1), followed by stage A-ii (pH 1.5) and stage A-iii (pH 3). Stage B is the final stage of the reaction with a distinct morphology of interconnected nanorods and has the highest pH of 6. Figure  1a -d shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the SnO 2 layer deposited on top of a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-covered glass via chemical bath deposition. The top-right insets are magnified top-down SEM images, highlighting the roughness and surface morphology of the film, with the SnO 2 layer more clearly seen on top of a pyramid-shaped FTO domain. The insets on the bottom-right are cross-section transmission electron microscope (TEM) images. In the early stage of the reaction (stage A-i), which is when the pH of the reaction solution is still approximately 1, the SnO 2 layer is about 20 nm thick, conformal with the underlying FTO layer. With increasing reaction time, and thus an increase in the pH of the reaction solution, the size of the SnO 2 domain increases while forming a densely packed layer with thicknesses ranging from around 50 nm to around 100 nm (Fig.  1b, c ). When the reaction reaches stage B, the SnO 2 begins to grow into elongated rod-like morphologies (Fig.  1d ). The high-resolution TEM shown in Fig.  1b  (stage A-ii) shows a SnO 2 layer forming complete coverage with interconnected domains, even down to the sharp valleys within the FTO layer (Fig.  1e ). The conformal and complete SnO 2 coverage is further confirmed by cyclic voltammetry, which shows that the films have robust hole-blocking capabilities when reacted past stage A-ii, or pH 1.5 (Supplementary Fig.  2 ), whereas stage A-i SnO 2 is inefficient at hole blocking. The lattice fringes in Fig.  1f   pure phase, whereas films prepared by allowing the reaction solution to reach stage B contain secondary phases, such as Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4 and SnO (Fig.  1g ). 
 SnO 2 synthesis mechanism From the experimental results, we classify the reaction progress into four parts (Fig.  1h ). At the beginning of the reaction (stages A-i and A-ii, pH = 1-1.5), the dominant product of the chemical bath deposition reaction is SnO 2. As the reaction progresses to stage A-iii, owing to a sharp decrease in oxygen dissolved in the reaction solution, incomplete oxidation of Sn 2+ to Sn 4+ is highly likely (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). This leads to dominant production of SnO 2-x, 0<x<2 (ref.  24  ). In addition, the chemical bath deposition solution turns murky around this reaction stage, owing to the formation of insoluble amorphous tin oxide species (inset in Fig.  1h )  24  . When the reaction reaches stage B, oxygen-deficient SnO 2-x is joined by Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4 and SnO, which are produced as secondary phases (red precipitate shown in the inset), as observed from the X-ray diffraction data (Fig.  1g  and Supplementary Fig.  4 ). We propose a synthesis mechanism during the chemical bath deposition growth of SnO 2 in Fig.  1i . In stage A, the Sn 2+ ions dissolved in strong acidic aqueous solution undergo a hydrolysis reaction, and form Sn(OH) + intermediate species. Sn(OH) + is then oxidized to Sn 4+ by the dissolved oxygen in the solution  24  . The Sn 4+ ions then react with OH - ions, provided by the decomposition of urea, to form Sn(OH) 4 species, which are converted to SnO 2 via a dehydration reaction (top branch in Fig.  1i )  24, 27  . However, Sn 2+ ions from Sn(OH) + can then be readily incorporated into the SnO 2 lattice owing to the comparable ionic radii of Sn 2+ (0.62 Å) and Sn 4+ (0.69 Å) for hexa-coordinated Sn species (middle branch in Fig.  1i )  [28] [29] [30]    
 Article which is synthesized in stage A-iii, as a result of a sharp decrease in oxygen dissolved in the reaction solution. When the reaction reaches stage B, a different Sn intermediate species, Sn 3 (OH) 4 2+ , forms in the reaction  25, 31     25, 26, 32  ). The Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4 is then partially transformed to SnO via a dehydration reaction, producing a mixture of Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4 and SnO (bottom branch in Fig.  1i ), consistent with the X-ray diffraction results  26, 33  . 
 SnO 2 ETL-based PSCs We fabricated a series of PSCs up to different stages for the growth of the SnO 2 layer to evaluate device performance (Fig.  2 ). PSCs with stage A-i SnO 2 show an average efficiency of about 20% with a relatively wide power conversion efficiency (PCE) distribution (Fig.  2a ). A noticeable improvement in device performance is observed for stage A-ii SnO 2 , where the PCE exceeds 24%, with the greatest improvements in V OC and fill factor (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). These devices show a stabilized power output of up to 24.5% with a certified quasi-steady state PCE up to 24.2% (Fig.  2b  and Supplementary Figs.  6 7 8 9 ). We attribute this substantial advancement in device performance to complete and conformal coverage of the SnO 2 layer, which prevents interfacial recombination. In contrast, when the reaction reaches stage A-iii, we observe a noticeable drop in device performance, with the greatest contribution from lower fill factor and V OC values despite complete film coverage and no detectable non-SnO 2 phases. To understand this device result, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence and transient photovoltage measurements to probe the interaction between the SnO 2 layers (stages A-ii and A-iii) and the perovskite active layer carefully (Fig.  2c, d ). Defects within a solar cell act as a carrier trap sites where the energy is lost through non-radiative recombination pathways. Thus, an ideal solar cell should be free from such trap sites. We performed time-resolved photoluminescence measurements because detrimental interfacial trap states lead to reduced carrier lifetimes. The time-resolved photoluminescence results show a much shorter carrier lifetime for stage A-iii SnO 2 than for stage A-ii samples, indicating an increase in non-radiative interfacial recombination between SnO 2 and perovskite, and thus leading to lower photovoltage and fill factor. From transient photovoltage measurements, we confirmed much longer decay times in stage A-ii devices than in stage A-iii PSCs, which further indicates reduced non-radiative pathways for stage A-ii SnO 2 -based devices. Inferior device performance for stage A-iii SnO 2 devices is the result of reduced carrier lifetime, where the increase in defects in the SnO 2 layer is responsible for an increase in non-radiative recombination where the position of the δ-phase is displayed as the dotted line and the diffraction peaks that corresponds to the δ-phase is highlighted in yellow. The perovskite thin film without any MAPbBr 3 (0 mol%) shows detectable amount of δ-phase. d, Time-resolved photoluminescence traces for perovskite thin films with decreasing amounts of added MAPbBr 3 . Carrier lifetimes τ are obtained from a mono-exponential fit. e, Effective mobility for perovskite thin films determined from optical pump-terahertz probe measurements (error bars show one standard deviation). pathways. In metal oxide thin films, oxygen vacancies act as site defects; their negative effects are especially important in films composed of tiny domains with high surface areas, such as in our SnO 2 films synthesized via chemical bath deposition. Both X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy suggest higher concentrations of defects for stage A-iii SnO 2 , as a form of oxygen vacancy, shown by the shift of the Sn 3d 5/2 state towards lower binding energy (Supplementary Fig.  10a )  28, 30, [34] [35] [36]  , gradual increase in absorptivity in the ultravioletblue wavelength range (Supplementary Fig.  10b ), and higher Raman signal (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). The uncontrolled formation of defects in stage A-iii SnO 2 films not only increases charge recombination at the SnO 2 /perovskite interface, but also limits electron transport through SnO 2 nanodomains (Supplementary Fig.  12 ). On the other hand, the suppressed formation of surface defects for stage A-ii SnO 2 films is critical for realizing high fill factor and a low V OC deficit, along with appropriate surface coverage (Supplementary Fig.  13 ). In addition, the ETL needs to have a deep relative valence band in order to efficiently prevent hole quenching at the ETL/perovskite interface. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy shows that the deepest valence band is achieved during stage A-ii (Supplementary Fig.  14 ). This further supports the reduction of charge recombination in the device and thus the high efficiency observed for PSCs fabricated using stage A-ii SnO 2 (ref.  37  ). Lastly, the PSCs with stage B SnO 2 show the lowest PCE, probably owing to the formation of non-SnO 2-x phases, such as Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4 and SnO, which are not electron-transporting, along with overproduction of oxygen vacancies in the SnO 2 layer. The overall understanding of the chemistry during the synthesis of SnO 2 via chemical bath deposition is illustrated in Fig.  2e  (see Methods for a detailed discussion). 
 Effect of the MAPbBr 3 additive In addition to engineering the physical and electrical properties of the ETL, further improvements in PSC performance can be achieved by improving the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite active layer. An ideal active layer should present a high absorption profile to maximize carrier generation with long carrier lifetimes and mobilities for efficient carrier collection. This requires developing strategies to improve crystal grain size and carrier lifetime, while preventing the formation of detrimental traps at the bulk and interfaces. Notably, improving the efficiency of PSCs requires the decoupling of the passivation strategies for the bulk and the interface because the type and concentration of defects affect them differently. In the second part of our holistic approach, we show that only a trace amount of methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr 3 ) (<1 mol%) is needed to stabilize the perovskite active layer, with the benefit of improved optoelectronic properties. Figure  3  shows the characterization of perovskite thin films passivated with a two-dimensional perovskite, with the bulk perovskite fabricated with the addition of various amounts of MAPbBr 3 . An increase in grain size with decreasing amounts of MAPbBr 3 is clear in the SEM images of Fig.  3a . The correlation suggests that MAPbBr 3 arrests perovskite grain growth, probably owing to the slow diffusion of the large bromide anion  38  in a perovskite thin film fabricated with methylammonium chloride (MACl) additives, where MACl has been reported to promote perovskite crystal grain growth. In addition to changes in grain size and morphology, the absorption onset and the photoluminescence peak redshifts are consistent with decreased incorporation of MAPbBr 3 into the perovskite crystal as lower amounts of MAPbBr 3 are added (Fig.  3b ). Notably, X-ray diffraction  
 Article analysis shows successful passivation of the perovskite active layer from the detrimental formamidinium lead iodide (δ-FAPbI 3 ) phase with a MAPbBr 3 concentration as low as 0.8 mol% (Fig.  3c )  39, 40  . Such a low concentration is in contrast to the commonly used range of 7-20 mol%, which was established through processes that passivate both the bulk and the interface in one step. We believe stabilization of the intermediate phase, before thermal annealing, is responsible for successful stabilization of α-FAPbI 3 even at such a low MAPbBr 3 concentration (Supplementary Figs. 15, 16). The two-dimensional perovskite passivation we used is thus shown to be effective in stabilizing the interface, which is prone to the formation of defects and the unfavourable δ-phase  8, 41  . Carrier lifetimes can be determined through fitting the time-resolved photoluminescence decays to a mono-exponential function (Fig.  3d ). Films with MAPbBr 3 added below 2.5 mol% show substantially longer carrier lifetimes than the 10 mol% sample, with the longest carrier lifetime observed in the 0.8 mol% sample (>3.6 μs). Carrier lifetimes in the microsecond range suggest that there are few non-radiative pathways and such long carrier lifetimes can lead to high V OC . We attribute the long carrier lifetimes to a combination of increased perovskite crystal grain size and successful passivation using the two-dimensional perovskite. Detrimental halide segregation, which is suspected to form carrier trap sites, is likely to be reduced at low MAPbBr 3 concentrations and this may also contribute to the increased carrier lifetimes  8, 42  . Carrier dynamics can be obtained using optical pump-terahertz probe spectroscopy, measuring transient photoconductivity (-ΔT/T) at different carrier densities (Fig.  3e  and Supplementary Fig.  17 ). With an increase in fluence, and thus an increase in carrier density, the -ΔT/T increases and the decay trace develops a fast component corresponding to increasing higher-order recombinations. An effective mobility can be calculated from the recombination dynamics measured by optical pump-terahertz probe measurements  43  . Figure  3e  plots effective mobilities as a function of the mole per cent added MAPbBr 3 . Interestingly, the effective mobility increases from 0 mol% to 2.5 mol% (26.8 cm 2 V -1 s -1 to 31.2 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ), before dropping down to 25.9 cm 2 V -1 s -1 for 10 mol%. Indeed, as we have observed for grain sizes (Fig.  3a ) and carrier lifetimes (Fig.  3d ), this low-concentration region can yield large changes in morphologies and carrier dynamics, which correlate with effective mobility. It is also possible that the perovskite crystal orientation, which is known to influence effective mobilities  44  , and homogenization of halides may also be affected at low concentrations of added MAPbBr 3 . Thus, through separately passivating the bulk (with extremely low amounts of MAPbBr 3 ) and the interface (with two-dimensional perovskite passivation 8 ), highly efficient PSCs can be fabricated by substantially reducing the MAPbBr 3 concentration, with the added benefit of reducing the bandgap penalty. 
 Solar cell and electroluminescence performance PSCs were fabricated by combining our newly developed SnO 2 ETL and the improved perovskite layer described above. These PSCs show an average PCE of 24.7%, with some devices exceeding a PCE of 25%, when measured in-house (blue data points, Fig.  4a ). The best performing devices were sent to the solar cell device testing facility in Newport, USA, for certification with the test results shown as the red data points in Fig.  4a . The best-performing device achieved a certified PCE of 25.2% from a quasi-steady-state measurement, with PCEs determined from the current-voltage (J-V) sweep to be 25.3% and 25.4% for the reverse and forward sweep, respectively (Fig.  4b  and Supplementary Figs. 18-21)   45  . In addition, the certified device showed almost no change in PCE during up to 3,600 h of storage (Supplementary Fig.  22 ). Additionally, the encapsulated device retained about 80% of its initial PCE after 500 h under continuous light illumination at maximum power point (100 mW cm -2 , AM1.5G, 45 °C), without an ultraviolet cut filter (Supplementary Fig.  23 ). We also fabricated PSCs with larger areas; our best-performing large-area cell (0.984 cm 2 ) exhibits PCEs up to 23.0% with a high V OC value of 1,196 mV (Fig.  4c ). The bandgap of this record cell, E g = 1.56 eV, was determined from the inflection point of the EQE curve (Supplementary Fig.  24 )  11  . This bandgap corresponds to a thermodynamic PCE upper limit of 31.3%. At 25.2% PCE, our best-performing certified cell is thus at 80.5% of the theoretical efficiency limit, which is comparable to the best Si solar cells, which are at 80.9% of the theoretical limit  46  . We attribute the high PCEs of our cells to major improvements in the V OC and the fill factor. The radiative V OC limit V OC rad is calculated to be 1.270 V and the V OC measured without an aperture mask reaches 1.225 V (Supplementary Fig.  25 )  6, 11, 47  , resulting in a ratio of V OC to the radiative V OC limit of up to 96.5%, which is the highest reported thus far for a PSC, and is within striking distance of that for GaAs (97.7%). Such a low V OC deficit suggests that almost all non-radiative recombination pathways have been efficiently eliminated and that these PSCs should be highly luminescent when operated as a light-emitting diode, as we find below. Figure  4d  shows a plot of the electroluminescence EQE and energy conversion efficiency (ECE) values versus voltage of a PSC measured under forward bias (the current-luminance-voltage curve is provided in Supplementary Fig.  26 ). We observe an electroluminescence EQE of up to 17.2%, which approaches the efficiency of the best-performing perovskite light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which are engineered specifically for efficient light emission  [48] [49] [50]  . In addition, due to early sub-bandgap turn-on, probably from thermal carriers, our PSCs exhibit a peak electroluminescence ECE of up to 21.6%. In addition to extremely low V OC loss and high luminescence efficiency, our devices exhibit a high fill factor of up to 84.8%. Such a high fill factor is a result of improved carrier mobility in the perovskite active layer and better charge collection with the SnO 2 ETL developed here with minimum parasitic losses from shunt and series resistances. For a further improvement in fill factor, future research should be focused on minimizing trap-assisted recombination, aiming to approach the theoretical fill factor limit of about 90%.

Device fabrication. The methods of cleaning ITO glass, methylammonium iodide (MAI) synthesis, preparing PTAA: F4-TCNQ solution can be found elsewhere.  [1, 2]  The spin coating process was conducted in glovebox with oxygen level lower than 100 particle per million (PPM). The PTAA was doped by 1 wt% F4-TCNQ. The spun PTAA : F4-TCNQ films were thermally annealed at 100 °C for 20 min. The perovskite films were made by interdiffusion method, where lead iodide (PbI 2 ) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) solutions were sequentially spun onto the substrates, followed by a thermal annealing driven diffusion process.  [2]  The concentration of PbI 2 and MAI was 650 mg/ml and 65 mg/ml, respectively. The spun films were annealed at 100 °C for 70 min on hotplate under the cover of a glass petri dish. 10 µL-30 µL DMF solvent was added at the edge of the petri dish during annealing process.  [3]  After annealing, insulating materials were deposited on top of perovskite by different methods. PS or the PS plastic foam were dissolved in dichlorobenzene (DCB) with concentrations from 0.02 % (0.2 mg/mL) to 2.0 % (20 mg/mL) and spin coated on top of perovskite at a speed of 6000 RPM. The films were annealed at 100 °C for 70 min; PVDF-TrFE was added into DCB : tetrahydrofuran (THF) mixture solvent (volume ratio from 10:1 to 5:1) and the solution was stirred and heated at 100 o C overnight. Then the saturated solution was filtered to remove the undissolved PVDF-TrFE. The saturated solution was spin coated on top of perovskite films at 6000 RPM and annealed at 100 °C for 70 min; Teflon was thermally evaporated with a deposition rate of 0.1 Å/s. Teflon thickness for the best devices was 2-5 nm. Fluoro silanes was purchased from Sigma Aldrich and spun coated on perovskite films with spin speed of 6000 RPM. For control device fabrication, PCBM was dissolved in DCB with a concentration of 2.0 %. The solution was spin coated on perovskite films with a spin speed of 6000 RMP. Then the films were annealed at 100 o C for 70 min. After the deposition of insulating or PCBM layers, 20 nm thickness of C 60 was thermally evaporated with a deposition rate of 0.5 Å/s. The devices were finished by the evaporation of 7 nm 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) and 100 nm aluminum electrode. The devices area was defined as the overlap of ITO and Al electrode. Slight variation of the device area was observed in devices from different batches. Optical microscopy was used to measure the active area accurately. Typical dimension of the device area was 2.0 mm × 5.0 mm. Si diode (Hamamatsu S1133) was used to calibrate the light intensity before photocurrent measurement. Keithley 2400 Source-Meter was used for recording the I-V measurement. Unless stated otherwise, the scanning direction for I-V measurement was from negative bias to positive bias. The voltage scanning rate was 0.1 V s -1 . The steady-state J SC was measured by recording device photo current under 0.94 V bias. Then steady-state PCE was obtained by multiplying the measured current with 0.94 V bias voltage. The EQE measurement was conducted in air without device encapsulation. 
 Photocurrent TPV measurement. TPV measurement has been a well-established method to measure the device carrier recombination lifetime.  [4]  In the measurement, the devices were stimulated by laser pulses (337 nm) to generate a small transient photovoltaic signal. A large resistance of 1 M Ohm was connected in serial with the devices so that the photo generated carriers could be effectively c-AFM and TEM measurements. The c-AFM studies were carried using a commercial AFM system (MFP-3D, Asylum Research, USA) equipped with conductive probes (PPP-EFM, Nanosensors). The photocurrent mapping was measured under 0 V bias and the dark current mapping was measured with a bias of 0.5 V. High resolution TEM analyses were carried out on a FEI OSIRIS microscope. The cross-sectional samples were prepared by using focused-ion-beam equipment (FEI Helios 660). Water stability analysis. The water stability test was performed in air under room temperature. Purified water was used to prevent current leakage. The samples without further encapsulation was immersed in water and the photovoltaic output was recorded by a multimeter.    of the perovskite fi lms by superhydrophobic insulating layers, which dramatically enhances resistance of perovskite solar cells to water-caused damage without further encapsulation. The tunneling junctions applied in silicon solar cells, which resulted in the most effi cient silicon solar panels in the world, are comprised of an insulating oxide or a thin-layer of amorphous silicon (HIT structure) inserted between the intrinsic silicon and the heavily-doped silicon layer or indium-tin-oxide (ITO) layer. The tunneling junctions have been shown to suppress the charge recombination at contacts and passivate the surface to increase device effi ciency.  [ 8 ]  The inserted insulating layer can selectively conduct one type of charges while block the other type, which spatially separates photogenerated electrons and holes to reduce their recombination, because the charge selection electrodes or charge transport layers have energymatching electronic states for one type of charges to tunnel into but not for the other type.  [ 9 ]  The oxide or amorphous silicon layers are generally deposited by relatively high temperature vacuum process, which is however not compatible for perovskite solar cells. Encouragingly, we found that the low temperature solution-coated polymeric insulating layers could play the same function, which potentially makes it low-cost and simple to be applied. Figure  1  a shows the structure of the devices in this study where the tunneling junction locates at the cathode side. An insulating polymer is inserted between the perovskite and the electron collecting fullerene (C 60 ) layers, and the proposed energy diagram in Figure  1  b is also shown to illustrate the function of insulating layer in transporting electrons and blocking holes in the perovskite layer. Photogenerated electrons at conduction band minimal (CBM) of the perovskite layer can tunnel to the excited electronic states in C 60 , followed by their relaxation to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of C 60 , because there are energy-matching unoccupied states in C 60 for electrons to tunneling into. On the contrary, these are no energy-matching states in C 60 which could allow the holes to tunnel into. Therefore, the tunneling rate of holes from perovskite to C 60 will be very low. The thin insulating layer thus allows the transport of photogenerated electrons in perovskite to C 60 layer by tunneling, and also blocks the photogenerated holes back into the perovskite layer. Therefore, the insulating tunneling layer causes a spatial separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes, which reduces their recombination at the contact of the perovskite and electron transport layers. The perovskite fi lms in this study were made by the interdiffusion method.  [ 10 ]  Poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) was chosen as the hole transporting layer because of the much larger perovskite grain size formed on the non-wetting surface of PTAA.  [ 5 ]  The PTAA fi lm was doped by 1.0 wt% 2,3,5,6-Tetrafl uoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) to increase its conductivity, Organolead trihalide perovskite (OTP) materials have drawn tremendous attention in the past years because of their great promise to fabricate next generation of low-cost and highly efficient solar cells.  [ 1, 2 ]  The power conversion effi ciency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has rocketed in the last few years, which has been ascribed to the excellent optoelectronic properties and unique defects physics that originates the low carrier recombination in perovskite polycrystalline thin fi lms.  [ 3 ]  Charge recombination in the grain interior can be negligible due to the absence of deep traps in OTP grains which also enables a carrier diffusion length signifi cantly longer than the optical attenuation length in their single crystals.  [ 2, 4 ]  Even in polycrystalline perovskite thin fi lms, the carrier diffusion lengths can still be much longer than the light penetration length, thanks to the enlarging grains and improving crystallinity of the perovskite fi lms with recent rapid improvement in material morphology controlling.  [ 5, 6 ]  The enlargement of grains also signifi cantly reduces carrier recombination at perovskite grain boundaries (GBs), which is facilitated by the advance of passivation techniques to further reduce recombination at GBs and fi lm surface.  [ 7 ]  Now that the photogenerated carriers can fl ow through perovskite fi lms with negligible charge recombination, minimizing the charge recombination at the contacts becomes increasingly important to achieve highly effi cient perovskite solar cells. Inspired by the success of applying tunneling contacts in silicon solar cells, in this paper, we report an insulating tunneling layer inserted between the perovskite and the electron collection layer in perovskite solar cells can reduce charge recombination. Many insulating polymers, including commercial plastic foam which is broadly used for packaging, can form a tunneling contact at the cathode side. The tunneling contact allows the transport of electrons from perovskite to cathode, while block holes into the perovskite layer. Devices with these insulating materials exhibited an increased PCE of 20.3% under 1 sun illumination. This simple nonlattice-matching structure enables the capping COMMUNICATION which was found important in increasing perovskite device fi ll factor.  [ 11 ]  Three insulating polymers, polystyrene (PS), Tefl on, and polyvinylidene-trifl uoroethylene copolymer (PVDF-TrFE), were randomly chosen for the tunneling materials in this study. The molecular structures are shown in Figure  S1  of the Supporting Information. The details of device fabrication can be found in the Experimental Section. The insulating polymers spun on the perovskite fi lms could form a conformal tunneling layer, as verifi ed by the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) cross-section image of the devices. As shown in Figure  1 c , the spun PS layer with a thickness of 1-2 nm conformably covers the perovskite layer. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of a perovskite fi lm before and after depositing PS insulating layer were shown in Figure  S2  of the Supporting Information, which reveals a good coverage of the perovskite fi lm by PS at micrometer scale. Figure  2  a shows the photocurrent curves of perovskite devices with different insulating polymers inserted and that of the control device with 20 nm [ 6 ] -phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) to replace the insulating polymer layer. The control device has a short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 21.1 mA cm  -2  , an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.07 V, a fi ll factor (FF) of 74.9%, and a PCE of 16.9%, which represent a typical performance of PCBM passivated perovskite devices.  [ 11 ]  In a striking contrast, the devices with polymer tunneling contacts exhibited an increased J SC and FF. The devices with PS, PVDF-TrFE, and Tefl on tunneling layer showed higher J SC of 22.9, 22.9, and 22.8 mA cm -2 , respectively. Meanwhile, the FFs for devices with inserted PS, PVDF-TrFE, and Tefl on tunneling contacts were also increased to 79.6%, 77.6%, and 75.6%, respectively. The performances of perovskite devices with different tunneling layers were also summarized in Table  1  . It should be mentioned that the V OC of the perovskite devices with tunneling contacts fabricated from different batches slightly varied between 1.05 and 1.11 V. Statistic V OC distributions of 50 samples in Figure  S3  of the Supporting Information show that the devices with tunneling contacts have a higher average V OC of 1.07 V, compared with 1.05 V of the control devices. The statistics of PCE in Figure  2  b , J SC , FF distributions in Figure  S3  of the Supporting Information demonstrate the reliability and the repeatability of the performance enhancement by the tunneling contacts. The universal performance enhancement by different insulating polymers and no change of trap density measured by thermal admittance spectroscopy belittle the possibility of chemical bonding formation between perovskite and the insulating polymers, because chemical reaction should be sensitive to the chemical structure of the polymers. It indicates the polymer only physically contact to the perovskite and act as tunneling layer. It was interesting that the PS plastic foam, which is broadly used for packaging, worked as well to get a PCE more than 19.0%. A picture of the PS plastic foam used in this study is shown in Figure  1 c . The perovskite device with PS from dissolved foam as the tunneling layer exhibited a J SC of 22.9 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.07 V, a FF of 80.3%, and a PCE of 19.6%. The device performance is even slightly higher than those of the devices with other three polymers with higher purity. The release of constraint of high material purity for highly effi cient perovskite devices might make perovskite solar cells even more competitive in the future market. Since the tunneling probability strongly depends on tunneling-layer thickness, the thickness of the tunneling layer should signifi cantly infl uence the electron extraction effi ciency and thus device effi ciency.  [ 12 ]  Figure  2 c  shows the photocurrent curves of perovskite devices with PS layers of different thicknesses which were tuned by varying the concentration of PS solution in the spin-coating process. As shown in Figure  2 c , for PS solution with a concentration of 0.02%, the device showed a J SC of 20.8 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.05 V, a FF of 75.1% and a PCE of 16.4%, which is comparable to that of the PCBM-passivated devices. This can be explained by the fact that the PS layer formed from the solution with such low PS concentration is barely continuous, and thus the device resembles the control device without PS layer. When the PS concentration was increased to 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1.0%, the photocurrents were signifi cantly increased to 22.0, 22.8, and 22.9 mA cm -2 , respectively. The best devices were made by 1.0% PS solution, exhibiting a V OC of 1.10 V, a J SC of 22.9 mA cm -2 , a FF of 80.6%, and a PCE of 20.3% from the photocurrent scanning. For these devices, the PS layer thickness was estimated to be 1-2 nm from the high resolution TEM shown in Figure  1 c . Further increasing PS layer thickness severely reduced the J SC , V OC , and FF to 20.0 mA cm -2 , 1.03 V, and 49.0%, respectively, because the increased tunneling layer thickness reduced electron tunneling rate. Figure  2 d  show the average external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of devices with PS and PCBM as the contact layer.   b ) the energy diagram that illustrates the principle of suppressing surface charge recombination by the insulating layer.

 COMMUNICATION PCE measured at the maximum power output point (0.94 V) of the most effi cient device. The steady photocurrent, stabilized PCE measured at the maximum power point agrees well with that measured from J -V scanning, excluding the existence of photocurrent hysteresis in our devices and confi rming the accuracy of our device effi ciency characterization. The absence of photocurrent hysteresis of these devices is also confi rmed by changing the photocurrent scanning directions (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information). We recently demonstrated that ion migration at grain boundaries plays a dominant role in causing the photocurrent hysteresis.  [ 13 ]  Any material which can block the ion migration channel at grain boundaries is expected to eliminate the photocurrent hysteresis. The insulating polymer may serve as a water-resistant layer to protect the perovskite fi lm from water damage. The speculation stemmed from the observation that the perovskite devices with insulating polymers generally showed a better stability in air (Figure  2  f), while the control devices without insulating polymers always degraded to yellow color in several days.  [ 14 ]  To confi rm it, we chose a hydrophobic insulating fl uoro-silane, Trichloro (3,3,3-trifl uoropropyl)silane, as a tunneling layer to make water-resistant devices. The fl uoro groups make the material to be extremely hydrophobic.  [ 15 ]  In addition, it has been reported fl uoro-silane could undergoes a crosslinking process with the aid of tiny amount of moisture.  [ 15, 16 ]  Figure  3  a illustrates the cross-linking process of this material.

 COMMUNICATION When fl uoro-silane was deposited on top of the perovskite fi lms, tiny amount of H 2 O that exists in the perovskite fi lms will trigger the hydroxylation of silanes to form silanols. Then the silanols will automatically undergoes a cross-linking process by forming Si-O-Si (siloxane) bonds, which makes this insulating layer robust to protect the underneath perovskite fi lms from water attacking. The devices with the fl uoro-silane layer also showed a good effi ciency of 18.9% (Figure  2  a), which is comparable to the performance of devices with other types of tunneling contacts. Encouragingly, the hydrophobic polymer protected devices showed much better resistance to water damage. As shown by the photos in Figure  3  b,c, the perovskite device with fl uoro-silane layer without further encapsulation showed negligible color change after it was soaked in water for 3 min, while the control device with 20 nm PCBM changed to yellow color after it was immersed in water for less than 5 s. The operation of the unencapsulated device in water was also demonstrated in Figure  3 d , showing a V OC of 1.09 V which is slightly higher than that of the device measured under one sun condition (Figure  2 a ). The slight variation in V OC might be caused by the optical effect of the water or glass beaker which slightly change the light illumination intensity to increase device V OC . The stable operation of the perovskite devices in water indicates the very good conformal coating of the nanometer thick insulting layer onto perovskite layers. Improving the moisture stability of perovskite solar cells has drawn great research attention recently.  [ 17 ]  The demonstration of stable device operation in water represents a major progress in stabilizing the perovskite solar cells in addition to the improved stability in air or moisture, though atomic conformal coverage of the perovskite by the polymer without any pin-holes is still challenging to achieve over very large device area with spin-coating. The performance enhancement in our devices is primarily ascribed to the function of tunneling layer in extracting electrons and blocking holes. To demonstrate that, conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) measurement was conducted to characterize the local dark-current and photocurrent of perovskite samples with or without PS tunneling layer at nanoscopic level. The samples for dark-current measurements have the structure of ITO/PTAA: F4-TCNQ/perovskite/with or without PS. Since both PTAA and the Pt-coated AFM conductive tip have a high work function as well, the measured current is essentially a hole current. As shown in Figure  4  a,b, the local dark current reduced after coating the PS layer, proving the function of PS in blocking holes. The uniform reduction of hole current across the whole mapping area indicates a conformal coating of PS on the perovskite fi lm. The samples for photocurrent measurement had the structure of ITO/ PTAA:F4-TCNQ/perovskite/with or without PS/C 60 . In the  measurement, the c-AFM tips contacted C 60 surface to map the photocurrent of samples illuminated by a white light source with an intensity of 20 mW cm -2 . Since there is an electronaccepting layer, electrons can be collected by C 60 and conduct to the tip. Figure  4 c, d  shows the photocurrent mapping results of the perovskite samples without or with the PS tunneling layer, respectively. The samples without PS tunneling layer showed a photocurrent ranging from 0 to 0.8 pA with a very good reproducibility. After inserting a PS contact, the local photocurrent through most grains increased to >4 pA, directly proving the function of PS tunneling layer in enhancing the photocurrent output. The function of the tunneling layer is also confi rmed at macroscopic level using the single-carrier devices with or without PS tunneling layer. The electron only devices have the structure of ITO/C 60 /perovskite/with or without PS/C 60 /Al, and the hole only devices have the structure of ITO/with or without PS/perovskite/Au, which are shown in the insets of Figure  4  e,f. The tunneling layer spatially separates photogenerated electrons and holes at the perovskite/polymer interface by transporting electrons and blocking holes, which should lead to the reduction of the carrier surface recombination. To verify it, we compared the carrier recombination lifetimes of devices with or without PS contact by transient photovoltage spectroscopy (TPV). As shown in the Figure  4  g, carrier recombination lifetime is longer in the device with PS tunneling contact, compared with the control device (PCBM passivated) at all the light intensity range. The carrier lifetime of the control device under one sun illumination is 0.5 μs which corresponds to the typical TPV lifetime of the PCBM passivated devices.  [ 18 ]  The device with PS contact have a much longer carrier lifetime of 1.6 μs under one sun illumination, demon- strating the suppressed carrier recombination in devices with the tunneling contacts. The increased carrier lifetime extends the carrier diffusion length to increase device J SC and FF. Meanwhile, the suppressed carrier recombination is also benefi cial to the increase of V OC as observed in the devices with tunneling contacts. In conclusion, we demonstrated that inserting a tunneling layer between perovskite and electron transport layer could signifi cantly increase device performance by suppressing carrier recombination at the cathode contact. The tunneling layer can also serve as an encapsulation layer to prevent perovskite fi lm from damage caused by water or moisture. This method is simple because it does not need lattice matching between the buffer layer and perovskite. The low temperature solution process makes it compatible with many types of perovskite materials, and may be applied for anode contact as well. The freedom to choose any insulating layer for contact enables more device designs and manufacturing.  Photocurrent-voltage curve and EQE measurements. The photocurrent-voltage curves of the

The 2D Halide Perovskite Rulebook: How the Spacer Influences Everything from the Structure to Optoelectronic Device Efficiency
Two-dimensional (2D)  halide perovskites have emerged as outstanding semiconducting materials thanks to their superior stability and structural diversity. However, the ever-growing field of optoelectronic device research using 2D perovskites requires systematic understanding of the effects of the spacer on the structure, properties, and device performance. So far, many studies are based on trial-and-error tests of random spacers with limited ability to predict the resulting structure of these synthetic experiments, hindering the discovery of novel 2D materials to be incorporated into high-performance devices. In this review, we provide guidelines on successfully choosing spacers and incorporating them into crystalline materials and optoelectronic devices. We first provide a summary of various synthetic methods to act as a tutorial for groups interested in pursuing synthesis of novel 2D perovskites. Second, we provide our insights on what kind of spacer cations can stabilize 2D perovskites followed by an extensive review of the spacer cations, which have been shown to stabilize 2D perovskites with an emphasis on the effects of the spacer on the structure and optical properties. Next, we provide a similar explanation for the methods used to fabricate films and their desired properties. Like the synthesis section, we will then focus on various spacers that have been used in devices and how they influence the film structure and device performance. With a comprehensive understanding of these effects, a rational selection of novel spacers can be made, accelerating this already exciting field.
INTRODUCTION Halide perovskites are rock-star semiconducting materials which have emerged in the past decade because of their extraordinary physical properties such as high mobility, long carrier lifetime and low trap density despite the presence of excessive impurities, structural defects, disorders and compositional variations.  1, 2  They have outperformed many rival materials from other classes of compounds in a wide variety of optoelectronic applications such as solar cells,  3, 4  light emitting diodes (LEDs),  5, 6  field effect transistors (FETs),  7, 8  lasers,  9, 10  and detectors (e.g., photodetectors, X-ray and γ-ray detectors).  [11] [12] [13]  The most extensively studied perovskites are three-dimensional (3D) halide perovskites with the general formula AMX 3 [A = Cs + , CH 3 NH 3 + (MA), or HC-(NH 2 ) 2 + (FA); M = Ge 2+ , Sn 2+ , Pb  2+  ; X= Cl -, Br -, I -]. The 3D structure with six-coordinated octahedra connected by corner-sharing creates a favorable electronic band structure with broad conduction and valence bands that facilitates the charge transport.  14  Larger organic cations cannot incorporate into the 3D structure, so lower-dimensional structures form instead. A common structure type is that of two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites, which can be imagined as ""cleaving"" the 3D structure along a crystallographic plane to form sheets, adding halide ions to satisfy the surface metal coordination sites and with the large cations inserted between the inorganic layers as spacers. The cleaving can be along the ⟨100⟩-, ⟨110⟩-, and ⟨111⟩-planes of the 3D structure, giving rise to ⟨100⟩-, ⟨110⟩-, and ⟨111⟩-oriented 2D perovskites. These sheets stack to form the bulk crystalline materials.  15  This type of dimensional reduction, where the covalently bonded 3D metal-anion (M-X) framework is terminated by chargebalancing counterions in one or more directions, is common in solid-state chemistry (Figure  1a ),  16, 17  This is different from the morphological dimensional reduction, where the framework itself stays the same but the crystallite size changes to the point where the system exhibits size-dependent properties at the nanoscale. For example, morphological changes for CsPbBr 3 result in 3D nanocubes, 2D nanoplates and 1D nanowires, but all these are still 3D materials in the solid-state definition since they all have the same framework (Figure  1b ). The 2D perovskites exhibit excellent structural diversity, and their properties can be tuned by the layer thickness, the cage cation and the spacer cation.  18, 19  They can be seen as naturally formed quantum wells; as the layer becomes thinner, the bandgap increases in defined steps since the structure becomes more quantum confined perpendicular to the stacking direction. The cage A-site cation can affect not only the metal-halide-metal (M-X-M) bond angles, like in 3D perovskites, but also the metal-halide (M-X) bond length, both of which can modulate the overlap of the metal and halide orbitals, thus altering the bandgap in a smaller degree than the layer-number.  20, 21  The properties of the 2D perovskites can also be tuned by the spacer cations: (1)  They can affect the distortion of each octahedron (deviation from the perfect octahedron) as well as tilting of the M-X-M bond angles. (2) The exciton binding energy (E b ) of the 2D perovskite (quantum well) structures can be tuned by the dielectric constant of the spacer cation (barrier),  15  higher dielectric constant of the spacer can lead to less dielectric mismatch between the organic and inorganic layer, thus reducing the E b . (3) The stability of the materials can be improved as well by controlling the hydrophobic cation as a ""raincoat"" layer.  22  When fabricating films and optoelectronic devices from 2D perovskites, even more factors must be considered. (i) Film morphology, (ii) crystallinity, and (ii) the orientation of the layers regarding the substrate are also influenced by the composition. Furthermore, the actual film composition is complex, containing other 2D perovskite phases with different layer thickness than the one targeted.  23  The distribution of layer-number is influenced by the spacing cation and by the film deposition method. Understanding how the structures may affect properties is essential for applying these materials in optoelectronic devices. However, so far most research on 2D perovskites is based on trial-and-error tests by picking the spacers at random to incorporate into devices. There is no commonly understood correlation between the chosen spacer Chemical Reviews pubs.acs.org/CR Review and the resulting structure or properties for the specific application. With the rapid growth of the field, different aspects of 2D halide perovskites have been reviewed such as the history and general introduction to the material family,  18, 19, 24  the electronic structures and consequences of quantum and dielectric confinement,  15, 25  the photophysical properties,  26, 27  and advances in optoelectronic devices such as solar cells.  28  So far, there have been a large number of spacer cations incorporated into 2D perovskites, but the structural design rules on how to choose the spacer cations are still ill-defined. In this review, we focus on the spacer cations that have been systematically studied for the group 14 (mainly Pb and Sn) halide perovskites, from single crystal synthesis to thin film fabrication to illuminate how they affect the properties and applications. We outline the many spacers that have been used in synthesis of crystals as well as in films and devices. We start with a guide to synthesize single crystals, to characterize the crystal structures and optical properties, all essential for the proper understanding of structure-property relationship and device performance. Then we discuss the structural design rules which determine if a given organic spacer will form a 2D perovskite or another nonperovskite phase from our experiences and lessons. We then provide a summary of different types of spacer cations that have been studied, categorized by charge (+1 vs +2) and functional group. Following that, we review the films made from these materials. Like the single crystal section, we begin with a guide to making films, starting with the different desired film properties and how to analyze them and following with the different methods to fabricate them. This is followed by a summary of the different structures incorporated into films and devices, categorized by the perovskite film architecture (2D vs mixed dimensionality vs heterostructures) with emphasis on how the resulting properties of the films relate to the spacer used. 
 OVERVIEW OF THE SYNTHETIC ASPECTS There are several synthetic approaches that have proven effective in the synthesis and crystallization of pure compounds of the 2D halide perovskites. These are classified based on the solvent and approach used and are described below. 2.1. Synthetic Methods 2.1.1. Solution Synthesis Using Hydrohalic Acid. Most of the 2D halide perovskites are prepared by solution synthesis in a hydrohalic acid.  [29] [30] [31] [32]  This method is particularly efficient for synthesizing the multilayered 2D perovskites.  [32] [33] [34]  The hydrohalic acid (HX = HI, HBr and HCl) functions as solvent as well as the halide source and thus must match the type of halide (X) in the desired perovskite. The metal source, spacer (or spacer salt), and A-site cation salt are dissolved under heating and stirring so that everything becomes ionized. After a clear solution is obtained, it can be cooled down to room temperature to get the desired crystal. Since there is a large excess amount of halide from HX in the solution, the perovskite with the same halide as the HX will be obtained no matter the anions in the metal source and cation salts. For example, to get lead iodide perovskites, one can use PbO, PbCl 2 , PbBr 2 , PbI 2 , Pb(NO) 2 , or Pb(CH 3 COO) 2 (as long as they are soluble in HI), and from our experience the choice of salt makes no difference. The layer-number can be controlled by the amount of the spacer cation added. However, using the ratio of starting materials based on the stoichiometry of the targeted composition does not necessarily lead to that composition in the crystals. The general principle is that compounds with a greater organic component (e.g., thinner layers with lower layer-number) are less soluble in HX and will crystallize more readily than more soluble (e.g., higher layernumber) compounds. The layer-number can by tuned by the ratio between the spacer and Pb sources, which is determined by the solubility of the n = 1 compound. If the spacer cation is very soluble in HX, for example, propylammonium (PA), a stoichiometric ratio may be needed to obtain the desired layernumber [PA:MA:Pb 2+ = 2:2:3 for (PA) 2 (MA) 2 Pb 3 I 10 )].  35  For less soluble spacer cations such as butylammonium (BA), if a stoichiometric ratio was added, lower layer-number phases would be obtained instead since they contain more organic part which is much less soluble in HX. Therefore, less than the stoichiometric ratio (70% or 50%) for the spacer should be added to obtain the desired layer-number [BA:MA:Pb 2+ = 1.4:1:2 for (BA) 2 (MA)Pb 2 I 7 ) and BA:MA:Pb 2+ = 1:2:3 for (BA) 2 (MA) 2 Pb 3 I 10 )].  32  For other spacer cations, this ratio needs to be optimized based on their solubility. Another note is that the solution needs to be close to saturation to get the desired layer-number. The solubility of MAPbI 3 is 0.6 M in boiling HI, so the concentration of Pb 2+ in solution should be close to 0.6 M because the compound whose solubility is close to the concentration of ions in solution will precipitate out first. If the solution is too diluted, the lower layer-number compounds would precipitate out since they are generally less soluble.  36  Sometimes, reducing agent such as hypophosphorous acid (H 3 PO 2 ) need to be added to the solution to stabilize the ions, especially during the synthesis of Sn 2+ perovskites. Since Sn 2+ can be easily oxidized to Sn 4+ , the addition of H 3 PO 2 is the key to the successful synthesis. Even during the synthesis of lead iodide perovskites, absence of H 3 PO 2 can cause the formation of I 3 -in air, which can lead to a dark brown solution and no precipitate formation. Even though H 3 PO 2 is added to many commercial sources of aqueous HI as stabilizer, external H 3 PO 2 is still necessary especially when the HI is nonstabilized. Usually 1/5 of the volume of HI is enough for H 3 PO 2 , and it is worth noting that hypophosphite may also form for some metals when large excess of H 3 PÒis used.  37  Sometimes for iodide perovskites, if the hot solution is cooled down directly to room temperature (RT), a light-yellow hydrate phase will be obtained instead of the desired perovskite phase. In these cases, the step-cooling method can be used to get the 2D phase.  [38] [39] [40]  After all the starting materials are dissolved under stirring and boiling, one can first lower the temperature of the solution to 125 °C, which is right below the boiling point of HI (127 °C), so that the solution is hot, and the light-yellow phase can remain soluble. At the same time, the solution is very concentrated, so the desired 2D phase can still precipitate out. Once the first few crystals start to precipitate out, they can serve as seeds for further crystal growth. Gradually lowering the temperature to RT would not result in precipitation of any second phase. There are also limitations of this method, for example, as mentioned above, sometimes light-yellow hydrate phases form during the precipitation. Even though some of these phases can be avoided by the step-cooling method, for those that are too insoluble in HX, other solvent should be used (see below). Besides, to grow high-quality, large crystals, it may take relatively long time. It is also worth noting that some spacer cations can react with HI, which will be discussed in detail in section 2.2.6. 2.1.2. Solution Synthesis Using Organic Solvents. The 2D halide perovskites can also be synthesized using organic solvent,  41, 42  such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and γ-butyrolactone (GBL),  43, 44  as well as mixtures of the solvents of above. These polar solvents can dissolve most organic and inorganic salts and may be suitable for the cations that are insoluble in HI (those with large organic cations, for example, Table  3c ). These solvents do not provide excess halide like HX; thus, salts with the same halide as the desired perovskites must be used, or an external halide source such as small amount of HX or NaX must be added. Usually a stoichiometric ratio of the starting materials is dissolved, but this cannot guarantee that the product is a single phase and has the same stoichiometry as the ingredients added; thus, it is necessary to identify the phase with powder or single-crystal X-ray diffraction (PXRD or SC-XRD). This is different from the deposition of thin film where all the ingredients must precipitate in some form on the film (see below), while during the solution synthesis of single crystal, some ions may remain soluble in the solution. For some of the 3D halide perovskites such as MAPbI 3 , their solubility in the organic solvent decreases with increasing temperature; thus, the crystal can precipitate out by the temperature-rising method.  43, 45  However, this method requires a systematic study of each compound's solubility with temperature, which may vary from spacer to spacer. Another way is to keep the solution temperature constant and let the solvent evaporate slowly, which can also result in a large single crystal.  46  Sometimes, additives such as H 3 PO 2 or formic acid are used to accelerate the crystallization, but additives should be picked carefully without introducing other component to the system.  47  However, so far, there is no systematic study on how to synthesize multilayer 2D perovskites using organic solvents. To achieve a single phase, the type of solvent (including ratio of mixed solvents), concentration, and additives need to be optimized and further studies are required. 2.1.3. Antisolvent (Vapor Diffusion) Method. Sometimes, the solubility reduction upon change in temperature or solvent evaporation is not significant enough for the crystal to precipitate. In these cases, slowly adding an antisolvent can accelerate the precipitation process.  [48] [49] [50] [51]  Like solution synthesis using an organic solvent, a stoichiometric ratio of starting materials is dissolved in a small vial with a ""good solvent"" (e.g., DMF and DMSO). Then the small vial (with the cap open) is put into another larger vial with a ""poor solvent,"" which acts as the antisolvent (e.g., ethyl ether and dichloromethane). As the ""poor solvent"" slowly diffuses into the ""good solvent"" in the small vial, the solubility of the perovskite phase decreases and crystals can precipitate out.  48  So far, this vapor diffusion method is also limited to the synthesis of n = 1 for 2D perovskites, especially for the cations with bulky organic parts that cannot be dissolved in HI (Table  3e -g, Figure  6a ).  [49] [50] [51]  Sometimes, the solvent has such a strong interaction with the starting materials that the solvate phase (metal-solvent complex) forms instead of the 2D perovskite phase. 2.1.4. Solvothermal Synthesis. Solvothermal method has been used to synthesize 3D and lower-dimensional structures.  [52] [53] [54] [55] [56]  The solvent can be either hydrohalic acid (HX) or organic solvent, or even a mixture of ""poor solvent"" (e.g., ethanol or acetonitrile) and HX. The solution is usually sealed in an autoclave or Pyrex tube. Interestingly, by changing the reaction conditions such as temperature or time, different morphologies of 3D perovskites can be obtained.  57  Sometimes, even different phases can be achieved when varying the conditions.  [54] [55] [56]  Recently, this method has been used to synthesize 2D perovskites  [58] [59] [60]  as well as nanocrystals.  61  However, there is no report of using it to synthesize multilayer bulk 2D perovskites. 2.1.5. Solid-State Grinding Method/Ball-Milling. To completely get rid of the effects of the solvent, the solid-state grinding method can be utilized. This is first done for the 3D halide perovskites, by grinding a stoichiometric ratio of the starting materials with a mortar and pestle, followed by annealing to get the desired phase.  62, 63  This method can also be used to synthesize the 2D perovskites,  39, 64  especially those that cannot be synthesized in solution (spacers too soluble or insoluble). Stoichiometric ratios of the starting materials are grinded until the metal source has been completely reacted. Examination of the as-grinded powder by PXRD should show no existence of the metal source, but the perovskite peaks have low intensity, suggesting poor crystallinity. Annealing of the powder results in a great improvement of the crystallinity. Ballmilling method can also achieve similar results without annealing.  65, 66  The advantage of this method is that it has no limitation of the spacer solubility as long as it can form 2D perovskites Thus, it is a good way to check whether a spacer can form a 2D perovskite (if the solution synthesis does not work). So far, 2D perovskites with more n > 3 have not been synthesized this way.  39, 64  Another note is that this method cannot yield highquality single crystals to resolve the structure by SCXRD, but it is possible to do Rietveld refinement on high-resolution PRXD to solve the structure. Generally, for the solution method, the product is determined by the solubility of the compound and the concentration of the solution. The species whose solubility limit is closest to the solution concentration precipitates out first. We do need to worry about second phases such as the solvate phase. Even though this problem can be overcome by the solid-state grinding method, this method does have its own limitations such as crystallinity. The organic or antisolvent methods work better for spacer cations with medium to poor solubility in HX. Therefore, all the methods can compensate each other to get the crystals we want. 
 Rules of Picking Spacer Cations for 2D Perovskites With the above synthetic methods of 2D perovskites in mind, we now discuss some factors that need to be considered when choosing a spacer cation to stabilize a 2D structure. Even though we cannot predict the structure of the product with 100% certainty, there are some general rules that can help choose a successful spacer. 2.2.1. Charge. To date, most of the 2D perovskites incorporate +1 and +2 cations, with the general formula of A′ 2 A n-1 M n X 3n+1 (A′ is +1) or A′A n-1 M n X 3n+1 (A′ is +2). Cations with +3 and +4 charges are unlikely to achieve charge balance in 2D perovskites. Therefore, they usually template low-dimensional structures instead. It is worth noting that when calculating the charge of a cation, one should count the number of nitrogen atoms (N) that can be protonated, instead of the total N number. For example, pyrrole cannot be protonated since lone pair of electrons on N are a part of the aromaticity. However, pyridine can be protonated because the N electrons are not involved in the aromaticity.  40  In imidazole, only one N can be protonated for the same reason.  67, 68  In other cases, the number of protonated N is determined by the reaction environment (pH) and pK a of the molecule. In these cases, researchers should carefully examine the protonation situation by infrared (IR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). 2.2.2. Shape. The shape of the spacer cation should be considered in two aspects, the amino head and the organic tail. The amino head must be the right size to fit in the inorganic pocket, this is why the primary ammonium cations are the most favorable for 2D perovskites, followed by secondary, then tertiary and quaternary ammonium cations (RNH 3 + > R 2 NH 2 + > R 3 NH + > R 4 N + ). If bulky groups are substituted on the N, the 2D structure may be destabilized.  69  The shape of the head amino group can influence the penetration depth (Figure  4b ), defined by the distance between the N atom of the amino group and the plane for terminal halides. When it is bulky (e.g., R 4 N + ), the head cannot penetrate into the inorganic pocket and the penetration depth is negative (above the plane), thus exhibiting weaker interaction with the inorganic layer and resulting in less tilted structure (discussed in detail below). The shape of the organic tail can be linear, branched or cyclic (both aliphatic and aromatic). Linear spacer cations are the most flexible, and usually they can form 2D perovskites.  [70] [71] [72]  For branched cations, the bulky tail increases the steric hindrance and may not form the interdigitating structure for these 1+ cations. If the spacer cation is cyclic, the ring has less freedom to move, especially for the aromatic ring, where all the atoms on the ring must stay on the same plane, further increasing the steric hindrance of the cation.  50, 73  2.2.3. Size. To form 2D perovskites, the spacer cannot be too big or too small. Billing et al. has reported the n = 1 structures for linear cations with up to 18 carbons.  [70] [71] [72]  The smallest monoammnonium spacer reported that can template a 2D n = 1 structure is methylhydrazinium, though it is not sure whether it can form multilayer structures. Ethylammonium can serve as spacer for bromide perovskite  59  as well as A-site cations inside the perovskite cage.  30, 74, 75  For linear diammonium cations, the shortest cation that can form ⟨100⟩-oriented 2D structure for iodide and bromide perovskites is 1,4butanediammonium.  39, 76, 77  For bromide compounds, the use of 1,3-propanediammonium forms 6 × 6 ⟨110⟩-oriented 2D perovskite and ethylenediammonium cation template 1D structure.  76  For chloride perovskite, 1,3-propanediammonium does form a 2D structure.  78  For cyclic spacers, Billing et al. has studied the monoammonium cations with different ring sizes from three to eight carbons and found that three-to six-member ring monoammonium cations can form 2D structures, while seven-and eight-member rings only form 1D structures.  79, 80  If the diameter of the ring is close to or larger than the width of the MX 6 octahedron (6.3 Å), it cannot fit into the 2D structure. For the same reason, C 60 derivatives cannot template 2D perovskite structure. Besides, if a cyclic spacer has too many rings, the tail may be too big to stabilize 2D perovskite structure. 2.2.4. Solubility. For solution synthesis, the solubility of the cation also needs to be considered to choose the right solvent. With HX as the solvent, generally bulkier spacers with more carbon atoms are less soluble. For aromatic spacers, the position of functional group (ortho, meta and para) can affect the solubility, for example, meta > ortho > para. To get single crystals, organic solvents may be a better choice for those less soluble cations. If a spacer cation is very soluble (e.g., propylammonium cation), using an organic solvent may not result in crystal precipitation, thus using HX is preferable. But for the solid-state grinding method, there is no limit for the solubility of the spacer since no solvent is involved. 2.2.5. Hydrogen Bonding. Hydrogen bonding plays a big role in stabilizing the 2D perovskites, for example, ⟨110⟩oriented 2D perovskites.  [81] [82] [83]  On the basis of the length of the carbon chain, different hydrogen bonds can form, resulting in different structures (⟨100⟩-vs ⟨110⟩-oriented 2D perovskites). Hydrogen bonding is also important when the cation has heteroatoms, and it may change the configuration of the cation and even displacement of the unit cell (see below in the heteroatom section).  84, 85  2.2.6. Spacer Cation Cannot React with the Solvent. Though seemingly obvious, this can also easily be forgotten. For example, primary amines can react with acetone to form imines. Therefore, acetone cannot be used as solvent for synthesis of halide perovskites. Many functional groups can react with HX, such as double bonds,  86  triple bonds,  87  -OH,  88  -Br, -Cl, and ether, especially under heating conditions. Thus, nonreactive solvents or milder conditions (low temperature)  82, 87  should be used when incorporating spacers with these functional groups. 
 STRUCTURAL CASE STUDIES USING DIFFERENT SPACER CATIONS The 2D perovskites can be categorized structurally into ⟨100⟩oriented, ⟨110⟩-oriented, and ⟨111⟩-oriented structures by the crystallographic planes of the 3D parent structure where the large spacer cations separate the octahedra. Among those, the ⟨100⟩-oriented 2D perovskites are most common and extensively studied. The ⟨100⟩-oriented 2D perovskites can be further divided into the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP)  32  phase, Dion-Jacobson (DJ)  89  phase and alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI) phase,  90  with general formulas of A′ 2 A n-1 M n X 3n+1 , A′A n-1 M n X 3n+1 and A′A n M n X 3n+1 , respectively (Figure  2 ). The RP phases incorporate +1 cations, which   
 Chemical Reviews usually interdigitate between the layers and enforce the inorganic layer to be staggered by half a unit cell (0.5, 0.5 displacement in the in-plane direction, not necessarily the a and b direction of the unit cell). The DJ phases feature compact +2 cations which generally leads to an eclipsed stacking with the inorganic layer exactly on top of each other (0, 0 displacement). For the ACI phases (0, 0.5 displacement), the inorganic layers are eclipsed looking from the a direction, but staggered from the b direction. The A site cation exists not only inside the cuboctahedral cage but also between the layers alternating with another cation. So far, only the guanidinium cation can template this type of structure. Though the structural templating effects of spacer cations have been reviewed previously,  19, 91, 92  hundreds of new structures have been reported since 2016. In this review, some of those structures will be revisited and new knowledge will be built up on those results based on recently reported structures. In the following part, we will discuss the structures of the most systematically studied main group 2D halide perovskites based on the spacer cations (the structural design rule of transition metal 2D halide perovskites may be slightly different and beyond the scope of this review). The spacer cations are categorized by charge, for example, monoammonium and diammonium cations. Under each category, examples of published structures will be discussed and compared to focus on the key factors of the spacers in influencing the structure of 2D halide perovskites. The following part can be seen as a series of case studies expanding upon the structural design rules on how to choose the spacer cation as discussed above. 3.1. Monoammonium Cations 3.1.1. Linear Cations. Linear carbon chain cations are one of the first spacer types explored in 2D perovskites.  [93] [94] [95]  These perovskites were mainly studied for their optoelectronic properties because of their naturally formed quantum well structure. In 1994, Mitzi et al.  96  reported the homologous series of (C 4 N 9 NH 3 ) 2 (MA) n-1 Sn n I 3n+1 (n = 1-5) and their electronic properties, setting the foundation of 2D halide perovskites as promising semiconductor materials. Subsequently, many n = 1 structures were reported by Mitzi et   (m = 4-18) where m represents the carbon-chain length (Table  1 ).  [70] [71] [72]  They also reported that for m = 3 (propylammonium), a nonperovskite 2D structure formed.  97  There seems to be little restriction on the maximum length of the carbon-chain that can form the 2D structure, though there is likely a limit where the cation can still be templated by the inorganic layer instead of being totally disordered like in the liquid phase. Most 2D perovskites exhibit a series of phase transitions upon temperature change.  [70] [71] [72] 98  The temperature of the phase transition increases with the chain length. From low to high temperature, the structure changes from a low symmetry phase to a high symmetry phase. Often the low-temperature phase transition is from the movement of the spacer cation, and the high-temperature phase transition usually involves increase of the Pb-I-Pb bond angles to closer to 180°, accompanied by a change to a darker color of the crystal, indicating a narrowing of the bandgap. When the M-X-M angle is closer to 180°, the Pb s-and I p-orbitals have better overlap, thus leading to a smaller bandgap, explaining the color change for the phase stabilized at high temperatures. Sometimes the phase transition is even accompanied by a change in the stacking of the inorganic layer, from staggered to eclipsed [unit cell displacement from (0.5, 0.5) to (0, 0)]. The thicker layered 2D perovskites have not been extensively explored until the recent demonstration of using them as absorbers for highly efficient solar cell devices, which will be discussed in the device part below.  99, 100  In 2016, Stoumpos et al. reported the single-crystal structures and properties of (C 4 N 9 NH 3 ) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 (n = 1-4).  32  Using the HI solution synthesis as discussed above, they obtained pure phase crystals of n = 1-4, as confirmed by PXRD. The structures solved and refined by SCXRD exhibit a unit cell displacement of (0.5, 0.5), resembling the oxide perovskite phases with staggered octahedra layers. Therefore, borrowing from the oxide perovskite nomenclature, they are classified as Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) type. Expanding this series to higher layer-number than n = 4 can be challenging. In 2017, the series was expanded to n = 5  33  and to n = 6 and 7  34  in 2019 (Figure  3a ), which is the highest layer-number resolved by SCXRD to date. Thermodynamic calorimetry measurements show that the enthalpy of formation (ΔH f ) for members above n = 5 is positive (Figure  3d ).  34  This value can change the Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔG) from negative to positive, suggesting that the formation of phase-pure n = 6 and 7 is thermodynamically unfavorable. For n > 7, the phases may even be thermodynamically unstable and, so far, attempts to synthesize them resulted in mixed phases, likely 3D MAPbI 3 and higher-n phases.  34  It is also possible that the 2D phases intergrow within a 3D matrix. Further exploration of the n > 7 phase is still ongoing, and these may be termed ""quasi-2D perovskites"". The optical properties of the homologous members of this series are shown in Figure  3b  and c . There are two slopes in the absorption spectra, a low-energy excitonic part and a highenergy continuum part. The bandgap is extracted by extrapolating the high-energy slope to the imaginary axis parallel to the x axis where the absorption edge is interrupted by the excitonic peak. The bandgaps decrease with increasing layer thickness, showing reduced quantum and dielectric confinement effects. The excitonic feature in the absorption spectra becomes less obvious for n = 5 and above. With greater layer thickness, the change in the bandgap is diminishingly smaller tending asymptotically to that of the n= ∞ member, that is, 3D MAPbI 3 , but there is still ∼0.15 eV difference between the bandgap of n = 7 and 3D MAPbI 3 . The theoretical band structure calculations show that all the compounds in this series are direct bandgap semiconductors, with a dispersive valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) in the layer directions and flat bands along the stacking direction, which is typical for 2D materials. Besides the extensively studied spacer butylammonium cation, other spacers such as propylammonium, pentylammonium, and hexylammonium cations have been demonstrated for the multilayer 2D structures (Table  1 ).  35, 36, 101  For propylammonium, even though crystals of the n = 1 2D structure could not form, as also seen by Billing et al.,  97  crystals for the 2D structure with n = 3 and 4 were successfully synthesized (Figure  3e ).  35  There is another homologous series with general formula of (C 3 H 7 NH 3 ) 2m+4 (MA) m-2 Pb 2m+1 I 7m+4 (m = 2, 3, 4). With a combination of corner-sharing and facesharing octahedra, they are called ""step-like"" structures and have a strong perovskites character, however, because of this they are not fully proper perovskites (Figure  3f ).  35  This suggests that when the cation is relatively small (e.g., propylammonium), the spacer itself may not be efficacious to template the 2D structure. When the A-site cation is involved to support the cage, the multilayer 2D structure can be stabilized. For the step-like structures, even though the connection is 2D, they exhibit a 1D electronic band structure because the charge transport through the face-sharing octahedra is almost forbidden.  35  This shows the importance of maintaining the corner-sharing structure for the excellent optoelectronic properties. For the longer carbon-chain pentylammonium and hexylammonium cations (Table  1d , 1e),  36, 101  they adopt similar 2D RP structures with lower symmetry space group at room temperature. This is because, as the carbon-chain length increases, the phase transition temperature from monoclinic to orthorhombic space group increases. The structure still does go to the orthorhombic space group at higher temperature.  36, 101  The bandgaps are not significantly influenced by the cation for a given layer thickness n, suggesting that the optical properties are mainly determined by n, as expected for the quantum well structure. But the bandgap does vary for the n = 1 structures, because of the larger difference in Pb-I-Pb angles across difference cations, as discussed previously,  18, 62, 102  showing that the spacer cation can also fine-tune the properties. The smallest monoammonium cation that can form the 2D n = 1 structure for iodide perovskites is methylhydrazinium (Table  1g ).  103  Although it has two N atoms, only the middle one is protonated in the synthetic conditions reported. Despite the small size, it can still form the iodide n = 1 2D structure because of the strong hydrogen bonding effect, and the octahedra are fairly undistorted with average Pb-I-Pb angles of 175.1°. The closest interlayer distance is 2.99 Å and it shows a reduced bandgap of 2.2 eV compared to other n = 1 perovskites. But it is not clear whether the spacer can form multilayered 2D perovskites or not. More interestingly, the same cation can also form 3D perovskite structures for bromide and chlorides, with methylhydrazinium as A-site cation.  104, 105  Even though the structures are distorted at room temperature, they both go through phase transitions to more proper perovskite phases at higher temperature. The bromide analogues were mainly explored for their ferroelectric properties, with (C 4 N 9 NH 3 ) 2 (A)Pb 2 Br 7 (A = Cs + , MA, and FA). All three compounds adopt the noncentrosymmetric Cmc2 1 space group at room temperature and exhibit a phase transition to the centrosymmetric space groups at high temperature, where the ferroelectric behavior disappears.  [106] [107] [108]  The shortest linear monoammonium cation that forms 2D bromide perovskite is ethylammonium, even though the same cation can also fit into the perovskite cage as A-site cation (discussed in section 3.3).  59  3.1.2. Cyclic Cations. Another type of aliphatic spacer is cyclic cations, which is a good model system to study the effect of ring size on the structure. Billing et al. reported a systematic study on different ring sizes from three to eight carbons, with the primary amino groups directly attached to the ring (Table  2 ).  79, 80  They found that for cyclic ammonium cations with three to six carbons, 2D perovskite phases can form. The structures with the smaller rings (three and four carbons) show more significant out-of-plane tilt and smaller Pb-X-Pb angles, since they are more distorted to accommodate the small spacer cations. For the cations with seven and eight-member rings, 1D structures form.  79, 80  This suggests there is a limit on the ring size that can template 2D perovskites. If the ring is too big, lower-dimensional structures will form to accommodate the spacer cation. More interestingly, for small ring members (three and four), the inorganic layers adopt the eclipsed stacking pattern, while for large ring members (five and six), the layers are staggered to better accommodate the bulky groups.  80  This suggests that the spacer cation can not only cause distortion of Pb-X-Pb bonds but also affect the stacking of the inorganic layers. 3.1.3. Aromatic Cations. Aromatic cations were one of the first spacers explored for multilayer 2D perovskites,  111  and they have been widely studied since then. The aromatic rings are believed to be beneficial for charge transport, however, if aromatics such as phenyl groups are involved, they tend be disordered in the crystal structure frustrating efforts to crystallographically refine the structures. Therefore, the bond lengths and bond angles are usually modeled with restraints   3b ), for example, it incorporates two sheets of organic spacers between the inorganic layers. Within each sheet, the aromatic rings are parallel because of π-π stacking, while between the sheets, the rings adopt a face-toedge (herringbone) configuration (Figure  4a ). Beyond ring size, Mitzi and co-workers systematically studied the influence of the number of rings fused together (benzene and naphthalene) and carbon-chain length (methyl and ethyl) attached to the ring on the perovskite structure (Table  3a d).  73  When comparing these structures to a variety of alreadyreported structures, they found that the penetration depth (Figure  4b ), defined by the distance between the N atom of the primary amino group and the plane for terminal halides, has a large influence on the Pb-X-Pb angles and thus the optical properties. The Pb-X-Pb bond angle decreases with increasing penetration depth in the range from -0.7 Å (above the plane) to 0.4 Å (below the plane) and then increases in the range from 0.4 to 0.9 Å (Figure  4c ). This is because the tilt of the PbX 6 octahedra (Pb-X-Pb bond angle) is mainly decided by the interaction (e.g., hydrogen bonding) between the cation and inorganic layer. When the amino group is way above the plane (negative penetration depth), it has very weak interaction with the halogen atoms, so the octahedra are not tilted (Pb-X-Pb bond angle close to 180°). When the penetration depth is positive, the amino group sinks into the octahedra pocket, and the distances between the N and halogen atoms (both terminal and bridging) decrease. Thus, the interaction between those atoms is stronger and the octahedra have larger tilts (Pb-X-Pb bond angle smaller than 180°). When the penetration depth is around 0.4 Å, the N atom has largest interaction with all the halogen atoms, so the Pb-X-Pb bond angle is smallest. As the penetration depth further increases, the distance increases again (especially for the terminal halogens) and so does the Pb-X-Pb bond angle. This shows the great influence of hydrogen bonding on the structure as mentioned above. Increasing the number of rings provides further tunability of the structure and property. Passarelli et al. used spacers with naphthalene, pyrene, or perylene as the aromatic component of the spacer bonded to an ethyl, propyl, or butyl linkers and synthesized the n = 1 2D compounds (Table 3e-g). When the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the O of the linker and the N pulls the amino head further away from the inorganic layer, the distance between primary N and I atoms is larger, resulting in weaker interaction with the inorganic layer and thus a smaller bandgap.  50   The complexity of the aromatic cations provides a tunability of the molecular orbitals of the spacer, which can match with the band structure of the inorganic layer to improve the charge transport. The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of the organic spacers get closer to the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of the inorganic layer, which may improve the charge transport between them (Figure  4d ). More interestingly, the out-ofplane conductivity increases with the number of the aromatic rings, suggesting better charge transport in the stacking direction (Figure  4e ). 3.1.4. Cations with Heteroatoms. Heteroatoms (O, F, Cl, Br, and I) in the spacers play important roles in templating the perovskite structures through hydrogen bonding and halogen-halogen interactions (Table  4 ), and their effects are mainly studied for the n = 1 structures, as those discussed below. After substituting the ethylammonium spacer with a hydroxyl group to form HO(CH 2 ) 2 NH 3 + (Table  4a ), the intermolecular hydrogen bonding NH 3 + •••OH stabilizes the cation in the cis conformation.  88, 118  The structure also features a short I•••I distance of 4.279(2) Å thanks to the compact conformation of the cation and the almost eclipsed octahedra stacking [(0.1, 0.1) unit cell displacement], both because of the hydrogen bonding.  118  The chlorine-and bromine-substituted cations, Cl(CH 2 ) 2 NH 3 + and Br(CH 2 ) 2 NH 3 + (Table  4b ,c), also experience hydrogen bonding between the amino group and the halogen atom, which results in the amino groups no longer in the pocket of the inorganic layer, giving a negative penetration depth (discussed above) of -0.39 Å and -0.44 Å for Cl and Br, respectively (Figure  5a ).  119  As a result, the hydrogen bonding between the amino group and the I atoms becomes negligible, leading to untilted octahedra (Pb-I-Pb bond angle close to 180°). This results in a better overlap of the Pb s-and I p-orbitals, thus giving smaller bandgaps than n = 1 structures with tilted octahedra. The iodine-substituted cation, I(CH 2 ) 2 NH 3 + (Table  4d ), shows a different structure. Because of the strong interaction between the iodine atom of the organic cation and the axial iodine atom of the octahedron, the C-N bond is perpendicular to the inorganic layer and the amino group penetrates into the octahedra pocket (penetration depth +0.44 Å). Thus, the amino group has strong interaction with iodine atoms of the octahedra, resulting in heavily tilted structure and larger bandgap than the Cl and Br-substituted ones.  119  More interestingly, the structures with Cl(CH 2 ) 2 NH 3 + and Br-(CH 2 ) 2 NH 3 + have (0.1, 0.5) unit cell displacement, while those with HO(CH 2 ) 2 NH 3 + and I(CH 2 ) 2 NH 3 + show (0.1, 0.1) displacement, showing that besides the (0, 0) and (0.5, 0.5) displacement, there are many possibilities in between, especially when heteroatoms and hydrogen bonding are involved. The fluorine-substituted one, F(CH 2 ) 2 NH 3 + (Table  4e ), exhibits similar structure as the Cl(CH 2 ) 2 NH 3 + and Br-(CH 2 ) 2 NH 3 + , with a cis conformation for the cation and The Pb analogue of 4-FPEA also adopts a parallel configuration for the cation (Figure  5b ),  22, 121  which is believed to be beneficial for the out-of-plane charge transport.  122  The in-plane transport of (4-FPEA) 2 PbI 4 is not as good as (PEA) 2 PbI 4 , because the Pb-I-Pb angle of (4-FPEA) 2 PbI 4 (151.69°) is smaller than (PEA) 2 PbI 4 (153.30°). 2D perovskite solar cells incorporating the 4-FPEA cation show higher power conversion efficiency than those with PEA, a point which will be discussed further in the device section below. More importantly, the photovoltaic devices exhibit better stability performance thanks to the hydrophobicity of 4-FPEA. 122 The fully fluorine-substituted cation, perfluorophenethylammonium (F5-PEA) (Table  4k ), was also explored. Interestingly, Mitzi et al. found that (F5-PEA) 2 SnI 4 could allow intercalation of benzene molecules between the layer, and perfluoroaryl molecules can also intercalate into (PEA) 2 SnI 4 .  123  Recently, the (F5-PEA) 2 PbI 4 was revisited because of its high hydrophobicity, thus improving the stability of the corresponding devices.  124  Mitzi and co-workers also explored the effects of substituting different halogens in the meta position (Table  4l ,m).  125  As the size of the halogen increases, so does the interlayer distance between the two planes of terminal iodine atoms to accommodate the bulky spacer cation. While A similar effect of halogen substitution on the para position for the Pb system was also studied by Tremblay et al.  84     85  BZA and 4-FBZA cations adopt a face-to-edge configuration, while 4-ClBZA and 4-BrBZA are tilted (Figure  5c ) because of the stronger halogen-halogen interaction between the halogen atom in the cation and the iodine atom in the octahedra. More interestingly, the 4-IBZA cation adopts face-to-edge configuration again because of the strong halogen-halogen interaction between the iodine atoms in the spacer and the octahedra. The closest I•••I distance is 3.931 Å, smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii of 3.96 Å.  84  Therefore, the strength of the halogen interaction follows the trend I > Br > Cl ≫ F. The unit cell displacements are (0.1, 0.3), (0.2, 0.2), (0.2, 0.2), and (0.45, 0.45) for 4-FBZA, 4-ClBZA, 4-BrBZA, and 4-IBZA, respectively, suggesting that the halogen interaction plays an important role in affecting the unit cell displacement. However, the lack of multilayer structures suggests that more studies are needed to understand the role of heteroatoms in n > 1. 3.1.5. Cations Involving Thiophene. Although the thiophene is a heterocyclic group, we separated the discussion from the above section of ""Cations with heteroatoms"" since it represents a special case because of the interactions between the electronic structure of the thiophene rings and that of the inorganic perovskite network. Cations involving thiophene moieties are another important class of aromatic spacers because the HOMO-LUMO gap of the molecule can be engineered relative to the bandgap of the inorganic layer. Thus, they can form either Type I or Type II quantum wells, where in Type I alignment, the low-energy electrons and holes are localized on the same component (both on the inorganic layer or both on the organic layer), and in Type II alignment, the electrons and holes are on different components (the inorganic layer and the spacer), as shown in Figure  6c .  126  This idea was first proposed by Mitzi et al. in 1999,  127  and they mainly focused on oligothiophene spacers with two amino groups on both ends, which will be discussed below. This idea has also been explored by Dou and co-workers using oligothiophene monoammonium cations.  51  The four cations listed in Figure  6a  have different HOMO-LUMO gap alignments compared to the inorganic layer. For cation i, the LUMO of the organic cation is higher than the CBM of the inorganic layer, and the HOMO is lower than VBM. The electrons and holes are localized on the CBM and VBM, respectively, and the bandgap is determined by the VBM-CBM gap of the inorganic layer. The photoluminescence property is similar to other n = 1 perovskites discussed above, with the PL emission peak at 526 nm (Figure  6b(i) ). The LUMO and HOMO of the organic cation ii are higher than the CBM and VBM of the inorganic layer, respectively, so the electrons are localized in the CBM of the inorganic part, while the holes are in the HOMO of the organic part, corresponding to the Type II quantum well structure (Figure  6c (ii)), which results in PL quenching. Cation iii is similar to cation ii except that the LUMO and HOMO are lower than the CBM and VBM, respectively, so the PL is also quenched (Figure  6c (iii)). For cation iv, the LUMO is lower than CBM, and the HOMO is higher than VBM, so the charge transport process is enabled and the electrons and holes are localized on the spacers. Only PL from the cation is observed, which has a longer lifetime than structure with cation i. This shows the powerful tunability of band alignment in 2D perovskites. Besides, cation ii has also been shown to improve the performance and stability of Sn perovskite-based field effect transistors (FET), thanks to the hydrophobic and bulky spacer cation. A multilayered 2D iodide perovskite using 2-thiophenemethylammonium has also enabled solar cell devices to achieve a PCE of over 15%, after adding extra methylammonium chloride, which will be discussed in more detail in the device section.  128  3.1.6. All Inorganic 2D Perovskites. Unlike the structures discussed above with organic spacer cations separating the octahedral layers, for the all-inorganic 2D perovskites, Cs 2 SnI 2 Cl 2  129  and Cs 2 PbI 2 Cl 2 ,  130  the two halides are ordered in the layers by the size mismatch. Instead of distributing randomly, the small halide (Cl) is in the bridging position while the large halide (I) takes the terminal sites. These unique ordered phases are favored thermodynamically and are distinct members of the Ruddlesden-Popper family, with the inorganic layer staggered by half an octahedron and the Cs + cations taking the inorganic pocket. The interlayer spacing is quite short because of the small size of the Cs + . The materials exhibit higher bandgaps than all-iodide 2D perovskites, but they are electronic structures are equally attractive because of their direct band gaps and broad valence and conduction bands. The organic cation MA can form similar structure in (MA) 2 Pb(SCN) 2 I 2 .  131  3.1.7. Guanidinium Cations. The alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI) phase is rare and was first reported by Kanatzidis and co-workers.  90  The A-site cation, MA, is not only inside the perovskite cage but also between the inorganic layers, alternating with another larger spacer cation, guanidinium (GA). Viewing from the a direction (Figure  2c ), the inorganic layers are eclipsed and from the b direction, they are staggered by half an octahedron, so the unit cell displacement is (0, 0.5). Because of the small size of the GA cation, the interlayer distance is small. There may be some interaction across the layer in the stacking direction, so the bandgaps of this series are smaller than the RP phase of the same layer-number. The n = 1 phase, (GA)(MA)PbI 4 , has MA between the inorganic layers even though there is no cuboctahedral cage, that is different from (GA) 2 MI 4 (M = Sn 2+ or Pb 2+ ),  [132] [133] [134]  which form ⟨110⟩-oriented 2D perovskite. This is not surprising because the GA cation is small enough to fit in the pocket of the ⟨110⟩-oriented 2D perovskite. Similar structures also form when Cs + is between the layer and alternating with GA for bromide and iodide perovskites.  135  The GA cation has strong hydrogen bonding with the neighboring Br atoms, so octahedra are tilted and the Pb-Br-Pb angles are much smaller than 180°. The bandgap is still smaller than the corresponding RP phase [(BA) 2 PbBr 4 ] because of the small interlayer distance. Combining GA with formamidinium (FA), which is slightly larger than MA, a ⟨210⟩-oriented 2D perovskite forms.  136  The crystals are red with a relatively broad PL emission. A similar structure can also form with FA and thiourea.  137  3.2. Diammonium Cations 3.2.1. Linear Cations. Diammonium cations have been less explored as spacers for 2D perovskites than the monoammonium cations. These are essentially ditopic ligands because they are capable of forming electrostatic interaction at two separate sites of their molecule. For linear cations that have a positive charge at each end, the ethylenediammonium cation is too small to template the 2D structure. The 1,3propanediammonium cation stabilizes a ⟨110⟩-oriented 2D perovskite using bromide  76  and ⟨100⟩-oriented 2D perovskite using chloride.  78  The iodide structure with 1,3-propanediammonium cation has not been published, and it is likely that it cannot form 2D structure. Billing and co-workers studied diammonium cations of different carbon-chain lengths NH 3 (CH 2 ) m NH 3 2+ (m = 4, 7, 8, 10, 12) (Table  5 ) and found that the diammonium cations with even carbon-chain lengths formed n = 1 2D perovskites while those with odd carbon chain lengths (m = 7) formed a 1D structure.  71  Li et al. synthesized (NH 3 C m H 2m NH 3 )(MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 (m = 4-9, n = 1-4) with both solution method and solid-state grinding method (Table  5b -f).  39  They found that the multilayer 2D perovskites can form when a step-cooling solution method is utilized for cations with both odd and even number carbon-chain lengths. However, this solution method does not apply to diammonium cations with short carbonchain (m = 4 and 6) since the cations are too soluble in HI. The solid-state grinding method can be used to solve this problem, achieving n = 3 for all the carbon-chain members (m = 4-9). The optical properties of 2D perovskites incorporating diammonium cations are similar to those with monoammonium cations. The PL emission peaks shift to lower energy as the interlayer distance decreases, so there may be some interaction in the stacking direction leading to lower bandgaps. The films with diammonium cations show better stability performance than those with monoammonium cations, since the weakest interaction between the layers changed from van der Waals interaction in the monoammonium cations to the electrostatic interaction between the amino group and the inorganic layer. Other linear diammonium cations explored include (CH 3 ) 3 NCH 2 CH 2 NH 3 2+ and 2-methylpentane-1,5-diammonium (Table  5i , j). The tertiary N with three methyl groups i s b u l k y , s o i t c a n f o r m 2 D p e r o v s k i t e ((CH 3 ) 3 NCH 2 CH 2 NH 3 )SnI 4 .  138  More interestingly, the inorganic layers are almost stacking exactly on top of each other, resembling the Dion-Jacobson phase. For 2-methylpentane-1,5-diammonium, it forms a 2D n = 1 structure for bromide and chloride perovskites and a 1D structure with face-sharing octahedra for the iodide compound.  78  Interestingly, when MA is incorporated into the compound, it can stabilize the n = 2 2D structure for the iodide perovskite, similar to the case of propylammonium discussed earlier when the 2D structure cannot form by the spacer itself but requires the A-site cation to be stabilized.  139  3.2.2. Cyclic Cations. Cyclic diammonium cations have more strict size limits for the rings since the spacers are more compact. Billing and co-workers. reported the n = 1 structure of (1,4-bis(ammoniomethyl)cyclohexane)PbI 4 (Table  6a ).  143  The Pb-I bonds are mainly tilted in-plane and barely tilted out-of-plane, and the unit cell displacement is (0.1, 0.1), close to that of the DJ phase. Not all cyclic cations involving a benzene ring can form a 2D structure. The p-phenylenediammonium cation stabilizes 1D and nonoctahedral structures for iodide  144  and chloride,  145  respectively (Table  6c ). While the m-phenylenediammonium cation (Table  6b ) stabilizes a 2D n = 1 structure for chloride, with eclipsed inorganic layers indicating this structure is a DJ phase.  145  If one of the amino groups becomes bulkier, for example, the N,Ndimethyl-p-phenylenediammonium cation (Table  6d ), it stabilizes isostructural 2D n = 1 structures for all three h a l i d e s . 1 4 5 , 1 4 6 T h i s is s i mi l a r t o th e c a s e of (CH 3 ) 3 NCH 2 CH 2 NH 3 2+ discussed above (Table  5i ), where the primary amino spacer cannot stabilize the 2D structure, but the quaternary amino spacer can. The penetration depths for the primary and tertiary N groups are 1.11 and -0.57 Å, respectively. The primary amino group can penetrate into the inorganic layer pocket, while the bulky tertiary amino group has a negative penetration depth, depending on the level of steric hindrance. The 1,5-naphthalene diammonium cation (Table  6e ) can also form the eclipsed DJ phase, and the octahedra are mainly tilted in-plane and barely tilted out-ofplane.  77  However, diammonium cations such as benzidinium  147  and 4,4′-bipyridinium  148  tend to form 1D structures. Heterocyclic diammonium cations such as 2,2′-biimidazolium  67  and benzodiimidazolium  149  can also form 2D perovskites (Table  6f , g). As discussed above, only two of the four N can be protonated. More interestingly, the M-I-M bond angles are close to 180°. The 2,2′-biimidazolium cations adopt a parallel configuration, and they are tilted with respect to the inorganic layer. So, the octahedra are staggered, with unit cell displacement of (0.1, 0.5).  67  1,4-dimethylpiperazinium cations stabilize the 2D n = 1 structure for bromide and 1D structure for iodide (Table  6h ).  150  All the 2D structures discussed in this part have relatively small interlayer d-spacing because of the compact spacers. 3.2.3. (Aminomethyl)piperidinium Cations. Some of the diammonium cations discussed above form the n = 1 Dion-Jacobson phase with inorganic layers stacked exactly on top of each other, but none have been incorporated into multilayered n > 1 structures. In 2018, Mao et al. first reported multilayer structures of 2D halide DJ perovskites (xAMP)-(MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 (AMP = (aminomethyl)piperidinium, x = 3 or 4, n = 1-4) (Table  6  i, j).  89  The dications are less symmetrical than most spacers discussed in the session above, with one primary N and another N on the piperidine ring. The position of the functional group has a profound influence on the structure and properties of the resulting 2D perovskite structure. Since the inorganic layers are stacked exactly on top of each other with no lateral shift, the distance between adjacent layers defined by the planes of terminal iodine atoms can simply be measured by the closest I•••I distance. Both series exhibit short interlayer distance of ∼4 Å, with the 3AMP series showing a slightly smaller distance (Figure  7a ) than the 4AMP one (Figure  7b ). The 3AMP cation shows weak interaction with the terminal iodine atoms (Figure  7a ), which exhibits a small effect on the in-plane Pb-I-Pb angle since the terminal iodine atom does not contribute to the in-plane distortion directly. While 4AMP seems to interact in a stronger fashion where the hydrogen bonding with bridging iodine atoms causes amplified in-plane distortion but negligible outof-plane distortion (Figure  7b ). To distinguish these two effects, the Pb-I-Pb angles can be further classified into two categories, the equatorial Pb-I-Pb angle parallel to the inorganic plane, and the axial Pb-I-Pb angle perpendicular to the plane (Figure  7a ). For both series, all the axial Pb-I-Pb bond angles are close to 180°, so the bond angle difference mainly comes from the equatorial ones. The equatorial Pb-I-Pb angles are much smaller in the 4AMP series than in the 3AMP series with a similar trend for the average angles. The inorganic layers are more distorted in the 4AMP series, leading to higher bandgaps than those for the 3AMP series (Figure  7e, f ). The optical properties of the DJ series present some differences from those in the RP series. For the same homologous member (e.g., n = 3), the PL emission peaks of the AMP compounds are at lower energy than those of the butylammonium (BA) compounds (Figure  7e ). As mentioned above, the Pb-I-Pb angle can affect the bandgap when the other structural parameters are the same (e.g., layer-number, interlayer distance and Pb-I bond lengths). For n = 3, even though the 4AMP compound shows the smallest average Pb-I-Pb bond angle (as well as smallest equatorial Pb-I-Pb bond angle), its bandgap is still smaller than the that of the BA compound, which suggests that the Pb-I-Pb angle is not the only factor that can influence the bandgap. It has been suggested that the interlayer spacing can also affect the bandgap especially when the closest interlayer distance is equal to or shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii of iodide atoms. In that case there may be significant I•••I interactions in the stacking direction and broaden electronic band widths thus reducing the 2D confinement and the narrowing bandgap.  40  Since the interlayer distance is much shorter for 4AMP (4.1 Å) than BA (7.1 Å), it shows lower bandgap despite the smaller average Pb-I-Pb angles. Electronic band structure calculations also show the I•••I interaction participates in antibonding that destabilizes the VBM, leading to reduced bandgap compared to the RP phase.  89  While between 3AMP and 4AMP, the interlayer distance is similar (∼4 Å) so the Pb-I-Pb angle still plays the role. The 3AMP series with larger average Pb-I-Pb angle (as well as larger equatorial Pb-I-Pb angle) shows lower bandgap. Fabrication of solar cell devices using the n = 4 compounds results in a PCE of 7.32% for (3AMP)(MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 , which is higher than (4AMP)-(MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13. In this context, it is illustrative to compare the n = 7 structure of (4AMP)(MA) 6 Pb 7 I 22 , which is highest layer thickness perovskite to be crystallographically characterized, with the RP structure of (BA) 2 (MA) 6 Pb 7 I 22 .  151  Even though for n = 3 the 4AMP structure is more distorted (smaller Pb-I-Pb angle) than the BA one, in n = 7 the difference becomes smaller. The equatorial Pb-I-Pb angle is still smaller for the 4AMP compound (160.8°) than the BA one (163.7°). Since the contribution of the axial Pb-I-Pb angle becomes more significant in n = 7 (six axial Pb-I-Pb angles), and 4AMP has large axial Pb-I-Pb angle close to 180°, the average Pb-I-Pb angle is larger for the 4AMP (169.2°) than the BA (165.1°) compound. More interestingly, the distortion of individual octahedron quantified by the bong angle variance (BAV) and distortion index (DI), is much larger in the BA compound. For the AMP n = 7 compound, the inorganic layer closest to the AMP cation is most distorted, and ""absorbs"" most of the strain. For the BA compound, the central layer is most distorted, and the strain cannot be relieved in the individual layer, leading to the overall more distorted structure. Therefore, the AMP n = 7 compound shows a lower bandgap than BA owing to its less distorted structure and smaller interlayer distance. The bandgaps of the AMP compounds can be further tuned by FA alloying targeting the perovskite cages.  152  It is wellknown that in 3D perovskites, FAPbI The same strategy of A cation alloying also applies to the bromide perovskites. Because of the similarity of 3AMP and 4AMP cations, both the spacer and the A-site cations can be a l l o y e d t o g e n e r a t e t h e s e r i e s ( 3 A M -P) a (4AMP) 1-a (FA) b (MA) 1-b Pb 2 Br 7 . Similar to the iodide series, the average Pb-Br-Pb angles are closer to 180°with more 3AMP and FA and increasing ratio of 4AMP and MA decreases the angles. Since all compounds exhibit similar interlayer distance, the Pb-Br-Pb angles play the major role in determining the bandgaps. The compound with larger Pb-Br-Pb angle shows lower bandgap, which can be tuned from 2.66 to 2.82 eV.  153  3.2.4. (Aminomethyl)pyridinium Cations. The aromatic analogues of the (aminomethyl)piperidinium cations, x-(aminomethyl)pyridinium (AMPY, x = 3 or 4) (Table  6k ,l) have been explored by Li et al.  40  Compared to the aliphatic xAMP cations, the aromatic xAMPY cations have larger rigidity since all the atoms on the aromatic ring must stay on the same plane. These cations also have some delocalization of charge on the aromatic ring as well as a smaller dielectric mismatch between the inorganic and organic layer owing to the increased dielectric constant of xAMPY. These factors affect the strength of the electrostatic interaction between the inorganic and organic layers, influencing stacking of the inorganic layer and the Pb-I-Pb bond angle, thus changing the optical properties. The 3AMPY cation is less symmetric than the 4AMPY, and since the aromatic ring cannot bend, the inorganic layers are slightly offset, with a unit cell displacement of (0.25, 0.25). Even though the 3AMPY compounds exhibit smaller interlayer distance, their closest I•••I distance (Figure  7c ) is still larger than the 4AMPY series (Figure  7d ) because of the slightly staggered octahedra. Because of the resonance of the aromatic ring, the ortho and para (2 and 4) positions are activated, bearing more partial positive charges. Then the partial positive charge is brought to the primary NH 3 + group through the inductive effect of the carbon in the aminomethyl group (CH 2 NH 3 + ). So, the 4AMPY cation exhibits a stronger electrostatic interaction with the inorganic layer, with the 4AMPY compounds showing smaller NH 3 + •••I distance than the 3AMPY compounds. For 4AMPY, the hydrogen bonding between the N-H of the pyridinium ring and the bridging iodine atom of the octahedra makes the octahedra mainly distorted in-plane and barely distorted out-of-plane (Figure  7d ). For 3AMPY, the N-H of the pyridinium ring is loosely hydrogen-bonded to the terminal iodine atom, resulting in slight distortion in the perovskite layer both in-plane and outof-plane (Figure  7c ). The 4AMPY series exhibits axial Pb-I-Pb angles close to 180°, but smaller equatorial Pb-I-Pb angles than the 3AMPY series (Figure  7c, d ). Overall, the average Pb-I-Pb angles are smaller for the 4AMPY series, leading to wider bandgaps than the 3AMPY series. Looking at the optical absorption spectra of the aromatic AMPY and aliphatic AMP compounds (Figure  7f ), there are two slopes for all, and the bandgap is extracted from the highenergy slope before it is interrupted by the exciton peak. The high-energy bandgap slope is almost the same, the low-energy slope varies because of the existence of the exciton peak. The exciton binding energy E b can be roughly estimated by subtracting energy of the exciton peak relative to the bandgap, resulting in smaller E b in the aromatic AMPY series than the aliphatic AMP series. As mentioned previously, the 2D perovskites can be seen as naturally formed quantum well structure, with the organic spacer as the barrier and the inorganic layer as the well. the E b of 2D perovskites can be estimated by the equation, = ε ε ( ) E E 4 b b D 2 3 w b , where ε w and ε b are the dielectric constants of the well and barrier, respectively, and E b 3D is the exciton binding energy of the corresponding 3D perovskite. Since the organic spacer (barrier) usually has smaller dielectric constant than the inorganic layer (well), the exciton binding energy of 2D perovskite is higher than that of the 3D one. This makes sense because of the quantum and dielectric confinement effects when the dimension is reduced from 3D to 2D. For 2D perovskites with different spacer cations (for the same n value), since the aromatic spacers (AMPY) exhibits larger dielectric constant than the aliphatic ones (AMP) as the barrier, they are expected to have smaller dielectric mismatch between the organic and inorganic layers and reduced dielectric confinement in the quantum well structure.  154  So, one can expect the electron-hole pairs to be more easily separated and carriers collected by the electron/ hole transport layers in photovoltaic devices, which is supported by the efficiencies of the solar cell devices. The J sc and thus the PCE of the devices based on (3AMPY)-(MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 is 50% higher than those of (3AMP)(MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 (see below in the device part). Interestingly, during synthesis, using the same aromatic cations but changing the starting ratio of Pb: xAMPY, new 3D nonperovskitic structures (perovsktoids) form with a combination of corner-sharing and edgesharing octahedra.  38  The 2AMPY cation can also be incorporated into lead iodide structures to form either a 1D structure that incorporates crystalline H 2 O in the lattice or 2D structures that preclude H 2 O, and these structures are interconvertible below 90 °C.  155, 156  This cation forms 2D perovskites for bromide and chloride compounds as well with a unit cell displacement of (0.2, 0.2), similar to that of the 3AMPY compounds.  156  The bromide compounds with x-AMPY (x = 3 or 4) cations form 0D and 1D structures with 3AMPY and 4AMPY, respectively.  157  3.2.5. Diammonium Cations Involving Thiophene. As mentioned above in the monoammonium cation section, Mitzi et al. first proposed the idea of exploring band alignment in the materials using cations with oligothiophene derivatives.  127  In 1999, they described the lead bromide perovskites structure of the n = 1 single crystal with a heavily conjugated quaterthiophene derivative (AE4T, Figure  8e (iv)) (Figure  8a ).  127  The cations adopt the herringbone configuration and have significant optical absorption and emission by themselves. They also fabricated the thin film of the perovskites with all three halides (X = Cl, Br, I). The absorption spectra of three thin films resemble those of the corresponding halide salts with an additional exciton peak from the inorganic lead halide octahedra (Figure  8b ). For X = Cl, the exciton peak is at higher energy than the organic absorption feature (Figure  8b (i)). For X = Br, the two energy peaks overlap (Figure  8b (ii)), and for X = I, the exciton absorption is at lower energy than the organic absorption feature (Figure  8b (iii)). The PL spectrum of the chloride perovskite is similar to that of the chloride salt of the oligothiophene organic cation, while the PL spectrum of the iodide perovskite is significantly quenched. This suggests that the chloride perovskite likely forms internal Type I heterojunction (Figure  6c (iv)) with the HOMO and LUMO level of the organic molecule representing the lowest energy states for both electrons and holes, so the carriers recombine in the chromophore radiatively. The conduction band is composed of the lead p-orbital and the valence band consists of the lead s-and halide p-orbitals. Changing the halogen from X = Cl to X = I increases the energy of the valence band maximum while maintaining the conduction band energy (Figure  8c ). This leads to a Type II quantum well for the bromide and iodide structures, with the electrons are localized in the CBM of the inorganic part and the holes in the HOMO of the organic part (Figure  6c (ii)). Charge separation inhibits overlap of the electron and hole wave functions and therefore decreases the possibility of radiative recombination. This is confirmed by DFT calculations (Figure  8c ).  126  Liu et al. has also evaluated the band alignment of different oligothiophene spacer cations for bromide perovskites, from one thiophene to five thiophene rings (Figure  8e(i)-(v) ).  126  Using the spacer with one thiophene ring leads to a 2D perovskite structure that adopts Type I alignment, while those with two and more thiophene rings lead to 2D perovskites with Type II quantum well structures (Figure  8d ). The rigidity and unique configuration of the AE4T cation also stabilizes the so-called metal deficient perovskites (AE4T)M 2/3 □ 1/3 X 4 (M = Bi 3+ and Sb 3+ , □ = vacancy)  158  and the iodide 2D double perovskite (AE4-T) 2 AgBiI 8 .  159  However, diammonium cations containing thiophene rings and flexible linear chain (Figure  8e (vi)) form 1D structures of (NH 3 RNH 3 )BiI 5 .  127   
 Varying the A-site Cations So far, we have discussed how the spacer cations can influence the properties of 2D perovskites, most of which have incorporated MA as the A-site cation. The size of the A-site cation which occupies the perovskite cage is limited by the  
 Goldschmidt tolerance factor = + [ + ] t r r r r ( )/ 2( ) A X M X , where r A , r M , and r X are the effective radii of A + , M 2+ , and X - ions, respectively.  160, 161  When the t value is between 0.8 and 1, the perovskite phases are favored. For cations with t larger than 1 or smaller than 0.8, they usually form nonperovskite phases.  162  For M = Pb 2+ and X = I -, the t values of Cs + and FA are near the lower and upper limits of the ideal range, respectively, so perovskite structures of CsPbI 3 and FAPbI 3 are metastable at room temperature. When M = Sn 2+ , the t values for Cs + and FA + are well within this range, so CsSnI 3 and FASnI 3 form stable perovskite structures.  62  However, in 2D perovskites (e.g., (A′) 2 (A) n-1 M n X 3n+1 ), the range of the tolerance factor can actually be extended so that spacer cations larger than MA can be stabilized.  75, 163  For example, (BA) 2 (FA)Pb 2 I 7 and (BA) 2 (FA)Pb 2 Br 7 are stable at room temperature (Table  7a ).  101, 107  Incorporating the isopropylammonium (IPA) cation in the tin iodide system forms a 1D structure at room temperature. But during the synthesis at high temperature, a red phase is observed, and characterizing the aliquots reveals a 2D structure (IPA) 2 (IPA)Sn 2 I 7 with the IPA cations taking the positions both between the inorganic layer (A′ site) and inside the perovskite cage (A site) (Table  7e ).  164  Upon cooling to room temperature, this phase transforms back to the 1D phase within five minutes. Mao et al. reported the structures of (EA) 2 (EA) 2 Pb 3 X 10 (EA = ethylammonium, X = Br and Cl), which are both stable at room temperature (Table  7c ). Similar to (IPA) 2 (IPA)Sn 2 I 7 , the EA cation takes both the A and A′ site (Figure  9a ).  75  To accommodate the large cation, the octahedra are highly distorted, with elongated Pb-X bonds and X-Pb-X angles deviated from 90°(Figure  9b ). The PL spectra of the compounds are broad, covering the whole visible light range, making them white-light emitters at room temperature. EA cannot template the iodide structure ""(EA) 2 (EA) 2 Pb 3 I 10 "" by itself, but it can serve as A-site cation when a larger spacer cation (such as butylamine (BA)) is employed, forming (BA) 2 (EA) 2 Pb 3 I 10 .  30, 74  Its bandgap is the highest among the n = 3 structures because of the elongation of the Pb-I bond length and distortion of the octahedra. Mixing EA with MA for the A-site results in a continuous shift of optical properties.  74  Adding more EA to the structure causes the bandgap and PL peak to shift to higher energy and the PL intensity to quench. (BA) 2 (EA) 2 Pb 3 I 10 is also reported to show antiferroelectricity  30  and sensitive X-ray detection.  166  Fu et al.  163  extended of Goldschmidt tolerance factor concept to 2D perovskites using hexylammonium (HA) as the spacer and formamidinium (FA), dimethylammonium (DMA), guanidinium (GA), and acetamidinium (AA) as A-site cations. The structure of (HA) 2 (GA)Pb 2 I 7 was characterized by singlecrystal X-ray diffraction and compared to that of (HA) 2 (MA)-Pb 2 I 7 (Table  7d ). The perovskite cage is expanded, and the tensile strain of the cage is compensated by the compressed spacer layer. The PL intensity and lifetime of (HA) 2 (GA)Pb 2 I 7 are significantly reduced compared to (HA) 2 (MA)Pb 2 I 7 because of increased phonon-mediated nonradiative decay caused by exciton-phonon interaction. Li et al. reported the detailed evolution of structural and optoelectronic properties of (BA) 2 (A)Pb 2 I 7 (A = MA, FA, DMA, GA) (Figure  9d-g ).  21  As the size of A-site cation increases (MA < FA < DMA < GA), the Pb-I bonds are elongated, which reduces the orbital overlap of the Pb s-and I p-orbitals, thus increasing the bandgap (Figure  9h ). A 2D color map of how the bandgap changes with Pb-I bond length is built by DFT calculations, showing that the bandgaps increase with increasing Pb-I bond lengths (Figure  9c ). It has been reported that the Pb-I-Pb bond angles can affect when the other structural parameters are the same. However, in this series, the Pb-I bond length plays the major role and the effect of Pb-I-Pb bond angle is secondary since the angles are similar. Raman spectra suggest that the lattice becomes softer and more anharmonic with larger A-site cations. These structural changes with enlarged A cations result in significant decreases in PL intensity and PL lifetime, consistent with a more pronounced nonradiative decay (Figure  9i ). So far, three factors have been proved experimentally to tune the bandgap of 2D perovskites for a specific layer-number: (i) metal-halidemetal (M-X-M) bond angle, (ii) interlayer distance and (iii) metal-halide (M-X) bond length. M-X-M bond angles close to 180°and small M-X bond lengths lead to more overlap of metal s-and halide p-orbitals, while close interlayer d-spacing results in weak halide interaction in the stacking direction, both reducing the bandgap. Hautzinger et al. reported similar trend for 2D nanoplates (HA) 2 (A)Pb 2 I 7 (A = Cs + , MA, FA, DMA, EA, GA, and AA).  165  The peak positions for both the absorption and PL spectra show a clear parabolic trend versus the size of the Asite cation, with MA and FA near the bottom (Figure  9j ). It is worth mentioning that the trend of the bulk and colloidal systems is slightly different, since the octahedra in the nanoplates have more freedom to tilt due to the finite size of the crystals and the strain introduced by the large A-site cation can be easily mitigated to the ligand. In contrast, for the bulk materials, the strain is accumulated in the inorganic lattice since the octahedra repeat infinitely in the stacking direction. The size dependence of the absorption peak for the 2D perovskite nanoplates follows the same trend as for that of the 3D bulk perovskites APbI 3 (A = Cs + , MA and FA) in that E g/Cs+ > E g/MA > E g/FA , which suggests in this region, the tilt of octahedra (Pb-I-Pb bond angle) is the main factor in determining the bandgap. On the other hand, for the 2D bulk perovskites, E g/MA < E g/FA < E g/GA , suggesting that the Pb-I bond elongation plays the major role. The size of the A-site cation is indicative of the chemical pressure inside the cage. Recent reports have shown that upon external pressure, the Pb-I bond length decreases and the optical bandgap also reduces (Figure  9j ).  [167] [168] [169]  However, there is no mechanism for stretching the Pb-I bond length by applying ""negative"" physical pressure. Incorporating large Asite cations can expand the perovskite cage as a form of negative chemical pressure, which results in the increase of the optical bandgap, in contrast to the bandgap decrease caused by physical pressure (Figure  9j ). This also leads to a decrease in PL quantum yield (PLQY) and lifetime, both of which are detrimental to solar cell performance. These results suggest that A-site cation alloying is not responsible for the improved photovoltaic performance, instead the passivation of grain boundary from the large A-site cations could be more likely.  165  The A-site cation is therefore a powerful tool for tuning the properties of 2D perovskites. More importantly, there is a longstanding debate on how the A-site cation may influence the properties of perovskites  [170] [171] [172] [173]  such as carrier dynamics,  171, 173  local ferroelectric domains,  170, 172  Rashba splitting,  174  and localization of conduction and valence band edges in spatially separated regions.  170  However, agreement still has not been reached and very few studies have been done on 2D perovskites. Increased choices of A-site cations for 2D perovskites with different dipole moments provide useful model systems to study the effect of A-site cation on the properties. This can help us with future designs of more optimal materials for specific optoelectronic applications. 
 ⟨110⟩-Oriented 2D Perovskites The less-explored ⟨110⟩-oriented 2D perovskites can incorporate +1 or +2 cations, adopting the general formula of A′AMX 4 (A and A′ are +1) or BMX 4 (B is +2) (Figure  10a, b ). For A′AMX 4 , the A and A′ cations can be the same or different. The A cation occupies the octahedral pocket while the A′ cation sits between the layers (Figure  10a ). For BMX 4 , the +2 cation connects the adjacent layers by electrostatic interaction. The ⟨110⟩-oriented 2D perovskites were first reported by Mitzi et al., using iodoformamidinium (IFO)  175  as the A′ cation and MA as the A cation (Table  8a ). Multilayered structures (IFO) 2 (MA) m Sn m I 3m+2 (m = 2-4) were synthesized, which remains the only example of multilayered ⟨110⟩-oriented 2D perovskites, but only the crystal structure for (IFO) 2 (MA) 2 Sn 2 I 8 (m = 2) was reported (Figure  10a ). ⟨110⟩-oriented 2D perovskite can also form for the Pb analogue, (IFO)(MA)PbI 4 , but so far, only the structure of one-layer is reported.  176  Lightfoot and co-workers have found that similar structures can be templated with GA as the A cation and imidazolium (ImH) (Table  8b ) and 1,2,4triazolium (TzH) (Table  8d ) as the A′ cation for lead bromide  177  perovskites and 1-methylimidazolium (Table  8c ) for tin iodide perovskites.  178  Combining TzH and ImH, a rare 3 × 3 ⟨110⟩-oriented 2D perovskite can form.  179  Because of the existence of multiple N atoms in the cation, inter-cation hydrogen bonding influences the structure. More interestingly, a 3D tin iodide structure can be stabilized with GA and TzH both inside the cuboctahedral cage.  178  The octahedra are highly distorted to accommodate the large cation. In the previously mentioned examples, the smaller cation occupies the octahedral pocket with the larger cation between the layers, but the 2-hydroxyethylammonium (Table  8e ) cation takes the position inside the pocket with the smaller FA between the layers. This because of the strong hydrogen bonding between 2-hydroxyethylammonium and the inorganic layer.  180  GA forms similar structures of (GA) 2 MI 4 (M = Pb 2+ and Sn 2+ ), where it takes both A and A′ site,  [132] [133] [134]  so does acetamidinium.  179  However, with a combination of GA and FA, a 2 × 3 ⟨110⟩-oriented 2D perovskite forms (Table  8g ).  136  A similar structure can also form for thiourea and FA (Table  8h ).  137  Besides the most common 2 × 2 ⟨110⟩-oriented 2D perovskites, other configurations can also be stabilized depending on where the corrugation occurs. These are named ""n × m"" ⟨110⟩-oriented 2D perovskites (Figure  10c ) such as the 2 × 3 structure discussed above, with two octahedra on the one side of the roof and three on the other side. Most of the structures are symmetric, such as 2 × 2, 3 × 3, 4 × 4 and 6 × 6 ⟨110⟩-oriented 2D perovskites (Figure  10c ). Most of these structures form because of unique hydrogen bonding, such as 4-nitrophenylethylammonium (Table  8i ), which forms 3 × 3 ⟨110⟩-oriented lead iodide perovskites. The isostructural bromide perovskite can form but not chloride.  182  ⟨110⟩-oriented 2D perovskites BMX 4 can form using linear or cyclic diammonium cations as well. For example, 1,3propanediammonium cation forms the 6 × 6 ⟨110⟩-oriented lead bromide perovskite (Table  8j ),  76  and 1,5-pentanediammonium cation can form the 4 × 4 ⟨110⟩-oriented perovskite with tin and iodide (Table  8k ).  183     5i ), forms ⟨110⟩-oriented perovskites with tin and iodide,  138  probably because the hydrogen bonding is not as strong as secondary and ternary N-H. Longer diammonium cations with ether groups such as 2,2-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylammonium) can form 2 × 2 ⟨110⟩-oriented perovskites for bromide and iodide, but not chloride (Table  8l ).  82  It is difficult to form ⟨110⟩-oriented perovskites with all three halides since the Pb-X bond length is halide-dependent, meaning the tolerance of each Pb-X framework to the same cation is different. However, because of its unique shape and size, the cyclic diammonium cation 3-aminopyrrolidinium can form ⟨110⟩-oriented perovskites for all three halides (Table  8p ).  181  The ring lies parallel to the stacking direction for the bromide and chloride structures but perpendicular to the stacking direction for the iodide structure which requires more space inside the octahedra pocket and leads to more distorted inorganic layers. Other cyclic diammonium cations such as piperazinium  150  (Table  8q ) and 1-ethylpiperazinium  69  (Table  8r ) can form 2 × 2 ⟨110⟩-oriented perovskites for chloride and bromide, respectively. For imidazolium derivatives (Table 8su), only one N atom on then ring can be protonated, and when that N atom shows on the different positions of the ring, different structures can form.  68, 184, 185  Many of the compounds discussed above exhibit broad PL emission, and the PL spectra for some of these compounds covers the whole visible light range, making them white-light emitters at room temperature. The white-light emission mechanism is associated with self-trapped excitons (STE), which are a series of traps states below the bandgap in highly distorted structures.  81, 82  Even though the essence of STE is still under exploration, they are generally believed to be caused by an exciton-phonon (lattice) interaction similar to polarons, not permanent chemical defects.  186  The perovskite lattice is very soft, so when the exciton interacts with the deformable lattice, local distortion can be created, like a hard ball dropping on a soft net and causing a potential minimum. When the ball (exciton) is removed, the net (lattice) returns to its original states. This is different from a ball dropping on a net with holes (defects), where the ball prefers to fall into where the hole is. Researchers have tried to correlate the STE with structural characters such as bond length distortion, bond angle variance and out-of-plane distortion.  83, 187  Most of the ⟨110⟩-oriented perovskites are more distorted than the ⟨100⟩-oriented perovskites; however, it is rare to find a system where ⟨110⟩oriented perovskites can be formed by all three halides and emit white-light at room temperature. As discussed above, 3aminopyrrolidinium is an exception and can form ⟨110⟩oriented perovskites for all three halides, which provides a perfect platform to compare the mechanism. Li et al. performed temperature-dependent PL measurement on these three compounds and found that as the temperature cooled down, the STE peak becomes observable.  181  Though the position of the free exciton (FE) peak varies for three halides, the positions of the STE peaks are similar. As shown in Figure  10d , at room temperature, the carriers have enough thermal energy to cross the barrier from FE to STE, so all three compounds emit white light at room temperature. As the temperature cools down, the thermal energy is insufficient for the carriers to cross the barrier. This happens for the iodide compound first at the highest temperature, so the FE peak starts to show up first. On the other hand, the barrier from STE to FE is smallest for the iodide compound, so it is possible for the carrier to detrap back to FE states. But for the chloride compound, the barrier to detrap is largest once the carriers are trapped, so it is unlikely for them to detrap. So, the chloride compounds exhibit broad emission even at low temperature. Overall, the trend for trapping follows E trap, I > E trap,Br > E trap,Cl while the trend of detrapping is the opposite. 
 ⟨111⟩-Oriented 2D Perovskites ⟨111⟩-oriented 2D perovskites usually incorporate +3 metals since cleaving the parent 3D structure selectively eliminates some metal sites, changing the charge of the inorganic lattice. These perovskites can be regarded as a class of defect perovskites A 3 M 2 □X 9 (M = Bi 3+ , Sb 3+ and As 3+ ; □ is vacancy), where the metal takes 2/3 occupancy of the M site in the A 3 M 3 X 9 perovskite formula. The structure can be seen as removing one layer of octahedra in the ⟨111⟩ direction for every three layers (Figure  11 ). For the iodide perovskites, when the A cation is small, such as ammonium,  189, 190  potassium,  191  or rubidium,  192, 193  ⟨111⟩-oriented 2D perovskite structures can form. While for large A cations like methyl-ammonium  194, 195  and guanidinium,  196  a 0D structure with a dimer of face-sharing octahedra forms. For Cs + , it forms 0D structure with Bi 3+191 and ⟨111⟩-oriented 2D structure with Sb 3+ .  197  Interestingly, when mixed with chloride, the 0D structure of Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 can expand to 2D Cs 3 Bi 2 I 6 Cl 3 ,  198  with the small chloride taking the bridging site and large iodide occupying the terminal site. More interestingly, even when a small fraction of I (9%) is replaced by Cl, the structure can change from 1D (Cs 3 Bi 2 Cl 9 ) to 2D Cs 3 Bi 2 Cl 8.16 I 0.84 ,  199  showing the powerful range that this strategy works. Thanks to the relatively low bandgap and large density, some of the compounds are explored for optoelectronic applications such as solar cells and 200 α-particle 201 and X-ray detection.  202  Generally, we expect the 2D structures to show better performance than the 0D ones. Solis-Ibarra and co-workers expand the single layer ⟨111⟩oriented 2D perovskites to multilayered perovskites by incorporating +2 metal to form A 4 M II M III 2 X 12 .  203  These compounds can also be seen as expansion of 2D layered double perovskites. The octahedra with the M II are in the middle layer and those with the M III are on the edge (Figure  11 ). So far, there are seven synthesized and structurally characterized compounds (Cs   [203] [204] [205]  and more are predicted by DFT calculations.  205, 206  4. OVERVIEW OF THIN FILM AND DEVICE FABRICATION The ascendance of 2D perovskites in the field of photovoltaics in the past five years was surprisingly rapid, and the main reasons for this have been their significantly greater chemical stability, facile tendency to form films from solutions, strong tendency for perpendicular orientation of the 2D perovskite layers relative to the substrate and comparable ability to perform as great solar cell materials compared to the 3D MAPbI 3 . However, even as the success in solar cell devices and light emitting diodes has been undisputed, there has been confusion and controversy in understanding the true nature of the films and the difference between nominal composition and the actual phase distribution in the films. In this section, we review the various methods, characterizations and current understanding of films made from 2D as well as 2D/3D perovskite mixtures. There are different methods used to make thin films of these materials which will influence the properties and the ultimate performance of the device. To understand the relationship between the perovskite layer and device performance, it is important to look at the perovskite layer in the context of the overall device architecture, which varies depending on the device. In solar cells, the overall device architecture consists of an electrode, a hole-transport layer (HTL) which allows holes through but not electrons, the absorbing perovskite layer, an electron-transport layer (ETL) which allows electrons through but not holes, and another electrode.  207  These layers can either be stacked with in the order substrate/electrode/HTL/perovskite/ETL/electrode (pi-n architecture, Figure  12a ) or substrate/electrode/ETL/ perovskite/HTL/electrode (n-i-p architecture, Figure  12b ). The HTL and ETL are chosen based on the energy levels of the perovskite layer. The conduction band minimum (CBM) of the ETL is ideally just below the CBM of the perovskite layer to allow electrons in the CBM of the perovskite to easily transfer to the CBM of the ETL. Likewise, the valence band In solar cells, the power conversion efficiency (PCE)  208  is the factor of merit, defined as the power produced by the solar cell divided by the power put into the cell via sunlight. The PCE can be determined through the simple formula PCE = V OC × J SC × FF where V OC is the open-circuit voltage, J SC is the short-circuit current density, and FF is the fill factor. Each of these parameters is affected differently by the properties of the materials used in the device. The potential maximum V OC is determined by the difference in the electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels.  209  However, other factors like carrier recombination from defects in the perovskite layer or at the interface reduce the V OC from the ideal. The J SC is dependent on the ability of the perovskite absorbing layer to absorb light and transfer the carriers to the HTL and ETL. Finally, the FF is primarily dependent on the interfaces between the perovskite layer and the ETL and HTL layers. If the physical contact of the layers or the electronic alignment between the layers is poor, the FF will suffer. With these parameters in mind, we begin by discussing the desired properties that films need to maximize each of these values. These can be thought of as the ""rules"" to making lowdimensional perovskite films which can succeed in devices. Proper measurements of these properties will be discussed along with the rules, as has been outline elsewhere.  210  After this, we outline the methods used to make the perovskite films and how each method can be used to access the desired properties. Then, we discuss the different cations used in devices with different dimensionalities to relate the effects of the spacer on the different properties of these films and devices, outlining what has been learned so far about the correlation between spacer and device performance from a film and device perspective. One of the well-known advantages of employing low-dimensional structures in perovskite films is the remarkable increase in chemical stability. 3D MAPbI 3 devices suffer significantly from their proclivity to react with moisture to form PbI 2 , MA, and HI as byproducts. This process is enhanced by the high polarity of the organic cation MA which can easily be separated from the inorganic framework.  211, 212  Along with this, degradation from light and heat as well as considerable ion migration in the 3D structures degrade the devices in real conditions.  213  While these processes can be mitigated by encapsulation and barriers,  214  producing intrinsically stable materials in films is preferred to reduce processing and production costs. All these factors should be considered when discussing the stability of perovskite films and devices. The presence of bulky more hydrophobic cations increases the overall hydrophobicity of the film. Additionally, the confinement of ion migration in two dimensions for the 2D structures give rise to an overall higher stability. Measuring film stability under light, humidity, or heat stress can be accomplished easily via X-ray diffraction (XRD) by observing the growth of the PbI 2 phase as the film decomposes.  99  Devices can be measured over time by simply taking the currentvoltage scan after different periods of time under different conditions. However, there is still a need for a consistent manner to test device stability. For instance, humidity varies greatly from location to location, which leads to drastically different responses to humidity depending on the weather. Humidity testing must be done in a controlled environment to make sure that fluctuations in humidity outside are not a factor. Furthermore, testing for light and heat should be regularly performed as well. Only by considering all these factors in a systematic manner can different methods and materials be compared. In fact, recently a consensus statement was issued, suggesting a systematic means to report device efficiency based on the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols.  215  4.1.2. Crystallinity. It is important to consider crystallinity when evaluating a film's ability to transport carriers. Crystallinity is based on the crystallites in the film, where a crystallite is a repeating unit of a chemical structure. Crystallinity is commonly measured using XRD by finding the full-width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the peaks in the pattern. With decreasing crystallite size, the fwhm will increase; however, other factors such as strain, stacking faults, and instrumental broadening can also influence the fwhm, so this is not a perfect method to approximate crystallite size but can be used as a general guide to the relative size of the crystallites when comparing films. 4.1.3. Morphology. Like the crystallinity, morphology is important when considering charge carrier transport. The morphology of a film is its internal and external structure based on the grain size and shape. In the perovskite literature, the term ""grain"" is loosely defined as a region on a film separated by a change in the topography of the film such as a crack. This is commonly quantified by scanning-electron microscopy (SEM)  216  or atomic-force microscopy (AFM). However, smaller cracks often exist within these grains, making the exact definition of ""grain"" difficult. Here, we define grain as the smallest unit able to be seen by SEM or AFM. It should be acknowledged that the techniques used to define grains often only use images from the surface of the film, giving an incomplete picture of the film morphology. Cross-sectional SEM can elucidate the full morphology of the film, showing how deep the grains grow, which is important when considering electron transport for devices. Related to the grains, the roughness of the films should be considered when discussing morphology. When the roughness is large, the presence of pin holes, defined as areas where there is no film coverage, become a possibility, leading to poor device performance. 4.1.4. Orientation. Achieving the correct orientation of a 2D perovskite film on the substrate is crucial for the success of device performance. This is the main difference concerning film deposition between 2D and 3D perovskites where in the latter crystalline grain orientation is much less of a critical issue. For 2D materials, the layers all orient in the same direction within each grain making the grains anisotropic. The orientation of the grains themselves thus leads to a distinct orientation of the layers with regard to the substrate, commonly defined as the ""texture"" of the film. A highly textured film could have grains with layers all parallel to the substrate or all perpendicular to the substrate while an untextured film has grains with layers oriented at all angles regarding the substrate. This is important because of the highly anisotropic nature of the 2D perovskites, which experience both quantum and dielectric confinement perpendicular to the layers. Because of these confinement effects, the charges cannot go from one layer to another, resulting in several orders of magnitude difference in conductivity measured perpendicular and parallel to the layers.  35  For devices such as solar cells, carriers must be able to separate and reach the top and bottom of the film to create current, shown in Figure  13a . If the layers are parallel to the substrate, the charges can only recombine, and no current is produced (Figure  13b ). On the other hand, devices like transistors require charge to run parallel to the substrate and may benefit from the perovskite layers being parallel to substrate. XRD can be used to roughly define the orientation of the films. Characteristic peaks below 2θ = 14°( for diffractometers with a Cu source) are indicative of grains with the 2D layers parallel to the substrate. On the other hand, characteristic peaks at ∼14°and ∼28°(for lead-iodide based structures) are from the repeating unit of one octahedra in line with the layers and seen when the layers are perpendicular to the substrate. A better technique to measure orientation is grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering (GIWAXS). Here, the X-rays irradiate the sample at a very low angle, resulting in complete reflection from the film. The scattering is measured with a 2D detector.  217, 218  The same peaks that would appear in a 1D XRD pattern and peaks that would not normally be seen due to the orientation of the 2D layers are seen in the 2D GIWAXS pattern.  23  The d-spacing of the various crystallographic planes will determine the position of the peaks along the radial axis q. Then, depending on the orientation of the crystallographic hkl planes in the chemical structure with relation to the substrate, the spot wills appear at a certain points along the azimuthal angle χ. The orientation of the perovskite layers will affect the orientation of all crystallographic planes, leading to distinct patterns depending on the orientation of the layers. If the orientation is random, the spots will be spread out along all χ, leading to rings. Comparing simulated GIWAXS patterns to experimental data allows the orientations in the film to be determined. 4.1.5. Composition. The chemical makeup of the film has become more and more relevant to low-dimensional perovskite films because of the phase inhomogeneity of the films. Generally, mixtures of different n values are seen within the films, with high-n phases first crystallizing at the surface followed by low-n phases on the bottom of the film, leading to the multiple quantum well film structure in Figure  13c .  220  Along with 2D lead halide perovskite films, this mechanism has also been seen in 2D tin halide perovskite films with a large variety of n values,  221  meaning that this mechanism is generalizable to a variety of systems. Thus, one should always systematically study the composition of a novel film. Several techniques have been used to identify the composition. XRD can give evidence of the film composition by the characteristic low-angle peaks below 2θ = 14°. As discussed above, the layers are generally oriented perpendicular to the substrate, so the X-ray can only detect the two characteristic peaks at ∼14°and 28°, which is unhelpful to elucidate the composition. In fact, the diffraction patterns for oriented MAPbI 3 and perpendicularly oriented 2D perovskites with most spacers and n values are nearly identical. Sometimes, low-angle peaks can be seen in films which can allow for phase identification by matching the experimental data to a pattern simulated from a structure solved via single-crystal XRD. If the single-crystal has not been solved for, having a harmonic pattern of low-angle peaks does imply the presence of a 2D phase, though not conclusively. Alternatively, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) can sometimes be used to detect different phases in the film visually, though this technique cannot measure the bulk film. A simple way to show the different phases that exist is static absorption spectroscopy measurements, which show the positions of the excitonic peaks, which can be correlated to the expected positions for different phases based on the bandgap of single crystals though it cannot always be assumed that these peaks must be correlated to n = 1, 2, 3, etc. To make such a conclusion, phase-pure materials must be made and measured to determine the location of the peaks in the spectrum, usually in the form of crystals, as phase purity when n > 2 is difficult to achieve in films.  222  Then, the peaks of the phase-pure materials and the peaks in the film can be correlated, though, even then, the presence of other phases with similar band gaps cannot be totally ruled out. Photoluminescence (PL) can also be used to identify different phases, as different quantum well thicknesses for different n values give discrete PL emission energies. The surface of the films (at the film/air interface) often gives a low-energy emission indicative of n > 7 while the bottom (at the film/ substrate interface) gives higher-energy emissions of n = 1-4, depending on the film composition and processing. This is illustrated by the depth-dependent PL of the film seen in Figure  13d .  219  However, the excitons are quickly transferred to higher n phases, reducing PL from the low-n values. Transientabsorption (TA) spectroscopy can be used to better track these different phases, as it tracks the excitons as they transfer from phase to phase, making it one of the most effective ways to observe film composition.  223  No matter which method is used, to conclusively identify the composition in the film, the properties of the phase-pure materials must be known. While certain properties such as bandgap are fairly consistent for the same layer thickness using different spacers, notable exceptions do exist.  89  This also applies to diffraction-and scattering-based analysis, which require simulations based on single-crystal XRD to match data in the films to the proper phase. Thus, we emphasize the need for crystallographic understanding before positing chemistry-based explanations for device performance. 4.1.6. Interactions between Phases. Films with multiple phases have been shown to be particularly advantageous for LEDs, as the carriers are able to transfer quickly from low-n to high-n phases in a sort of ""energy funnel,"" allowing for the carriers to travel easily through the film.  224  This is shown schematically in Figure  17a  and has also been described as a multiple quantum well structure (MQW). Understanding how these phases interact in the films has become increasingly important in optimizing both LEDs and solar cells. TA spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) also give indications as to how quickly carriers will transfer from phase-to-phase. These processes have not been fully elucidated yet, as the composition in films with n > 3 is highly complex, making systematic studies of the interactions between different phases difficult to achieve. 
 Thin Film Deposition Methods Next, we discuss the methods that have been developed to fabricate the films with desired properties as illustrated above. While these are the most common methods, there are many more methods used for fabrication of 3D devices which may be utilized for 2D devices as well in the future.  225  Further details on each of these methods have been reviewed previously.  226  4.2.1. One-Step. The simplest method to fabricate films is a one-step deposition, shown in Figure  14a . To spin-coat a thin film of perovskite, the components of the structure are dissolved in a solvent, generally an organic solvent such as γbutyrolactone (GBL), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). While GBL cannot coordinate strongly with the perovskite in solution, DMF and DMSO can, which affects the kinetics of the crystallization of the film. These solvents have also been shown to create 1D solvated intermediates, which can lead to an undesired needle-like morphology.  220, [227] [228] [229]  In particular, DMSO has been shown to strongly coordinate to PbI 2 and slow down crystallization.  230  One can either directly dissolve the phase-pure crystals synthesized using the methods above or dissolve the individual components, PbI 2 , the A-site cation halide, and the spacer halide. Dissolution can be completed in minutes to hours depending on the concentration, composition, and temperature of the solution. Once dissolved, the solution is injected onto the substrate which is sitting on the spin-coater. If needed, the solution can also be filtered before injection. Spinning then commences, often for 30 to 60 s at a rate of thousands of rpm. Depending on composition and concentration, crystallization may commence on the spin-coater, leading to a color change from clear to colored for most materials.  100  After this, it is commonplace to anneal the film to remove residual solvent and complete crystallization. However, another method, the gas-pump method, involves removing solvent in a vacuum chamber immediately after deposition.  231  Even for the relatively simple one-step method, there are already many different parameters to consider: perovskite composition, solvent choice, dissolution time, concentration, spin time, spin rate, annealing time, and annealing temperature, among others, making transparency in reporting these parameters key to reproducibility. This process can be further optimized by using additives to the precursor solution before spin-coating, such as ammonium salts and hydrohalic acids,  232  but choosing the proper additive is highly dependent on the processing and composition of the film. 4.2.2. Hotcasting. Like the one-step method, hotcasting (Figure  14b ) involves depositing a solution of perovskite precursor directly onto the substrate. However, in this case, the substrate is hot enough to accelerate crystallization during spin-coating. This process has been shown to give large grain size for MAPbI 3  233  and was adopted to 2D (BA) 2 (MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 to give films with the layers highly perpendicular to the substrate,  234  giving highly efficient devices. The drawback to this technique is that the films are often not homogeneous, giving thinner regions in the center of the films. It is also difficult to reproduce given that the process must happen very quickly using a hot substrate, allowing for a greater amount of human error than room-temperature spin coating. However, further optimization and automation could prove to improve homogeneity and remove human error, making this a relevant lab-scale process for evaluating new materials and techniques. 4.2.3. Antisolvent. One commonly used technique is the so-called antisolvent method, shown in Figure  14c .  230  In this method, the perovskite precursor solution contains a polar solvent such as DMSO that is able to coordinate with lead iodide in solution. Generally, a mixture of DMF or GBL and DMSO is used. As mentioned above for one-step method, DMSO is known to coordinate with PbI 2 , which is essential for this method. This solution is then deposited on a substrate for spin coating. During spinning, an antisolvent is deposited onto the center of the film, rapidly removing the solvent and leaving a pinhole-free film composed of a solvated intermediate. Several antisolvents can be used, as long as they do not dissolve the perovskite phase. Commonly used antisolvents include toluene, chlorobenzene, and diethyl ether. The choice of antisolvent strongly affects the crystallization process; for example, chlorobenzene has been shown to lead directly to MAPbI 3 without the intermediate phase produced with other antisolvents.  235  Furthermore, the timing of this step is very important and varies depending on the specific conditions being used. However, in general, dropping of the antisolvent too early leads to the antisolvent being washed away with the precursor solution, and dropping too late into the process leads to large pinholes, presumably from the prolonged growth of the solvate intermediates. Annealing then converts this to a dense and uniform perovskite film, advantageous for device applications. This process has been reviewed in detail recently by Ghosh et al.  236  4.2.4. Dry Methods. In addition to methods that rely on a solvent, other methods have been developed as well. Being able to avoid toxic solvents has been of interest to the perovskite community, leading to developments of new methods to make 3D MAPbI 3 without solvent such as thermal evaporation,  237  gas-solid crystallization,  238  and chemical vapor deposition (CVD).  239  Some of these methods have also been applied to 2D perovskites, though to a lesser extent. Thermal deposition has been achieved using a single source apparatus to deposit ( B A ) 2 ( M A ) 3 P b 4 I 1 3 2 4 0 a n d m i x e d d i m e n s i o n a l ""(BA) 2 Cs n-1 Pb n Br 3n+1 ,""  241  and CVD has been used to form CsPbX 3 (X = Cl, Br, I) nanoplatelets.  242  However, few further studies have been done using these methods to form molecularly 2D perovskite films. 4.2.5. Additives. Any of the mentioned fabrication methods can be modified and likely improved by the use of additives to the precursor solution. The use of additives in 3D and 2D perovskites has been reviewed extensively elsewhere.  28, 243, 244  For both 2D and 3D perovskites, additives can lead to grain boundary passivation, interface modification, and improved morphology, crystallinity, and stabilization, among other effects. In 2D perovskites, the effect of additives on orientation and n phase distribution are also highly important. Common additives include salts with cations such as ammonium (NH 4 + ), FA + , MA + , Cs + , or other metal and ammonium cations. The anions include Cl -, I -, Br -, and thiocyanate (SCN -), which have been shown to improve orientation and crystallinity for certain systems.  128, [245] [246] [247]  However, it should be noted that synergistic effects of multiple additives may be needed to take advantage of these effects.  245  Interestingly, these additives may improve the orientation by suppressing the formation of solvate intermediates.  248  Finding the correct additive or additives for each system and fabrication process is crucial to maximizing efficiency. In the case of addtives certain caveats need to be kept in mind. Additives are in fact reagents added into the precursor solutions or post film deposition and as a consequence they can engage in reactions with the perovskite and potentially generate in situ certain amounts of second phases. Elucidating and understanding these extra phases and their effects on film properties is a challenging task and today it has received very little attention, as the emphasis has been to just observe performance increases regardless of how they occur. 
 THIN FILM CASE STUDIES USING DIFFERENT PEROVSKITE LAYER ARCHITECTURES AND SPACER CATIONS Now that the desired properties of the 2D perovskite films and the methods used to fabricate them have been discussed, we turn our attention to the different low-dimensional perovskite layer architectures in the films. Here, we are defining film architecture as it relates only to the orientation of the perovskite layer [Pb n I 3n+1 ], not to be confused with the entire device architecture, which includes many other layers such as the electrodes, ETL, or HTL. This section is separated into the three primary architectures used for reduced dimensional perovskites films: 2D films based on stoichiometries for n < 8, mixed dimensionality films where multiple phases with different dimensionalities are all present throughout the film, and heterostructures in which a low-dimensional perovskite layer is selectively deposited on an already-existing 3D perovskite. These three architectures are illustrated in Figure  15 . For each of these three architectures, many different organic cations have been used as spacers, from the most common BA and PEA to complex spacers such as guaninium  249  and many more,  [250] [251] [252] [253] [254] [255] [256] [257] [258] [259]  though the structures produced by many of these cations have not been resolved crystallographically, making correlations between structural properties and film properties difficult. Here, we outline several examples of different spacers used in different architectures and relate what is known about the phases that are stabilized by these spacers to the film properties and device performance. 
 2D Films We begin with a discussion of what we call ""2D films,"" designated as films in which the targeted stoichiometry (based on the precursor solution) gives an n value less than 8. We have chosen this value because the highest n value studied with single crystal X-ray crystallography has been n = 7.  34, 151  Because the crystalline phases in the film deposit quickly depending on the deposition method, the final material in the film is highly unlikely to be phase pure especially when the targeted n is greater than 2, as multiple phases with different n values will crystallize under kinetic control during film formation. Because of the multitude of conditions used in a wide variety of laboratories, the phase composition of the films can vary from indeed being a single phase containing only one homologous member to containing several homologous members. This is why it is critical for researchers to report as broad a characterization of these films as possible. For simplicity, we will define the composition of the films by the nominal stoichiometry that is used in the precursor solution to make the film. Here, we outline some examples of spacers used in 2D films and devices along with the methods used to make the films and highlight the spacers' unique influence on film properties and device efficiency. Tables  9  and 10  summarize a selected list of monoammonium and diammonium spacers, respectively, that have been used in solar cells with relevant device parameters. 5.1.1. 2D Phases with Monoammonium Cations. 5.1.1.1. Alkylammonium Cations. The BA spacer was the first alkylammonium spacer used in a 2D perovskite solar cell  100  and has also been utilized in LEDs.  [260] [261] [262]  Table  9a  shows a couple examples of early 2D devices using BA as the spacer in solar cells, including with tin as the metal.  64  Mixtures of tin and lead have also been used in solar cells. One report shows a PCE of 5.96% (with large hysteresis) using (BA) 2 (MA) 3 Pb 3 SnI 13 . Interestingly, GIWAXS analysis shows a narrower texture with increasing tin concentration, implying that films using 2D tin perovskites have a greater degree of preferred orientation compared to their lead equivalents.  263  While BA remains one of the most commonly used spacers in film and device studies, other alkylammonium spacers derived from BA have been used to improve upon the original BA spacer. When choosing a new alkylammonium spacer for highefficiency devices, three of the more common derivations of the BA spacer have been considered, outlined in Figure  16 . (1)  A smaller carbon-chain length can be utilized to potentially give a narrower interlayer spacing, leading to a larger inorganic volume ratio in the film, which increases light absorption in solar cells.  35  (2) Conversely, increasing spacer length has shown some improvements in solar cell stability.  36  (3) Conjugated spacers or spacers with heteroatom substitutions can have a higher dielectric constant which is thought to facilitate charge transport across layers.  264  One short spacer is isobutylammonium (IBA), which is isomeric to BA, but with a more compact branched structure. We have recently characterized crystals using the IBA spacer along with the longer isoamylammonium spacer up to n = 4.  265  Solar cell efficiencies for each are in Table  9b  and c . Because of its more compact shape, IBA allows for a smaller interlayer spacing and increased inorganic volume ratio, and its bulky shape leads to larger Pb-I-Pb angles, lowering the bandgap, making it a good possibility for solar cells. In fact, solar cells made from hotcasting (IBA) 2 (MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 films gave a champion efficiency of 10.63% using a C 60 electron transport layer (ETL). In this study, the IBA-based device was compared to a device using the same architecture and method with the BA spacer which led to a lower efficiency of 5.38%.  266  However, because of the hysteresis from using the C 60 layer at the bottom of the device, these values are inflated. Despite this, the results imply that the use of a small spacer leads to increased device efficiency. Further analysis of n = 4 films shows that the phase distribution and charge transfer process is also affected when using IBA instead of BA as the spacer.  223  As mentioned above, multiple phases with different n values exist in these films to form energy funnels. This allows for charge transfer from the wide-bandgap low-n phases to the narrowbandgap high-n phases, as shown in Figure  17a . The TA data in Figure  17b  show that the high-n phases, indicated by the peak at ∼760 nm, are much more apparent in the IBA-based film than the BA-based film. Because the quantum confinement in high-n phases decreases, this would lead to lower exciton binding energy and higher carrier mobility with greater charge extraction in devices, possibly explaining the higher efficiencies for IBA-based devices. Furthermore, the authors showed that the rate of charge transfer was faster for the IBA-based films which had shorter interlayer spacings, implying that the shorter spacers allowed for more efficient charge transfer. One carbon shorter than BA, propylammonium (PA) has been used as a short spacer in solar cells (Table  9d ). We have published the structures for three 2D ""step-like"" structures with the general formula (PA) 2m+4 (MA) m-2 Pb 2m+1 I 7m+4 (m = 2, 3, 4) Table  9 . continued and two 2D RP structures with the general formula (PA) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 (n = 3, 4).  35  Notably, RP ""n = 1,"" ""2,"" and ""5"" were unable to form with a traditional synthesis, though it has been suggested that certain conditions allow ""n = 1"" to form in films.  267  Hotcasting with solvent engineering has been primarily used when studying films with PA. Solvent engineering involves simply tuning the solvent mixture with two or more solvents, in this case DMF and DMSO. Using either DMF or DMF:DMSO mixed solvents has given highly oriented films for n = 3,  35  4,  268  and ""5"" 269 films, particularly with the solvent mixture. TA spectroscopy has also detected a high degree of 3D character in the PA films when compared to the BA equivalents, implying that shorter spacers favor phase distributions with high-n phases, as was the case with the IBA spacer above.  268  Despite this advantage, it is unclear if the parasitic ""step-like"" structures are present in these films or if  such structures are common among short spacers, which would be problematic for device performance. Devices have been fabricated using the same methods with the stoichiometry for n = 3,  35  4,  271  and ""5.""  269  The latter ""n = 5"" case gave a PCE of about 10%, nearly equivalent to the PCE achieved under the same conditions but with (BA) 2 (MA) 4 Pb 5 I 16 .  33, 272  Compared to (BA) 2 (MA) 4 Pb 5 I 16 made with the same method, the efficiencies are nearly equivalent, though the J SC is much higher for ""(PA) 2 (MA) 4 Pb 5 I 16 "" and the FF is higher for (BA) 2 (MA) 4 Pb 5 I 16 , suggesting that, while PA allows for more  current, possibly due to more light absorption, the interface is not as ideal as when using BA. While shorter spacers have potential for greater light absorption since inorganic component of the 2D perovskite is mainly responsible for light absorption, longer spacers may still be beneficial in terms of stability. Films made from the longer pentylammonium and hexylammonium cations have shown improved stability under heat, light, and ambient conditions compared to MAPbI 3 films.  36  Contact angle measurements with water droplets in Figure  17c  clearly show increased hydrophobicity of the films with increasing spacer length. The stability was tested on films with the stoichiometry for n = 4, and both films made from the hotcasting and onestep methods were analyzed. Several conditions were tested as well: 100 °C with 50% relative humidity, ambient light with 50% relative humidity, 1 sun illumination with 50% relative humidity, no light with 50% relative humidity, encapsulated at 100 °C, and encapsulated with 1 sun illumination. In general, the pentylammonium spacer provided the greatest stability for each deposition method and each condition tested. Except for films kept at 100 °C with 50% relative humidity, the stability trend for all conditions is pentylammonium > butylammonium > hexylammonium. For the films under heat and humidity, the trend is pentylammonium > hexylammonium > butylammonium. In either case, the stability is not directly correlated to the spacer length, meaning that the spacer length does not directly affect the stability. Other factors such as final film composition, orientation, and thickness must also be considered, highlighting the complexity of correlating spacer to stability. Films using tin as the metal have also been fabricated with the longer spacers octylammonium and dodecyl-ammonium, showing that shorter chains lead to perpendicular layer orientation for the tin system.  273  The other strategy used to increase efficiency involves alkylammonium spacers with higher dielectric constants (Table  9e -g). For example, conjugated spacers may lead to better charge transport from layer to layer. BA is a completely saturated carbon chain with only single C-C bonds, but replacing the C-C tail with a double or triple bond results in 3-buten-1-ammonium (BEA) or 3-butyn-1-ammonium (BYA), respectively. This gives a series of three cations with similar lengths and different degrees of conjugation, which were incorporated into films and devices via hotcasting using the stoichiometry for n = 4.  270  Shown in Figure  17d , BEA gave the highest efficiency of 16.1% primarily from increased J SC attributed both to the reduced tunneling barrier for conjugated spacers and the more crystalline films leading to lower leakage and fewer defects. Using the 2-(methylthio)ethylammonium spacer has also led to potential for cross-layer interactions via sulfur atoms in the interlayer spacer, as suggested by DFT calculations, yielding a remarkable efficiency of over 18% for a stoichiometrically ""n = 5"" film.  274  Further studies on single crystals of all these materials will help to understand these processes by isolating a single phase and ruling out other variables present only in films. 5.1.1.2. Aromatic Cations. Like the conjugated BEA and BYA spacers discussed above, aromatic spacers are commonly used to attempt to reduce dielectric confinement to improve efficiencies. Phenylethylammonium (PEA) was the first spacer used in a 2D halide perovskite solar cell  99  and LED.  275  Solar cells using this cation have benefitted from the addition of salts with the ammonium cation NH 4 + (Table  9h ). Using ammonium thiocyanate (NH 4 SCN) gives devices using the stoichiometry for ""(PEA) 2 (MA) 4 Pb 5 I 16 "" with efficiencies over 11%, though 2 mol equiv of NH 4 SCN are needed to achieve this efficiency.  246  By using a combination of NH 4 SCN and ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl), an even higher efficiency of 14.1% is achieved with only 0.2 equiv of total ammonium additives using the same composition and device architecture.  276  LEDs have benefitted from the naturally formed multiple quantum well structure in both lead  224  and tin-based perovskites.  277  The thickest layer for any aromatic spacer characterized by SCXRD is n = 3.  99, 128  Thus, the chemical understanding of these spacers is lagging behind that of the alkylamines. Bulky spacers such as the recently reported 1-naphthalenem e t h y l a m m o n i u m ( N p M A ) a n d 9 -a n t h r a c e n emethylammonium (AnMA)  278  show potential for improved solar cell performance (Table  9 (j,k)).  279  The presence of low-n phases is strongly suggested in ""n = 4"" films using the NpMA spacer. HRTEM shows lines of atoms indicative of plates oriented perpendicularly to the substrate, and TA spectroscopy shows bleaches with the energy characteristic of low-n phases. Furthermore, XRD of n = 1 and n = 2 films shows low angle peaks with harmonicity. However, separate DFT studies have shown that, compared to those using phenylmethylammonium, n = 1 RP phases using 1-naphthalenemethylammonium have a higher formation energy, implying that the bulkier the spacer, the less stable the RP phases.  280  While the naphthalene spacer still appears to form well-defined quantum wells, the bulkier AnMA spacer shows greater 3D character via TA spectroscopy, and the n = 1 film does not clearly show harmonic peaks. Because the naphthalene spacer can more readily stabilize multiple quantum wells, it delivers a higher performance. Furthermore, bleach formation time of the 3D phase is more rapid when using the NpMA than it is for the AnMA spacer (6.56 ps vs 10.17 ps), further showing the advantage of the distinctly defined multiple quantum well structure when using NpMA. Additionally, the NpMA spacer has shown great use in LEDs with ""n < 3"" films, which shown a quantum well structure despite the low n value.  281, 282  Characterization of larger n values for such bulky spacers will help to determine which spacers have the potential to stabilize 2D phases in the films and which do not. Dielectric confinement can be potentially further modulated by using spacers substituted with heteroatoms (Table  9 (l-n)); Figure  16 ). Devices made with the precursor stoichiometry for ""n = 5"" using 4-fluorophenylethylammonium (4FPEA) have shown improved efficiencies compared to using the unsubstituted PEA.  122, 283  In particular, a one-step method with an ammonium thiocyanate (NH 4 SCN) additive gave an impressive efficiency of 17.34%.  264  These devices seemed to benefit from a change in phase distribution. Looking at the TA data in Figure  18a , compared to PEA-based films, the 4FPEA-based films have stronger MAPbI 3 and n = 2 bleaches. The enhanced MAPbI 3 bleach is reminiscent of the films made with short spacers and could help charge transfer. Additionally, as shown in Figure  18b , DFT calculations suggest that the fluorinated spacers have substantially higher dipole moments which is backed up by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) which shows an increase of surface potential from 91.28 mV for PEAbased films to 224.36 mV for 4FPEA-based films. This could allow for greater carrier mobility. In fact, the electron mobility remained unchanged, the hole mobility increased by an order of magnitude, giving credence to this hypothesis. Solid state mixtures using the spacers PEA and perfluorophenethylammonium (F5-PEA) have been incorporated into films using a one-step method with no additives and have shown to give the greatest efficiency and stability when a 1:1 ratio of these phase is used, as shown in Figure  18c .  124  The texture (defined as the degree to which the grains in the film are oriented in the same direction) lessens with increasing 4FPEA (i.e., the orientation of the grains goes from perpendicular to random) while the morphology becomes less favorable for increasing PEA, leading to an optimum film structure when a 1:1 ratio is used. Thus, using fluorine-substituted spacers affects phase distribution, dipole moment (and thus exciton binding energy and carrier mobility), chemical stability, orientation, and morphology, which demonstrates the complexity of the effects of changing the spacer. Other substituted spacers can also be considered such as methoxyphenyletheylammonium  283  (Table  9m ) or other halogenated spacers. Earlier, we discussed how the halogen atoms on the cation and the MX 6 inorganic framework can interact to change the unit cell displacement and cation configuration. However, as mentioned above, the spacers also play a key role in film-specific properties. For example, spacers using the larger bromine (4-bromophenylethylammonium, 4BrPEA) and chlorine (4-chlorophenylethylammonium, 4ClPEA) atoms instead of fluorine leads to differences in the orientation of the films, with the films using 4BrPEA and 4ClPEA giving some grains oriented parallel to the substrate.  284  This films also show lower electron mobility compared to those with 4FPEA, reducing device performance. Heteroatoms can also substitute for one of the carbon atoms in the conjugated ring, such as the case for the sulfurcontaining thiophenes (Table  9o -q). In the previous synthesis section, we discussed the ability of the thiophene spacers to form Type II quantum wells. Here, we discuss their effects on film composition and device performance. Thiophenemethylammonium (2TMA) has been used as a spacer, giving (2TMA) 2 (MA) 2 Pb 3 I 10 , which was solved crystallographically and incorporated into a solar cell.  128  This material was deposited using the antisolvent method, which leads to rapid crystallization. Remarkably, by adding additional MACl, the orientation of the layers is still highly perpendicular to the substrate despite the rapid crystallization during the antisolvent method. Understanding whether this effect is because of the extra Cl -, the crystallization rate, or the spacer itself would be very helpful to develop alternative methods for crystalline and oriented films. Either way, a PCE of 15.42% was achieved and remains one of the highest efficiencies for an RP n = 3 solar cell. Later, a ""(2TMA) 2 (FA) 4 Pb 5 I 16 "" solar cell using a 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzylammonium iodide additive in a isopropanol antisolvent yielded a remarkable efficiency over 1 9%.  2 8 5  Anot her thiophene spacer, thiopheneethylammonium  286  was also used to achieve a similar PCE with n = 3 stoichiometry using the hot-casting method with a carefully chosen solvent mixture of 4:1 DMF:toluene and an 8 vol% HI additive.  287  In this study, the phase compositions using different solvent mixtures were analyzed. While all conditions saw bleaches for the n = 2 and n = 3 phases present, the N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc):toluene solvent mixture (with and without HI) was the only one to show a bleach for MAPbI 3 and had more phases with n > 3 present in the film when compared to films made with a DMAc:DMSO solvent mixture. Furthermore, the bleaching time constants when using DMAc:toluene were shorter than the other mixtures. Once again, the phase distribution plays a pivotal role in the charge carrier dynamics for the films, even when the same spacer is used. In this case, all films had low-n phases, but the film with faster charge transfer (and better solar cell efficiency) had both 2D and 3D character. Meanwhile, the DMAc:DMSO mixture here had mostly 2D character. Along with this, we discussed the 9-anthracenemethylammonium (AnMA) spacer above which gave films with mainly 3D character, resulting in slower charge transfer than films made with the 1-naphthalenemethylammonium (NpMA) spacer, which had both 2D and 3D phases.  279  Thus, this phase distribution appears to be a common denominator for high-performance devices. 5.1.1.3. Alternating Cations in the Interlayer Space Phases. Guanidinium (GA) has been the only cation studied in films composed of the ACI phase (Table  9r ). The first device using (GA)(MA) 3 Pb 3 I 10 gave an efficiency of 7.26% with the antisolvent method and the FTO/PEDOT:PSS/ (GA)(MA) 3 Pb 3 I 10 /PCBM/Al architecture.  90  However, by simply using a new architecture -FTO/c-TiO 2 /(GA)-(MA) 3 Pb 3 I 10 /Spiro-OMeTAD/Au-the efficiency nearly doubled, and the addition of an MACl additive allowed the efficiency to exceed 18% when accounting for hysteresis.  288  Other methods such as hotcasting and the one-step method have only seen efficiencies at about 13-14% for each.  289  Like other small spacers, GA can also stabilize other structures such as the ⟨110⟩-oriented (GA) 2 PbI 4 phase  132  which may affect the film formation mechanism. TA spectroscopy has also shown that multiple phases, likely n = 1, 2, and 3 and 3D phases are present in these films and act as energy funnels as in other 2D perovskite films.  289  5.1.2. 2D Phases with Diammonium Cations. 5.1.2.1. Alkyldiammonium Cations. Diammonium cations are attractive because they can coordinate to both layers, removing the van der Waals gap. By coordinating to both layers, these structures are more robust, potentially improving thermal stability.  39  An early report used several cations in devices using the n = 1 materials,  291  which was followed by incorporation of multilayered structures in films and devices. Multilayered structures are known only for the longer cations with at least four carbons.  39  While short cations such as propyldiammonium (PdA)  271, 292  have been used in films and have shown high efficiencies of over 14% in solar cell devices (Table  10a ), it is not clear if these are truly ""2D films,"" as there is no proof that PdA can stabilize 2D iodide perovskites. If PdA cannot form such a structure, it may play a different role in the final film such as a passivator as interfaces. Only with full characterization can we understand this. Even so, the devices show very high efficiency and stability, with the hotcasted ""(PdA)(MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 "" device showing great stability in ambient conditions, heat, light, and humidity. The crystal structures for several alkyldiammonium structures were discussed in the synthesis part of this report. The n = 3 crystals were also made into films using a one-step method with an HI additive to test their stability in future device applications.  39  A different study also fabricated films using an ""n = 5"" stoichiometry with several of these spacers using a one-step method with an ionic liquid solvent.  293  Interestingly, the two methods and n values result in different textures for the films, which is quantified by the GIWAXS images in Figure  19 . For the n = 3 films, GIWAXS reveals that a greater degree of texture (i.e., more grains aligned in the same direction) is found when using longer cations. In fact, while the films from butyldiammonium (BdA) and hexyldiammonium (HdA) show almost no preferred orientation as indicated by the rings in the GIWAXS patterns, the films from octyldiammonium (OdA) and nonyldiammonium (NdA) are highly oriented with the layers perpendicular to the substrate as indicated by the sharp peaks. It should be mentioned that NdA-based films do have some grains orientated with the layers parallel to the substrate, but no rings are seen in the GIWAXS pattern. This indicates that the 2D layers in the grains are either oriented parallel or perpendicular to the substrate with none oriented at other diagonal angles to the substrate Contrarily, the ""n = 5"" films showed sharp Bragg peaks in the GIWAXS patterns for all alkydiammonium cations from three (PdA) to six (HdA) carbons in length when using a one-step method with an ionic liquid solvent. Additionally, the PdA-based film was thge most textured, while the HdA-based film was the least, indicating that these trends are dependent on the n value and deposition method. Additionally, TA spectroscopy of the ""n = 5"" films was also measured and revealed that the PdA and BdA films showed no presence on low-n phases while the pentyldiammonium (PedA) and HdA films did, indicating that longer chains lead to more low-n character in the films, which matches our earlier discussions comparing short monoammonium cations such as PA to longer cations such as BA. Alkyldiammonium-based films were also shown to have increased stability to light, heat, and humidity compared to MAPbI 3 . For the n = 3 films, the OdA-based film had the highest stability of all the alkyldiammonium-based films, with BdA and HdA having the poorest stability. Furthermore, the OdA-based film was even more stable in light than the BAbased film, both n = 3 stoichiometrically and prepared under the same conditions, showing the great stability of these materials. For the ""n = 5"" films, a similar trend was seen, the longest spacer (HdA) showing the greatest thermal stability. However, when incorporated into solar cells (Table  10b -d), the PedA spacer led to greater thermal stability, showing the complexity of stability in devices. The thermal stability for the BdA-based films has been further enhanced by using Cs + instead of MA as the A-site cations.  294  Of the ""n = 5"" films, the short BdA spacer gave the greatest efficiency of 16.38%, likely because of a complexity of factors such as perpendicular orientation, low trap state density, and less surface defects. We also note that the BdA spacer has been used to form lead-free (BdA)(FA) 2 Sn 3 I 10 which has been characterized crystallographically and been incorporated into devices to enhance both PCE and stability.  295  5.1.2.2. Cyclic Diammonium Cations. These cations are attractive for use in solar cells because some of them can form Dion-Jacobson 2D halide perovskites, and they can lead to very close terminal I-I bonds and relatively low bandgaps. Initial average efficiencies for devices based on (xAMP)(MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 (AMP = (aminomethyl)piperidinium, x = 3 or 4) were only 6.74% and 4.24% for x = 3 and 4, respectively (Table  10f ,g).  89  This was done using the antisolvent method with a small amount of HI added, which is shown to give more perpendicular orientation in films. As mentioned above, using a mixture of FA and MA as the A-site cation leads to lower bandgaps by increasing bond angle. Additionally, the trap density has decreased with the addition of the FA cation.  152  To further tune the properties of these materials, the conjugated spacers 3AMPY and 4AMPY can be studied, which benefit from both small spacer size and larger dielectric constant. Using the same methods and architecture as for 3AMP-and 4AMP-based devices, the efficiencies for (xAMPY)(MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 (AMP = (aminomethyl)pyridinium, x = 3 or 4) are 9.20% and 5.69%, respectively (Table  10h ,i). It is interesting to note that, regarding PCE, 3AMPY > 3AMP > 4AMPY > 4AMP, indicating that substitution position, and thus spacer size, influences the device efficiency more than conjugation in this case. It seems likely that this trend is a result of better crystallinity and orientation for 3AMPY film, as well as different optical properties of the crystals, since the 3AMPY crystals show lower bandgaps and smaller interlayer distances than the 4AMPY ones. The use of 4AMP to form Dion-Jacobson phases, though without SCXRD characterization, has also seen success in improving tin-based device stability.  296, 297  Devices have also been made using other spacers whose final structures have yet to be characterized crystallographically (Table  10 (j,k)). The 4-(aminoethyl)pyridinium (4AEP) spacer is slightly longer than the 4AMPY spacer, but has given an efficiency of 11.68% for a device with ""n = 5"" when using a one-step method with NH 4 SCN as an additive, as has been done for other aromatic spacers.  298  It should be noted that the authors characterized this as though AEP was a monoammonium cation, leading to an excessive of (4AEP)I 2 in the precursor solution. This nice efficiency is attributed to the 4AEP spacer's proclivity to coordination with PbI 2 cations, evidenced by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Another perovskite using the phenylenedimethanammonium (PDMA) spacer and FA as the A-site cation, ""(PDMA)(FA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 ,"" gives an efficiency of 6.52% using a one-step method with no additives. These devices primarily suffer from a low V OC , which may be a result of poor film morphology seen by SEM.  299   
 Mixed Dimensionality and Composite Films While the 2D films benefit from additional stability and have seen efficiencies over 17%, they still lag behind the record 25.2% efficiency for 3D devices. Therefore, so-called ""mixed dimensionality""  28  films have been fabricated which have largely 3D character but incorporate small quantities of spacers which stabilize lower-dimensionality structures. These films take advantage of the superior optical properties of the 3D structures to achieve high efficiency while also taking advantage of the improved stability of the lower-dimensional films. Most of the films use spacers which stabilize 2D structures such as BA or PEA, but an unrealistic stoichiometry with a very high n value such as n = 50. As mentioned before, the highest n value to be characterized using SCXRD has been n = 7, which was only formed by very precise stochiometric control with slow crystallization. Even using these scrupulous techniques, crystals of n = 9 were unable to be grown phase pure, though they still formed as plates which indicates some form of 2D character. However, this could mean that the crystals are mostly 3D with 2D phases grown in, that they are 2D with very high n values, or that they are composed of  very unlikely to form, but instead combinations of phases including the 3D phase, are likely to grow together. In fact, there have been no substantiated claims of phases where n > 7 in films or in crystals. Thus, we emphasize that films made from a precursor stoichiometry with n > 7 must be treated differently than either 2D or 3D films. In the case of these mixed dimensionality films, several scenarios are possible. For example, mixtures of 2D phases (n ≤ 7) and 3D phases may be present. If so, TA spectroscopy can be used to show which phases are present by matching absorption peaks in the film to those of pure crystals. However, the spacing cations can also move to grain boundaries or interfaces instead of forming 2D phases. Here, no 2D phases will be seen in the TA data, nor will the XRD peaks shift, as the present phase remains 3D. While it is still unclear what phases make up these films, we discuss what has been understood about the composition of these films so far, with a summary of different phase distributions in the films shown in Figure  20 , which will be discussed further in this section. For ease of understanding, we continue providing the so-called n values to give an intuitive estimate of the quantity of spacer in the film. Tables 11-14 list the spacers used in these mixed dimensionality films organized by dimensionality: 2D/3D with monoammonium spacers, 2D/ 3D with diammonium spacers, 1D/3D, and unknown dimensionality, respectively. 5.2.1. Mixed Phases with Monoammonium Cations. 5.2.1.1. Alkylammonium Cations. As with the 2D films, mixed dimensionality films can be made with alkylammonium spacers such as BA. An early report incorporates BA into a (Cs 0.17 FA 0.83 ) 0.91 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 film using hotcasting and an  HI/HBr additive, resulting in both improved efficiency and stability (Table  11a ).  300  In this report, instead of targeting a specific stoichiometry for some high n value, the authors substituted the A-site cations for an equal molar amount of BA to give films of ""BA x (Cs 0.17 FA 0.83 ) 1-x Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 "" (x = 0.05, 0.09). This results in approximate n values of 22.2 for x = 0.09 and 40 for x = 0.05, but the precursor solution has an excess of PbX 2 compared to these n values based on the stoichiometry used in the precursor solution. It is unclear what effect, if any, preparing a precursor in this way has on the film. Either way, the x = 0.09 film gives an impressive average efficiency of 15.5% ± 1.1% with 80% of the efficiency maintained at 1005 h in ambient conditions, an improvement over the 3D (Cs 0.17 FA 0.83 ) 0.91 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 device which had an average efficiency of 15.1% ± 1.0% and 80% efficiency at 693 h. Furthermore, reducing the BA content by setting x = 0.05 gives a film more compositionally like the 3D film, with an even higher efficiency of 18.1 ± 1.5% and a champion efficiency of 20.6%. 2D-XRD analysis shows that increasing the quantity of BA gives new peaks likely from 2D phases with an unknown n value. These peaks are highly oriented, as seen in 2D films. SEM analysis further shows plates clearly perpendicular to the substrate, a good indication that a mixture of 2D and 3D phases exist. Further analysis on the films shows that the PL is slightly blue-shifted for the x = 0.09 film when compared to the pure 3D film, suggesting some form of reduced dimensionality. The shorter propylammonium (PA) cation has also been used in mixed-dimensionality devices with the stoichiometry for ""(PA) 2 (Cs 0.05 FA 0.79 MA 0.16 ) 40 Pb 41 (I 0.84 Br 0.16 ) 124 "" (""n = 41"") using the antisolvent method (Table  11b ).  305  In this case, XRD shows no low-angle peaks, but the (110) peak appears to shift to lower 2θ, indicative of unit cell expansion. The authors concluded that a new phase is present but did not determine the identity of this phase. This paper was published only days before a paper characterizing several phases using the PA cation,  35  which may be present in these films. Furthermore, while the presence of PA increased the values of the CBM and VBM, the bandgap showed negligible changes. The allylammonium (ALA) cation is the same length as the PA cation but is conjugated, with a double bond between the two terminal carbon atoms (Table  11c ). Films with the stoichiometry ""(ALA) 2 (MA) 9 Pb 10 I 31 "" (""n = 10"") were fabricated using the antisolvent method and compared to films with the same stoichiometry using BA and PEA spacers. UV-vis spectroscopy showed sharp peaks corresponding to phases with n = 3-5 for all films, but the peaks were not nearly as sharp for the ALA-based films as for the BA-and PEA-based films. Furthermore, TA spectroscopy showed almost no signs of low-n phases for ALA-based films, but low-n phases were readily apparent when using BA and PEA. The differences in these multiple quantum well structures can be seen in Figure  20a . All these data suggest that the ALA spacer favors phases with high-n values, hindering the formation of low-n values in films, similar to the PA system which shows great 3D character in the EQE spectrum even for n = 3 films.  35  The ALA-based films also showed long diffusion lengths of 633 ± 14 nm for electrons and 507 ± 11 nm for holes. In comparison, electron diffusion lengths when using BA and PEA were 224 ± 2 nm and 442 ± 22 nm, respectively, and hole diffusion lengths were 76 ± 1 nm using BA and 266 ± 13 nm using PEA. This leads to improvements in solar cell performance, with ALA giving the highest PCE of 14.4% compared to PEA (12.1%) and BA (11.5%) using the same conditions. Adding Cs + and FA into the precursor solution allows for an even greater PCE of 16.5%. While it is unclear whether the conjugation or the small size of the ALA spacer plays a bigger role in the quantum well distribution, clearly the preference for high-n values is valuable for solar cell performance in this case. However, this seems contrary to the discussion of multiple quantum well distribution discussed for 9-anthracenemethylammonium (AnMA) which suffered from its lack of 2D character.  279  The difference may be that the ALA-based films consist of only 3D phases while the AnMA-based films were mostly 3D phases, though this is mere speculation and other factors such as orientation and crystallinity need to be considered as well. Clearly, the charge transfer mechanisms are very complex and must be better understood to know exactly what composition and where the phases should be located to yield the best device. Particularly, the ideal scenario for mixed dimensionality devices will need to be distinguished from that of the 2D devices. ALA has also been used for tin-based devices, with ""n = 9"" giving efficiencies up to 9.48%.  306  Another cation, cyclohexane methylammonium (CMA), has been incorporated into a mixed dimensionality film with the stoichiometry for ""(CMA) 2 (MA) 8 Pb 9 I 28 "" (""n = 9"") to create a ""reversed-graded"" film (Table  11d ).  302  In this film, the low-n phases are located at the surface of the film and the high-n phases at the bottom by the substrate, the opposite of the other films we have described. While no crystallographic characterization has been done, strong evidence for 2D phases is provided by the XRD of a stoichiometric ""n = 1"" film which shows a set of peaks with equal 2θ spacing starting from a lowangle value, a common characteristic of 2D phases. Furthermore, the UV-vis and PL data show several highenergy peaks which suggests phases with different n values. The reverse-graded structure of this film is evidence by TA data taken from the front and the back of the film, shown in Figure  20a . When excited from the surface, the films exhibit bleaches corresponding to energies expected for n = 2, 3, and 4 along with a strong low-energy bleach associated with a high-n bleach. When excited from the back, two low-energy high-n bleaches dominated with little or no low-n-associated bleaches present, indicating that the back of the film has greater high-n character than the surface. This implies that the charges will transfer from the surface to the bottom of the film. This also has important implications for the stability of devices made from these films, as the more water-resistant 2D phase is contained at the surface of the film, which is most likely to react with humidity in the air. In fact, negligible PCE was lost even after 4600 h (70 days) in 40-70% relative humidity. 5.2.1.2. Aromatic Cations. Another early example of mixed dimensionality films used the PEA cation.  307  This and other aromatic cations used in these types of films are listed in Table  11e -h.  257, 308, 309  Films were made based on stoichiometries for 2D structures ""(PEA) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 with n ranging from 1 to 60. Films with n < 10 were fabricated from a one-step deposition while films with n ≥ 10 were made using the antisolvent method, giving efficiencies from 9.22% for n = 6 to an impressive 18.40% for n = 60. These efficiencies are on par with that for BA without the need for secondary A-site cations. Furthermore, n = 60 devices retained 74% of their efficiency over 2 weeks in humidity compared to MAPbI 3 , which retained only 4%. When looking at the different n values studied here, it is apparent that there is a trade-off between efficiency (high n) and stability (low n). To study the composition of these films, the films were scraped off the substrate to collect a powder which was measured by XRD. Interestingly, low-angle peaks are seen from n = 1 to ""n = 60."" While the exact composition is unknown, clearly these phases are some reduced dimensional structures present in the film far from the n values based on the precursor solution. Furthermore, absorption spectra show increasing bumps for low-n films which correspond to low-n phases, as expected. Along with this, a low-energy tail corresponding the MAPbI 3 forms for the higher-n films, indicating the presence of 3D structure. Along with the lead iodide series, lead bromide perovskites hold potential to be used in solar cells, particularly for the top cell of a tandem cell because of their wide bandgaps. Three aromatic phenylalkylammonium spacers with various alkylammonium tail lengths were incorporated into nominally ""n = 50"" films: benzylammonium (BZA), phenylethylammonium (PEA) and phenylpropylammonium (PPA).  309  The mixed dimensionality films showed an enlarged unit cell via XRD, which the authors suggest is from the incorporation of the spacers. While the bandgaps of the films do not change, high-energy peaks in the absorption spectra were attributed to low-n phases. While this does suggest mixed dimensionality, the exact composition of the films remains unclear. That being said, solar cells made with these films show decent efficiencies of 9.5%, 8.6%, and 7.1% for BZA, PEA, and PPA, respectively. In fact, the BZAbased film has a higher efficiency than that of the 3D film (8.9%). All devices have very high V OC , with PEA giving a V OC of 1.45 V. Furthermore, the 2D/3D devices are more stable in air, retaining 80% PCE under 1 sun illumination, 90 °C, and 50% humidity compared to 3D devices which had lost nearly all efficiency over the same period in the same conditions. Tin-based devices have benefitted greatly by the incorporation of mixed-dimensional architectures (Table  11j ). One of the earliest reports uses phenylethylammonium (PEA) as the spacer in ""(PEA) 2 (FA) 8 Sn 9 I 22 "" mixed-dimensionality solar cell devices to achieve an efficiency of 5.94%.  310  Remarkably, very little loss of efficiency is seen in the devices after 100 h in the glovebox compared to the 3D devices which completely short in ∼70 h. This was further improved by Shao, et. al to give an efficiency over 9% for stoichiometrically ""n = 25"" devices also using the PEA spacer.  311  5.2.1.3. Other Cations. The heavily fluorinated cation 3-(nonafluoro-tert-butyloxy)propylammonium (A43) has been shown to form the RP structures (A43) 2 PbI 4 and (A43) 2 (MA)Pb 2 I 7 , confirming that they can stabilize multilayered 2D structures which may be present in films (Table  11i ). This study analyzed both mixed dimensionality films and heterostructures with this cation, the latter of which will be discussed further below. In the mixed dimensionality films, no noticeable change in the XRD was noticed, though a slight peak around 550 nm was seen in the absorption, implying a 2D structure was present. By using a micro-PL setup to only analyze the very surface of the film, the same 2D phase was found, which did not appear when the bulk was measured. This implies that the 2D phase formed only at the surface and not through the entire film, possibly suggesting another reversegraded architecture. The same group later reported that other similar fluorinated cations could stabilize RP n = 1 structures and make water-repellent films, with longer alkyl chains and removal of the ester group showing the largest water droplet contact angle.  312  5.2.2. Mixed Phases with Diammonium Cations. 5.2.2.1. Cyclic Diammonium Cations. The use of diammo-  Recently, the use of 3-aminomethylpiperidinium (3AMP) incorporated into the 3D (MA) 0.5 (FA) 0.5 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 gave an impressive efficiency over 20% and a very low bandgap of 1.27 eV, which can be useful in tandem solar cells.  314  One study uses the previously mentioned phenylenedimethanammonium (PDMA) cation as a spacer in films with the stoichiometry for ""n = 10.""  315  A film made with the precursor stoichiometry for ""n = 1"" does show a low-dimensional phase with a high-energy PL emission, though no crystallographic characterization has been done to prove what phase this is.  316  Devices made with this cation showed a nice PCE of 15.6% and improved stability in light and humidity when compared to standard MAPbI 3based devices. 5.2.2.2. ⟨110⟩ Phases. Beyond the ⟨100⟩ phases commonly discussed, cations which stabilize the ⟨110⟩ phase can be used in mixed dimensionality films (Table  12f ). However, it is rare to stabilize multilayered ⟨110⟩ phases, with only one known example,  175  meaning that mixtures of these phases with a 3D phase should be treating differently. This is exemplified by a study of mixed dimensionality films using the cation (ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylammonium) (EDBE), known to stabilize a ⟨110⟩ phase.  82, 303  In this study, mixed dimensional films were made with the stoichiometry ""(EDBEP-bI 4 ) x (MAPbI 3 ) 1-x "" (x = 0.01, 0.03, and 0.05), where the x values correspond to ""n = 90"", ""30"", and ""13,"" respectively. However, for all these films, the XRD shows Bragg peaks only for the (EDBE)PbI 4 and 3D phases, with no evidence for higher layer-numbers, as expected based on the challenges to make higher layer-numbers synthetically of the ⟨110⟩ phase family. The optical absorption spectra show only a single highenergy peak corresponding to (EDBE)PbI 4 , as opposed to the previous examples which showed multiple peaks for several n values. Further evidence is provided by TA spectroscopy, where only the 3D phases show bleaches in the spectra, ruling out the possibility of a multiple quantum well structure (Figure  20b ). These films gave champion efficiencies of 21.06% for x = 0.03 (""n = 30"") with remarkable stability, retaining 90% of the efficiency after 1000 h in 65% humidity. 5.2.2.3. 1D Structures. Some cations do not stabilize 2D perovskite structures but instead stabilize 1D structures. One such example is with the dication benzyldiammonium (BDA) (Table  13a ). While this cation is 2+ with an aromatic ring similar to the 3AMPY and 4AMPY cations, it instead stabilizes the (BDA)PbI 4 structure consisting of 1D chains of lead iodide octahedra connected at the edges as discussed earlier in the crystal structure part.  304  This spacer was incorporated into films with the stoichiometry ""(BDA)(MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 "" (""n = 1-4""). We previously described materials with such low n values as 2D films, but here represents a new case to be considered. When attempting to synthesize crystals of ""n = 1-4,"" only the 1D (BDA)PbI 4 •2H 2 O and 3D MAPbI 3 formed, suggesting that higher layer-numbers could not be stabilized. While no water was used in the film fabrication process, there was still evidence of a 1D phase in the film. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) of the films showed that the films were made of the 3D phase with the 1D phase incorporated in it, not necessarily with 2D phases, as shown in Figure  20c . Thus, the n values used in the paper were only nominal, and this is a 1D/3D mixed dimensionality film. Interestingly, the absorption spectra still show multiple peaks as expected from multiple n phases. In fact, it appears from the TEM that 2D sheets of MAPbI 3 do exist in the film. However, based on the aforementioned results, this should not be treated the same way as for traditional 2D perovskites. For 2D perovskites, the quantum confinement is caused by the spacing cations. Here, the 1D quantum wires themselves separate the 2D layers, creating quantum wells which are not based on an extended 2D perovskite structure. These films also result in nice efficiencies of over 14% and improved stability with encapsulation under humidity, illumination, and heating. Another reported 1D/3D mixed dimensional film incorporates the fluorinated 2,2,2-trifluoroethylammonium (FEA) spacer (Table  13b ).  317  In the case discussed above, the FEA spacers stabilizes a 1D face-sharing structure. In this case, the stoichiometry was much closer to that of MAPbI 3 , meaning the phases present are not obvious, as the XRD patterns show peaks associated with structures other than MAPbI 3 . Either way, significant disadvantageous morphological changes such as pin holes were seen with as low as 8% FEA incorporation. However, with only 3% incorporation, a PCE of 18% was achieved, an improvement over 15.7% for MAPbI 3 . Improvements in V OC , J SC , and FF all contribute to this. Furthermore, the device with 3% FEA maintained 92% PCE after 4 months in ambient humidity, which is about 50-80% throughout the year in Lausanne, Switzerland where the study was performed. 5.2.2.4. Incorporation into 3D Structures. Very short cations such as guanidinium (GA), ethylammonium (EA), and dimethylammonium (DMA) have been used in mixed dimensional films for solar cells as well (Table  14a-c ). While incorporating these spacers into perovskite devices has given outstanding efficiencies of 21.12%,  318  13.91%,  319  and 15.02%,  308  respectively, these spacers have potential to  incorporate as an A-site cation in 2D and 3D structures, as discussed earlier for the 2D (BA) 2 (A)Pb 2 I 7 or (BA) 2 (A) 2 Pb 3 I 10 crystals. It has also been suggested that each of these cations can be incorporated into a 3D structure as a solid solution with MA, FA, or Cs + as the primary A-site cation.  268, 320  So far, we have discussed GA as a spacer in ACI perovskites. However, there is substantial evidence that, when the concentration of GA is low enough, the ACI phases are not stabilized, but instead the GA incorporates into the 3D perovskite structure as an A-site cation.  321  In fact, GA has already been used as an A-site cation in a 2D structure (mentioned in the previous section).  1 6 3  In the (GA) x (MA) 1-x PbI 3 system, no low angle peaks, indicative of 2D phases, are seen up to x = 25%, and the (2 0 2) 3D   perovskite peak shifts to lower 2θ, indicative of the expected unit cell expansion by the large GA cation. Further studies of mechanically synthesized powders and films using both GA/ MA and GA/FA mixtures shows similar results and are backed by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which shows that the GA cations rapidly rotate, as is common with the A-site cation.  322  Recently, single crystal structures of (GA) x (MA) 1-x PbI 3 have proven that GA can be incorporated into a structure with up to x = 5.6%.  323  Similar results are seen when attempting to incorporate DMA into MAPbBr 3 . 324 5.2.2.5. No Incorporation. While many ammonium cations can incorporate into the perovskite structure, it should be acknowledged than not all seem to do so (Table  14d ). A fluorinated cation, 2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl ammonium (5F-PA), has been shown to give increased device stability and carrier lifetime.  325  However, it does not show any low angle peaks in the XRD nor a shift or any high-energy peaks in the bandgap or PL. In fact, TA spectroscopy confirms that no high-energy peaks corresponding to a low-dimensional phase exist, suggesting that 5F-PA does not template low-dimensional structures but has other functions in the device, such as a grain boundary or surface passivator. Other cations are listed in Table 14(e,f) which have been used in solar cell devices but whose role is the film has not been conclusively determined. Tin-based devices have also benefitted from adding spacers that do not incorporate into the structure (Table  14 (g-j)). The complex aromatic spacers x-fluoro-phenylethylammonium (xFPEA; x = 2,3,4) have given efficiencies over 10% by improving the crystallinity, though no evidence that 2D structures form was seen, implying that the cation formed at the grain boundary instead.  326  Another highly conjugated cation, 3-phenyl-2-propen-1-ammonium (PPeA) has also given an impressive efficiency of 9.6% and 7.08% for a large-scale solar cell device.  327  Additionally, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that, when compared to a film using PEA as an addition, PPeA leads to less formation of Sn 4+ , indicating a lower propensity of the film to oxidize. In fact, when stored in an N 2 environment, the PPeA-modified device retained 92% PCE after 60 days while the 3D device retains only 12%. Additionally, the PPeA-modified device maintained 60% PCE after 10 h in 60% relative humidity and 60% PCE after 1000 h at 100 °C, compared to the 3D device which retains 0% and 20% PCE for each condition, respectively. Even more impressively, the PPeA-modified device shows selfhealing behavior after exposure to heat or light. Once back under N 2 atmosphere with no heat, the devices regained a substantial percent of the relative PCE. This effect was seen with PEA-and BA-modified films as well, but to a lesser extent. The 3D films did not show this effect, suggesting that bulkyamine modification is the key to the self-healing behavior in these tin-based devices.    
 Heterostructures Another way to utilize both the high efficiency advantages of 3D films and the long stability of low-dimensional films is to create a heterostructure architecture, in which a thin layer of low-dimensional perovskite sits on the surface of a 3D film. This can be done by a very simple process. First, a 3D film is deposited with a predetermined method and composition, generally using an excess of lead halide. Then, an ammonium (or sulfonium) halide salt is dissolved in an antisolvent (generally isopropanol, IPA) and deposited on the 3D film with the one-step method followed by annealing. This second step forms the low-dimensional film in situ by reacting with the lead-halide-rich 3D film underneath, effectively removing the excess lead halide.  328  Alternatively, the film can be dipped in the same antisolvent mixture to form the capping layer.  329  Thus, the bulk of the film has the same properties as a 3D film while the surface is capped with a layer of moisture-repellant low-dimensional perovskite, improving efficiency while keeping stability. Tables 15-17 list spacers used in heterostructure films based on dimensionality, as was done for mixed dimensionality devices, specifically: 2D/3D, 1D/3D, and unknown dimensionality. 
 2D Structures. The first study of a mixed phase perovskite heterostructure architecture used BAI and PEAI to form 2D perovskites on top of MAPbI 3 (Table  15a ).  330  In this study, no excess PbX 2 was used. Instead, the composition of the antisolvent mixture had both MAI and either BAI or PEAI. For the BAI-treated film, this led to XRD peaks corresponding to (BA) 2 (MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 on the surface. GIWAXS analysis showed that this phase oriented parallel to the substrate, potentially hindering charge transport. Compared to the 3D control device, the J SC of the BAI-modified device did decrease from 19.82 mA/cm 2 to 16.56 mA/cm 2 . However, an increase of the V OC from 0.99 to 1.08 V was also seen, which was attributed to reduced charge recombination. These trends were also consistent for the PEAI-modified film, but the FF was also increased from 70% for the 3D device to 73% for the PEAImodified device, leading to an increase in PCE from 13.61% to 14.94%. The effects of the aromatic PEA spacer will be discussed further below in the aromatics section. 5.3.1.1. Alkylammonium Cations. Another of the first spacers to be used in a heterostructure film was the small cyclopropylammonium (CA) cation (Table  15b ).  328  In this study, CA in IPA was deposited onto a ""MAPbI x Cl 3-x "" film where the concentration of CA in the IPA was varied from 5 mg/mL to 30 mg/mL. The overall properties of the film remained the same, though for the 20 and 30 mg/mL samples, a small peak corresponding to the previously characterized 79 n = 1 RP phase (CA) 2 PbI 4 was seen. For the other phases, the amount formed was too small to be seen using their diffractometer. Devices made with the concentration at 5 or 10 mg/mL showed little difference compared to the 3D control device, giving efficiencies around 13%. This indicates that the 2D capping layer has little effects on the device properties when using the CA cation. However, with increasing CA concentration, the J sc and FF decrease, particularly for the former, as the 2D capping layer hinders the charge transfer at the interface. Stability was improved, with the 10 mg/mL device maintaining 54% of its PCE after 220 h in 63% humidity, while the control device completely shorted before 60 h. With a wide variety of spacers to choose from, one simple question is: What effect, if any, does the spacer length have on device performance of a heterostructure film? Furthermore, will too long of a spacer have a deleterious effect on charge extraction by functioning as a barrier at the surface of the film? Three straight-chain alkyammonium spacers -BA (four carbons long), octylammonium (OA, eight carbons long), and dodecylammonium (DA, 12 carbons long)were chosen to investigate this effect by depositing the alkylammonium iodide on the surface of a (MA) 0.05 (FA) 0.95 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 film (Table  15c ).  331  Each of these spacers has been shown to form RP n = 1 phases.  [70] [71] [72]  The presence of low-n phases can be seen by both a small shoulder at higher energy (560 nm) in the absorption spectra corresponding to some low-n structure such as n = 2 as well as low-q diffraction spots in GIWAXS patterns, which shows low-n structures oriented parallel to the substrate. Both features are strongest for the longest spacer DA. These films also benefited from surface passivation, clear from TRPL which shown increased carrier lifetimes for the treated films, especially OAI and DAI. Furthermore, for HTL-free devices, the V OC is highly dependent on the spacer used. Without any spacer, the V OC is low at about 0.5 V, but adding BAI, OAI, and DAI raise it to about 0.7, 0.85, and 0.9 V, respectively, showing a clear trend for increasing V OC with increased spacer length (Figure  21a ), indicating that surface passivation is improved with longer spacers. Notably, the J SC is not strongly affected, indicating that the 2D passivating layer does not hinder charge transfer even with the very long DA cations. Furthermore, when an HTL layer is employed in the device architectures (Figure  21b ), the V OC is higher for all the devices, but the same trend is seen with the DA cations leading to the highest V OC of 1.13 V follow by OAI (1.12 V), BAI (1.11 V) and no spacer (1.09 V). In this case, J SC and FF are not affected significantly, leading to devices with similar efficiencies, though OAI has the highest efficiency. However, the stabilities for the devices vary greatly. After 100 h in 85% relative humidity, the DAI-treated film retained 90% PCE with the overall stability trend DAI > OAI > BAI > 3D, with the nontreated 3D film maintain only 60% PCE. The best heat stability was also when DA was used, with 80% of the PCE maintained at 65 °C after 100 h, as shown in Figure  21c . The general trend for heat stability was DAI > OAI > BAI = 3D, with the BAI-treated and nontreated 3D films only maintaining 40% of the starting PCE. 5.3.1.2. Aromatic Cations. Heterostructures using the PEA cation have been used to improve efficiencies and stabilities of lead-based and tin based devices,  332  similar to the alkylammonium spacers discussed above.  330, 333  As previously mentioned in the first study of heterostructure devices, the PEA spacer was shown to improve the PCE by increasing V OC and FF.  330  Another study elaborates on this phenomenon.  333  XRD and UV-vis spectroscopy confirm formation of 2D (PEA) 2 PbI 4 on a Cs 0.05 (MA) 0.16 (FA) 0.79 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 film (Table  15d ). To evaluate the effects of the capping layer on the electronic structure of the film, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was used to assess the work function of the films by detecting the surface potential difference. Maps of the surface potential distribution were made for both the control 3D film and the heterostructure film. For the 3D film, a lower average potential was measured when compared to the heterostructure film, corresponding to a deeper Fermi level. Furthermore, there were much greater variations in the potential distribution for the 3D film, indicating that the 2D capping layer effectively lowered the potential of the film and made it more homogeneous. This has important implications for devices because the V OC is dependent on the Fermi levels of the different layers. In fact, this lowering of the surface potential for the heterostructure film led to a better alignment with the HTL (Spiro-OMeTAD), increasing the V OC from 1.05 to 1.11 V. Furthermore, devices benefitted from an increased carrier lifetime from lower recombination rates, also improving V OC . Additionally, if the capping layer was not too thick, the current was still able to be extracted, evidenced by the unaffected J SC . Finally, the stability of these devices was also improved. After 1000 h in 60% relative humidity, devices retained 90% of the PCE. Furthermore, heating the devices at 60 °C for 100 h showed improved thermal stability of the heterostructure device, with 75% of the PCE retained. While the effects of efficiency are like that of the heterostructure devices using alkylammonium spacers, the stability using PEA as a spacer does seem to be greater. Several other aromatic spacers derived from phenylalkylammonium cations have been used to form capping layers as well. These include 4-tert-butyl-benzylammonium (tBBA), 334 phenylformamidinium (PFA),  335  phenyltrimethylammonium (PTA), 5F-PEA,  336  and 4-vinylbenzylammonium (VBA) (Table  15e -i).  337  The tBBA spacer was shown to give no low-angle peaks by XRD though XPS confirmed presence of extra carbon molecules on the surface of the film, indicative of the intercalation of tBBA on the surface.  334  The authors suggest that the material formed on the surface was amorphous, leading to the lack of low-angle peaks. Like PEA, addition of tBBA leads to better carrier extraction at the surface of the film, fewer surface defects, and higher stability when compared to the 3D control film, though tBBA has an even greater effect than PEA. This leads to highly efficient devices with a PCE of 23.4%, higher than that of the 3D device (20.1%) and of the PEA-modified device (22.7%). The stability also is greatly enhanced, with over 90% PCE maintained after 1300 h in ∼60% relative humidity, compared to 86% maintained PCE for the PEA-modified device with the same film composition in the same conditions. The previously mentioned F5-PEA spacer leads to greatly increased hydrophobicity of the film.  336  In fact, contact angle measurements with water droplets loading for 3 s increase from 38.4°for the 3D film to 95.8°for the F5-PEA-modified film. This is reflected in device stability measurements under very high relative humidity (>90%). The F5-PEA-modified film retains over 60% PCE after 70 h while the PEA-modified film retains less than 20%. As has been reported earlier, thiophene-derived spacers have led to highly efficient solar cells using the pure 2D and mixed dimensionality architectures.  128  Additionally, a series of these spacers was also employed in heterostructure devices, including the 2-thiophenemethylammonium (2TMA) spacer discussed along with 3-thiophenemethylammonium (3TMA) and 2-thiopheneethylammonium (2TEA) (Table  15j ).  338  Interestingly, the temporal stability of these devices was greatly dependent on the spacer. As shown in Figure  22b , for devices using 2TMA and 3TMA, there was substantial increase in device stability under illumination in an inert atmosphere when compared to the 3D control device. However, the device modified with 2TEA showed nearly 90% PCE was maintained after 1000 h. Even more remarkable, the PCE did not simply drop over time but began to increase over the first 400 h before slowly dropping again. To understand how this was happening, PL spectra were taken of the surface of the films over time in light to understand how the 2D/3D interface evolved (Figure  22a ). For the films with 2TMA and 3-TMA, the high-energy emissions corresponding to low-n phases slowly decreased in intensity while low-energy emissions associated with 3D or 3Dlike phases slowly increased. Meanwhile, the films with 2-TEA showed only the high-energy peaks, with only a small peak with an emission similar to that of a RP n = 2 phase growing in. The schematic in Figure  22c  illustrates the mechanism that leads to this. For 2TMA and 3TMA, the interface reacts over time to form less-stable high-n phases which can then degrade, but the 2TEA spacer retains its structure. While it is not clear why some cations lead to more robust low-n phases, this is an important step to understanding the correlation between spacer and device stability for heterostructure films. 5.3.1.3. Other Cations. As mentioned above in the mixed dimensionality section, the heavily fluorinated 3-(nonafluorotert-butyloxy)propylammonium (A43) spacer (Table  11i ) stabilizes RP n = 1 and n = 2 structures.  313  This study uses this spacer for both mixed dimensionality devices, discussed earlier, as well as heterostructure devices (Table  15k ). Treating a 3D Cs 0.1 (MA) 0.13 (FA) 0.74 PbI 2.48 Br 0.39 film with the A43 iodide salt shows new peaks in the XRD corresponding to the (A43) 2 PbI 4 phase, confirming their presence in heterostructure films. Two PL peaks, possibly corresponding to n = 1 and n = 2 phases, are seen as well which were not visible for the mixed dimensionality film. Notably, because the same cation was used for both mixed dimensionality and heterostructure films, it is interesting to note that the photovoltaic performance of each was similar for V OC , J SC , FF, and PCE. Likewise, the waterrepelling capabilities were both drastically improved, though the heterostructure film had a greater water drop contact angle of 98.4°compared to 83.8°for the mixed dimensionality film. 5.3.2. 1D Structures. Beyond 2D/3D heterojunctions, 1D/3D heterojunctions can also be formed (Table  16 ). Using the small thiazolium (TA) cation, a 1D structure with facesharing octahedra can be formed (Figure  23a ).  339  This spacer was then used to modify a 3D (MA) 0.9 (FA) 0.1 PbI 3 film to form the 1D structure on the surface. This is confirmed by XRD which shows the presence of the low-angle peak corresponding to the pattern for the crystallographically confirmed 1D structure. Despite its very large bandgap, the 1D structure shows no effects on the optical properties of the film. Like the 2D/3D heterostructures above, this structure shows increased carrier lifetime, improved V OC , and enhanced device stability. In fact, these devices maintained 84% PCE after 500 h at 70 °C and 70% PCE after 500 h with 70% relative humidity, shown in Figure  23b . Another recently reported 1D/3D heterostructure uses the nonammonium spacer trimethylsulfonium, denoted as (CH 3 ) 3 S + .  340  This spacer forms a 1D structure also with facesharing octahedra, which can be employed as a capping layer on a 3D film to yield increased film stability. 5.3.3. No Incorporation. As previously mentioned, some bulky spacers may not be able to easily stabilize RP phases. (Table  17 ) The 1-naphthalenemethylammonium (NpMA) spacer has been shown to barely react with a 3D film and mainly leave a thin layer of NpMAI on the surface.  280  The previously mentioned fluorine-substituted alkylammonium cation 2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropylammonium (5F-PA) has also been implemented in these types of devices, with no evidence of RP phases.  341  The authors report that even when casting a 1 M solution of the spacer in IPA on top of 3D films, no low-angle peaks are seen nor are there any peaks in the UV-vis spectra to suggest that low-dimensional phases are  present. Thus, it is likely that this cation functions as a surface passivator, possible at the grain boundaries, instead of forming low-dimensional structures. This is in agreement with the previously mentioned study,  325  which showed that the 5F-PA cation does not form low-dimensional structures in mixed dimensionality films. Either way, similar benefits to the heterostructure devices such as increased PL lifetime and enhance moisture stability, are seen, implying that these benefits are not dependent on the presence of low-dimensional structures. 
 CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FURTHER DIRECTIONS Studies on 2D halide perovskites in the past few years have led to a remarkable degree of understanding of the excellent properties and potential applications of these materials. Because of a seemingly endless plethora of spacers to choose from, being able to choose the correct spacer for the desired application will further propel this field. While many spacers have already been explored, the library of the known structures needs to be expanded to achieve a full understanding of 2D halide perovskites from structure-property relationships to stability and performance in devices.  
 Choice of Spacer Cations Rationally choosing new spacer cations which have the right characteristics to stabilize 2D compounds is the key to successful synthesis of new structures. The structural design rules we have outlined can be used to target spacers that will likely stabilize 2D perovskites, where factors such as the charge, shape, size, and heteroatoms need to be considered. The amino head should be able to anchor in the inorganic layer pocket, while the organic tail cannot be too bulky or too small. Heteroatoms on the spacer cations such as O, F, Cl, Br can influence the formation of hydrogen bonding thus the stacking or even structure type (e.g., ⟨100⟩ vs ⟨110⟩-oriented 2D perovskites). More complicated cations, especially those with heavily conjugated rings, may interact electronically with the inorganic layers to yield new properties. This allows for a large diversity of structures which have tunable dimensionalities and electronic structures. 
 Structure-Property Relationships When new spacer cations are incorporated into perovskites, the resultant structures need to be characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction even if they are 2D perovskites similar to already known structures. Because of the unusual softness and flexibility of these frameworks, even subtle distortions from one structure to the next could be behind the observed differences in physical properties. We now know that the M-X-M bond angle is a major determinant in the electronic structure with angles close to 180°giving narrower bandgaps more ideal for solar cell applications.  62, 102, 342  Besides, the interlayer distance and metal-halide (M-X) bond length can also influence the bandgap. Other factors such the spacer length, which may affect light harvesting  35  and device efficiency  36  have also been shown to be very important. Additionally, having crystallographic evidence of multilayered structures is critical to discern what 2D phases can exist in the final film. On the one hand, only knowing that the n = 1 compound can be stabilized is not proof that other homologous phases with higher layer-numbers may exist; on the other hand, the absence of 2D n = 1 phase does not necessarily mean the multilayer phases cannot exist, like in the case of propylammonium cation. Since the resultant film usually has mixture of different phases, to compare the optical properties of those phases with the properties of single crystals, each phase should be made phase pure and fully characterized structurally and optically. Though, with very high n values, this becomes more challenging. That being said, structures up to n = 7 have been verified with SCXRD, and they may be present in films,  34, 151  though this has not been confirmed. 
 Film and Device Fabrications With this chemical understanding, the focus can then be turned to depositing films and optoelectronic devices. Even then, however, the effects of the spacer on the film properties are complex and must be studied in depth to gain a fundamental understanding of the effects of the spacers on the film performance and in the final device. Because the crystallization process during film deposition is relatively fast compared to crystallization from a synthesis solution, it cannot be assumed that the same kinetics will apply to both systems. While kinetics and thermodynamic processes often align, if there are competing processes, the kinetic processes could prevail in the fast crystallization during spin coating. For other film deposition methods, thermodynamic processes may prevail instead. This casts doubt on the composition of the films. More importantly, many powders and crystals are made from acid solutions, not the organic solvents generally used for films which may complicate the crystallization. Because the mechanisms are different, the resulting compositions are unlikely to be the same for films and powders. Therefore, the effects of spacer selection on film composition are difficult to control or predict, especially considering that films are highly affected by processing conditions. Thus, we can expect that each film architecture (2D, mixed dimensionality, and heterostructures) will be affected by spacers differently. Looking at factors such as stability, crystallinity, morphology, orientation, composition, and the interaction between phases in the film helps to discern the effects of the spacer. For example, systematically studying alkyldiammonium spacers revealed opposite trends when using an ionic solvent with onestep spin coating  293  versus an organic solvent with hotcasting.  39  Nevertheless, we expect the proper conditions and processes can be found for the deposition of films with targeted single phase compositions for many organic spacers. Recently, researchers have reported the phase-pure films of (BA) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 (n = 1-5) using molten salt butylamine acetate instead of butylamine iodide in the precursor.  343  It will be interesting to see if this strategy works for other spacers as well. On the other hand, it does not always mean that the presence of mixed phases in the films is undesirable or detrimental to device performance. One of the most important effects seen in recent years is the spacer's effect on composition of the mixed-phase films, allowing energy funnels from low-n to high-n phases in high performing devices.  224  With greater mixtures of 2D and 3D character, charge transfer rates from phase to phase increase, and efficiencies can improve.  223  Knowing the right combination of phases and how to control the phase distribution and understanding the charge transfer processes are keys to increasing device efficiency. Looking into the f uture, some key challenges need to be addressed to take us to the next level of the field: rational design of perovskite structures for desired applications, not only for solar cells but also all kinds of optoelectronic devices, especially those that are hard to achieved in 3D perovskites, such as the all-perovskite heterostructures.  344   
 Using Theory to Help Develop New 2D Perovskite Structures When choosing a new spacer, theory can also help pick the spacer by modeling the factors such as charge, shape and size of the cations. Machine learning has been used to find new 3D halide perovskites,  345  for 2D perovskites, it is more complicated because of the structural diversity and many factors that need to be considered. A recent paper builds a database of 2D halide perovskites with 180 different cations and 515 compounds. Machine learning is used to extract the relationships between the structures and bandgaps.  346  Since this review cannot cover all of those compounds, it will be useful to check the database for more information on reported 2D perovskites. Another paper shows automated synthesis using inverse temperature crystallization can be used to rapidly test many different cations with n = 1 to improve machine learning techniques,  347  though this technology for 2D perovskites is still in its infancy. Therefore, the structural design rules still need to be considered to narrow down the number of cations that need to be modeled instead of picking random cations. After the cations are chosen, proper synthesis conditions need to be found to achieve the targeted phases using the theory-selected cations. 
 Synthesis of Pure Single Crystals From synthesis and structural characterization aspects, synthesis methods need to be improved to obtain pure phases of 2D perovskites, especially for the multilayer structures. So far, the most effective way to synthesize multilayer 2D perovskite is using a solution method with hydrohalic acid. Other solution methods using organic solvents and antisolvents have lagged and need to be further optimized to give crystals of multilayer 2D n > 1 perovskites. Further development and understanding of these synthetic methods will help expand the library of spacer cations that can be incorporated into structures and devices. 6.6. Exploring the Layer-Number Limit 2D perovskites with very high layer thickness n need to be explored to gain insights on what phases, mixed or pure, can be stabilized when the thermodynamic limits of layer thickness are reached or passed. This will help to bridge the gap between pure 2D and 3D perovskites. So far, the highest layer-number that has been crystallographically characterized is n = 7. What structures are stabilized beyond that layer-number is unknown. When n > 7, crystallography becomes insufficient to fully characterize these phases. This is because the unit cell dimensions become very large and intergrowth of different phases reduces the crystallinity. There is tremendous imbalance in electron density between the very heavy atom in the inorganic slabs and the very light atoms in the organic spacers causing weak Bragg scattering of the long-range order in the stacking direction. Other microscopic and spectroscopic techniques are needed to supplement or possibly replace crystallographic means to characterize these phases. For example, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) can be used to take images at the molecular level. Spectroscopic techniques can be used to find emission and absorption peaks between those of n = 7 and 3D peaks. 
 Characterizing the Photophysical Properties As we gain more knowledge on the chemistry and precise structures of 2D perovskites, it aids understanding of their physical properties using different spectroscopic techniques.  348  So far, the vast majority of the spectroscopic studies are on well-explored 3D perovskites. There are many interesting phenomena such as self-trapped excitons, charge and energy transfer in different layer-numbers, exciton-exciton annihilation, etc. that need to be further explored in 2D perovskites. Furthermore, even though the complex makeup of the films has made spectroscopic characterization a challenge, significant progress in the charge transfer mechanisms and their effects on device performance has been made. The multiple quantum well structure has been shown to allow for efficient charge transfer from low-n phases to high-n phases, allowing for improved efficiencies in LEDs and solar cells. While it has been established that the presence of 2D and 3D phases together is advantageous for charge transfer, more studies are needed to understand the optimal composition in films for charge transfer. Is it best to have phases where n is at least 3 or 4 or are the n = 1 and 2 phases also necessary? Does the location of the phases within the film matter? What are the effects of the spacer on charge transfer between phases with different n values? We expect that addressing these questions will expedite film optimization and device performance. In particular, there is a dearth of charge transfer studies in the recently popularized heterostructure films which have shown great promise in terms of efficiency and stability. 
 Understanding the Structural Role of the Organic Cation and the Film Formation Mechanism For film and device fabrication, more emphasis should be put on the structural effects of new spacers beyond the improvement of device performance. They can serve as spacers for 2D perovskites (2D films), ligands on the grain boundaries (mixed dimensionality films), or capping ligands on the surface (heterostructure films). So far, many studies on film and device fabrication focus on a new specific spacer and present how it improves device efficiency but there is a lack of understanding of why a spacer changes properties such as film texture and phase distribution. Several studies of the film formation mechanism have recently come to light through the use of techniques such as in situ GIWAXS or PL during spincoating and annealing. These techniques can help to understand how the spacers affect the final film and they should be applied systematically to multiple materials and methods. It is imperative to understand which parts of the mechanisms that have been uncovered are generalizable and which are spacer-specific. From a mechanistic standpoint it is also important to understand the intermediate phases and how they may influence the film formation process. 
 Improving the Device Stability Besides device efficiencies, improving the stability is also an essential step toward the commercialization of the materials. Understanding the degradation mechanism is important to improve the stability. The use of a standard stability test protocols as the recently suggested  215  is needed to compare the results from different laboratories. It has become very clear that the interfaces are key to the stability, and understanding how the spacer affects these interfaces is also important. For the heterostructure perovskite film architectures, this is especially important, as the lower-dimensional phases only exist at the interfaces. Figure 2 . 2 Figure 2.

 untilted octahedra. However, when more than one fluorine atoms are substituted, as in F 2 CHCH 2 F no longer exists. 60  Instead the amino head penetrates inside the inorganic pocket (positive penetration depth) and has a stronger interaction with the iodine atoms of the octahedra, thus the Pb-I-Pb angles are much smaller than those for F(CH 2 ) 2 NH 3 + . So, (FCH 2 CH 2 NH 3 )PbBr 4 shows the smallest bandgap among these three compounds. When more F atoms are substituted the interlayer distance also increases from (FCH 2 CH 2 NH 3 )PbBr 4 to (F 2 CHCH 2 NH 3 )PbBr 4 and (F 3 CCH 2 NH 3 )PbBr 4 because of the different cation conformations and increasing steric hindrance. Besides the aliphatic cations, heteroatoms in aromatic rings can also change the spacer configuration and even the layer stacking motif. In 2001, Mitzi et al. reported the (x-FPEA) 2 SnI 4 (FPEA = fluorophenylethylammonium, x = 2, 3, 4) series with fluorine substitution in the meta, ortho, and para positions (Table 4h-j). 120 While the cations of 2-FPEA and 3-FPEA adopt face-to-edge configuration, the 4-FPEA spacers stack parallel to each other. For 3-FPEA and 4-FPEA cations, the closest fluorine-fluorine distance is 3.015 and 3.511 Å, respectively, while the van der Waals radius of fluorine is 1.47 Å, suggesting strong F•••F interaction for 3-FPEA and weaker interaction for 4-FPEA. For 2-FPEA, the closest F•••F distance is 6.117 Å, while the closest I•••F distance is 3.781 Å, which is near to the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.45 Å), indicating a strong interaction between the fluorine atom and the inorganic layer. The unit cell displacements are (0.1, 0.5), (0.4, 0.5), and (0.15, 0.15) for 2-FPEA, 3-FPEA, and 4-FPEA, respectively. (2-FPEA) 2 SnI 4 shows the highest bandgap among this series, because of the largest tilt of inorganic layer (smallest Sn-I-Sn angle) caused by the strong interaction between the fluorine atom and the octahedra.

 (2-FPEA) 2 SnI 4 and (2-ClPEA) 2 SnI 4 only tilt in-plane but barely tilt out-ofplane, (2-BrPEA) 2 SnI 4 tilts both in-plane and out-of-plane. The Sn-I-Sn angle is smallest for (2-BrPEA) 2 SnI 4 , leading to the highest bandgap among this series. Unlike in (2-FPEA) 2 SnI 4 , 2-BrPEA adopts a parallel configuration, with a closest C•••C distance of 3.80 Å. This strong interaction between the aromatic rings helps stabilize the parallel cation configuration.

(BZA) 2 PbI 4 and (4-FBZA) 2 PbI 4 adopt the centrosymmetric space groups of Pbca and P2 1 /n, respectively, while (4-ClBZA) 2 PbI 4 and (4-BrBZA) 2 PbI 4 adopt the noncentrosymmetric space group of P2 1 . This is confirmed by the second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurement, which show that (BZA) 2 PbI 4 and (4-FBZA) 2 PbI 4 only exhibit a surface SHG signal while (4-ClBZA) 2 PbI 4 and (4-BrBZA) 2 PbI 4 show both surface and bulk SHG signals two orders higher than (BZA)PbI 4 and (4-FBZA) 2 PbI 4 .

 3 has larger Pb-I-Pb angle and thus smaller bandgap than MAPbI 3 . So mixing FA with MA in the A site can further reduce the bandgap. Taking (3AMP)(MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 for example, alloying 25% FA ((3AMP)-(MA 0.75 FA 0.25 ) 3 Pb 4 I 13 ) increases the Pb-I-Pb angle from 168°to 173.8°and reduces the bandgap by 0.1 eV. The average PCE of the solar cell devices also increases from 7.02% for (3AMP)(MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 to 11.24% for (3AMP)-(MA 0.75 FA 0.25 ) 3 Pb 4 I 13 .

 Figure 16 . 16 Figure 16. Many spacers are based on the commonly used BA and PEA spacers. Alkylammonium cations can be made shorter than BA to achieve greater light absorption or longer to achieve greater stability. They can also be conjugated or substituted to improve charge transfer between layers. For aromatic spacers derived from PEA, hydrogen substitution has been shown to lead to a higher dipole moment. Ring substitution has led to a different quantum well structure (Type II).

Imaging and Quantifying non-radiative Losses at 23% Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells Interfaces

One could estimate an ideal FF for the perovskite with a band gap of Eg=1.57 to be up to 90.17%. Considering the diode equation model, it is also possible to estimate the series and shunt resistance. The results are reported in Supplementary Table  1 . The details of the model used which we implemented can be find in Pica et al.  1    
 Radiative limit The Δµ rad is defined as: where 𝐼 𝑝ℎ is the photocurrent due to the considered illumination and 𝜙 𝑒𝑚 is the PL emission of the absorber in thermal equilibrium with its surrounding at 300 K and kT the thermal energy of the charge carriers. In our analysis, we consider the photocurrent generated by a monochromatic radiation at 405 nm with a 1 sun-equivalent power density to match the experimental conditions used in the steady measurements and directly compare the Δµ rad with the Δµ experimentally measured on bare absorbers and stacks. The PL emission 𝜙 𝑒𝑚 corresponds to 𝜙 𝑒𝑚 = ∫ 𝐴(𝐸)𝜙 𝐵𝐵 300𝐾 (𝐸)𝑑𝐸, where 𝜙 𝐵𝐵 300𝐾 is the blackbody radiation at 300K and 𝐴(𝐸) is the absorptivity of the perovskite, extrapolated from absorption measurements reported in Supplementary Figure  2 . The radiative Voc (Voc rad ) was calculated from : 𝑉 𝑜𝑐 𝑟𝑎𝑑 = 𝑘𝑇 𝑞 ⋅ ln ( 𝐽 𝑠𝑐 𝐽 0𝑟𝑎𝑑 ) Δ𝜇 𝑟𝑎𝑑 = 𝑘𝑇 ⋅ ln ( 𝐼 𝑝ℎ 𝑞𝜙 𝑒𝑚 ) Where kT is the thermal energy of the charge carriers, q is the elementary charge, Jsc is the shortcircuit current density of the solar cell and J0rad is the radiative current. Specifically: 𝐽 0𝑟𝑎𝑑 = 𝑞∫ 𝐸𝑄𝐸(𝐸)𝜙 𝐵𝐵 300𝐾 (𝐸)𝑑𝐸 with EQE being the external quantum efficiency of the full devices. This calculation is illustrated in Supplementary Figure  6where  the EQE of one of the samples is reported (orange curve) together with the blackbody radiation (black curve) at the temperature of the experiment. The radiation current of charges per unit of energy is the product of the two later (blue curve). The radiative recombination current corresponds to the area in light blue under the blue curve. Interestingly, a narrow wavelength (energy) range of the EQE is of interest for the calculation of J0rad In particular, the quantity J0rad defines both the lower limit for the actual saturation density J0 of a real solar cell and the upper limit for the open-circuit voltage Voc rad . Moreover, the Voc rad not only depends on the optical properties and radiative recombination such as the Δµ rad but also on the quantum efficiency and thus on collection and injection of carriers. This arises from the fact that the spectral dependence of the φBB weights the different spectral contribution of the EQE differently. However, the resulting changes in terms of Voc rad will be minimal as the ratio Jsc/ J0rad enters logarithmically into Voc rad . Supplementary Figure  6 .

 exp ( 𝐸 -𝛥𝜇 𝑘𝑇 ) Where h is the Planck's constant, c the speed of light, E the photon energy, a(E) the absorptivity of the sample taking into account sub-band gap absorption, Δµ the QFLS, and kT the thermal energy of the charge carriers. The absorption is described by an ideal band-band term convoluted with a sub-bandgap absorption, in which the tail states are represented by an exponent factor 𝜃. For a monoexponential decay of the tail states in the gap, 𝜃 = 1 and 𝐸 𝑢 corresponds to the Urbach energy  2  . 𝑎(𝐸) = 1 -exp ( 𝛼 0 𝑑 2𝐸 𝑢 𝛤 (1 + 1 𝜃 ) ∫ (𝑒𝑥𝑝 (-| 𝑢 𝐸 𝑢 | 𝜃 ) √𝐸 -𝐸 𝑔 -𝑢𝑑𝑢 ∞ -∞ ) Fitted values for all the fitting parameters are reported in Table  S1  (neat perovskite), Table  S2  (half devices) and table  S3  (full devices).

 Model for TR-measurements The model we used to interpret the decays is the 1d-Drift-Diffusion model. We implemented a simplified model both for full-cell devices and thin-films. This model is the following  4  . We consider a slab of intrinsic semiconductor of thickness 𝐿. The laser pulse will generate excited charges in the device. We consider that the electron and hole density to be equal at all position in the thickness and time. We model the time and space (in thickness) dependent photo generated carrier density Δ𝑛(𝑧, 𝑡) with the 1d-Drift-Diffusion equation: 𝜕Δ𝑛 𝜕𝑡 = 𝐷 𝜕 2 Δ𝑛 𝜕𝑧 2 -𝑘 1 Δ𝑛 -𝑘 2 Δ𝑛 2 + 𝑔(𝑧, 𝑡) (S1) With the effective diffusion coefficient 𝐷, the SRH recombination constant 𝑘 1 and the radiative external recombination coefficient 𝑘 2 . The laser pulse is modeled via the time dependent generation rate 𝑔 via: 𝑔(𝑧, 𝑡) = [𝑛 𝛾 𝛼𝑒 -𝛼𝑧 ] × [ 1 √2𝜋𝜎 exp ( -𝑡 2 2𝜎 2 )] That is Beer-Lambert's absorption law with 𝛼 the absorption coefficient at the laser wavelength 𝛼(532𝑛𝑚) = 1.3𝑒5 𝑐𝑚 -1 and 𝑛 𝛾 the fluence in ph.cm -2 pulse -1 which is varied during the experiment. The right part of 𝑔 is a Gaussian temporal profile of duration 𝜎 = 5𝑝𝑠 in the simulation. The boundary conditions to solve Eq S1 are the following: ⎩ ⎨ ⎧ 𝜕Δ𝑛 𝜕𝑧 | 𝑧=0 = 𝑆 𝑡𝑜𝑝 Δ𝑛(𝑧 = 0, 𝑡) 𝜕Δ𝑛 𝜕𝑧 | 𝑧=𝐿 = -𝑆 𝑏𝑜𝑡 Δ𝑛(𝑧 = 𝐿, 𝑡) They represent non radiative recombination at the interfaces. The definition of the photoluminescence signal in this model is taken as: 𝐼 PL (𝑡) = 𝐴 ∫ 𝑑𝑧 Δ𝑛 2 𝐿 0 With 𝐴 a constant that represents geometrical factors as well as the radiative recombination coefficient 𝑘 2 . Since the fitted decays are all normalized, the value of 𝐴 has no effect on the model. The implementation of the model is made via a Matlab code using the pdepe function to solve the partial differential equation. A fitting procedure was coded and has the following properties: 1. A unique model is fitted for all the selected fluences. That means that only one value for the physical parameters is fitted -no fluence dependent values are fitted. 2. A unique model is fitted for the experimental curves acquired in top or bottom illumination configuration. The model takes into account which curves comes from which experiment. 3. The uncertainties on the fitted parameters are estimated using the nlparci method. They are an estimate of the uncertainties -which are difficult to determine for this non-linear fitting method. The reference thin film was used to fit the diffusion coefficient -which was then fixed to the value of 4.5𝑒 -3 𝑐𝑚 2 𝑠 -1 (±3%) for all other fits, see Supplementary Figure  7 . The fitting offers a very close correspondence with the experimental results. The correlations are relatively low except for the correlation between the top surface and bulk non radiative recombination parameters 𝑆 𝑡𝑜𝑝 and 𝑘 1 . This comes from the fact that both will have similar effects on the decays. This makes it impossible to distinguish independently bulk from top surface recombination in this framework. To test this hypothesis, we tried fitting the full cell devices with and without bulk recombination, see Supplementary Figure  8 . The addition of bulk recombination was not found to improve the fitting result and no specific feature were modeled by this parameter. We therefore decided to neglect it for simplicity reasons and to attribute all non-radiative recombination to the interfaces. Fitting the full cell devices gave us a radiative recombination coefficient higher than for the films on glass possibly due to a change in photon outcoupling. The fitted value for the full cells is: 𝑘 2 = (2.5 ± 1) × 10 -10 𝑐𝑚 3 𝑠 -1 . The three full cell devices were fitted using the procedure. The results are the following: (2.5 ± 1) × 10 -10 𝑐𝑚 3 𝑠 -1 Parameter Fitted from the full cell reference Diffusion coefficient 𝐷 4.5 × 10 -3 𝑐𝑚 2 𝑠 -1 (±3%) From a fit of the thin film reference. Supplementary Table  6 . Model parameters values. The corresponding figures are shown in Supplementary Figure  10 . Even though the model is extremely simplified, it is able to describe correctly both the top and bottom illumination configuration as well as the change in fluence with a unique model for each sample. The fitted recombination values show a passivation of the cells compatible with the other measurements. A question is the role of the extracting layers on the TR-PL decay. Following the work of Krückemeier and colleagues  3  , we think that the high fluence behavior of the full cell devices is close to the behavior of a single absorbing layer without charge transport layers. This is exemplified here by the fact that the simplest model is capable of qualitatively reproducing the observed trends of the TR-PL decays. We believe that the simplest model possible should be applied to all data sets in order to avoid overfitting.  
 Repartition of the recombination in the model In this section we use our fitted model to attribute the decay to its origins. We can compute theoretically the time derivative of the PL signal as: 𝑑𝐼 PL 𝑑𝑡 (𝑡) = -2𝐴 ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎡ 𝑘 1 ∫ 𝑑𝑧 Δ𝑛 2 𝐿 0 (i) + 𝑆 𝑡𝑜𝑝 Δ𝑛 2 (𝑧 = 0, 𝑡) (ii) + 𝑆 𝑏𝑜𝑡 Δ𝑛 2 (𝑧 = 0, 𝑡) (iii) + 𝐷 ∫ 𝑑𝑧 ( 𝜕Δ𝑛 𝜕𝑧 (𝑧, 𝑡)) 2 𝐿 0 (iv) + 𝑘 2 ∫ 𝑑𝑧 Δ𝑛 3 𝐿 0 (v) ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎤ This decomposition may also be found in the paper by Maiberg et al.  4  . Each of the terms inside the brackets can be attributed to a physical interpretation.

 Computation of the decay time In this section, we describe our reasoning to compute the decay time. Mainly, we tackle the question of computing the decay time when the charge carrier density in the device is close to the estimated 1 sun excitation density, ie 10 15 cm -3 . For an intrinsic material we have the following scaling: 𝑃𝐿 ∝ Δ𝑛  2  or we can write it as Δ𝑛 ∝ 𝑃𝐿 1/2 . This implies that a loss of two orders of magnitude of PL leads to a loss of one order of magnitude of carrier density. We have two sets of acquisitions for each sample, one with an initial carrier density of 1.5 10 17 cm -3 (high fluence, 150 suns) and one with an initial carrier density of 10 11 cm -3 (low fluence, 10 suns). For the high fluence acquisition, we would need to observe at least 4 orders of magnitude to reach 1 sun equivalent carrier density. This is not possible since the noise of our experimental setup is reached approximatively in this regime. For the low fluence acquisition, we only need to wait for 2 orders of magnitude of PL decrease to reach a density of approximately 10 15 cm -3 ie, 1 sun acquisition. For this acquisition, this is the case in the [300; 500] ns region, see Figure  2(d) . Once we have selected a time window, the decay time is computed by using the following model: log 𝑃𝐿(𝑡) = 𝑐𝑡𝑒 - 𝑡 𝜏 = 𝑎 + 𝑏𝑡 We fit a linear behavior for the logarithm of the PL in the corresponding temporal window. The decay time is defined as the inverse of the absolute value of the slope: 𝜏 = -1/𝑏. To obtain the mapping of the decay time, we used our TR-FLIM acquisitions. One issue that arises is the noise at the level of each pixel. To be able to average out noise at the local level, we performed a temporal mean of the logarithm of decays of each pixel on different temporal windows noted [𝑡 𝑖 ; 𝑡 𝑖+1 ]. Namely, we averaged the decays in the logarithm space and created a new dataset PL': 𝑃𝐿′ ( 𝑡 𝑖 + 𝑡 𝑖+1 2 ) = exp ( 1 𝑡 𝑖+1 -𝑡 𝑖 ∫ 𝑑𝑡 log(𝑃𝐿(𝑡)) 𝑡 𝑖+1 𝑡 𝑖 ) This is justified in the case of a mono-exponential decay, which we expect here after ~100ns after the pulse. We used the following time windows limits:  {𝑡 𝑖 } = [

Despite its pivotal function in the development of a rational device optimization, the actual role played by the incorporation of interfacial modifications and the interface physics therein remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the interface and device physics, quantifying charge recombination and charge losses in state-of-the-art inverted solar cells with power conversion efficiency beyond 23% -among the highest reported so far -by using multidimensional photoluminescence imaging. By doing that we extract physical parameters such as quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) and Urbach energy enabling us to assess that the main passivation mechanism affects the perovskite/PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester) interface rather than surface defects. In this work, by linking optical, electrical measurements and modelling we highlight the benefits of organic passivation, made in this case by phenylethylammonium (PEAI) based cations, in maximising all the photovoltaic figures of merit. I nverted perovskite solar cells following a p-i-n structure have recently attracted enormous interest due to their enhanced stability and reduced hysteresis compared to the traditional n-i-p architecture 1,2 . However, n-i-p devices, where the perovskite absorber is deposited onto an electron transport layer, still result in higher power conversion efficiencies (PCE) reaching values up to 25.6% 3 mainly due to a better carrier extraction. One of the most common strategies employed to limit non-radiative losses and therefore improve perovskite solar cells (PSC)s efficiency relies on the use of interface passivation agents such as low dimensional halide perovskites 2,4,5 , organic cations  6, 7  or selfassembled monolayers (SAM)  8, 9  . In our recent work, we have developed an innovative strategy for the optimisation of p-i-n stateof-the-art inverted solar cells  10  , consisting of a dual passivation method at both the top and bottom interfaces of the perovskite active layer by introducing large organic cations at these interfaces. This resulted in improved performances with PCE beyond 23%, among the highest reported so far  10  . Specifically, two large organic A-site cations, i.e. 4-chloro-phenylethylammonium iodide (Cl-PEAI) and 4-fluoro-phenylethylammonium iodide (F-PEAI), were introduced at the interfaces of the perovskite absorber with both hole transport layer (HTL) and electron transport layer (ETL). Despite the clear improvement, questions regarding the physics behind the modified interfaces are still open  11  . Issues regarding the completeness of the coverage of the passivating layer  12  , whether a 2D perovskite is formed or not  13, 14  , and the possible effects on carrier extraction remain not fully understood. In a more general way, several studies focused on the recombination dynamics at the perovskite/selective interfaces by tracking the photoluminescence signal and its intensity  [15] [16] [17]  . For instance, the contributions of bulk and interfacial recombination currents were decoupled through the measurements of the quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) of the individual layer by all-optical techniques  18  . Stolterfoht and coworkers used transient and absolute photoluminescence (PL) imaging to visualise non-radiative recombination pathways at modified perovskite/C 60  19  electron transport layer. Here, we combine steady-state and time-resolved multidimensional photoluminescence imaging techniques to probe the main optoelectronic and transport properties of the optimised p-i-n devices. First, our results demonstrate that the Cl-PEAI and F-PEAI cations deposition result in a homogenous coverage of the perovskite surface. Second, we verify that no layered perovskite is formed. Moreover, we identify that interfacial passivation is the main mechanism driving the improvement of the device open circuit voltage (V oc ), as the boost of QFLS and the reduction of surface recombination rate are observed only after PCBM (ETL) deposition. Instead, the introduction of the cations at the perovskite bottom interface (HTL/perovskite) helps in the perovskite crystallisation process but does not significantly reduce the losses at that specific device interface, as demonstrated by the quantitative analysis of the QFLS. 
 Results Dual interfacial modified devices. The devices under investigation follow a p-i-n structure, as shown in Fig.  1a, d . The full stack includes: glass/Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)/Poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA)/A-cation/perovskite/A-cation/ [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/Bathocuproine (BCP)/silver. Ionic salts, namely piperidinium salt [BMP] + [BF 4 ] -20 , were added to the mixed cation double halide composition (Cs 0.05 (FA 5/6 MA 1/6 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.9 Br 0.1 ) 3 ). Three different types of cells were fabricated: a reference cell (Fig.  1a ) and devices with dual interfacial modification by F-PEAI and Cl-PEAI cations (Fig.  1d ). The cations, commonly used as precursor for 2D perovskite formation, were added in very low concentrations (of 0.5 mM) at the top interface, meanwhile 20 mM were added at the bottom interface. The use of such low concentrations did not lead to the formation of a 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase  10  , confirmed by XRD analysis reported in Supplementary Fig.  S1 , showing the characteristic perovskite reference peaks. However, as recently reported by Gharibzadeh et al  21  , 2D organic cations can be also employed to passivate both grain boundaries and interfacial defects in p-i-n configuration devices, allowing to achieve a substantial enhancement of the device performances. In this case the use of the top and bottom modification with the large organic cations is meant to improve the interfaces between the perovskite and the selective charge transport layers by simultaneously reducing the defect density and therefore the nonradiative recombination. The main photovoltaic characteristic parameters for the reference cell and the A-cations devices are reported in Fig.  1b, c , e and f. The addition of the cations induced an increase of all the main photovoltaic characteristics. The PCE of the devices in which both absorber interfaces were modified by A-cations is clearly enhanced, exhibiting values up to 23.34% for the Cl-PEAI and 23.22% for the F-PEAI. In particular, we can note a clear increase of the V oc from 1.10 V for the reference to 1.15 V using Cl-PEAI and exceeding 1.16 V using F-PEAI, which corresponds to a tenfold decrease of the dark current, i.e. of the carrier recombination rate. The current also slightly improved, in contrast with some previous observations in the literature, where the full formation of a 2D perovskite layer was acting as a blocking layer  22  . Remarkably, fill factor reached values up to 85 % on the Cl-PEAI and F-PEAI devices, within the highest ever reported for halide perovskite solar cells. Also, the devices do not show any hysteretic behaviour, as is shown in Supplementary Fig.  5 . Quantification of non-radiative losses at the interfaces. To better understand the origin of this evident improvement in terms of device performances we employed multi-dimensional photoluminescence and analysed the datasets by employing physical models to quantify the key parameters governing the carrier recombination and transport. Specifically, we used two different set-ups to investigate both steady-state and transient regimes, namely a Hyperspectral Imager (HI)  23  and a Time Resolved Fluorescence Imaging (TR-FLIM)  24  set-up. Photoluminescence (PL) spectrum images were acquired by using a blue laser (405 nm) and illuminating the samples from the thin films side to avoid optical artefacts induced by the glass. We acquired a series of PL calibrated maps of neat perovskite thin films deposited on glass, half devices (glass/ITO/PTAA/perovskite) and full devices without the silver top electrode (glass/ITO/PTAA/perovskite/ PCBM/BCP) of reference and Cl-PEAI or F-PEAI samples. Notably, the A-cations samples do not exhibit any 2D perovskite emission peak, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  3 . The lack of a 2D perovskite formation is thus further confirmed, corroborating the XRD measurements. The spatially averaged and absolutely calibrated values of each map were fitted by using a model based on Planck's law  25, 26  (see Fig.  2a  for PL spectra and fits of full devices), allowing to determine the QFLS values for each set of samples, reported in Fig.  2b  and in Table  1 . In Table  1  we also report the radiative level splitting (Δµ rad ) and the radiative open circuit voltage (V oc rad ). The Δµ rad is defined as: 4μ rad ¼ kT Á ln I ph qϕ em ð1Þ where I ph is the photocurrent due to the considered illumination and kT the thermal energy of the charge carriers and q is the elementary charge. The term ϕ em is the PL emission of the absorber in thermal equilibrium with its surrounding at 300 K. It means that only the thermal photons emitted in the dark by the  surrounding excite the device, which in return emits the very minimum PL photons flux possible. This PL flux depends on the bang gap energy, the temperature and the absorption coefficient, which is affected by the defect density. Moreover, we defined the radiative open circuit voltage V oc rad as: V rad oc ¼ kT q Á ln J sc J 0rad ð2Þ Where kT is the thermal energy of the charge carriers, q is the elementary charge, J sc is the short-circuit current density of the solar cell and J 0rad is the radiative current  27, 28  . Specifically: J 0rad ¼ q Z EQEðEÞϕ 300K BB E ð ÞdE ð3Þ with EQE being the external quantum efficiency of the full devices. We considered the radiative QFLS (Δµ rad ) as the radiative limit for the optical measurements and the V oc rad as the upper limit for the open-circuit voltage measured by electrical characterisation. The small difference of the values determined for the two limits arises from the fact that the V oc rad depends not only from optical properties of the absorber and the radiative recombination but also from the collection and the injection of carriers. We obtained values of QFLS for neat perovskite thin films equal to 1.24 eV for the reference sample and 1.25 eV for the two A-cations samples, corresponding to 80-90 meV losses if compared to the radiative QFLS (Δµ rad ) that is equal to 1.33 eV in all cases. Interestingly, the main impact of the organic cation passivation is observed for full devices. In this case, the difference between reference and A-cations containing samples is in the range of 60-70 meV, proving that the cations have drastically reduced the non-radiative recombination at the interface absorber/ETL. Conversely, when considering neat perovskite or half devices the addition of the cations resulted in an improvement of only 10-20 meV. Therefore, the main passivation mechanism acting relates to the interfacial passivation at the interface absorber/ ETL. The introduction of the organic cations at the interface HTL/absorber favoured the perovskite crystallisation on the PTAA surface, but did not drastically reduce the losses at that interface. It is worth noting that the interface perovskite/PCBM appears to be particularly critical for device optimisation. The fast recombination observed at this specific interface represents a major loss mechanism for solar cell operation  29  . Moreover, we linked the QFLS of full devices to the V oc measured on full devices  30  by finding a good agreement between the two values, thus confirming the direct relationship between optical and electrical measurements. A similar approach to evaluate the recombination processes of 3D-2D interfaces in a n-i-p architecture was performed by Sutanto et al.  22  , where the interfacial passivation was considered as the main process affecting the losses. However, cation interfacial passivation, not only reduce the non-radiative recombination, but also favour the carrier extraction that, on the contrary, is limited in the case of full 2D perovskite formation at the interfaces, acting as a barrier for the photo-generated carriers  22  . Finally, we determine the total losses due to non-radiative recombination in full devices by comparing the radiative voltage radiative voltage V oc rad with the measured V oc (ΔV= V oc rad -V oc ). In the reference sample ΔV ref is equal to 0.21 eV, while in the A-cations devices ΔV corresponds to 0.16 eV in the case of Cl-PEAI and to 0.15 eV in the case of F-PEAI, thus confirming the beneficial role played by the addition of the cations on the charge losses. To gain further insights regarding the carrier dynamics, we performed TR-FLIM analysis on two sets of samples: (i) thin films on glass and (ii) full cell devices (without the Ag metallic layer to allow for illumination from both sides). For both sets of samples, we analysed a reference sample with only bulk perovskite as well as Cl-PEAI and F-PEAI samples. The experiments were performed using a wide field illumination via a pulsed 532 nm laser with repetition rate of 40 kHz. For each sample, the fluence of the laser was varied from low (~10 11 ph.cm -2 ) to high level (~1.5 × 10 12 ph.cm -2 ) and all the samples were measured with both top and bottom illumination (and light collection). A complete list of the available data and conditions is reported in the Supplementary Information. Decays averaged over the image for low fluence (~10 11 ph.cm -2 ) by illuminating the samples from the thin films side are presented in Fig.  2c  (neat perovskite) and 2d (full devices). In the case of bare absorbers, the three decays are very similar, whereas for the full devices, the samples with the added A-cation layers show slower decay than the reference. We estimate that the slightly higher PL level obtained for the Cl-PEAI bare absorbers is not discriminating enough to conclude that this cation has a better passivation effect than its F-PEAI counterpart. Slower decays of multilayer samples do not necessarily imply better devices as passivation layers could hinder the amplitude of the current of charges flowing out of the cell. In this case, considering also that the short-circuit currents slightly increased upon modification with the A-cations (see Fig.  1c ), we can conclude that this passivation approach allows to reduce non-radiative recombination at the perovskite-charge transport layer interfaces while allowing for high currents to flow. Transient measurements thus confirmed that the passivation plays a key role only at the perovskite-charge transport layer interface, as also observed in the steady-state study. Importantly, the time-resolved analysis also proves that high non-radiative recombination is responsible for the fast decay of the reference cell of Fig.  2d , that therefore cannot be attributed to carrier extraction as sometimes reported in the literature  31, 32  . Next, we treated the datasets by using drift-diffusion model in order to quantify the induced passivation. However, fitting decays of multilayer samples remains challenging, as an incorrect modelling of the layer stack, of the band alignment or of the boundary conditions can easily lead to data misinterpretation  16, 33  . To overcome this issue, we chose to fit the simplest model possible, that is based on a thin film without the neighbouring extracting layers. Supplementary Figure  10  represents the fitting results of the cells' decays, the green dotted line is the fitted model, while the coloured curves correspond to the experimental data. We fit a unique drift-diffusion model to represent simultaneously four curves, i.e. decays acquired in bottom and top configuration at low and high fluence. The fitted parameters are the top and bottom surface recombination velocitiesall the other parameters are fixed, see Supplementary Materials for more details. We consider the bulk Table  1  Values of radiative QFLS Δµ rad ; QFLS Δµ for the different stacks (neat perovskite (pvk), half cells (glass/ITO/PTAA/ pvk) and full stacks (glass/ITO/PTAA/pvk/PCBM/BCP)); V oc rad and V oc for reference, Cl-PEAI and F-PEAI samples.

The fitting results for bottom surface recombination velocity on full devices are presented in Fig.  2d . We observe a drastic reduction of the recombination velocities at the top surface (S top ) for the two passivation strategies. In particular, S top was reduced by a factor varying from nine to five going from ~900 cm/s for the reference to ~110 cm/s and ~200 cm/s for the Cl-PEAI and F-PEAI samples respectively, as shown in Table  2 . For unpassivated classical semiconductors, surface recombination velocities are of the order of 10 5 -10 6 cm/s  [34] [35] [36]  , while passivated surfaces may reach low values in the range of 10-10 2 cm/s  34, 37, 38  . For perovskite films, even unpassivated, we  39, 40  and others  34, 41  have found surface recombination velocities of the order of 10 3 cm/s which are fully compatible with our present analysis. Again, the TR-FLIM results are consistent with those obtained via the hyperspectral studies, showing that the passivation mainly takes place at the perovskite/ETL interface. V oc rad (V) V oc (V) Reference 1. Quantitative optical microscopy analysis. It is noteworthy that the passivation of the top surface is achieved by incorporating the A-cations into the antisolvent used for triggering the perovskite layer crystallisation, thus raising the question regarding the homogeneity of passivation obtained by this method. In order to better assess the homogeneity of the passivation over the samples surface, we mapped the optoelectronic properties by spectrally and temporally resolved photoluminescence imaging analysis on the full stack without the silver rear electrode. We first fitted the PL spectra pixel-by-pixel  39, 42  by using the model proposed by Katahara and Hillhouse  43, 44  to extract key physical parameters like the bandgap energy (E g ), the quasi-Fermi levels splitting (Δμ or QFLS) and the Urbach energy (E u ) from absolutely calibrated spectral images. More details on the fitting model are provided in the Supplementary Information section. The maps of the QFLS are shown in Fig.  3a-c . All the samples, reference and most importantly cation modified samples, show a good homogeneity with a standard deviation in the order of 0.006 eV. Moreover, no areas with values of QFLS comparable to pure 3D cells, i.e. in the range of 1.110 ± 0.013 eV, can be observed on the Cl-PEAI and F-PEAI samples, proving the uniformity of the passivation effect induced by the cations. The introduction of the large cations has thus produced a clear reduction of non-radiative losses and importantly we demonstrate that the passivating agents act uniformly on the whole surface of the solar cell. However, in the three cases, small spatial fluctuations in the order of few meV in the 10 µm range are distinguishable. These minor inhomogeneities may be due to the spin-coating process. In Fig.  3d-f  we investigate the variations of the E u which again exhibits a good homogeneity. The determined values are in line with E u values reported in the literature and measured by different characterisation methods  45  . To highlight the correlations between the different optoelectronic properties, as well as the statistic distribution of the determined parameters over the maps, we report the correlation between E g and QFLS and between E u and QFLS measured at each pixel, as shown in Fig.  3g, h . All the physical parameters, namely E g , QFLS and E u , have a small statistical dispersion. The introduction of the A-cations results in a minimal increase of the gap of the material in the order of few meV but significantly impacts the QFLS that shows a substantial raise of its average value from 1.11 eV up to 1.18 eV. A very small variation of E u of ~1 meV is observed when comparing the reference to the A-cations passivated devices. Moreover, this analysis suggests that the addition of the cations does not significantly affect the bulk recombination kinetics of the absorber as QFLS (in the case of bare absorbers), E g and the E u , do not vary significantly after the A-cations addition. Finally, we wanted to further confirm the homogeneity of the A-cation deposition as well as their role in the interface physics. To do so, we used TR-FLIM acquisitions to map the local decay times, often called ""lifetime"", for the three full stacks (glass/ITO/ PTAA/perovskite/BCP/PCBM), as shown in Fig.  4a-d . In general, the definition of ""lifetime"" is ambiguous, as it does not represent an intrinsic property of the material (e.g. it is dependent on the excitation conditions), and does not always correlate well with the electrical figures of merit, such as the open circuit voltage  15  . For these reasons we employ here the term decay time. If we place ourselves in the correct setting -after the carrier distribution has homogenised in depth and with low radiative recombination -the decay time of PL is a measure of the non-radiative recombination. In the case of triple cation mixed halide perovskite thin films this corresponds to a few tens to one hundred nanoseconds after the laser pulse  46  . We use then the decay times to map the nonradiative recombination in our devices. To get a high signal to noise ratio for the images we used the high fluence (1.5 × 10 12 ph.cm -2 ) acquisitions, as reported in Fig.  4a-d . Here the decay time is defined as the inverse slope of the logarithm of the local decay fitted between 90 ns and 500 ns after the laser pulse, see SI for more details. Figure  4a-c  are thus representative of the non-radiative recombination in the devices. Overall, an excellent homogeneity was achieved at the 1 mm 2 scale for the F-PEAI and Cl-PEAI samples. The histograms of Fig.  4d  display that the difference between reference and modified samples in terms of non-radiative recombination is statistically significant. The mean decay time on the maps extracted from the high fluence acquisitions are found to be 84.6 ns for the reference, 107.9 ns for the F-PEAI and 117.35 ns for Cl-PEAI. The images of the passivated layers show a slightly wider distribution of decay time, compared to the reference sample with a standard deviation of 6.7 ns for the reference and 8.7 ns and 8.2 ns for the F-PEAI and Cl-PEAI, respectively. This analysis provides us with an approximate estimate for the uncertainty and noise level on the images. The decay time maps thus show the homogeneity of the interfacial cation addition treatment resulting in a uniform improvement of decay times for the A-cation modified devices, further confirming the reduction of non-radiative recombination. Moreover, we provide the decay times for the full stacks when the carrier density of the transient experiment is ~10 15 cm -3 , which is the order of magnitude of carrier density expected at 1 sun continuous illumination condition for perovskite devices close to the radiative limit  47  . To obtain these values of decay time, we used a procedure described in the SI for the low fluence (10 11 ph.cm -2 ) acquisitions that yields decay times of 102 ns (±7%) for the reference cell, 254 ns ±(3%) for the Cl-PEAI cell and 261 ns (±3%) for the F-PEAI cell. For the low fluence dataset, the local signal to noise ratio of the maps is too low for the local determination of the decay time and therefore we do not show maps for this illumination condition. 
 Discussion In conclusion, we have investigated the interface recombination dynamics related to an emergent passivation approach in the field of perovskite solar cells based on the introduction of large cations at the absorber interfaces by coupling electrical and optoelectronic characterisation methods and modelling. In particular, we demonstrated that the introduction of large organic cations such as Cl-PEAI and F-PEAI resulted in a drastic reduction of interfacial recombination processes leading to PCE up to 23.34%, one of the highest ever reported for a p-i-n architecture. Importantly, we proved that this passivation approach does not significantly act on the surface defects of the absorber layer but drastically reduce the non-radiative recombination at the interface perovskite/PCBM. Indeed, the major improvement in terms of QFLS was observed after the deposition of the ETL, with an increment from 1.11 eV to 1.18 eV for passivated devices. Conversely, in the case of neat perovskite thin films the QFLS remained almost constant after the two cations deposition. The same behaviour was also observed for transient measurements that showed identical decays in the three cases. Finally, photoluminescence maps and decay times maps of full devices proved that the cations were uniformly deposited over the perovskite surface at the micrometre scale and that the main bulk optoelectronic properties of the absorber such as the energy gap and the Urbach energy were homogenous at a local level. This work provides insights into the processes occurring at the interfaces of highly efficient perovskite solar cells, which are fundamental for further progress in the field and makes this passivation method extremely promising to approach the theoretical limit of perovskite devices.

Perovskite films and devices were fabricated using PbI 2 and PbBr 2 (99.99% purity) purchased from TCI, organic halide salts purchased from GreatCell Solar and Cesium Iodide (99.99% purity) purchased from Alfa Aesar. The poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The PC61BM was purchase from Solenne. The bathocuproine (BCP; sublimed grade, 99.99% purity). All the anhydrous solvents were purchased from Acros Organics. Perovskite film preparation and device fabrication. Pre-patterned ITO/glass substrates were sequentially cleaned with acetone and isopropanol by ultrasonication for 15 min. The ITO/glass substrates were then dried with N2 and treated with oxygen plasma at 100 mW for 10 min. The HTL and the perovskite films were fabricated in a drybox (relative humidity <2 %), while the ETL and the contacts were deposited inside a glovebox filled with inert atmosphere N 2 . For reference devices, a hole transport layer of ∼10 nm thickness made of PTAA with a concentration of 1.5 mg ml -1 dissolved in toluene was spin-coated at a speed of 2000 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. After the annealing step, the samples were washed by DMF by spin-coating it on the prepared PTAA films at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The perovskite precursor solution (1.2 M) composed of mixed cations (Pb, Cs, FA and MA) and halides (I and Br) was dissolved in mixed solvent (DMF/DMSO = 4/1) according to a formula of Cs 0.05 (FA 5/6 MA 1/6 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.9 Br 0.1 ) 3 with an excess of PbI 2 of 1%. The piperidinium salt [BMP] + [BF4]was dissolve in the perovskite solution obtained with the molar ratio 0.25 mol %. The perovskite is deposited via a two-step spin-coating procedure with 1000 r.p.m. for 12 s and 5000 r.p.m. for 27 s was adopted for the preparation of perovskite films. A mixture of antisolvents (CB/IPA = 9/1, 150 μl) was dripped on the spinning substrate during the 21 s of the second spin-coating step. Subsequently, the sample was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. The electron transport layers were dynamically deposited from a PC61BM solution (20 mg/mL in CB) and spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at the speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s (with a ramping speed of 1000 rpm/s) and annealed for 10 min at 100 °C. Next, thin layers of BCP (0.5 mg/mL in IPA) were spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s (with a ramping rate of 1000 rpm/s) as hole blocking layers. The devices with an area of 4.5 mm 2 were completed by thermally evaporating of Ag (80 nm). The devices with modified interfaces were prepared by dissolving a small amount of the A-cations in DMF (20 mM) used for washing the PTAA and in the mixture CB/IPA (0.5 mM) used in the antisolvent step. Photovoltaic device characterisation. Current density-voltage measurements were performed in ambient conditions under simulated AM 1.5 light with an intensity of 100 mW cm -2 (Abet Sun 3000 Class AAA Solar Simulator). The intensity was calibrated using a Si reference cell (NIST traceable, VLSI), and corrected by measuring the spectral mismatch between the solar spectrum, reference cell, and the spectral response of the PV device. The mismatch factor obtained was approximately 1.1. Cells were scanned using a Keithley 2450 source measure unit from 1.2 to 0 V and back, with a step size of 0.025 V and a dwell time of 0.1 s, after light soaking for 2 s at 1.2 V. The pixel area was 3 mm × 1.5 mm. XRD. XRD patterns were measured in ambient air using a Bruker D2 Phaser diffractometer equipped with a Cu-Anode (λ = 1.54060 Å) and a LYNX-EYE detector in 1D mode. All scans (coupled 2θ/θ, 2θ = 10°-45°, step size 0.02°) were background corrected using the Bruker Diffrac.Eva software. Hyperspectral characterisation. The hyperspectral imaging system records a luminescence intensity signal along three dimensions {x,y,λ}. The set-up is composed by a home-built microscope with Thorlabs optomechanical elements, a 2D bandpass filtering system from company Photon Etc with 2 nm resolution, and a 1Mpix silicon-based CCD camera PCO1300. The sample was illuminated (λ = 405 nm) through an infinity-corrected ×50 Nikon objective with numerical aperture of 0.6, and the luminescence is collected through the same objective. The excitation beam and luminescence signals are separated with appropriate Thorlabs dichroic beam splitter (DMLP 495) and filters (FESH 450, FELH 450). The 2D luminescence signal is corrected for each pixel of the sensor from the spectral transmissions along all the optical path, from the read noise and dark current noise of the camera. The incident photon flux measured was 100 mW/cm 2 , corresponding to 1 sun equivalent photon flux. We obtained this photon flux by dividing the measured power of the LED used for the illumination under the objective over the LED spot size at the working distance of the objective. All the acquisitions were performed in nitrogen atmosphere. Post-treatment of the data cubes includes a deconvolution and fit to the generalised Planck law, which are realised with a dedicated Matlab routine employing the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. TR-FLIM characterisation. The TR-FLIM setup records luminescence intensity over an imaging sensor and as a function of time. We used a Princeton Instrument PiMAX4 gated camera. We used 3 ns wide temporal gates that we slid in time to record the local decays of the films. The illumination was performed with a Coherent Laser (λ = 532 nm, pulse width 15 ps), defocused and homogenised by a rotating diffuser to obtain a flat and homogenous wide field excitation. The repetition rate of the laser was set to 40 kHz.To estimate the fluences, the wide field illumination was imaged with a portable CCD array to obtain the illumination area while the incident power was also measured. A ×10 objective was used both for excitation and collection, and the laser was filtered out with a DMLP650R beam splitter as well as with a FEL0680 filter. Each acquisition was repeated two times in a row to check for any reproducibility issue (none was found) and to obtain a better average signal to noise ratio.

Efficient and stable solution-processed planar perovskite solar cells via contact passivation

Planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) made entirely via solution processing at low temperatures (<150°C) offer promise for simple manufacturing, compatibility with flexible substrates, and perovskite-based tandem devices. However, these PSCs require an electron-selective layer that performs well with similar processing. We report a contact-passivation strategy using chlorine-capped TiO 2 colloidal nanocrystal film that mitigates interfacial recombination and improves interface binding in low-temperature planar solar cells. We fabricated solar cells with certified efficiencies of 20.1 and 19.5% for active areas of 0.049 and 1.1 square centimeters, respectively, achieved via low-temperature solution processing. Solar cells with efficiency greater than 20% retained 90% (97% after dark recovery) of their initial performance after 500 hours of continuous room-temperature operation at their maximum power point under 1-sun illumination (where 1 sun is defined as the standard illumination at AM1.5, or 1 kilowatt/square meter). 
 M etal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive research interest for next-generation solution-processed photovoltaic (PV) devices because of their high solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low fabrication cost  (1) (2) (3) (4) . The top-performing PSCs, which have reached a certified PCE of 22.1%, have relied on hightemperature-sintered (450°to 550°C) mesoporous TiO 2 as the electron-selective layer (ESL)  (5) (6) (7) . However, this high-temperature processing makes manufacture more complex and hampers the development of flexible modules and perovskitebased monolithic tandem devices. To overcome this limitation, researchers have pursued planar PSCs that exploit low-temperature (typically <150°C) solution-processed charge-selective layers. Metal oxide materials such as TiO 2 , ZnO, SnO 2 , and Zn 2 SnO 4 colloidal nanoparticles synthesized at low temperatures have commonly been used as the ESL  (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . Very recently, high-efficiency (certified 19.9%), small-area PSCs have been achieved using low-temperature-processed SnO 2  (17, 18) . Unfortunately, long-term device operational stability has remained far inferior to that of counterpart devices made using high-temperature-processed ESLs  (19) (20) (21) (22) . Furthermore, the high efficiency and large area required for industrialization have yet to be demonstrated in lowtemperature planar PSCs (table  S5 )  (23) (24) (25) . We reasoned that performance and stability loss in low-temperature planar PSCs could arise from imperfect interfaces and charge recombination between the selective contact at the illumination side and the perovskite film grown on top  (4, 26, 27) , as the perovskite active layers themselves have excellent long-term photostability upon the addition of formamidinium (FA), Cs, and Br ions  (19) (20) (21) (22) 28) . Once the impressively long photocarrier diffusion lengths in perovskite films are achieved, attention must shift to perfecting the interface  (29) (30) (31) (32) . We reasoned that deep trap states present at the perovskite/ ESL interface could potentially be addressed by passivating the interface between the chargeselective contact and the perovskite absorber. We devised a simple and effective interfacepassivation method that leads to efficient and stable low-temperature-processed planar PSCs. Chlorine-capped TiO 2 colloidal nanocrystal (NC) films processed at <150°C were used as the ESL. The chloride additive in perovskite precursor solutions enhances grain-boundary passivation in MAPbI 3-x Cl x (MA, methylammonium cation, CH 3 NH 3 + ) PSCs  (33) (34) (35) (36) . We found that the interfacial Cl atoms on the TiO 2 NCs suppress deep trap states at the perovskite interface and thus considerably reduce interface recombination at the TiO 2 /perovskite contact. The interfacial Cl atoms also lead to strong electronic coupling and chemical binding at the TiO 2 /perovskite planar junction, as projected in previous theoretical studies  (37) . As a result, we fabricated hysteresis-free planar PSCs with independently certified PCEs of 20.1% for small-area devices (0.049 cm 2 ) and 19.5% for large-area devices (1.1 cm 2 ). The low-temperature planar PSCs with high initial PCE >20% exhibit excellent operational stability and retain 90% (97% after dark recovery) of their initial performance after 500 hours operating at their maximum power point (MPP) under constant 1-sun illumination (where 1 sun is defined as the standard illumination at AM1.5, or 1 kW/m 2 ). We first used density functional theory (DFT) to examine defect passivation and interface binding by interfacial chlorine at the TiO 2 /perovskite interface (Fig.  1 , fig.  S1 , and table  S1 )  (38) . We found that Cl at the interface results in stronger binding at the TiO 2 /perovskite interface for both the cases of MAX-and PbX 2 -terminated (X = Cl, I) perovskite surfaces. Perovskite films with the PbX 2 -terminated interface are energetically favored to contact the TiO 2 . Previous studies  (39) (40) (41)  have shown that, in bulk perovskites, the most detrimental defects (deep-level defects) are antisites but that their formation energy is relatively high, which explains the low trap-state density in MAPbI 3 perovskite films and single crystals. Vacancies and interstitials, although much more abundant, are shallow defects. We thus explored the effect of Cl at the interface on both antisite and vacancy defects. Without Cl, a Pb-I antisite defect leads to localized states near the valence band edge (Fig.  1A ). These states can capture holes and become nonradiative recombination centers. In contrast, the formation energy of the Pb-Cl antisite at the PbCl 2 -terminated interface is higher (i.e., less favorable to form), which indicates that antisite defects are suppressed in the presence of interfacial Cl atoms. The Pb-Cl antisite defect becomes much shallower and more delocalized (Fig.  1B ) and has little effect on interface recombination. Overall, the incorporation of Cl atoms at the TiO 2 /perovskite interface resulted in a lower density of interfacial trap states (fig.  S1, B  and D ), as well as stronger binding between TiO 2 and perovskite (table  S1 ). We devised a synthetic approach to obtain Cl-capped TiO 2 NCs as the ESL in solar cells. We first synthesized ~5-nm-diameter anatase TiO 2 NCs (fig.  S2 )  (38)  via a nonhydrolytic method through the reaction of TiCl 4 and benzyl alcohol at 85°C under ambient atmosphere  (42, 43) . This process resulted in Cl-capped TiO 2 NCs (TiO 2 -Cl) with 12 ± 2 atomic % of Cl relative to Ti atoms, as determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig.  1C ). A mixture of methanol and chloroform was used to disperse the NCs while preserving surface Cl ligands. XPS confirmed that surface Cl ligands were well retained after we formed films from a methanolchloroform cosolvent (Fig.  1C ). In contrast, the surface Cl ligands were detached from TiO 2 surfaces when the washed NCs were redispersed in ethanol with a stabilizer such as titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TiAcAc). Such TiO 2 NCs that lack Cl ligands-the ESL materials used in previous reports (8, 9)-were taken as controls in the present study. Henceforth, we refer to the TiO 2 ESL with Cl ligands as TiO 2 -Cl and the TiO 2 ESL lacking the Cl ligands as TiO 2 . The Cl atoms were strongly bound to TiO 2 , and the Cl ligands of TiO 2 thin film were retained on the surface after annealing up to 250°C (Fig.  1D ). We fabricated planar PSCs with TiO 2 as the ESL with the device architecture of Fig.  2A . The TiO 2 -Cl film on indium tin oxide (ITO)coated glass obtained by spin-coating was smooth and pinhole-free (Fig.  2B  and fig.  S3A ). The film also exhibited negligible parasitic absorption loss over the entire visible-to-near-infrared spectral range (fig.  S3B ). Post-annealing treatment at moderate temperatures was applied to improve the quality of the spin-cast TiO 2 -Cl film. The best PV performance was achieved with a TiO 2 -Cl annealing temperature of 150°C (table  S2  and fig.  S4 ). The mixed cation-halide perovskite layer FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45 , with a thickness of ~600 nm, was deposited on the TiO 2 -Cl film using the antisolvent method  (38, 44, 45) . The processing solvent for perovskite precursors (e.g., dimethylsulfoxide) did not remove surface Cl ligands from the TiO 2 -Cl film (fig.  S5 ). The bulk quality of perovskite films was similar on both TiO 2 -Cl and TiO 2 , a consequence of their identical processing. Smooth pinhole-free perovskite films with uniform and large grains were formed on both TiO 2 -Cl and TiO 2 (Fig.  2C    and fig.  S6 ). As expected from the stoichiometric ratio of the precursors, x-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra show no obvious PbI 2 nor other nonperovskite phases in films (Fig.  2D ). The sharp absorption edge and narrow photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the perovskite film confirm a homogenous and single-phase material (fig.  S7 ). The perovskite films on both TiO 2 -Cl and TiO 2 exhibit a very low trap-state density of ~3 × 10 15 cm -3 , as determined using the space-charge limited current method (fig.  S8 ). The band alignment between TiO 2 -Cl (or TiO 2 ) and perovskite was determined from ultraviolet (UV) photoelectron spectroscopy and absorption measurements (fig.  S9 ). The excellent match in conduction band minimum between TiO 2 -Cl and perovskite allowed efficient electron transfer into TiO 2 -Cl, whereas the high offset in valence band maximum provided efficient hole blocking. We used steady-state and time-resolved PL spectroscopy to study the charge transfer kinetics between perovskite and ESLs. When perovskite films were formed on TiO 2 and TiO 2 -Cl, the steady-state PL was quenched because of fast electron transfer to the ESLs (Fig.  2E ). Figure  2F  shows the PL decays of the perovskite films on bare glass and on the TiO 2and TiO 2 -Cl-coated ITO glass substrates. Table  S3  summarizes the decays fit for biexponential components, a fast decay lifetime t 1 , and a slow decay lifetime t 2 . The perovskite film on bare glass had a long lifetime (t 2 ) of 470 ns. The PL lifetimes of perovskite films on ESLs were shortened to a similar degree for both TiO 2 and TiO 2 -Cl. This result indicates that both ESLs had sufficient electron extraction in solar cells, consistent with the good band alignments between the ESLs and perovskite. To explore the effect of interfacial Cl atoms on the PV performance of planar PSCs, we made devices on the TiO 2 -Cl and control TiO 2 ESLs. Figure  S10  presents the statistical performance of 40 devices fabricated with otherwise-identical device processing on each type of ESL. Solar cells fabricated on TiO 2 -Cl exhibit considerably better performance than those on TiO 2 for all PV metrics: The average open-circuit voltage (V oc ) increased from 1.06 to 1.14 V with the incorporation of Cl, and the average fill factor (FF) increased from 69 to 77%. Correspondingly, TiO 2 -Cl resulted in a higher average PCE (19.8%) than the Cl-free TiO 2 (15.8%). Device performance measured after optimization is shown in Fig.  3A  and table  S4 . Our results confirm that the interfacial Cl atoms, not the bulk properties of TiO 2 ESLs, dominate the performance of these PSCs. Figure  3B  shows a histogram of PCE values over 200 planar PSCs fabricated on TiO 2 -Cl within a period of 3 months. Excellent reproducibility is indicated by the narrow distribution of PCE values. The best-performing devices with TiO 2 -Cl reached a PCE of 20.9%. The PCE from current density-voltage (J-V) sweeps is consistent with the stabilized maximum power output (fig.  S11 ). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum (fig.  S12 ) exhibited a broad plateau above 80% over the spectral range from 400 to 760 nm because of strong light harvesting within the thick perovskite film. Integration of the EQE curve with the AM1.5G solar spectrum yielded a photocurrent density of 22.6 mA cm -2 , in good agreement with the short-circuit current density (J sc ) value from J-V characterization. We also examined the hysteresis of solar cells made on TiO 2 -Cl and TiO 2 (Fig.  3A  and table  S4 ). Devices on TiO 2 -Cl showed negligible hysteresis, whereas devices made on TiO 2 exhibit strong hysteresis, similar to previous studies using low-temperature TiO 2 as the ESL  (8, 9) . The PV parameters of the Cl-free devices varied substantially with respect to scan direction. To gain further insight into the performance enhancement resulting from the use of TiO 2 -Cl, we characterized perovskite film properties, charge-transfer kinetics, and charge recombination in solar cells with TiO 2 and TiO 2 -Cl. The bulk quality of perovskite films and charge transfer were similar on both ESLs. Transient photocurrent decay under short-circuit conditions was obtained to study the influence of the ESL on charge transfer in solar cells (Fig.  3C ). Cells with the two ESLs had a comparable chargetransport lifetime (t t ~3.4 ms), indicating similar interfacial charge transfer. This similarity implies that either bulk quality or interfacial charge transfer is not the main reason for the solar cell performance enhancement by TiO 2 -Cl. We used transient photovoltage decay under the open-circuit condition to characterize solar cells and found that the charge-recombination lifetime (t r ) of the device on TiO 2 -Cl was substantially longer than that of the device on TiO 2 (145 versus 64 ms) (Fig.  3D ), consistent with slowed charge recombination at the TiO 2 -Cl/ perovskite interface. The reduced ideality factor of solar cells with TiO 2 -Cl (n = 1.25) compared to those with TiO 2 (n = 1.73) is consistent with suppressed interfacial recombination (fig.  S13 ). As seen in the DFT studies, interfacial Cl atoms suppress the formation of deep trap states on the surface of perovskite films, leading to improved surface passivation and reduced interfacial recombination. To examinetheapplicability of TiO 2 -Cl toother highefficiency PSCs, we fabricated devices using cesiumcontaining perovskite Cs 0.05 FA 0.81 MA 0.14 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45 (denoted as CsMAFA), which had been shown to improve performance and photostability compared with FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45 (denoted as MAFA)  (22, 46, 47) . The best-performing small-area CsMAFA solar cell (0.049 cm 2 ) exhibited a high laboratory PCE of 21.4% (V oc = 1.189 V, J sc = 22.3 mA/cm 2 , FF = 0.806) without hysteresis in J-V sweeps (Fig.  3E ). We also fabricated large-area (1.1 cm 2 ) CsMAFA solar cells on TiO 2 -Cl, showing a PCE value >20% with negligible hysteresis (Fig.  3F ). A small-area and a large-area device were sent, without encapsulation, to an accredited independent PV test laboratory (Newport Corporation PV Lab, Montana, USA) for certification. These devices produced certified PCEs of 20.1 and 19.5%, respectively (figs. S14 to S16). The large-area device exhibited ~3% performance loss relative to the small-area device. The certified PCE of 19.5% for the large-area, low-temperature planar PSC exceeds that of other reported lowtemperature or planar PSCs  (24, 25) , and it approaches the certified PCE of large-area cells that relied on high-temperature-sintered mesoporous TiO 2 (table S5)  (23, 38, 48) . We examined the long-term stability of lowtemperature planar PSCs made on TiO 2 -Cl and TiO 2 under dark storage as well as under operating conditions. The long-term stability of PSCs is closely related to the front ESL/perovskite interface binding strength and interfacial charge accumulation during operation  (49, 50) . The devices made on TiO 2 -Cl showed substantially enhanced stability relative to TiO 2 under dark storage (Fig.  4A ). MAFA-based devices on TiO 2 -Cl maintained 95% of their initial PCE after storage in the dark over 60 days, whereas those on TiO 2 only retained 38% of their initial efficiency (Fig.  4A ). The high-efficiency CsMAFA devices on TiO 2 -Cl (initial PCE > 21%) exhibited promising shelf stability, retaining 96% of their initial performance after 90 days (more than 2000 hours). Solar cells must operate stably under MPP conditions. The MAFA solar cells based on TiO 2 -Cl showed improved stability under continuous operation at MPP, as compared with devices based on TiO 2 (fig.  S17 ). The CsMAFA solar cells on TiO 2 -Cl (with a 420-nm cutoff UV filter) retained 90% of their initial performance after continuous operation for 500 hours under 1-sun illumination, as directly determined from the MPP tracking (Fig.  4B ). The PCE increased slightly in the first tens of hours of MPP operation, which may be caused by lightinduced defect healing in the perovskite active layer  (19, 51) . No perovskite decomposition was observed after MPP operation, as seen from the XRD results (fig.  S18 ), which indicates that the performance drop during MPP operation may be caused by defect generation in the perovskite layer  (52, 53)  and changes to the perovskite/ spiro-OMeTAD interface (the latter has previously been shown to be vulnerable)  (54) (55) (56) . The device self-recovered to an efficiency of 19.8% (97% of initial PCE) following dark storage (Fig.  4C ), consistent with previous reports  (18, 19, 52) . Overall, the stronger binding at the TiO 2 -Cl/ perovskite interface and the suppressed interfacial recombination account for superior stability in planar PSCs based on TiO 2 -Cl. The new approach to fabricate efficient and stable PSCs is simple and scalable, compatible with future industrialization of perovskite-based PV technology. It offers a promising path to flexible devices and, in combination with low-band-gap semiconductor materials, to the formation of tandem devices.  
 Materials and Methods 
 Density function theory calculation The DFT calculations were performed using a Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient exchange correlational function  [57] . All calculations were performed with mixed Gaussian and plane-wave basis set, using the molecularly optimized MOLOPT double ζ-valence polarized basis set as implemented in the quantum chemistry code CP2K  [58] . The charge density cutoff was fixed at 400 Ry along with a five-level multigrid and a relative energy cutoff of 60 Ry  [58] . The structural optimizations were performed using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm  [59]  until forces on all atoms were less than 10 -4 Ha/Bohr. The TiO 2 /MAPbI 3 interface was modeled using the (110)-TiO 2 /(110)-MAPbI 3 surface as discussed by De Angelis et al.  [37]  for which interface lattice-mismatch is minimal. A 3×5×3 perovskite slab consisting of 45 MAPbI 3 units with (110) exposed face was placed in contact with 5×3×2 slab of anatase TiO 2 consisting of 120 TiO 2 units with (110) exposed face. A vacuum of 15 Å was employed in the cross-plane direction (perpendicular to the interface) along with the periodic boundary conditions in the inplane directions. The lattice parameters of TiO 2 were fixed at the experimentally observed values and the MAPbI 3 slab was allowed to relax. Both MAX and PbX 2 (X=I, Cl) terminated perovskite surfaces were considered. The effect of Cl was taken into account by replacing all I atoms at the interface by Cl atoms. Only charge-neutral defects are considered in our calculations. MAX vacancy and PbX 2 vacancy, Pb-X antisite defects were considered in the case of MAX and PbX 2 terminated surfaces. For vacancy defects, one MAX or PbX 2 was randomly removed from the TiO 2 /MAPbX 3 interface; and for antisite defects, the positions of neighboring Pb and X atoms were flipped at the interface. The defect formation energies were calculated as: E ^F = E _product -E _pure , where E ^F is the formation energy of defect, E _product is the energy of TiO 2 /MAPbX 3 system with a defect (sum of energies of TiO 2 /MAPbI 3 system and one MAX/PbX 2 unit, in the case of MAX/PbX 2 vacancy defect) and E _pure is the energy of TiO 2 /MAPbI 3 in the absence of a defect. 
 Synthesis of TiO 2 nanocrystals The TiO 2 nanocrystals were synthesized following modified non-hydrolytic sol-gel method with all procedures in the ambient air. Firstly, 4 mL TiCl 4 (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) was injected drop by drop into 16 mL cold anhydrous ethanol (stored in the fridge before use) with strong stirring to avoid local overheating of ethanol. After the solution cooled down to room temperature, 80 mL of anhydrous benzyl alcohol was added to the previous solution after cooling and stirred for 10 min. The original yellow solution became reddish after the addition of benzyl alcohol. The mixed solution was then transferred into a 200-mL vail, which was firmly sealed and stored without stirring in an oven at 85 °C for 12 hours. After heating for one hour, the solution became yellow again. The product TiO 2 nanocrystals were then precipitated from the as-obtained solution by the addition of diethyl ether and isolated by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 2 min. The solid was subsequently washed by adding anhydrous ethanol and diethyl ether, followed by a similar centrifugation step (5000 rpm for 2 min). This washing procedure was repeated for twice. To obtain the chlorine-capped TiO 2 (TiO 2 -Cl) colloidal solution (~5 mg/mL), the washed TiO 2 nanocrystals were dispersed into anhydrous chloroform and anhydrous methanol (1:1 volume ratio). The solution is transparent and can be stable in air for at least 6 months without precipitation. To get non-Cl capped TiO 2 (TiO 2 ) colloidal solution, the washed TiO 2 nanocrystals were dispersed in anhydrous ethanol (concentration around 6 mg/mL) by the addition of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (15 µL/mL). The obtained solution are transparent and shows slight yellow color. 
 Planar perovskite solar cell fabrication The pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO, TFD Devices) coated glass was sequentially cleaned using detergent, acetone, and isopropanol. The TiO 2 -Cl and TiO 2 electron transport layers (ETLs) were spin-coated on ITO substrates from the colloidal TiO 2 nanocrystal solutions, and annealed on a hot plate at the displayed temperature of 150 °C for 30 min in ambient air. The thicknesses of TiO 2 -Cl and TiO 2 ETLs are about 60 and 50 nm, respectively. After the substrates had cooled, we transferred the TiO 2 -coated substrates immediately to a nitrogen-filled glovebox for the deposition of perovskite films. The FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45 precursor solution (1.2 M) was prepared in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO with a volume ratio of 4:1. The molar ratios for PbI 2 /PbBr 2 and FAI/MABr were both fixed at 0.85:0.15, and the molar ratio of (FAI+MABr)/(PbI 2 +PbBr 2 ) was fixed at 1:1. The Cs 0.05 FA 0.81 MA 0.14 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45 precursor solution (1.2 M) was prepared with molar ratios of PbI 2 /PbBr 2 and FAI/MABr both fixed at 0.85:0.15, molar ratio of CsI/(FAI+MABr)=0.05:0.95, and the molar ratio of (FAI+MABr+CsI)/(PbI 2 +PbBr 2 ) was fixed at 1:1. The perovskite films were deposited onto the TiO 2 substrates with two-step spin coating procedures. The first step was 2000 rpm for 10 s with an acceleration of 200 rpm/s. The second step was 4000 rpm for 20 s with a ramp-up of 1000 rpm/s. Chlorobenzene (100 µL) was dropped on the spinning substrate during the second spincoating step at 10 s before the end of the procedure. To form a thick but still smooth perovskite film, chlorobenzene was slowly dropped on the precursor film within ~3 seconds to allow sufficient extraction of extra DMSO through the entire precursor film. The substrate was then immediately transferred on a hotplate and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the hole-transport layer was subsequently deposited on top of the perovskite film by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s using a chlorobenzene solution which contained 65 mg/mL of Spiro-OMeTAD and 20 µL/mL of tert-butylpyridine, as well as 70 µL/mL of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (170 mg/mL in acetonitrile). Finally, 100 nm Au contact was deposited on top of Spiro-OMeTAD by electron-beam evaporation in an Angstrom Engineering deposition system. 
 Solar cell characterization The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under the illumination of the solar simulator (Newport, Class A) at the light intensity of 100 mW cm -2 as checked with a calibrated reference solar cell (Newport). Unless otherwise stated, the J-V curves were all measured in a nitrogen atmosphere with a scanning rate of 50 mV s -1 (voltage step of 10 mV and delay time of 200 ms). The steady-state PCE, PCE(t), was measured by setting the bias voltage to the V MPP and then tracing the current density. The V MPP at maximum power point was determined from the J-V curve. The active area was determined by the aperture shade mask (0.049 cm 2 for small-area devices and 1.1 cm 2 for large-area devices) placed in front of the solar cell to avoid overestimation of the photocurrent density. Spectral mismatch factor of 1 was used for all J-V measurements. EQE measurements were performed using an in-house built system with monochromatic light and white bias light (~0.1 Sun). The photodiode used for the calibration of EQE measurements has been calibrated by Newport. The dark long-term stability assessment of solar cells was carried out by repeating the J-V characterizations over various times. The devices without encapsulation were stored in a cabinet with dry air with relative humidity < 30%. The stability test at continuous MPP operation under 1 Sun, AM 1.5G illumination was carried out in nitrogen by fixing the voltage at V MPP and then tracking the current output. A 420-nm cutoff UV-filter was applied in front of the solar cells during the MPP tracking tests. The cells were purged with nitrogen flow for 1 hour before MPP tracking to get rid of residual moisture on the surface. We found that even residual moisture could cause much faster degradation, especially under MPP operational conditions. 
 Other characterizations High-resolution SEM images were obtained using the Hitachi S-5200 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 1 kV. HRTEM samples were prepared by adding a drop of the solution of TiO 2 nanocrystals onto an ultrathin-carbon film on lacey-carbon support film (Ted Pella 01824) and subsequently imaged using Hitachi HF3300 operating at 300 kV. XRD patterns were collected using a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 diffractometer equipped with a NaI scintillation counter and using monochromatized Copper Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). XPS analysis was carried out using the Thermo Scientific K-Alpha XPS system, with a 300 μm spot size, 75 eV pass energy, and energy steps of 0.05 eV. TiO 2 thin films were prepared on ITO substrates and electron flood gun was used for charge compensation to avoid peak shifting. All signals were normalized to Ti for direct comparison between different samples. Optical absorption measurements were carried out in a Lambda 950 UV/Vis spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) was measured using a Horiba Fluorolog time correlated single-photon-counting system with photomultiplier tube detectors. The light was illuminated from the perovskite film side. The excitation source is a laser diode at a wavelength of 540 nm. Transient photocurrent/photovoltage decays were measured on a home-made system. For the transient photovoltage decay measurements, a 480-nm light emitting diode was used to modulate the V oc with a constant light bias. The pulse duration is set to 1 µs and the repetition rate to 500 Hz. For the constant light bias, a continuous light source from a Xe lamp was coupled through a fiber to collimate on the active area of the solar cell under study. The intensity of the pulsed laser was set in a way that the modulated V oc was ~10 mV to               Fig. 2 . 2 Fig. 2. Device structure and characterization of perovskite films on TiO 2 -Cl.

Once the interfacial Cl atoms are incorporated into the perovskite crystal at TiO 2 -Cl/perovskite interface, the interfacial Cl atoms in the perovskite can be dissolved in DMSO solvent. The weak Cl 2p signal could be from the underlying Cl-ligands (away from the TiO 2 /perovskite interface, no contact with perovskite film) in the bulk of TiO 2 -Cl NC film.

Stable and scalable 3D-2D planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells via vapor deposition
The device stability and toxic-solvent-free processing are indispensable development to industrialize organometal halide perovskite solar cells. In this work, the conventional top surface of vapor prepared 3D-MAPbI 3 was replaced by 2D-(BA) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 perovskite platelet via molecular substitution from MA (CH 3 NH) to BA (C 4 H 9 NH 2 ). Our fully vapor process fabricated a 3D-2D perovskite heterojunction for solar cell application, realizing the power conversion efficiency as high as 16.50% and the average one as 15.40%. Furthermore, unencapsulated devices can sustain their 81% efficiency after 30 days under 55% RH, and also 74% efficiency after 30 days under 80 °C heat stress. Stability of humidity resistance arises from the reduced n value of 2D perovskite caused by the surface reaction of moisture, and the improvement of thermal stability comes from the buffering of MA molecules release. Meanwhile, the fabrication of large scale device with high efficiency is also demonstrated in our experiment.
Introduction Organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained intense attention since 2009  [1] . The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has rapidly increased from 3.8% to 23.7%, due to its unique features such as the excellent light absorption, suitable band gap, small exciton binding energy, and long carrier diffusion length  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Despite three-dimensional (3D) MAPbI 3 perovskite shows impressively high efficiencies, it still undergoes a fast degradation upon exposure to moisture because of its low structural formation energy and the pronounced hygroscopic nature  [12] . The volatile MA cations also leads to poor thermal stability as well  [13] . Compared with 3D perovskite structures, two-dimensional (2D) perovskite materials obtain much attention recently due to their superior moisture resistance and photothermal stability. By using ""Hot-Casting"" technology to fix out-ofplane crystal orientation, Hsinhan Tsai et al. get 12.52% PCE of the 2D perovskite solar cell with n = 4. The devices can sustain 60% initial PCE after 2250 h under continuous standard (AM1.5G) illumination  [14] . However, the further enhancement of PCE of 2D layered perovskite solar cells is highly challenging because of its large exciton binding energy, increased band gap and low conductivity across adjacent inorganic layers  [15] [16] [17] . When investigating the impact of structure dimension on stability and performance of PEA 2 (CH 3 NH 3 ) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 , Li et al. showed that device performance improved as the increase of n value, while sacrificed the stability  [18] . This provides the good strategy to design the experiments under the balance between efficiency and stability based on hybrid 3D-2D structure. Direct mixture of 2D and 3D perovskite is one feasible attempt. In 2017, Wang et al. added the n-butylammonium cations into a mixed-cation lead mixed-halide FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb(I y Br 1-y ) 3 3D perovskite. The formation of 2D perovskite was then found to suppress non-radiative charge recombination. The optimized solar cells exhibited the best stabilized power conversion efficiency of 19.5% and  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.03.014  Received 4 October 2018; Received in revised form 18 December 2018; Accepted 3 March 2019 sustain 80% efficiency after 1000 h in air  [19] .  Hu et al. combined  the Bi-based 2D perovskites solution and 3D MAPbI 3 solution to form 2D/ 3D structure and they found that the 2D perovskite located at the grain boundary and reduced the recombination centers inside the grains and the grain boundary  [20] . Another effective fabrication is to build the hybrid structure through forming a 2D capping layer on the 3D thin film. Chen et al. shows that a capping layer of 2D perovskite was formed via cation exchange by spin-coating a phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) solution upon the 3D perovskite film,  [21] . Similar experiment was also carried out by Chen et al., who dropped 5-ammoniumvaleric acid (5-AVA) solution on the surface with excess PbI 2 and formed an ultrathin 2D perovskite (5-AVA) 2 PbI 4 to improve the device stability and performance  [22] . Currently, the solution processed 2D/3D hybrid structure has shown the breakthrough point to enhance the stability, however, there are still some problems remains to be explored. First of all, the distribution of 2D in 3D phases cannot be easily controlled in the solution  [19, 23] . Band alignment mismatch and thus unfavorable charge recombination are likely to appear  [24] . Secondly, the reaction mechanism is still not well resolved. In 3D CsPbI 3 perovskite system, the PEA treatment was found not to react with the underlying 3D structure. So surface defect passivation is suggested instead of forming of 2D capping layer  [25] . Finally, traditional solution process is also hindered by the widely use of toxic solvent, such as N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)  [26] . It is hazardous to handle these toxic solutions during the industrialized production process. Green fabrication with solvent free is imperative for commercialization purpose  [27] . Vapor deposition of perovskite solar cell is one of the promising methods for mass production and green solvent-free device fabrication. Since the first research work used vapor deposition of perovskite was reported by Snaith's group  [28] , the PCE of the device fabricated by vapor phase preparation now reaches 20.13%  [29] . In this work, we provide a fully vapor fabrication of 3D-2D planar perovskite heterojunction for solar cells, via surface vaporized molecular exchange between BAI and the MAPbI 3 thin films. The optimized PSCs show champion PCE of 16.50%, and maintained their 83% output for 30 days under 55% RH, and 71% for 30 days at 80 °C heat stress, without encapsulation. 
 Experimental 
 Devices fabrication The electron transporting TiO 2 layer was spin coated (SETCAS Electronics Co., Ltd KW-4B) onto the FTO substrate at 5000 r.p.m. for 30 s, using precursor with 369 μl titanium isopropoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999%) and 0.15 ml 37 wt% HCl solution dissolved in 5 ml ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%). It was annealed in air at 500 °C for 30 min. 5 nm-thick C 60 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) and 150 nm-thick PbI 2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) were deposited onto the TiO 2 surface using thermal evaporation under vacuum of 5 × 10 -4 Pa and the deposition rate of 1 Å/s was measured using quartz crystal oscillation method with sensor near the sample. The as-prepared PbI 2 films were then placed facedown on a 2 cm height corundum boat with 100 mg MAI (TCI, 98%) powder uniformly dispersed at the bottom. The corundum boat was then placed into a vacuum oven preheated to 180 °C, and then pump down to 10 kPa in no more than 10 min (Fig.  S1 ). The whole reaction process lasts for 30 min for the fully formation of 3D-MAPbI 3 perovskite film. To fabricate the 3D-2D perovskite structure, the as-prepared 3D-MAPbI 3 perovskite film was treated by 50 mg BAI (TCI, 97%) with the procedure the same as the above, but with oven temperature set at 120 °C for 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 40 min and 60 min. After the reaction, the 3D-2D perovskite film was transferred immediately into a nitrogenfilled glove box and naturally cooled down to room temperature. 25 ml of 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) solution was spin-coated onto the as-prepared perovskite film at 5000 rpm for 30 s. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was synthesized according to our previous work  [30] . The sample was then oxidized for 21 h in a cabinet with controlled humidity under 10% RH. Finally, 80 nm-thick Au was deposited onto the spiro-OMeTAD layer through thermal evaporation method under a vacuum better than 5 × 10 -4 Pa and a deposition rate of 0.6 Å/s. 
 Characterization The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristic was measured with a Keithley 2400 source-meter together with a sunlight simulator (Zolix Sirius-SS150A, AM 1.5G) in a glovebox. KPFM images were obtained using NT-MDT NDTGRE with tip bias. Surface potential on difference devices is calibrated using Au as reference. The XRD patterns of the prepared films were measured using Rigaku miniflex 600. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra were measured using SHIMADZU UV-2600. Steady-state PL spectra measurements were taken with 532 nm laser source at room temperature (Horiba, LabRAM HR Evolution Inc.). The valance band maximum (VBM) was measured using ultraviolet photoelectron emission spectroscopy (UPS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ESCALAB 250), using the He I (21.2 eV) as excitation source. 
 Results and discussion The 3D CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite was prepared by a two-step vapor fabrication. A PbI 2 thin film of 150 nm was first evaporated on FTO/ TiO 2 substrate, and then exposed in a MAI vapor environment for 30 min under 180 °C (Fig.  1a ). Reaction according to equation (1) take places, which drive the formation of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . PbI 2 +CH 3 NH 3 I = CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 (1) nCH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 +2BAI = (BA) 2 (CH 3 NH 3 ) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 +CH 3 NH 3 I (2) The SEM image in Fig.  1b  shows that the as-prepared MAPbI 3 thin film is composed of compact crystals with sizes of around 800 nm. Formation of the 2D capping layer was accomplished by exposing the as-prepared MAPbI 3 thin film in the BAI vapor (equation (  2 )). Fig.  1c  shows that surface layered structure developed from the 3D grains in 5 min, indicating the partial transformation of 3D to 2D structure. The conversion of morphology proceeds with time and a surface with smaller layer structure was observed after 60 min reaction (Fig.  1d ). The crystal structure of the thin film was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in Fig.  2a . On the as-prepared MAPbI 3 thin film, typical diffraction peaks at 14.13°, 20.00°, 24.56°, 28.47°, 31.92°, were observed. They correspond to the (110), (  112 ), (  202 ), (  220 ), (310) crystal plane of tetragonal MAPbI 3 . It's found that after BAI vapor treatment, the diffraction peaks did not change until treatment time increase to 20 min. New diffraction peaks of 2D perovskite at 6.38°and 4.73°, corresponding to (002) plane of (BA) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 for n = 1 and n = 2 appeared. The appearance of new excitonic absorption peaks at 517 nm (n = 1), 570 nm (n = 2), 608 nm (n = 3) in the UV-Vis spectra (Fig.  2b ) also confirm the existence of 2D perovskite species in the 3D MAPbI 3 perovskites. This result shows that large alkyl ammonium BA has inserted into the 3D-MAPbI 3 structure and enlarged the distance between inorganic [PbI 6 ] layers by replacing MA to form a 2D perovskite in the thin film. If the 2D and 3D perovskite is in the mixing form, a decrease of n value of the whole perovskite can be expected, and thus broaden the band gap of the thin film. The absorption onset of the thin film in Fig.  2b  keeps constant at 780 nm, corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.59 eV of 3D structure. It suggests that the 2D perovskite does not mixed into the bulk. To locate the existence of 2D perovskite, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite surface and the interface between the perovskite and TiO 2 were measured (Fig.  2c  & Fig.  S2 ). It's found that once the 3D perovskite was exposed to BAI vapor, BA 2 MA 2 Pb 3 I 10 (n = 3) peak at 615 nm and BA 2 MA 1 Pb 2 I 7 (n = 2) peak at 577 nm were observed and increase with prolonging treatment time on the surface side. At the same time, the emission peak at 780 nm shift to 762 nm. It indicates the formation of surface 2D perovskite with higher n values, which has a higher band gap than the original 3D perovskite  [31] . In contrast, PL spectra at the interface detects no signal of 2D perovskite. It confirms that transformation of 3D to 2D structure only appears on the surface, showing the formation of a 3D-2D heterojunction structure. AFM images in Fig.  S3  show that the surface of the 3D perovskite thin film is compact and uniform. After treating with BAI vapor for 5 min, the grains turn to platelet crystals with layered structure, and the root square roughness slightly increase from 24.5 nm to 25.0 nm because of the formation of 2D structure. As the 2D structure shows different energy levels, which will alter the energy level alignment at the interface, we continue to measure the surface potential change on the surface using KPFM. Fig.  2d  & Fig.  S4  shows that as more and more 2D perovskite with smaller n value formed, the surface potential decreases from 530 mV to 96 mV. As the tip is biased in our measurement set-up, the decrease of surface  The inset shows the enlarge section between 550 nm and 650 nm. (d) CPD evolution for different BAI treatment time. The AFM tip is bias so as the decrease of CPD means an increase of vacuum level. (We performs the KPFM in Air, the work function may affected by absorbing H 2 O or O 2 . So the absolute value of work function cannot be taken exactly.) potential means that the upward band bending of vacuum level. This result indicates there is a building potential between 3D and 2D structure, which facilitates the separation of electron-hole. The results indicate that exposing the 3D perovskite thin film using BAI vapor allow slow formation of surface 2D layer and control of the energy structure. We fabricated solar cells with the above 3D-2D hybrid structure using device architecture consists of glass/FTO/TiO 2 /C 60 /3D-2D perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au in Fig.  3a . The effect of treatment time on the performance of the devices was shown in Fig.  3b  and Table  1 . As prepared 3D perovskite device has V oc of 1.01 V, J sc of 23.66 mA cm -2 , and FF of 72.40%, giving a PCE of 17.30% in reverse scan. The device shows a hysteresis index of 7.07%, which is calculate by (J Re- verse (0.8V oc )-J Forward (0.8V oc ))/J Reverse (0.8V oc ) (Fig.  S5a )  [32] . Although the above KPFM results shown that more 2D structure leads to stronger internal field for more efficient electron-hole separation, however, with increased treatment time, the PCE decrease was observed. To investigate the origin, we first investigate the dark current of the devices in Fig.  S5c . Rapid decrease of dark current with increasing treatment time was observed, which leads to a decrease of FF as shown in Table After long time treatment, the S-shape J-V curves was observed (Fig.  S5d ). This shows that transport of carrier is not only affected by the increasing resistance of 2D structures, but also by charging at the interface. To further reveal the mechanism, we analyzed the surface valance band structure evolution during the vapor treatment process in quantify. UPS measurement on samples with increasing treatment time in Fig.  4a  gives the SE cutoff edge at 17.26 eV, 17.19 eV, 17.18 eV, 17.17 eV, 17.16 eV, 17.15 eV, respectively, and the VB onset at 1.59 eV, 1.52 eV, 1.54 eV, 1.55 eV, 1.57 eV, 1.58 eV, respectively using logarithmic extraction method due to its low DOS at valance band  [33] . The   VBM position can be calculated by: E VBM = 21.22-(E SE-cutoff-edge -E VB-onset ) (3) The change of VBM is shown in Fig.  4c . It shows that the VBM becomes deeper as treatment time increases. It means that hole flowing to the Au back contact will encounter an increasing barrier. This VBM offset will induced hole accumulation at the interface, and thus cause reduction of J SC or even the S-shape. It's shown that when the treatment time was restricted at 5 min, the position of VBM lies at -5.55 eV, which is nearly the same as that of 3D counterpart. This energy level  alignment facilitates the extraction of holes and blocking of electrons. Therefore, the J SC and V OC are as high as that of the 3D devices in Fig.  3c . The 3D-2D device after 5 min treatment showed V OC of 1.02 V, J SC of 23.37 mA cm -2 , FF of 68.70% and thus the PCE reaches 16.50%. The hysteresis index of the device is reduced to 4.54%. Moreover, our device structure and fabrication process are proved to be suitable for large area fabrication. Fig.  3d  and e  shows typical devices with active area of 1.00 cm 2 fabricated using the same procedure. The 3D-2D device showed a PCE of 14.10% with J SC of 21.04 mA/ cm 2 , a V OC of 1.07 V, and an FF of 62.55% under reverse scanning measurement. It is similar to the 3D device, which shows PCE of 14.01% with a J SC of 21.91 mA/cm 2 , a V OC of 1.05 V, and an FF of 60.44%. The PCE difference is negligible in large area devices. We suggest that it comes from the reduction of leakage in the film because of more compact surface, where BAI insertion leads to lattice expansion. The stability of the devices is investigated in Fig.  5 . Both the asprepared 3D perovskite and hybrid structure after 5 min treatment shows good illumination stability, giving the stabilized power output (SPO) of 16.75% and 16.12% at maximum power point, as shown in Fig.  5a  and b . Both devices can reach a stable PCE rapidly. The 3D device only shows 95.78% SPO ratio, while the 3D-2D device shows better SPO ratio of 97.69%. The higher SPO ratio means that hysteresis of 3D-2D device is alleviated as compared to the 3D device  [20] . More importantly, the long-term thermal and humidity stability was greatly improved in 3D-2D heterostructure devices as shown in Fig.  5c  and d . Under 55% RH at room temperature without encapsulation, the PCE of as-prepared 3D-MAPbI 3 device decreases to 44% of its original PCE after 30 days, while the 3D-2D hetero-structure keeps 83% after 30 days. Under 80 °C ± 2 thermal aging, the PCE of the 3D device decrease to 27% in 14 days, while the 3D-2D hetero-structure keeps 73% after 30 days. To understand the mechanism of stability improvement, we first trace the change of XRD patterns under difference storage environment. It's found that the under 55% RH environment, strong PbI 2 peaks at 12.67°can be observed in 3D MAPbI 3 after 4 days. For the 3D-2D structure, although significant decrease of the (110) peaks intensity was observed, the PbI 2 peak is not observed at 9 days. At 14 days, a small PbI 2 peak appeared. Moreover, we can observe a strong peak at 10.50°a nd a small peak at 8.52°These peaks coincided with the (-101) and (100) reflections of monoclinic MAPbI 3 •H 2 O  [34] , indicating the formation of monohydrate. Reaction between 2D perovskite and H 2 O has been proposed as  [35] : → + ⋅ - + -- - -+ MA Pb I x H O MA Pb I x MAPbI H O BA ( ) BA ( ) n n n n x n x n x 2 1 3 1 2 2 ( ) 1 ( )3 ( ) 1 3 2 (4) This reaction shows that on the surface, the amount of 2D perovskite with high n value will be reduced, giving a surface layer with MAPbI 3 •H 2 O and 2D inside layer with smaller n value (Fig.  6c ). This process will increase the amount of 2D perovskite with smaller n. It's found from the XRD that a small peak at 9.54°also appears after 14 days storage. This peak consists with the n = 2 peak of BA 2 MAPb 2 I 7  [16] . It supports the above analysis and shows that n = 2 is the most stable form in the system. The generation of 2D perovskite with smaller n value at surface can protect the inner species and is helpful for the stabilization of devices. The thermal degradation of the 3D perovskite shows the similar quick degradation process as compared with humidity degradation of 3D perovskite film. However, the evolution of 3D-2D structure under heat stress shows difference with that of humidity degradation. From XRD monitoring, PbI 2 peak cannot be observed after 4 days storage. After 9 days, only the peak of PbI 2 was observed, no additional peaks appear (Fig.  S6b ). It means that the thermal degradation of 3D-2D system is different from the humidity degradation. To further investigate the change, we map the surface potential evolution using insitu KPFM under 80 °C. The surface of as-prepared 3D-MAPbI 3 perovskite thin film in Fig.  S7  shows uniform and smooth grains. After heating at 80 °C for 20 min, some nanoscale particles first appeared on the grain boundary (marked by the black arrow), and then dispersed to overall surface after 57 min. The surface roughness increases from initially 18.05 nm-20.76 nm after 57 min. KPFM shows that the surface potential decreased from 480 mV to 220 mV, this process can be understood by the formation of lower surface potential PbI 2 owning to release of MA molecules  [36] . The AFM topography evolution of the 3D-2D perovskite films shown in Fig.  7a -d is different. The 2D-(BA) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 platelet structure keeps robust under 80 °C heat stress for 56 min. It reflects that the 2D surface is more resistive to heat stress. Meanwhile, the change of surface potential of the 2D layer shows opposite tendency to that of thermal degradation of 3D-MAPbI 3 , with value increases from 350 mV to 660 mV. It indicates that the perovskite does not experience the thermal decomposition to PbI 2 . If revisit the surface potential change of 2D perovskite in Fig.  2d , where the surface potential decreases as n value decreases, it can be found that the surface potential evolution during decomposition of the 2D layer has inverse tendency to the formation process, and thus an increase of n value can be expected. As a result, we suggest that the thermal decomposition is an inverse process to the 2D perovskite growth (Fig.  7f ). At high temperature, the MA species inside the MAPbI 3 counterpart is released to the top 2D layer, while the BA species slightly diffuses inside. This interdiffusion behavior leads to the formation BA 2 (MA) n Pb n+1 I 3n+4 from a (BA) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 grain. Improvement of the thermal stability comes from generation of 2D perovskite with high n value, which buffers the release of MA species inside the film. 
 Conclusion In summary, we have successfully fabricated 3D-2D planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells by BAI vapor treatment of 3D-MAPbI 3 perovskite films. Compared with the 3D-MAPbI 3 perovskite solar cells, the mixed 3D-2D planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells show better stability in humidity by forming 2D perovskite with smaller n value to prevent direct reaction between H 2 O and MAPbI 3 , and also demonstrate better thermal stability by buffering the release of MA molecules in the film. The non-encapsulation device shows a champion PCE of 16.50% and can maintain their 84% efficiency after 30 days under 55% RH, and 72% efficiency after 30 days under 80 °C heating stress. Moreover, the device with 1 cm 2 active area fabricated with the same processes gives PCE as high as 14.10%, showing the potential of scale-up fabrication. Additionally, this fully vapor fabrication of 3D-2D perovskite heterojunction solar cell avoids the use of toxic solvent entirely. It finally provides a potential green way of mass production of large-area perovskite solar cell with high stability solar cells in the future. Fig. 1 . 1 Fig. 1.

Defect Passivation of Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites by Diammonium Iodide towards High-Performance Photovoltaic Devices
All materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich without further purification unless stated specifically. CH 3 NH 3 I was synthesized by reacting 33 wt% CH 3 NH 2 in ethanol with 57% HI in water solution at a 2:1 molar ratio of CH 3 NH 2 to HI and 0ºC for 2h.  1  The product was collected by removing solvent through rotary evaporation, followed by diethyl ether washing until colorless and recrystallized twice in ethanol. The crystalline white powder was finally dried in a vacuum oven at 60 ºC for 24 h. NH 3 I(CH 2 ) 4 NH 3 I (C4), NH 3 I(CH 2 ) 8 NH 3 I (C8) and NH 3 I(CH 2 ) 2 O(CH 2 ) 2 O(CH 2 ) 2 NH 3 I (EDBE) are synthesized and purified in a similar way except that NH 2 (CH 2 ) 4 NH 2 , NH 2 (CH 2 ) 8 NH 2 and NH 2 (CH 2 ) 2 O(CH 2 ) 2 O(CH 2 ) 2 NH 2 are mixed with HI at a 1:2.2 molar ratio in ethanol respectively. 
 Substrate cleaning, CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 film fabrication, and post treatment process: ITO (15 ohm/sq) glass substrates were cleaned sequentially with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol under sonication for 10 min each. After drying under a N 2 stream,
substrates were further cleaned by a UV ozone treatment for 10 min. Cu-doped NiO x precursor were spin coated onto the cleaned ITO substrate at 3000 rpm for 60 s and annealed at 400 °C for 1 h in air. The perovskite precursor solution was made by dissolving an equimolar ratio of PbI 2 (1 M)   and CH 3 NH 3 I (1 M) into a mixed solvent of DMSO and GBL (volume ratio of 3:7) at 60°C and filtering through 0.45µm PTFE filter. Perovskite layers were formed by spin-coating the precursor solution at 1000 rpm for 15 s and 4000 rpm for 45 s sequentially. During the last 15 s of the second spin-coating step, the substrate was treated with toluene drop-casting (0.7 mL). The resulting thin films were annealed at 100 o C for 10 min. After annealing, the film was cooled down to room temperature. C4, C8 and EDBE were dissolved in IPA in a concentration of 1 mg/mL, 2 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL respectively. 20mL vials with 3mL solution in it were used for post treatment through 10s immersion. Following that the substrate was blow dried by N 2 blow gun and further immersed in a 20mL vial containing 3mL IPA for 2s washing followed by N 2 blow gun drying. 
 2D hybrid perovskite film fabrication The 2D hybrid perovskite precursor solution was made by dissolving an equimolar ratio of PbI 2 (0.3 M) and diammonium iodide (0.3 M) in DMF at 60°C and filtering through 0.45µm PTFE filter. Perovskite layers were formed by spin-coating the precursor solution at 3000 rpm for 60 s. The resulting thin films were annealed at 100 o C for 10 min. 
 Device Fabrication and Characterization: ITO glass cleaning, Cu:NiOx deposition, and CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 film growth are discussed above. Atop the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 film, PCBM (15 mg/ mL in chloroform (CF)) and C 60 -bis surfactant (2 mg/mL in IPA) were sequentially deposited by spin coating at 4k rpm for 30 s and 3k rpm for 30 s, respectively. Silver electrodes with a thickness of 150 nm were finally evaporated under vacuum (<2 x 10 -6 Torr) through a shadow mask. The device area was defined as 3.14 mm 2 . All J-V curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter unit. The device photocurrent was measured upon illumination from a 450 W thermal Oriel solar simulator (AM 1.5G) calibrated with a standard Si photodiode detector equipped with a KG-5 filter, which can be traced back to the standard cell of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). 
 Characterization: X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were performed using a Bruker F8 Focus Powder XRD operating at 40 kV and 40 mA with a Cu K-alpha (1.54 A) X-ray source. Secondary electron images were taken with a FEI Sirion scanning electron microscope at 5 kV. Time-resolved PL decay traces were acquired by a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system (FluoTime 100, PicoQuant GmbH). Samples were photoexcited using a 467 nm laser beam (LDH-P-C-470, PicoQuant GmbH) pulsed at frequencies between 0.5-10MHz, with a pulse duration of 60 ps and fluence of ∼10 nJ/cm 2 . Perovskite films for PL studies were prepared on glass to highlight the intrinsic PL behavior before and after C8 treatment. The lifetime was obtained by fitting the PL measured from perovskite films with a bi-exponential decay function of the form:    O rganometal trihalide perovskites (OTPs) have under- gone a rapid development as promising photovoltaic materials with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) increasing from 3.8% to 22% within just a few years.  [1] [2] [3] [4]  Besides high absorption coefficient, ambipolar charge transport, high charge carrier mobility, and long electron-hole diffusion lengths,  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]  OTPs' compatibility with simple low-temperature solution processes provides great promise for future commercialization.  10  However, a consequence of solution processing is the polycrystallinity of prepared thin films, which results in substantial structural disorder and crystallographic defects.  11, 12  Several reports have identified the prevalence of vacancy and interstitial defects in OTP thin films due to their low formation energies.  [13] [14] [15] [16]  In principle, these defects incur trap-assisted nonradiative recombination losses and thus deteriorate the resulting photovoltaic performance. In addition, vacancy defects provide a pathway for ion migration, which adversely affects the charge collection and results in current-voltage hysteresis.  [17] [18] [19] [20]  Therefore, effective mitigation of defects in the solution-processed perovskite films is an important research subject to further enhance the performance of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) toward their thermodynamic limits. Iሺtሻ = ‫ܣ‬ ଵ exp ൬- ‫ݐ‬ ߬1 ൰ + ‫ܣ‬ ଶ exp ሺ- ‫ݐ‬ ߬2 ሻ In an ionic crystal like OTP, dangling bonds at the surface and grain boundaries (GBs) introduce trap states and nonradiative recombination centers. The polycrystalline nature of solutionprocessed OTP films further aggravates this issue because of increased GB density and structural disorder, in contrast to a single-crystalline perovskite that shows an extremely long electron-hole diffusion length of 175 μm.  21  Several studies have indicated that surface defects and GBs can serve as photoluminescence (PL) quenching sites and thus result in loss of photogenerated carriers.  [22] [23] [24] [25]  Additionally, it has also been reported that ion migration becomes more pronounced in a polycrystalline material, due to higher diffusivity of ions across extended defects like GBs.  26  Thus, it is critical to develop effective methods that can passivate the defects at the film surface and GBs in OTPs. Recently, several approaches have been reported to be able to passivate the surface/interfaces and GBs of solution-processed OTP films. For example, PbI 2 preferably formed at GBs through high-temperature annealing creates a type I band alignment at GBs, resulting in defect passivation and retardation of carrier recombination.  [27] [28] [29]  Meanwhile, small molecules have also been employed to passivate dangling bonds in OTPs by exploiting the  associated intermolecular interaction.  [30] [31] [32]  Lately, we and several groups have discovered that the commonly used fullerene-based electron-transporting layers (ETLs) can also passivate surface trap states and GB defects in OTPs to eliminate trap states and suppress device hysteresis.  [33] [34] [35]  However, the role of fullerene in eliminating the dominant vacancy defects is limited. We and several groups have found that iodide in perovskites has the propensity to dope fullerene at the perovskite/fullerene interface.  33, 36, 37  In this case, iodo radicals would be inevitably generated after doping and then form iodine that can potentially sublime easily. As a result, new V I defects can possibly be generated inside the perovskite film. Thus, for fullerene-based inverted PVSCs, it would be ideal if the perovskite surface and GBs can be passivated without generating new defects due to perovskite fullerene interaction. In this study, a series of diammonium iodides, namely, C4, C8, and EDBE, were explored to passivate perovskite surface and GBs considering their bilateral ammonium iodide end can simultaneously passivatethe perovskite layer and dope the adjacent electron-transporting layer (PCBM herein) in derived PVSCs, as illustrated in Figure  1 . In pursuing the suitable materials for defect passivation, we surprisingly discovered that the molecular structure of diammonium iodide plays a critical role in affecting perovskite's surface morphology and phase purity. We found that both C4 and EDBE can induce three-dimensional (3D) to twodimensional (2D) perovskite phase transformation during post treatment. However, the activation energy for such transition can be modulated by tailoring the molecular structure of the diammonium iodides. The C8 can successfully passivate perovskite surface and GBs without causing 2D phase transformation of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 because of its unique anti-gauche isomerization, which may elevate the activation energy for the 3D-to-2D phase transformation. Consequently, the thin-film PVSC passivated by C8 shows a much improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.60% compared to 14.64% for the control device. Diammonium Iodides for Perovskite Passivation. To effectively passivate the above-mentioned defects, three diammounium iodides with different molecular structures, C4, C8, and EDBE (Figure  2a ), were selected because their bilateral ammonium iodide group is capable of simultaneously passivating perovskite surface/GBs and inducing PCBM doping without consuming iodides from bulk perovskite (Figure  1 ). We first try to investigate the effect of alkyl chain length on electron transfer from perovskite to PCBM by comparing C4 and C8. The EDBE is included in our exploration to study whether the hydrogen bonding between adjacent EDBE molecules  38  will influence the self-assembly kinetics between the organic species and perovskite for better passivation effects. The post-treatment procedure is illustrated in Figure  2a  and detailed in the Supporting Information. It is important to note that similar surface topology and bulk properties such as crystallinity and absorption coefficient of perovskite films should be retained if the diammonium iodide distributes only at the perovskite surface or in the GBs. To examine this, the evolution of surface morphology of post-treatment perovskite films is investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure  2b ). As clearly shown, only the C8-treated film showed surface morphology similar to that of the pristine film, which encompasses a compact and uniform film with grain sizes ranging from tens of nanometers to around 200 nm. However, the C4-and EDBE-treated films showed distinct morphology with striplike and branchlike features, respectively. The enormous change in surface morphology of C4-and EDBE-treated films prompt us to speculate the possibility of 3D-to-2D perovskite phase transformation due to the tendency of large-sized diammonium iodides to form 2D hybrid perovskites,  38, 39  which induce the morphological changes through dissolution-recrystallization.  40  To probe this, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption of posttreated films were measured to study if the relatively larger organic cations diffuse into the pristine perovskite film and partially convert the perovskite from 3D to 2D. As clearly evidenced from the XRD data shown in Figure  2c , the characteristic diffraction corresponding to {200} planes of (C4)PbI 4 and (020) plane of (EDBE)PbI 4 are apparent in the C4-and EDBE-treated films, respectively. In addition, their corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra (Figure  2d ) clearly show the excitonic absorption peak, affirming the formation of 2D perovskite due to the intercalation of C4 and EDBE cations into the perovskite films. However, the C8-treated film seems to uniquely preserve its morphology and phase purity without going through such transition (Figure  2b-d ). The 3D-to-2D perovskite phase transformation induced by C4 and EDBE cations can be explained by the tendency of forming more thermodynamically stable 2D hybrid perovskite.  [41] [42] [43] [44]  The reaction rate for such 3D-to-2D phase transformation is in principle determined by its associated activation energy. Therefore, the inhibited phase transformation observed in C8-treated films might be due to two possible reasons: (i) The phase transformation from 3D MAPbI 3 to 2D (C8)PbI 4 occurs too slowly to be effectively observed during the fast 10 s treatment period. (ii) The (C8)PbI 4 in nature has a higher Gibbs free energy than MAPbI 3 . The distinction in morphological variation between C4/ EDBE-and C8-treated films further triggered us to ponder the structural difference of their corresponding 2D perovskites. Interestingly, Lemmerer and Billing 39 found that, among all of their studied 2D lead-halide-based perovskites incorporating diammonium cations, C8 is the only material that has gauche conformation in the middle of the alkyl chain while other diammomium cations consist of only the anti conformation. This gauche conformation has higher energy compared to the anti conformation, and the associated local energy minimum is metastable. Thus, it can be inferred that the middle part of the C8 diammonium cation needs to convert from its energetically stable anti form into the gauche conformation to intercalate into the 2D perovskite film. Such anti-gauche isomerization necessitates additional energy barrier for 3D-to-2D phase transformation, thereby slowing the conversion. To prove this hypothesis, the 2D hybrid perovskite (n = 1) thin films based on C4, C8, and EDBE were prepared accordingly by a simple spin-coating procedure (Supporting Information). As shown in Figure  3a , both spin-coated C4 and EDBE films convert immediately into a yellow color after being placed onto the preheated (100 °C) hot plate, whereas the C8 film remains clear after being annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. As previously reported by Lemmerer and Billing,  39  the single crystal of C8-PbI 4 possesses a yellow color as well, which is typical for lead-iodide-based 2D hybrid perovskites. Therefore, we can conclude that the elevated activation energy for forming the corresponding 2D C8-PbI 4 perovskite phase is the reason for forming the clear intermediate state (Figure  3c ; will be discussed later). Interestingly, it was discovered that exposing the C8 films in air facilitates the 2D phase transformation. As shown in Figure  3b , the C8 film turns into a yellow color after being stored in air overnight. Its corresponding XRD and UV-vis absorption results are presented in Figure  S1 , where the yellow phase is clearly identified to be the 2D C8-PbI 4 . However, the C8 film remains in the clear state even after being stored in N 2 for a week. This result suggests that moisture or/and oxygen play a critical role in lowering the activation energy for this phase transformation, and the exact mechanism is still under investigation. Because the 2D C8-PbI 4 film can be eventually formed (Figure  3b ) and is quite stable in air, we hypothesize that although anti-gauche isomerization may also raise the 2D C8-PbI 4 phase's Gibbs free energy, it still lower than that of the 3D MAPbI 3 phase. Hence, the change in Gibbs free energy should play a less important role than the elevation of activation energy in mediating 3D-to-2D perovskite phase transformation in C8 post treatment. A scheme showing the reaction mechanism of the studied diammonium salts is illustrated in Figure  3c . Our results reveal that owing to the higher thermodynamic stability of 2D perovskites, most organic salts with larger cations used for perovskite passivation will induce fast 3D-to-2D phase transformation (within 10 s) due to the low activation energy of this process. However, the extra anti-gauche isomerization energy for C8 slows the self-assembling process and thus limits itself to be distributed only at the perovskite surface and GBs. Defect Passivation Characterization. After elucidating that only C8 can successfully interact with pristine perovskite without affecting its bulk properties, we next examined its efficacy in defect passivation. Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM)  45, 46  is employed to investigate the perovskite films before and after C8 treatment. Figure  4A  illustrates the topography (left column) and surface potential (SP) (right column) images of the perovskite films before (top row) and after (bottom row) treatment. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of perovskite films before and after treatment are 7.99 and 5.99 nm, respectively. As can be clearly seen, both films showed similar morphology, affirming no surface reconstruction of perovskite film after C8 treatment, which is consistent with the SEM image shown in Figure  2b . Notably, the small decrease in surface roughness of the treated film indicates that C8 did fill in the GBs and thus reduces the height difference between the grain surface and GB. Despite the similarity in surface morphology, the two films showed distinctly different SP. For the control film without treatment, most GBs showed SP higher than that of the interior grains, indicating a downward band-bending in the GBs which will cause electron trapping.  25, 27  However, the SP difference between GBs and interior grains is significantly reduced after treatment, indicating negligible band bending at this corresponding interface. This will facilitate electron transport across the GBs. It clearly validates effective perovskite passivation. In addition, the average SP of the treated film (-0.10 V) shows an increase of 0.24 V compared to that of pristine film (-0.34 V). This suggests a larger downward surface band-bending of the treated film, which can benefit charge carrier separation and facilitate the electron collection toward ETL in derived devices.  47  Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) has also been utilized to further examine the effects of defect passivation on resulting photophysical properties, as shown in Figure  4B . The average lifetime of perovskite film increased from 24 to 40 ns after C8-treatment with both improved fast and slow component, revealing the suppressed charge recombination in the treated film. The fitting and detailed parameters are summarized in Table  S1 .  
 Photovoltaic Performance Characterization and Recombination Kinetics Study. To examine how C8-passivation affects photovoltaic properties, planar heterojunction structure (PHJ) devices were fabricated in the configuration shown in Figure  5a . The detailed fabrication procedure is described in the Supporting Information, and the statistical device performance with standard deviation for control and C8-, C4-, and EDBE-treated devices is shown in Table  S2 . As expected, the PCE of the derived PVSC is significantly improved from 14.64% to 17.60% after C8-treatment (Figure  5b ) with a marked increase in all photovoltaic parameters (Table  S2 ). The steady-state current output of both devices is shown in Figure  S2 , and it matches well with our measured PCEs. Different from the C8-treated device, the C4-and EDBE-treated PVSCs showed inferior PCEs with a much lower short-circuit current (J SC ) and fill factor (FF). This can be attributed to the formation of bulk 2D perovskite, in which the intercalated insulating alkyl chains block electron transfer from perovskite to PCBM and thus impede efficient charge collection. To better understand the charge carrier dynamics and enhanced performance, we have studied the device recombination kinetics by measuring the dependence of J-V characteristics on light intensity.  48  Figure  5c  shows the dependence of J SC on light intensity of the studied devices, in which the fitted slope (in accordance to power law) is 0.918 and 0.944 for the control device and C8-treated device, respectively. This result clearly indicates that the reduced charge recombination loss for the C8-treated device is due to effective defect passivation. Figure  5d  shows the relationship between open-circuit voltage (V OC ) and light intensity of the studied devices. Notably, the control device possesses a slope of 1.186 kT/q throughout the entire range of light intensity, showing a bimolecular recombination dominant kinetics. This supports the respectable high PCE of the control device. Neverthelessly, the C8-treated PVSC showed a further reduced slope of 1.006 kT/q, suggesting a minimized trapassisted recombination in the device. In addition to the effective defect passivation, this significantly reduced recombination loss can also be attributed to the interfacial doping at the C8/PCBM interface.  33, 34, 49  The other end of C8 ammonium iodide can dope PCBM without the need of creating further V I defects inside the perovskite film, leading to a much improved device performance. In summary, we have successfully developed a simple and effective method to passivate the surface and GB defects of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 films by employing alkyl diammonium iodide. It was discovered that the molecular structure of used diammonium salt has a profound effect on influencing the surface morphology and phase purity of perovskite. Both C4-and EDBEdiammonium salts induce 3D-to-2D hybrid perovskite phase transformation during treatment, which is unfavorable for charge transport and device performance because of their insulating nature. However, the 3D-to-2D transition is inhibited in C8treated films because of its unique anti-gauche isomerization, which elevates the activation energy of this transition. Therefore, the C8 diammonium iodide treatment can successfully passivate perovskite films as evidenced by the SKPM and TRPL measurements. Further investigations on device recombination kinetics also showed reduced charge recombination loss in the derived device, indicating that the C8 salt can also potentially dope PCBM. As a result, the C8-treated PVSC shows a muchimproved PCE of 17.60% compared to that of the control device (PCE of 14.64%). This study highlights the importance of rational molecular design for perovskite surface modification and passivation.

Supplementary The paper by Yang et al. describing the preparation of EDTA-complexed SnO2 represents an interesting and obviously very high-performance perovskite solar cell electron transport layer. However, due to numerous issues with the paper, detailed below, I recommend that this paper be rejected from Nature Communications pending major revisions by the authors. First some general comments. • The authors consistently use hyperbolic language in this manuscript. They describe -even in the title -the solar cells as ""without hysteresis"" and say that hysteresis is ""completely eliminated"" in their devices. I agree that the devices have very low hysteresis for perovskite solar cells. This is clearly shown in Fig.  S11 . Nevertheless, the hysteresis is not eliminated: eliminated is simply too strong of a word. There are differences in the forward and reverse JV scans. While these differences are slight they are clearly visible. Fig.  6  shows the FF changes from 0.792 to 0.783 with scan direction. This is hysteresis. The authors should modify the language of the paper in this respect. Hysteresis is reduced, it is perhaps even negligible, but it is certainly still present and is not ""eliminated"". • The English throughout the paper requires significant improvement to improve the readability of the manuscript. This is particularly true of the methods section. In fact, it is in places difficult to understand the methods being used due to inconsistent grammar. Improving readability would greatly improve the impact of this work. • The authors use a variety of device configurations to measure material properties such as defect density, mobility, and others. While I don't necessarily disagree or refute the results as presented, there are complicating factors associated with these measurements and device architectures. The authors should be clear about the caveats associated with their measurements and why they believe these can be neglected in this case. This will give the reader a fairer picture of the measurements undertaken and the conclusions of the work. More specific comments. • The authors' description of the crystallization with respect to the Gibbs free energy is unclear. What do the authors mean that the ""hydrophilicity of the E-SnO2 surface… decreases the Gibbs barrier during perovskite growth"" and how do the authors envision this resulting in ""improved quality of perovskite film""? What Gibbs barrier is being reduced? Are the authors merely expecting more uniform nucleation of perovskite crystals on the E-SnO2 surface? It isn't clear from the discussion of this in the text what exactly is meant and how this would affect trap densities in the perovskite layer. Also, it looks like these Nt measurements are conducted with FAPbI3. Is this a different active layer than the FACsPbI3 layers used in the rest of this work? If so, why? • The authors state that hysteresis is more severe in planar-type architecures (see pg 3). This is not universally a true statement • On page 4 the authors comment on the high annealing temperature necessary for TiO2. Contrary to this assertion, TiO2 ETLs which can be processed at low temperature with high performance have been widely shown. Including some with similar high performance to the current study. See DOI: 10.1126/science.aai9081 • The E-SnO2 solution is said to be stable. Can the authors provide device data or something else to actually confirm this? A photograph of the solution does not confirm if the solution is actually stable or not. • The authors say the obtain their XPS data from films on quartz substrates. What effects from charging do the authors see with this? I would expect very significant charging in these samples which could greatly shift the observed binding energies. • The FTIR spectra of the control SnO2 is missing. The authors show the O-O stretch at ~1000 cm-1, is this related to the SnO2 itself exposed to O2 (as described in the reference cited) or is it a result of the EDTA bound to the SnO2 surface? The authors report a success strategy in eliminating hysteresis and at the same time attaining record-efficiency in planar-type perovskite solar cells by using EDTA-complexed SnO2 (E-SnO2) electron transport layers (ETL). Statistical analysis seems sounds as well as expertiments carried out for improving understanding. I thus recommend publication after addressing these minor but useful points below. ""Even though ETL free planar-type PSCs have been reported, their performances are poor compared to those with ETL"": Please quantify the PCE of these ETL-free devices. ""ii) suitable energy level with the perovskite materials to reduce the energy barrier for electron transport"" On one hand you want to eliminate an energy barrier for electron injection, on the other you don't want the conduction band to be too much lower that that of the perovoskite otherwise it would lower the Voc. Please explain this better. ""However, the PCE of the planar-type PSCs is still lower than that of the mesoporous-type devices because there exists significant energy barrier between SnO2 ETL and perovskite absorber, leading to energy loss."" In fact some referenced have used both SnO2 compact layer and either a compact layer ( https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024817300  65X) or a mesoporous TiO2 layer ( https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12274-017-1896-5 ) over the top to improve the efficiency confirming what the authors say. Other groups have doped the SnO2 for improved performance ( https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/cf6b/9a40dcdb8a82887d20b2335469  7dd873e7b4.pdf). I would recommend adding this further discussion and references in the introduction for the state of the art. On page 7 ""The reduced energy barrier is also believed to enhance charge transfer from the perovskite to the ETL"" . This is not an energy barrier because the conduction band of the SnO2 is lower than that of the perovskite. The electron in the solar cells is injected from the perovskite into the SnO2 during solar cell operation (this is different from IV curves in the dark where electrons are injected from the SnO2 into the perovoksite). Why should the transfer be better if the jump is lower? The Voc should be higher because the conduction band of the SnO2 is closer to that of the perovskite. Please review this explanation as well as the caption of S5. The authiors partly explain the higher crystallinity of the perovskite films using contact angle measruements, where larger grain sizes are correlated with lower contact angels. However, there is literature where investigators say that non wetting surfaces lead to higher grain size. Can the authors discuss this matter in more depth using the literature and provide a clearer or more definitive explanation of the literature on this matter? Again on page 11 when discussing why pholtoluminescence times are shorter, the explanation of higher mobility seems correct, but the reduced energy barrier does not (it is a jump). It may be that the interface or adhesion is better at the interface. Same when discussing hysteriss at the end of page 16 ""meaning no energy barrier for electron transfer (Fig.  S5 ), that is expected to facilitate electron extraction from the perovskite to the ETL."" The explanation must be another. Maybe less traps? Better initial growth on the E-SnO2? On page 17 the authors use a bending radius of 7mm 4. As known, in the conventional structure of PSC, the instability is mainly due to the perovskite layer and spiro-OMeTAD HTL. As the author did not change the perovskite layer and HTL, why the device without encapsulation could show better stability in air with 35% humidity for a so long time of 3000 h? The author should clarify it. 
 Point-By-Point Response to Referees' Comments Reviewer #1 (Remarks to the Author): 
 Introductory comment: The paper by Yang et al. describing the preparation of EDTA-complexed SnO 2 represents an interesting and obviously very high-performance perovskite solar cell electron transport layer. However, due to numerous issues with the paper, detailed below, I recommend that this paper be rejected from Nature Communications pending major revisions by the authors. Response to introductory comment: Thank you for your insightful comments and suggestions! We have conducted additional experiments and revised the manuscript to address all the comments and questions raised in the review. 
 Comments: First some general comments. • The authors consistently use hyperbolic language in this manuscript. They describe -even in the title-the solar cells as ""without hysteresis"" and say that hysteresis is ""completely eliminated"" in their devices. I agree that the devices have very low hysteresis for perovskite solar cells. This is clearly shown in Fig.  S11 . Nevertheless, the hysteresis is not eliminated: eliminated is simply too strong of a word. There are differences in the forward and reverse JV scans. While these differences are slight they are clearly visible. Fig.  6  shows the FF changes from 0.792 to 0.783 with scan direction. This is hysteresis. The authors should modify the language of the paper in this respect. Hysteresis is reduced, it is perhaps even negligible, but it is certainly still present and is not ""eliminated"". Response: Thank you very much for your suggestion. We agree with your comment and have revised all relevant sections accordingly. • The English throughout the paper requires significant improvement to improve the readability of the manuscript. This is particularly true of the methods section. In fact, it is in places difficult to understand the methods being used due to inconsistent grammar. Improving readability would greatly improve the impact of this work. Response: Thanks for the suggestion! Revised version has been reviewed by a native English speaker for grammar. • The authors use a variety of device configurations to measure material properties such as defect density, mobility, and others. While I don't necessarily disagree or refute the results as presented, there are complicating factors associated with these measurements and device architectures. The authors should be clear about the caveats associated with their measurements and why they believe these can be neglected in this case. This will give the reader a fairer picture of the measurements undertaken and the conclusions of the work. Response: Thank you very much for the comments! Per your request, we have revised the sections with proper analyses and discussion, as shown on pages 10 and 22. To gain insights into the charge transport, we have measured electron mobility using different electron transport layers (ETLs) in the same device structure. Specifically, the electrononly device was designed and fabricated using structure ITO/Al/ETL/Al, as shown in the inset in Likewise, the trap state density (N t ) of the perovskite films are estimated using the device structure ITO/ETL/perovskite/PCBM/Ag, similar to previously reported results (Energy Environ. Sci., 2017, 10, 2570-2578; Adv. Mater., 2016, 28, 5206-5213; Energy Environ. Sci., 2017, 10, 2095-2102, etc.), R3-R5 The device architecture is shown in Fig.  3a  with the dark condition I-V curves. The linear correlation in the I-V curve reveals an ohmic-type device response in the low bias voltage range. The current is quickly increased nonlinearly when the bias voltage exceeds the trap-filled limit voltage (V TFL ) located at the kink point, indicating that the traps are completely filled. Hence, the trap density of the perovskite film can be calculated using V TFL through equation (  2 ) presented in the manuscript. More details are provided in the manuscript on page 10. More specific comments. • The authors' description of the crystallization with respect to the Gibbs free energy is unclear. What do the authors mean that the ""hydrophilicity of the E-SnO Response: According to the established model for nucleation and growth of thin films, R6,R7 the perovskite formation process can be divided into four steps: i) formation of crystal nucleus, ii) evolution of nuclei's into island structure, iii) formation of networked microstructure and iv) growth of networks into continuous film. The Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation in the first step can be expressed as: △G heterogeneous = △G homogeneous × f(θ), wherein f(θ) = (2 -3cosθ + cos 3 θ)/4, and θ is contact angle of the precursor solution. Since the magnitude of θ varies in the range of [0, π/2], the larger the is θ the smaller is the magnitude of cosθ, and therefore larger is the parameter f(θ) ϵ [0, 1]. In other words, a smaller contact angle results in reduced Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation, thereby, assisting the nucleation process. Higher nucleation density will promote the film densification process.  R7  Compared to EDTA and SnO 2 , E-SnO 2 shows the smallest contact angle (20.67°, Fig.  S6 ), which is further expected to improve the wettability between the E-SnO 2 and the perovskite layer. R8-R10 Thus, the perovskite coated on the E-SnO 2 exhibits better crystallinity (Fig.  S7 ) and full surface coverage (Fig.  2c ). In addition, the small contact angle of substrate provides the low surface energy,  R11  leading to increased grain size during the growth of the networked structure as observed in the SEM measurements. R7 This explanation has been added in the manuscript (page 9-10). The N t measurements are conducted with FA 0.95 Cs 0.05 PbI 3 , the same active layer used in the rest of this work. We are really sorry for the error label in Fig.  3a . It has been corrected. • The authors state that hysteresis is more severe in planar-type architectures (see pg 3). This is not universally a true statement. Generally p-i-n structures have very low hysteresis. Moreover, Response: Thank you for your question! Fig.  S2  compares the FTIR spectra of the E-SnO 2 solution measured in the freshly prepared condition and again after it was stored in ambient for 2 months. It is clear that there is no obvious difference between the two solutions indicating the high stability. We have added this measurement in the Supplementary Information (Fig.  S2 ). • The authors say the obtain their XPS data from films on quartz substrates. What effects from charging do the authors see with this? I would expect very significant charging in these samples which could greatly shift the observed binding energies. 
 Response: The XPS of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 films deposited on quartz substrates were measured again. In order to reduce the charging effect, the exposed surface of the quartz substrate was coated with a conductive silver paint and connected to the ground. We calibrated the binding energy scale for all XPS measurements to the carbon 1s line at 284.8 eV. It is clear from these measurements that SnO 2 shows only peaks attributed to Sn and O. After the EDTA treatment, the E-SnO 2 film shows an additional peak located at ca. 400 eV, ascribed to N. Meanwhile, the Sn 3d peaks from E-SnO 2 are shifted by ca. 0.16 eV in contrast to the pristine SnO 2 (Fig.  S3 ), indicating that EDTA is bound to the SnO 2 . These results have been described in the manuscript (page 6, Fig.  1a ) and the Supplementary Information (Fig.  S3 ). 
 • The FTIR spectra of the control SnO 2 is missing. The authors show the O-O stretch at ~1000 cm  -1  , is this related to the SnO 2 itself exposed to O 2 (as described in the reference cited) or is it a result of the EDTA bound to the SnO 2 surface? Response: We have measured the FTIR spectra again from 3600 cm -1 to 500 cm -1 for all three samples EDTA, SnO 2 and E-SnO 2 . As shown in Fig.  1b , the peaks around 2895 cm -1 and 1673 cm -1 belong to C-H and C=O stretching vibration in the EDTA, respectively. The characteristic peaks of SnO 2 observed at ca. 701 cm -1 and 549 cm -1 are due to O-Sn-O stretch and the Sn-O vibration, respectively.  R12  In addition, the peak at 1040 cm -1 in the SnO 2 film is attributed to O-O stretching vibration due to oxygen adsorption on the SnO 2 surface.  R13  For the E-SnO 2 sample, the characteristic peaks of SnO 2 shift to 713 cm -1 and 563 cm -1 , and the C-H and C=O stretching vibration peaks shift to 2913 cm -1 and 1624 cm -1 , further demonstrating that the EDTA is indeed complexed with SnO 2 . We have added this additional analysis in the manuscript (page 6, Fig.  1b ). 
 • The PL lifetimes in Fig 3c are very fast! lifetimes of less than 1 ns for good perovskite films indicate either something really strange going on or nonlinear behavior. The assignment to interface quenching and trap recombination is complicated by this. Is the lifetime excitation intensity dependent? Typical lifetimes are more in the 50-1000 ns range. Related to this, how much does ITO quench the emission? Response: Thank you for your insightful question. We measured the lifetime of the perovskite films deposited on various substrates using different excitation intensity. The TRPL spectra and fitting data are shown in Fig.  S8  and Table  S1 . Generally, the slow decay component (τ 1 ) is attributed to the radiative recombination of free charge carriers due to traps in the bulk, and the fast decay component (τ 2 ) is originated from the quenching of charge carriers at interface.  R14  The glass/perovskite sample shows the longest lifetime under excitation intensity of 3 μJ/cm 2 . For perovskite coated on the ITO substrate, the lifetime is decreased more than half due to the charge transfer from perovskite into ITO. For EDTA/perovskite and SnO 2 /perovskite samples, both the fast and slow decay lifetimes are very similar, and τ 1 dominates the PL decay for both samples, indicating severe recombination before they were extracted. When the perovskite is deposited on E-SnO 2 , both τ 1 and τ 2 were shortened to 14.16 ns and 0.97 ns, with a proportion of 45.32% and 54.68%, respectively. Meanwhile, τ 2 appears to dominate the PL decay, indicating that electrons are effectively extracted from the perovskite layer to the E-SnO 2 with minimal recombination loss. Even under smaller excitation intensity (0.5μJ/cm 2 ), the acceleration of the lifetime for E-SnO 2 /perovskite is observed. The lifetime increases with reduced excitation intensity (Fig.  S8  and Table  S1 ), in agreement with previous report.  R15  The electron transport yield (Ф tr ) of different ETLs with different excitation intensity can be estimated using equation, Ф tr = 1τ p /τ glass , where τ p is the average lifetime for perovskite deposited on different substrates, and τ glass is the average lifetime for glass/perovskite. With the excitation intensity of 3 μJ/cm 2 , the electron transport yields of ITO, EDTA, SnO 2 and E-SnO 2 are 49.72%, 67.58%, 68.31% and 81.50%, respectively. When the excitation intensity reduces to 0.5μJ/cm 2 , the electron transport yields of ITO, EDTA, SnO 2 and E-SnO 2 are increased to 60.37%, 74.46%, 80.65% and 90.82%, respectively. It is clear that the excitation intensity can significantly increase the electron transport yield. These results further indicate that the E-SnO 2 is a good electron extraction layer for planar-type perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We have added the details in the manuscript (page  12 ) and the Supplementary Information (Fig.  S8  and Table  S1 ).  Response: We are sorry for the typo. This sentence should have been: ""the high electron mobility of E-SnO 2 would enhance electron transport from perovskite to E-SnO 2 ETL,"" We have made the correction in revised manuscript (page 18). 
 • The authors write dimethyl sulfide in the materials and methods, is this a typo of dimethyl sulfoxide or is this correct? Response: Thank you very much for the catch. This is a typo, and we have corrected it as ""dimethyl sulfoxide"" in the manuscript. • Is the SnO 2 /water solution 2.5 wt%? Response: Yes, this is the weight concentration. The SnO 2 aqueous colloidal dispersion (15 wt%, purchased from Alfa Aesar) was diluted using deionized water to the concentration of 2.5 wt%. Details are presented in the Methods Section (page 21). 
 • Are the SnO 2 layers annealed at all? Response: The ETLs including EDTA, SnO 2 and E-SnO 2 were kept at 60 ℃ in a vacuum oven after spin-coating. The system was evacuated to ca. 5 Pa for 30 min to remove residual solvent, as described in the Methods Section (page 21). • How are the control SnO 2 layers and the control EDTA layers fabricated? Response: We have added details on fabrication process for the SnO 2 and the EDTA layers in the Methods Section (page 21): The 0.2 mg EDTA was dissolved in 1 mL deionized water, and the SnO 2 aqueous colloidal dispersion (15 wt%) was diluted using deionized water to the concentration of 2.5 wt%. These solutions were stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. The SnO 2 and EDTA layers were fabricated by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 60 s using the corresponding solution, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C under ca. 5 Pa for 30 min to remove residual solvent. Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author): 
 Introductory comment: The authors report a success strategy in eliminating hysteresis and at the same time attaining 
 record-efficiency in planar-type perovskite solar cells by using EDTA-complexed SnO 2 (E-SnO 2 ) electron transport layers (ETL). Statistical analysis seems sounds as well as experiments carried out for improving understanding. I thus recommend publication after addressing these minor but useful points below. Response to Introductory comment: Thank you very much for the nice comments. 
 Comments: ""Even though ETL free planar-type PSCs have been reported, their performances are poor compared to those with ETL"": Please quantify the PCE of these ETL-free devices. 
 Response: We have briefly summarized the PCE of ETL-free PSCs in the manuscript: ""Even though ETL free planar-type PSCs have been reported,  30, 31  their highest PCE is only 14.14%, significantly lower than that of the cells with ETL, demonstrating the importance of the ETL in this configuration of PSCs."" We have added these comments in the manuscript (page 3). ii) suitable energy level with the perovskite materials to reduce the energy barrier for electron transport"" On one hand you want to eliminate an energy barrier for electron injection, on the other you don't want the conduction band to be too much lower than that of the perovskite otherwise it would lower the V oc . Please explain this better. Response: Thanks for the comment and excellent question. The PSCs using the E-SnO 2 ETL show higher J sc due to the high electron mobility of E-SnO 2 . Further, they show larger V oc due to the energy level match between the Fermi level of E-SnO 2 and the conduction band of the perovskite. This information has been added in the manuscript (page 3). "" Response: Thanks for these suggestions. We have incorporated this information in the introduction (page 4): ""The SnO 2 -TiO 2 (planar and mesoporous) composite layers were developed to enhance the performance of the PSCs.  37, 38  It is noteworthy to that Al 3+doped SnO 2 provides even better performance.  39  "". All these literatures have been cited as No. 37-39 in the Reference Section. On page 7 ""The reduced energy barrier is also believed to enhance charge transfer from the perovskite to the ETL"". This is not an energy barrier because the conduction band of the SnO 2 is lower than that of the perovskite. The electron in the solar cells is injected from the perovskite into the SnO 2 during solar cell operation (this is different from I-V curves in the dark where electrons are injected from the SnO 2 into the perovskite). Why should the transfer be better if the jump is lower? The V oc should be higher because the conduction band of the SnO 2 is closer to that of the perovskite. Please review this explanation as well as the caption of S5. Response: Thank you very much for your suggestion. The effective electron injection is attributed to the high electron mobility of E-SnO 2 while the larger V oc (Fig.  4a  and Table  1 ) results from the smaller energy level difference between E-SnO 2 and the perovskite layer. We have revised the explanation in the manuscript (page 8) as ""The Fermi level of E-SnO 2 is very close to the conduction band of perovskite, which is beneficial for enhancing V oc ."" In addition, we have revised the caption of Fig.  S5  as ""In order to examine electron transport capability of the E-SnO 2 film, the glass/ITO/ETL/perovskite/PCBM/Al devices were fabricated. When a voltage is applied to the top ITO electrode, electrons are injected to ETL from the perovskite. The J-V curve of the E-SnO 2 -based device exhibits lower response voltage than that of the SnO 2 -based device (Fig.  S5a ), indicating that the electron injection from the perovskite to the E-SnO 2 is easier than to the SnO 2 , due to the higher electron mobility of E-SnO 2 . In addition, Fig.  S5b  and S5c illustrate the energy level alignment for the devices based on the SnO 2 and E-SnO 2 ETLs. It is clear that the Fermi level of the E-SnO 2 shows a better match to the conduction band of the perovskite than that obtained for the SnO 2 . This provides enhancement in the observed V oc (Fig.  4a  and Table  1 )."" The authors partly explain the higher crystallinity of the perovskite films using contact angle Can the authors discuss this matter in more depth using the literature and provide a clearer or more definitive explanation of the literature on this matter? Response: Thank you very much for your suggestions! According to the established model for nucleation and growth of thin films, R6,R7 the perovskite formation process can be divided into four steps: i) formation of crystal nucleus, ii) evolution of nuclei's into island structure, iii) formation of networked microstructure and iv) growth of networks into continuous film. The Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation in the first step can be expressed as: △G heterogeneous = △G homogeneous × f(θ), wherein f(θ) = (2 -3cosθ + cos 3 θ)/4, and θ is contact angle of the precursor solution. Since the magnitude of θ varies in the range of [0, π/2], the larger the is θ the smaller is the magnitude of cosθ, and therefore larger is the parameter f(θ) ϵ [0, 1]. In other words, a smaller contact angle results in reduced Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation, thereby, assisting the nucleation process. Higher nucleation density will promote the film densification process.  R7  Compared to EDTA and SnO 2 , E-SnO 2 shows the smallest contact angle (20.67°, Fig.  S6 ), which is further expected to improve the wettability between the E-SnO 2 and the perovskite layer. R8-R10 Thus, the perovskite coated on the E-SnO 2 exhibits better crystallinity (Fig.  S7 ) and full surface coverage (Fig.  2c ). In addition, the small contact angle of substrate provides the low surface energy,  R11  leading to increased grain size during the growth of the networked structure as observed in the SEM measurements. R7 This explanation has been added in the manuscript (page 9-10), and the relevant literatures have been cited in the Reference Section. Again on page 11 when discussing why photoluminescence times are shorter, the explanation of higher mobility seems correct, but the reduced energy barrier does not (it is a jump). It may be that the interface or adhesion is better at the interface. Same when discussing hysteresis at the end of page 16 ""meaning no energy barrier for electron transfer (Fig.  S5 ), that is expected to facilitate electron extraction from the perovskite to the ETL."" The explanation must be another. 
 Maybe less traps? Better initial growth on the E-SnO 2 ? Response: Thank you very much for your suggestions. The perovskite deposited on E-SnO 2 substrate shows the shortest lifetime (Fig.  3c  and Table  S1 ), which is attributed to its high electron mobility. The short lifetime indicates that the carriers can be effectively extracted into E-SnO 2 with minimal recombination loss. We have revised this explanation in the manuscript (page 12). Generally, the hysteresis of PSCs is ascribed to ion migration, high trap density, and unbalanced charge transport within the perovskite device. The trap density of the perovskite film is significantly reduced when deposited on the E-SnO 2 , which is one reason for reduced hysteresis in the PSCs. In addition, the electron mobility of E-SnO 2 ETL is 2.27 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s - 1 (Fig.  1f ), comparable to the hole mobility of the doped spiro-OMeTAD (~10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) HTL. Thus, the electron flux (F e ) is essentially equal to the hole flux (F h ) because the interface area of the ETL/perovskite is the same as that of the perovskite/HTL (Fig.  S13b ). Therefore, there is no significant charge accumulation, and consequently, the devices based on the E-SnO 2 exhibit negligible hysteresis. We have added these explanations in the manuscript and the Supplementary Information (page 18, Fig.  S13 ). On page 17 the authors use a bending radius of 7mm. Why was this chosen? It is where ITO cracks? Please provide some references. Response: According to a previous report,  R16  it is safe for ITO to be bended to a radius of 14 mm, and when the bending radius is smaller than 14 mm, the ITO layer starts to crack, leading to significant degradation in conductivity. In order to examine the intrinsic mechanical stability of the flexible PSCs, we therefore adopted the bending radius of 7 mm, half of that suggested in literature, to test the flexible device. Reviewer #3 (Remarks to the Author): 
 Introductory comment: In this work, the authors introduced an ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-complexed SnO 2 as the electron transport layer (ETL) for planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to realize a certified efficiency of 21.5% with eliminated hysteresis and enhanced stability. However, similar concept has been already reported in a previous work (Chem. Mater., 2017, 29, 4176-4180)   besides the improved efficiency for PSCs. I thus felt the novelty of this work is not impressive and not suitable to publish in Nature Communications as considering its high standard. I would recommend the publication of this work in the other specific journal. 
 Response to introductory comment: We thank the Referee for helpful feedback and comments. It was pointed out that our approach is similar to that reported by Li et al. (Chem. Mater., 2017, 29, 4176-4180). In this reference, EDTA was used to modify ZnO to form a hybrid interface in organic solar cells. However, the EDTA-ZnO does not work in the PSCs because when the perovskite film is deposited onto the EDTA-ZnO surface, it shows severe degradation due to the hydroxyl groups or acetate ligands on the ZnO surface, and proton transfer reactions at the perovskite/ZnO interface.  R17  In our work we have used EDTA to modify the SnO 2 . It is demonstrated that the efficiency of PSCs is increased to record high 21.60% (certified efficiency at 21.52% by Newport) with negligible hysteresis, the highest efficiency reported so far for the planar-type PSCs. In addition, the solar cells show significantly improved stability. We provide systematic fundamental analysis to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for this improved enhancement. Thus, we truly believe that our work advances the state-of-the-art and provides a promising pathway for obtaining high performance of planar-type PSCs. Hope the reviewer will find our explanations to his/her comments satisfactory. 
 Comments: Some remarks / questions follow: 1. The author should refer the mentioned reference (Chem. Mater., 2017, 29, 4176-4180) in the manuscript. ETL and demonstrated improved performance of the organic solar cells.  45  However, when the EDTA-ZnO layer is used in the present perovskite cells, the hydroxyl groups or acetate ligands on the ZnO surface react with the perovskite and proton transfer reactions occur at the perovskite/ZnO interface, leading to poor device performance.  46  ""   
 Response 
 The surface potential (Fermi level 
 What is the real mechanism for the eliminated hysteresis by using EDTA-SnO 2 ? The author should clarify it. 
 Response: The hysteresis of PSCs is ascribed to interfacial capacitance caused by charge accumulation at the interface, which originates from ion migration, high trap density, and unbalanced charge transport within the perovskite device.  R18-R20  It is found that the trap density of the perovskite film is significantly reduced when it is deposited on the E-SnO 2 , one of the primary reasons for reduced hysteresis. In addition, the electron mobility of the SnO 2 ETL is only 9.92 × 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 s -1 (Fig.  1f ), about an order of magnitude slower than the hole mobility of the doped spiro-OMeTAD (~10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) HTL. Thus, the electron flux (F e ) is ca. 10 times smaller than the hole flux (F h ) because the interface area of the ETL/perovskite is the same as that of the perovskite/HTL, leading to accumulated charge or capacitance at the SnO 2 /perovskite interface, as shown in Fig.  S13a . The accumulated charge will cause hysteresis in the solar cells (Fig.  6c ). When the high electron mobility E-SnO 2 (2.27 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) is employed as the ETL, the F e is comparable to the F h of the spiro-OMeTAD HTL (Fig.  S13b ), resulting in equivalent charge transport at both electrodes. Therefore, there is no significant charge accumulation or capacitance and thus reduced hysteresis in the PSCs. We have added these discussions in the manuscript and the Supplementary Information (page 18, Fig.  S13 ).  
 Response: The instability of PSC is mainly caused by degradation of perovskite film and spiro-OMeTAD HTL. In the present work, all devices used the same spiro-OMeTAD HTL, therefore the degradation from the HTL should be same for all the devices. It is found that the grain size of perovskite film is increased by 3 times when it is deposited on E-SnO 2 in comparison to that on the pristine SnO 2 (Fig.  2 ). The larger grain size can effectively suppress the moisture permeation at grain boundaries,  R21  resulting in improved environmental stability for the PSCs based on the E-SnO 2 ETLs. These explanations have been added in the manuscript (page 17).

 Responses to Reviews Dear Editor and Reviewers: Thank you very much for your insightful feedback on the manuscript. We have carefully revised the manuscript to address all your comments and questions. In particular, we have conducted additional experiments to address some of your critical questions. All changes have been marked in blue color in the revised submission. A detailed point-by-point response is attached along with this letter. We hope that all of you will find this revised submission satisfactory for publication in the ""Nature Communications"". We very much look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely,

 Point-By-Point Response to Referees' Comments Reviewer #1 (Remarks to the Author): The authors have done an exemplary job responding in detail to my, and the other reviewer's comments. The paper is now both more complete and more easily understandable. I think it will be an influential paper in the field. I therefore recommend publication of the manuscript in Nature Communications. Response: We really thank the referee for recommending publication in Nature Communications. Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author): Am satisfied with the answers. Two minor things: 1) Where the electron goes down in energy, I would not use the term ""barrier"" but ""offset"" Response: Thanks for your suggestion. We completely agree with this point that ""offset"" is more accurate than ""barrier"" to describe the electron goes down in energy, therefore we have revised the expression in the manuscript. 2) The important thing is that the main text has been improved by incorporating the answers in the manuscript. The only answer which has not been incorporated in the text is the one below so I suggest incorporating in the main text to help any reader, not just me, understand why such a radius was used for the bending tests. 
 QUESTION: On page 17 the authors use a bending radius of 7mm. Why was this chosen? It is where ITO cracks? Please provide some references. Response: Thank you for your comments. According to a previous report (J. Polym. Sci. Pol. Phys., 2011, 49, 638-648), it is safe for ITO to be bended to a radius of 14 mm, and when the bending radius is smaller than 14 mm, the ITO layer starts to crack, leading to significant degradation in conductivity. In order to examine the mechanical stability of the flexible PSCs, we therefore adopted the bending radius of 14 mm, 12mm and 7 mm to test the flexible device. The quality of this manuscript has been greatly improved by the authors in this version. I would recommend the publication of this work in Nature Communications after the authors address the following critical issues. Response: Thank you very much for referee's kind feedback and comments. We have conducted additional experiments and revised the manuscript to address all the questions. 
 As shown in Fig 1e, the overall transmittance of all the SnO 2 -based ETLs is below 90 % across the wavelengths from 400-800 nm. Why does the EQE of the EDTA-SnO 2 -based device (Fig.  4b ) can exceed 90%? Response: We characterized the reflection of ITO/E-SnO 2 and ITO/E-SnO 2 /perovskite samples, as shown in Fig.  R1 . It can be seen that the average reflection value of ITO/E-SnO 2 is 12.21% in the wavelength range of 400-800 nm. However, when the perovskite absorber layer is deposited onto the ITO/E-SnO 2 substrate, the average reflection is significantly reduced to 6.88%. The reduced optical loss of the ITO/E-SnO 2 /perovskite is often seen for multilayer coatings for the antireflection effect due to the difference refractive index between E-SnO 2 (~2.3) and perovskite (~2.9) (J. Sci. Techno., 2012, 4, 61-72; J. Phys.: Condens. Matter, 2017, 29, 245702). The smaller reflection leads to higher IPCE of the perovskite solar cells based on E-SnO 2 ETLs in the wavelengths from 400 nm to 800 nm. The results have been added in the manuscript and the Supplementary Information (page 14 and Fig.  S11 ).   
 ARTICLE High efficiency planar-type perovskite solar cells with negligible hysteresis using EDTA-complexed SnO 2 Even though the mesoporous-type perovskite solar cell (PSC) is known for high efficiency, its planar-type counterpart exhibits lower efficiency and hysteretic response. Herein, we report success in suppressing hysteresis and record efficiency for planar-type devices using EDTAcomplexed tin oxide (SnO O wing to the singular properties, including tuned band gap, small exciton energy, excellent bipolar carrier transport, long charge diffusion length, and amazingly high tolerance to defects  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]  , organometal halide perovskites have been projected to be promising candidates for a multitude of optoelectronic applications, including photovoltaics, light emission, photodetectors, X-ray imaging, lasers, gamma-ray detection, subwavelength photonic devices in a long-wavelength region, etc.  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]  . The rapid increase efficiency in a solar cell based on organometal halide perovskites validates its promise in photovoltaics. In the last few years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of mesoporous-type perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has increased to 23.3% by optimizing thin-film growth, interface, and absorber materials  [15] [16] [17]  . As of today, almost all PSCs with high PCE are based on mesoporous-type PSCs that often require high temperature to sinter the mesoporous layer for the best performance, compromising its low-cost advantage and limiting its application in flexible and tandem devices  16, 17  . In order to overcome this issue, planar-type PSC comprising of stacked planar thin films has been developed  18, 19  using low-temperature and low-cost synthesis processes  [20] [21] [22]  since the long charge diffusion length and bipolar carrier properties of perovskites  23, 24  . However, compared to the mesoporous-type PSC, its planar-type counterpart suffers from significant lower certified PCE  18, 25  . In a typical planar-type PSC, the perovskite absorber usually inserts between the electron-transport layer (ETL) and the holetransport layer (HTL) to achieve inverted p-i-n or regular n-i-p configuration  21  . Generally, the inverted device structure utilizing fullerene ETL displays very low hysteresis, however, it usually yields lower PCE, not to mention that fullerene is very expensive  26, 27  . Therefore, research has focused on n-i-p architecture to provide low cost and high efficiency  28, 29  . Even though ETL-free planar-type PSCs have been reported  30, 31  , their highest PCE is only 14.14%, significantly lower than that of the cells with ETL, demonstrating the importance of the ETL in this configuration of PSCs. A suitable ETL should meet some basic requirements for high device efficiency  32  . For instance, decent optical transmittance to ensure enough light is transmitted into the perovskite absorber, matched energy level with the perovskite materials to produce the expected open-circuit voltage (V oc ), and high electron mobility to extract carriers from the active layer effectively in order to avoid charge recombination, etc. Fast carrier extraction is desired to restrict charge accumulation at the interface due to ion migration for reduced hysteresis in the planar-type PSCs. Thus, emphasis has been on developing highquality ETLs with suitable energy level and high electron mobility for high PCE devices. Thus far, TiO 2 is still the most widely used ETL in highefficiency n-i-p planar-type PSCs due to its excellent photoelectric properties  33  . However, the electron mobility of TiO 2 ETL is too low (ca. 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) to match with high hole mobility of commonly used HTLs (ca. 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ), leading to charge accumulation at the TiO 2 /perovskite interface that causes hysteresis and reduced efficiency  34  . There have been extensive efforts in developing low-temperature TiO 2 ETL, such as exploring low-temperature synthesis processes through doping and chemical engineering. The results shown by Tan et al. demonstrate that use of chlorine to modify the TiO 2 microstructure at low temperatures provides promising PCE of 20.1%  35  . Recently, SnO 2 has been demonstrated as an alternative ETL to replace TiO 2 , owing to its more suitable energy level relative to perovskite and higher electron mobility. Ke et al. first used SnO 2 thin film as an ETL in regular planar-type PSCs and demonstrated a PCE of 16.02% with improved hysteresis  36  . Later, the SnO 2 -TiO 2 (planar and mesoporous) composite layers were developed to enhance the performance of the PSCs  37, 38  . It is noteworthy to mention that Al 3+ -doped SnO 2 provides even better performance  39  . Subsequently, a variety of methods, such as solution deposition, atomic layer deposition, chemical bath deposition, etc.  [40] [41] [42]  have been developed for synthesizing SnO 2 thin film to improve the performance of planar-type PSCs  43  . Recently, Jiang et al. developed the SnO 2 nanoparticles as the ETL and demonstrated a certified efficiency as high as 19.9% with very low hysteresis  21  . However, the PCE of the planar-type PSCs is still lower than that of the mesoporous-type devices likely due to charge accumulation at the ETL/perovskite interface caused by relatively low electron mobility of the ETL  44  . It is expected that better PSC performance will be achieved by increasing electron mobility of the ETLs. Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) provides excellent modification of ETLs in organic solar cells owing to its strong chelation function. Li et al. have employed EDTA to passivate ZnO-based ETL and demonstrated improved performance of the organic solar cells  45  . However, when the EDTA-ZnO layer is used in the present perovskite cells, the hydroxyl groups or acetate ligands on the ZnO surface react with the perovskite and proton transfer reactions occur at the perovskite/ZnO interface, leading to poor device performance  46  . In the present work, we realize an EDTA-complexed SnO 2 (E-SnO 2 ) ETLs by complexing EDTA with SnO 2 in planar-type PSCs to attain PCE as high as 21.60%, and certified PCE reaches to 21.52%, the highest reported value to date for the planar-type PSCs. Owing to the low-temperature processing for E-SnO 2 , we fabricate flexible PSCs, and the PCE reaches to 18.28%. Besides, the PSCs based on E-SnO 2 show negligible hysteresis because of the eliminated charge accumulation at the perovskite/ETL interface. We find that the electron mobility of E-SnO 2 increases by about three times compared to that of SnO 2 , leading to negligible current density-voltage (J-V) hysteresis due to improved electron extraction from the perovskite absorber  21  . Furthermore, we find that SnO 2 surface becomes more hydrophilic upon EDTA treatment, which decreases the Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation, resulting in high quality of the perovskite film. 
 Results Fabrication and characterization of E-SnO 2 . It is well known that EDTA can react with transition metal oxide to form a complex, because it can provide its lone-pair electrons to the vacant d-orbital of the transition metal atom  47  . Thus, EDTA was chosen to modify the SnO 2 to improve its performance. Supplementary Fig.  1a  describes the chemical reaction that occurred when the SnO 2 was treated using the EDTA aqueous solution, resulting in the formation of a five-membered ring chelate. The images of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 samples are shown in Supplementary Fig.  1b . It is apparent that the unmodified EDTA and SnO 2 samples are transparent, while EDTA-treated SnO 2 turned into milky white. Supplementary Fig.  2  compares the Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of the E-SnO 2 solution measured in the freshly prepared condition and again after it was stored in an ambient atmosphere for 2 months. It is clear that there is no obvious difference between the two solutions indicating the high stability. Figure  1a  shows the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) for EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 films deposited on quartz substrates. In order to reduce the charging effect, the exposed surface of the quartz substrate was coated with a conductive silver paint and connected to the ground. We calibrated the binding energy scale for all XPS measurements to the carbon 1s line at 284.8 eV. It is clear from these measurements that SnO 2 shows only peaks attributed to Sn and O. After the EDTA treatment, the E-SnO 2 film shows an additional peak located at ca. 400 eV, ascribed to N. Meanwhile, the Sn 3d peaks from E-SnO 2 are shifted by ca. 0.16 eV in contrast to the pristine SnO 2 (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), indicating that EDTA is bound to the SnO 2 . FTIR was used to study the interaction between SnO 2 and EDTA. As shown in Fig.  1b , the peaks around 2895 cm -1 and 1673 cm -1 belong to C-H and C=O stretching vibration in the EDTA, respectively. The characteristic peaks of SnO 2 observed at ca. 701 cm -1 and 549 cm -1 are due to O-Sn-O stretch and the Sn-O vibration, respectively  48  . In addition, the peak at 1040 cm -1 in the SnO 2 film is attributed to O-O stretching vibration due to oxygen adsorption on the SnO 2 surface  49  . For the E-SnO 2 sample, the characteristic peaks of SnO 2 shift to 713 cm -1 and 563 cm -1 , and the C-H and C=O stretching vibration peaks shift to 2913 cm -1 and 1624 cm -1 , further demonstrating that the EDTA is indeed complexed with SnO 2 . Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 films deposited on the ITO substrates are shown in Fig.  1c . The data reveal that the E-SnO 2 film shows the smallest root-mean-square roughness of 2.88 nm, a key figure-of-merit for the PSCs  50  . We also measured their Fermi level by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), with the surface potential images shown in Supplementary Fig.  4 , and the calculated details are described in Supplementary Note 1. Figure  1d  provides energy band alignment between perovskites and different ETLs. The Fermi level of E-SnO 2 is very close to the conduction band of perovskite, which is beneficial for enhancing V oc  51  . )  Figure  1e  shows the optical transmission spectra of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 films coated on ITO. All these samples display high average transmittance in the visible region, demonstrating good optical quality. In addition, the electron mobility of various ETLs was measured using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method  20  , as shown in Fig.  1f . It is found that electron mobility of E-SnO 2 is 2.27 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 , significantly larger than those of the EDTA (3.56 × 10 -5 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) and the SnO 2 (9.92 × 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ). It is known that the electron mobility is a key figure-of-merit for ETLs in PSCs. Supplementary Fig.  5  shows the electron injection models for ITO/SnO 2 or E-SnO 2 /perovskite/PCBM/Al structures, with their corresponding J-V curves, and the details are described in Supplementary Note 2. It is apparent that the high electron mobility effectively promotes electron transfer in the PSCs, reduces charge accumulation at the ETL/perovskite interface, improves efficiency, and suppresses hysteresis for the PSCs  21  . V app -V r -V bi (V) EDTA 3.56E-5 cm 2 V -1 s -1 SnO 2 9.92E-4 cm 2 V -1 s -1 E-SnO 2 2.27E-3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 Perovskite growth mechanism. The quality of the perovskite films, including grain size, crystallinity, surface coverage, etc., is very important for high-performance PSCs. For a consistent microstructure, a solution deposition technique was used to fabricate perovskite films on EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 substrates. Figure  2a-c  shows the morphology of the perovskite films deposited on different ETLs. It is clear from these images that continuous pinhole-free films with full surface coverage were obtained. Figure  2d  shows the distribution diagram with an average grain size of about 309 nm for the perovskite coated on SnO 2 . The grain size increased to about 518 nm for the EDTA sample. Surprisingly, the average perovskite grain size is further enhanced to as much as about 828 nm (Fig.  2c, d ) for the E-SnO 2 substrates. According to the established model for nucleation and growth of thin films  52, 53  , the perovskite formation process can be divided into four steps: (i) formation of a crystal nucleus, (ii) evolution of nuclei into an island structure, (iii) formation of a networked microstructure, and (iv) growth of networks into a continuous film. The Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation in the first step can be expressed as Eq. (  1 ) 4G heterogeneous ¼ 4G homogeneous f θ ð Þ ð1Þ wherein f(θ) = (2-3 cos θ + cos 3 θ)/4  54  , and θ is the contact angle of the precursor solution. Since the magnitude of θ varies in the range of [0, π/2], the larger the θ is, the smaller is the magnitude of cos θ, and therefore larger is the parameter f(θ) ϵ [0, 1]. In other words, a smaller contact angle results in reduced Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation, thereby assisting the nucleation process. Higher nucleation density will promote the film densification process  53  . Compared to EDTA and SnO 2 , E-SnO 2 shows the smallest contact angle (20.67°, Supplementary Fig.  6 ), resulting in the wettability interface for the perovskite  55- 57  . Thus, the perovskite coated on the E-SnO 2 exhibits better crystallinity (Supplementary Fig.  7 ) and full surface coverage (Fig.  2c ). In addition, the small contact angle of the substrate provides the low surface energy  58  , leading to increased grain size during the growth of the networked structure  53  , as observed in the SEM measurements. Charge transfer dynamics. The electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/ETL/perovskite/PCBM/Ag were fabricated to evaluate the trap density of perovskite deposited on different substrates. Figure  3a  shows the dark current-voltage (I-V) curves of the electron-only devices. The linear correlation (dark yellow line) reveals an ohmic-type response at low bias voltage, when the bias voltage is above the kink point, which defines as the trapfilled limit voltage (V TFL ), the current nonlinearly increases (cyan line), indicating that the traps are completely filled. The trap density (N t ) can be obtained using Eq. (  2 ) N t ¼ 2ε 0 εV TFT eL 2 ð2Þ EDTA/perovskite where ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε is the relative dielectric constant of FA 0.95 Cs 0.05 PbI 3 (ε = 62.23)  59  , e is the electron charge, and L is the thickness of the film. The trap densities of the perovskite film coated on SnO 2 and EDTA substrates are 1.93 × 10 16 and 1.27 × 10 16 cm -3 , respectively. Interestingly, the trap density is reduced to as low as 8.97 × 10 15 cm -3 for the film deposited on E-SnO 2 . The significantly lower trap density is related to low grain boundary density in the perovskite film (Fig.  2 ). Figure  3b  shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite deposited on different substrates. Compared with other samples, significant PL quench is observed in the ITO/E-SnO 2 /perovskite, demonstrating that the E-SnO 2 has the most appealing merits as the highest electron mobility (Fig.  1f ). Figure  3c  shows the normalized time-resolved PL (TRPL) for perovskite coated on various ETLs. The lifetime and the corresponding amplitudes are listed in Supplementary Table  1 . Generally, the slow decay component (τ 1 ) is attributed to the radiative recombination of free charge carriers due to traps in the bulk, and the fast decay component (τ 2 ) is originated from the quenching of charge carriers at the interface  60  . The glass/ perovskite sample shows the longest lifetime under excitation intensity of 3 μJ cm -2 . For perovskite coated on the ITO substrate, the lifetime is decreased to more than half due to the charge transfer from perovskite into ITO. For EDTA/perovskite and SnO 2 /perovskite samples, both the fast and slow decay lifetimes are very similar, and τ 1 dominates the PL decay for both samples, indicating severe recombination before they were extracted. When the perovskite is deposited on E-SnO 2 , both τ 1 and τ 2 were shortened to 14.16 ns and 0.97 ns, with a proportion of 45.32% and 54.68%, respectively. Meanwhile, τ 2 appears to dominate the PL decay, indicating that electrons are effectively extracted from the perovskite layer to the E-SnO 2 with minimal recombination loss. Even under smaller excitation intensity (0.5 μJ cm -2 ), the acceleration of the lifetime for E-SnO 2 /perovskite is observed. The lifetime increases with reduced excitation intensity (Supplementary Fig.  8  and Supplementary Table  1 ), in agreement with a previous report  61  . The electron-transport yield (Ф tr ) of different ETLs with different excitation intensities can be estimated using equation, Ф tr = 1 -τ p /τ glass , where τ p is the average lifetime for perovskite deposited on different substrates, and τ glass is the average lifetime for glass/perovskite. With the excitation intensity of 3 μJ cm -2 , the electron-transport yields of ITO, EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 are 49.72%, 67.58%, 68.31%, and 81.50%, respectively. When the excitation intensity reduces to 0.5 μJ cm -2 , the electron-transport yields of ITO, EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 are increased to 60.37%, 74.46%, 80.65%, and 90.82%, respectively. It is clear that the excitation intensity can significantly increase the electron-transport yield. These results further indicate that the E-SnO 2 is a good electron extraction layer for planar-type PSCs. The performance of PSCs. With the superior optoelectronic properties discussed above, it is expected that the E-SnO 2 would make a better ETL in the PSCs than the SnO 2 . Planar-type PSCs are therefore designed and fabricated based on different ETLs with the device structure shown in Fig.  4a  inset. FAPbI 3 was used as the active absorber for its proper band gap, with a small amount of Cs doping to improve its phase stability  62, 63  . Supplementary Fig.  9  presents the cross-sectional SEM images for the complete device structure. The thickness of the perovskite film is controlled at ca. 420 nm for all devices. While the perovskite grains are not large enough to penetrate through the film thickness when the SnO 2 is used as the substrate, the grains are significantly larger when deposited on EDTA and E-SnO 2 with the grains grown across the film thickness, which is consistent with top-view SEM results (Fig.  2 ). Figure  4a  shows the J-V curves of planar-type PSCs using different ETLs, with the key parameters, including short-circuit current density (J sc ), V oc , fill factor (FF), and PCE summarized in Table  1 . The device based on EDTA gives a PCE of 16.42% with J sc = 22.10 mA cm -2 , V oc = 1.08 V, and FF = 0.687. The device based on SnO 2 substrate shows a PCE of 18.93% with J sc = 22.79 mA cm -2 , V oc = 1.10 V, and FF = 0.755. Interestingly, when the E-SnO 2 is employed as ETL, the J sc , FF, and V oc are increased to 24.55 mA cm -2 , 0.792, and 1.11 V, yielding a PCE up to 21.60%, (the certified efficiency is 21.52%, and the certificated document is shown in Supplementary Fig.  10 ), the highest efficiency reported to date for the planar-type PSCs. The low device performance for the EDTA is caused by small J sc and FF, which is related to low electron mobility and high resistance  47  , and the low V oc results from the small offset of Fermi energy between the EDTA and HTL (Fig.  1d )  64  . In comparison, the planar-type PSCs with E-SnO 2 ETLs exhibit the best performance. The higher J sc and FF are Fig.  3  The charge transfer between perovskite and different ETLs. a Dark I-V curves of the electron-only devices with the V TFL kink points. The inset shows the structure of the electron-only device. b Steady-state PL and c TRPL spectra with an excitation intensity of 3 μJ cm -2 of perovskite films deposited on different substrates attributed to the high electron mobility that promotes effective electron extraction, and the larger V oc due to the closer energy level between E-SnO 2 and perovskite  65  . Figure  4b  shows the incidentphoton-to-charge conversion efficiency (IPCE) and the integrated current of the PSCs based on different ETLs. The integrated current values calculated by the IPCE spectra for the devices using EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 are 21.22, 21.58, and 24.15 mA cm -2 , respectively, very close to the J-V results. It is apparent that the device based on the E-SnO 2 shows significantly higher IPCE due to less optical loss when perovskite is deposited on E-SnO 2 ETL (Supplementary Fig.  11 ), consistent with the J-V measurement. To further demonstrate the device characteristics, photocurrent density of the champion devices from each group based on EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 was measured when the devices were biased at 0.85, 0.89, and 0.92 V, respectively. Figure  4c  shows the corresponding curves at the maximum power point (V mp ) in the J-V plots. The PCEs of the champion devices using the EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 stabilize at 16.34%, 18.67%, and 21.67% with photocurrent densities of 19.22, 20.98, and 23.55 mA cm -2 , respectively, very close to the values measured from the J-V curves. Next, we fabricated and measured 30 individual devices for each ETL to study repeatability. Figure  4d  shows the PCE distribution histogram for devices with different ETLs, with the statistics listed in Supplementary Tables  2 3 4 . Amazingly, the devices based on E-SnO 2 exhibit excellent repeatability with a very small standard deviation in contrast to the devices based on EDTA and SnO 2 , indicating that the E-SnO 2 is an excellent ETL in the planar-type PSC.  In order to gain further insight into the charge transport mechanism, the charge transfer processes in the perovskite devices were studied in detail. The carrier recombination rate in the PSCs was evaluated by the V oc decay measurements. Figure  5a  shows the V oc decay curves of the PSCs based on different ETLs. It is apparent that the planar-type PSC based on E-SnO 2 exhibits the slowest V oc decay time compared to the devices based on EDTA and SnO 2 , indicating that the devices with E-SnO 2 have the lowest charge recombination rate and the longest carrier lifetime, consistent with the highest V oc for the device based on E-SnO 2 by J-V measurements. Figure  5b  shows J sc versus light intensity of the PSCs using various ETLs. It appears that all devices show a linear correlation with the slopes very close to 1, indicating that the bimolecular recombination in the devices is negligible  66  . Figure  5c  shows that V oc changes linearly with the light intensity. Prior studies have indicated that the deviation between the slope and the value of (kT/q) reflects the trap-assisted recombination  20  . In the present case, the device using the E-SnO 2 shows the smallest slope, indicating the least trap-assisted recombination, which is in excellent agreement with the result showing the lowest trap density when the perovskite is deposited on E-SnO 2 (Fig.  3a ). In fact, the slope is as small as 1.02 kT/q, implying that the trap-assisted recombination is almost negligible. The electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to extract transfer resistance in the solar cells. Figure  5d  shows the Nyquist plots of the devices using different ETLs measured at V oc under dark conditions, with the equivalent circuit shown in Supplementary Fig.  12 . It is known that in the EIS analysis, the high-frequency component is the signature of the transfer resistance (R tr ) and the low-frequency one for the recombination resistance (R rec )  67  . In the present study, because the perovskite/ HTL interface is identical for all devices, the only variable affecting R tr is the perovskite/ETL interface. The numerical fitting gives the device parameters, as listed in Supplementary Table  5 . Apparently, compared to PSCs based on EDTA and SnO 2 , the device with E-SnO 2 shows the smallest R tr of 14.8 Ω and the largest R rec of 443.3 Ω. The small R tr is beneficial for electron extraction, and the large R rec effectively resists charge recombination, which is in agreement with the observations discussed above. Combined, all the results confirm that E-SnO 2 is the most effective ETL for the planar-type PSC. Stability and hysteresis. Stability and hysteresis are two key characteristics for the PSCs. Figure  6a  shows normalized PCE measured as a function of storage time, with more detailed J-V parameters summarized in Supplementary Table  6 . It is clear that while the device based on E-SnO 2 maintains 92% of its initial efficiency exposed to an ambient atmosphere after 2880 h in the dark, the device using SnO 2 only provides 74% of its initial efficiency under the same storage condition. The PSCs were also tested under continuous irradiation at 100 mW cm -2 . Figure  6b  shows the normalized PCE changes as a function of test time, with more detailed J-V parameters provided in Supplementary Table  7 . It is clear that after 120 h of illumination, the device using the E-SnO 2 maintains 86% of its initial efficiency, while for the same test duration, the device using SnO 2 remains only 38% relative to its initial efficiency. It is apparent that the device fabricated on E-SnO 2 shows excellent stability under both the dark and continuous irradiation. The instability of PSC is mainly caused by degradation of the perovskite film and spiro-OMeTAD HTL. In the present work, all devices used the same spiro-OMeTAD HTL, therefore, the degradation from the HTL should be the same for all the devices. It is found that the grain size of the perovskite film is increased by three times when it is deposited on E-SnO 2 in comparison to that on the pristine SnO 2 (Fig.  2 ). The larger grain size can effectively suppress the moisture permeation at grain boundaries  68  , resulting in improved environmental stability for the PSCs based on the E-SnO 2 ETLs. For the hysteresis test, Fig.  6c  and d  show the J-V curves measured under both reverse-and forward-scan directions. It is found that the device with E-SnO 2 has almost identical J-V curves with negligible hysteresis, even when it is measured using different scan rates from 0.01 to 0.5 V s -1 . Supplementary Fig.  13  presents J-V curves measured for the device based on E-SnO 2 at different scan rates. It is apparent that the J-V curves almost remain the same, regardless of scan rate and direction, demonstrating that the hysteresis is negligible. Generally, the hysteresis of PSCs is ascribed to interfacial capacitance caused by charge accumulation at the interface, which originates from ion migration, high trap density, and unbalanced charge transport within the perovskite device  [69] [70] [71]  . It is found that the trap density of the perovskite film is significantly reduced when it is deposited on the E-SnO 2 , one of the primary reasons for reduced hysteresis. In addition, the electron mobility of the SnO 2 ETL is only 9.92 × 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 s -1 (Fig.  1f ), about an order of magnitude slower than the hole mobility of the doped spiro-OMeTAD (ca. 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) HTL. Thus, the electron flux (F e ) is ca. 10 times smaller than the hole flux (F h ) due to the same interface area of the ETL/perovskite and perovskite/HTL, that leads to charge accumulation at the SnO 2 /perovskite interface, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  14a . The accumulated charge would cause hysteresis in the solar cells (Fig.  6c ). When the high electron mobility E-SnO 2 (2.27 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) is employed as the ETL, the F e is comparable to the F h of the spiro-OMeTAD HTL (Supplementary Fig.  14b ), resulting in equivalent charge transport at both electrodes. Therefore, the high electron mobility of E-SnO 2 would enhance electron transport from perovskite to E-SnO 2 ETL, leading to no significant charge accumulation, and consequently, the devices based on the E-SnO 2 exhibit negligible hysteresis. High-efficiency flexible PSCs. Given the advantage of lowtemperature preparation, we applied the E-SnO 2 ETL in flexible PSCs. Figure  7a  shows J-V curves of flexible PSCs using the poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET)/ITO substrates, with key J-V parameters summarized in Table  1 . The champion flexible device exhibits PCE of 18.28% (J sc = 23.42 mA cm -2 , V oc = 1.09 V, and FF = 0.716). The lower J sc of the flexible device is caused by the lower transparency of the PET/ITO substrate compared to the glass/ITO used for the rigid device (Supplementary Fig.  15 ). The lower V oc and FF are likely due to higher sheet resistance of the PET/ITO substrate  67  . Figure  7c  shows the IPCE and integral current density of the flexible device. It is clear that the integral current is 23.12 mA cm -2 , in perfect agreement with the J-V results. For the reproducibility test, 30 individual cells were fabricated with the PCE distribution histogram shown in Fig.  7d  and detailed parameters are summarized in Supplementary Table  8 , both confirming very good reproducibility. The mechanical stability is an important quality indicator for the flexible solar cells. According to a previous report  72  , it is safe ) Voltage (V) for ITO to be bended to a radius of 14 mm, and when the bending radius is smaller than 14 mm, the ITO layer starts to crack, leading to significant degradation in conductivity. In order to examine the mechanical stability of the flexible PSCs, we therefore adopted the bending radii of 14 mm, 12 mm, and 7 mm to test the flexible device. Figure  7a  shows device performance of the flexible solar cells measured after flexing for 500 times with different curvature radii, and the test procedure is shown in Fig.  7b . It shows that after flexing for 500 times at a bending radius of 14 mm, the J-V curve and the associated parameters remain the same without obvious degradation. However, when the bending radius is decreased to 12 mm and 7 mm, the PCE degraded to 17.82% and 16.84%, respectively, attributing to the conductivity degradation of ITO  72  .

 Discussion An effective E-SnO 2 ETL has been developed, and the PCE of planar-type PSCs is increased to 21.60% with negligible hysteresis, and the certified efficiency is 21.52%, this is the highest reported value for planar-type PSCs so far. By taking advantage of lowtemperature processing for E-SnO 2 ETLs, flexible devices with high PCE of 18.28% are also fabricated. The significant performance of the planar-type PSCs is attributed to the superior advantages when perovskite is deposited on E-SnO 2 ETLs, including larger grain size, lower trap density, and good crystallinity. The higher electron mobility facilitates electron transfer for suppressed charge accumulation at the interface, leading to high efficiency with negligible J-V hysteresis. Furthermore, the longterm stability is significantly enhanced since the large grain size that suppressed perovskite degradation at grain boundaries. This work provides a promising direction toward developing highquality ETLs, and we believe that the present work will facilitate transition of perovskite photovoltaics. 
 Methods Materials. NH 2 CHNH 2 I (FAI) was synthesized and purified according to a reported procedure  45  . The SnO 2 solution was purchased from Alfa Aesar (tin (IV) oxide, 15 wt% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion). PbI 2 (purity > 99.9985%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. EDTA (purity > 99.995%), CsI (purity > 99.999%), dimethylformamide (DMF, purity > 99%), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, purity > 99%) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. In total, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-pmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) was bought from Yingkou OPV Tech Co., Ltd. All of the other solvents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich without any purification. Fabrication of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 films. The 0.2-mg EDTA was dissolved in 1 mL of deionized water, and the SnO 2 aqueous colloidal dispersion (15 wt%) was diluted using deionized water to the concentration of 2.5 wt%. These solutions were stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The SnO 2 and EDTA layers were fabricated by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 60 s using the corresponding solution, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C under ca. 5 Pa for 30 min to remove residual solvent. The EDTA and SnO 2 solution were mixed with a volume ratio of 1:1, then put on a hot plate at 80 °C for 5 h under stirring conditions, and the milky-white E-SnO 2 colloidal solution (Supplementary Fig.  1b ) was obtained. The E-SnO 2 colloidal solution was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 60 s, and then transferred the samples into a vacuum oven at 60 °C under ca. 5 Pa for 30 min to remove the residual solvent. Finally, the E-SnO 2 films were obtained. Electron mobility of EDTA, SnO 2 , and E-SnO 2 films. To gain insights into the charge transport, we have measured electron mobility using different ETLs in the same device structure. Specifically, the electron-only device was designed and fabricated using ITO/Al/ETL/Al structure, as shown in the inset in Fig.  1f . In this analysis, we assumed that the current is only related to electrons. When the effects of diffusion and the electric field are neglected, the current density can be determined by the SCLC  73  . The thickness of 80-nm Al was deposited on ITO substrates by thermal evaporation, and then the different ETLs were spin-coated on ITO/Al. Finally, 80-nm-thick Al was deposited on ITO/Al/ETL samples. The dark J-V curves of the devices were performed on a Keithley 2400 source at ambient conditions. The electron mobility (μ e ) is extracted by fitting the J-V curves using the Mott-Gurney law (  3 ) μ e ¼ 8JL 3 9ε 0 ε V app À V r À V bi 2 ð3Þ where J is the current density, L the thickness of different ETLs, ε 0 the vacuum permittivity, ε r the dielectric permittivity of various ETLs, V app the applied voltage, V r the voltage loss due to radiative recombination, and V bi the built-in voltage owing to the different work function between the anode and cathode. Fabrication of solar cells. The perovskite absorbers were deposited on different ETL substrates using one-step solution processed. In total, 240.8 mg of FAI, 646.8 mg of PbI 2 , and 18.2 mg of CsI were dissolved in 1 mL of DMF and DMSO (4:1, volume/volume), with stirring at 60 °C for 2 h. The precursor solution was spincoated on the EDTA, SnO 2 and E-SnO 2 substrates. The spin-coated process was divided by a consecutive two-step process, the spin rate of the first step is 1000 rpm for 15 s with accelerated speed of 200 rpm, and the spin rate of the second step is 4000 rpm for 45 s with accelerated speed of 1000 rpm. During the second step end of 15 s, 200 μL of chlorobenzene was drop-coated to treat the perovskite films, and then the perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 30 min in a glovebox. After cooling down to room temperature, the spiro-OMeTAD solution was coated on perovskite films at 5000 rpm for 30 s with accelerated speed of 3000 rpm. The 1-mL HTL chlorobenzene solution contains 90 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 36 μL of 4-tertbutylpyridine, and 22 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide of 520 mg mL -1 in acetonitrile. The samples were retained in a desiccator overnight to oxidate the spiro-OMeTAD. Finally, 100-nm-thick Au was deposited using thermal evaporation. The device area of 0.1134 cm 2 was determined by a metal mask. Characterization. The J-V curves of the PSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 source under ambient conditions at room temperature. The light source was a 450-W xenon lamp (Oriel solar simulator) with a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter (Praezisions Glas & Optik GmbH) to match AM1.5 G. The light intensity was 100 mW cm -2 calibrated by a NREL-traceable KG5-filtered silicon reference cell. The active area of 0.1017 cm 2 was defined by a black metal aperture to avoid light scattering into the device, and the aperture area was determined by the MICRO VUE sol 161 instrument. The J-V curves for PSCs were tested both at reverse scan (from 2 to -0.1 V, step 0.02 V) and forward scan (from -0.1 to 2 V, step 0.02 V), and the scan rate was selected from 0.01 to 0.5 V s -1 . There was no preconditioning before the test. The IPCE was implemented on the QTest Station 2000ADI system (Crowntech. Inc., USA). AFM height images were attained by a Bruker Multimode 8 in tapping mode. KPFM was carried out on Bruker Metrology Nanoscope VIII AFM in an ambient atmosphere. The TRPL spectra were performed on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer. SEM images were gained by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SU8020) under an accelerating voltage of 2 kV. XPS measurements were performed on an AXISULTRA X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The optical transmission was acquired by a Hitachi U-3900 spectrophotometer. Fig. 1f . 1f Fig. 1f.

 ) obtained from KPFM is totally different from the value of CB band, and the energy diagram in figure 1(d) is misleading. Response: Thank you very much for the comment. The Fermi level obtained from KPFM is indeed different from the value of CB band. We are really sorry for the inappropriate label used in Fig. 1b, and it is corrected in the revised manuscript. In present work, we used the KPFM to test surface potential of different ETLs, and the images are shown in Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Information. The Fermi level (FL) of different samples can be calculated using the equation: FL = 4.6 + e(SP HOPG -SP sample ),where e is the elementary charge of the electron, SP HOPG and SP sample are surface potential of HOPG and the sample, respectively. Thus we can obtain the values of FL for EDTA, SnO 2 and E-SnO 2 . More details are provided in the Supplementary Information (page S3, Fig.S4).

Related to this, how much does ITO quench the emission? • On page 17 the authors state that the ""electron mobility of E-SnO2 would enhance electron transfer,"" do the authors mean transport? • The authors write dimethyl sulfide in the materials and methods, is this a typo of dimethyl sulfoxide or is this correct? • Is the SnO2/water solution 2.5 wt%? • Are the SnO2 layers annealed at all? • How are the control SnO2 layers and the control EDTA layers fabricated? Reviewer #2: Remarks to the Author: • The PL lifetimes in Fig 3c are very fast! lifetimes of less than 1 ns for good perovskite films indicate either something 
 . Why was this chosen? It is where ITO cracks? Please provide some references. Reviewer #3: Remarks to the Author: In this work, the authors introduced an ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-complexed SnO2 as the electron transport layer (ETL) for planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to realize a certified efficiency of 21.5% with eliminated hysteresis and enhanced stability. However, similar concept has been already reported in a previous work (Chem. Mater., 2017, 29, 4176-4180) besides the improved efficiency for PSCs. I thus felt the novelty of this work is not impressive and not suitable to publish in Nature Communications as considering its high standard. I would recommend the publication of this work in the other specific journal. Some remarks / questions follow: 1. The author should refer the mentioned reference (Chem. Mater., 2017, 29, 4176-4180) in the manuscript. 2. The surface potential (Fermi level) obtained from KPFM is totally different from the value of CB band, and the energy diagram in figure 1(d ) is misleading. 3. What is the real mechanism for the eliminated hysteresis by using EDTA-SnO2? The author should clarify it.

Suppressed Ion Migration in Reduced-Dimensional Perovskites Improves Operating Stability
Impressive progress in halide perovskite solar cells motivates further work to improve operating stability. It is known that ion-migration-driven decomposition represents a degradation pathway in perovskite solar cells and that it can occur within the perovskite material even in well-encapsulated devices. Here we find that quasi-two-dimensional (2.5D) perovskites suppress this ionmigration-induced degradation. Using TOF-SIMS, we confirm that iodide migration occurs in bulk perovskite photovoltaic devices operating at their maximum power point (MPP). We observe that iodine ions migrate across the spiro-OMeTAD layer to the spiro/ gold contact interface, oxidizing and deteriorating the gold at the interface. In contrast, we find that large ⟨n⟩ 2.5D perovskites exhibit a significantly reduced rate of ion migration compared to 3D devices and exhibit less than 1% relative PCE loss in over 80 h of continuous operation at MPP, whereas the PCE of 3D devices diminishes by more than 50% within the first 24 h.
T oday's perovskite solar cells (PSCs) require additional effort on stability, especially under maximum power point (MPP) operating conditions.  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  Perovskites have two main decomposition pathways at room temperature: one arises due to moisture and oxygen-induced hydration and oxidization of the perovskite and another is ion-migrationdriven decomposition.  [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]  The first process can be addressed by encapsulants such as those employed in commercial solar cell modules.  [12] [13] [14] [15]  The second process, ion migration, is associated with the low formation energy of the perovskite lattice and involves the movement of ions especially under solar cell working conditions. This can occur even in encapsulated devices. It leads to the formation of vacancies or undesirable complexes.  10, [16] [17] [18] [19]  It has been shown that ion migration can cause the formation of PbI 2 belts in MAPbI 3 under a high applied bias, which is believed detrimental to long-term performance.  10  This behavior needs to be addressed through improvements to the perovskite active layer itself. Recently, PSCs with active layers composed of mixeddimensional perovskites (also known as Ruddlesden-Popper or quasi-two-dimensional (2.5D) perovskites) have shown indications of promising stability compared to analogous 3D PSCs.  [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26]  Lower-dimensional perovskites are formed through the addition of bulky ammonium cation ligands (typically phenethylammonium, PEA, or butylammonium, BTA), which can substitute A-site cations (e.g., methylammonium, formadinium, or cesium) (FA = HC(NH 2 ) 2 + , MA = CH 3 NH 3 + ) and form a layer of protective hydrophobic organic molecules that terminate the perovskite lattice. Hydrophobic terminating organic layers help prevent water from penetrating into the material.  20, 21, 27  Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have shown that the removal of these bulky cations from the lattice requires significantly higher energies than does the removal of smaller A-site cations like MA or FA, indicating another basis of improved stability.  27  The relationship between perovskite dimensionality and ion migration remains underexplored. Temperature-dependent conductivity studies have revealed that the activation energy for ion migration in low-n 2.5D perovskites (⟨n⟩ = 3) exceeds that in bulk perovskites.  28  These studies focused on the active material itself rather than full devices, and the identity of migrating species was not reported. Additionally, solar cells with active layers composed of strongly confined, lowdimensional 2.5D perovskites (typically n ≤ 5) typically exhibit low PCEs and are therefore not suitable for applications in highly efficient photovoltaics.  20, 27  Studies of 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures have shown improved long-term stability but do not directly address the challenge of ion migration within the 3D layer and have been seen to suffer an initial loss of PCE (termed a fast burn-in).  29  Ion migration in 2.5D perovskites with higher average quantum well widths (n ≥ 20) has not been thoroughly examined nor has the relationship between 2.5D perovskites and device operating (AM1.5 at MPP) stability, as distinct from ambient stability (shelf life). Here we study vertical ion migration and investigate how this affects performance degradation in planar n-i-p PSCs under ambient working conditions, comparing the use of 2.5D vs 3D active layers. We find that 2.5D perovskites (n = 40) that employ the ligand allylammonium (ALA) provide improved operating stability compared to their 3D counterparts. With the aid of time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS), we report that the main species undergoing vertical ion migration is iodine. We observe that iodine migrates through the organic hole transport layer (HTL) to the metal contact atop the device, deteriorating the HTL and HTL/metal interface. Comparing the TOF-SIMS profiles of 2.5D and 3D perovskites in the same device architectures and aging conditions, we find 75% less Au 2 I signal at the HTL/ metal interface and 60% lower change in iodine signal in the HTL for the 2.5D device, indicating that 2.5D perovskites exhibit significantly slower vertical iodine migration in planar n-i-p devices. We further analyze the impact of ion migration on device stability, finding that iodide migration is deleterious to MPP stability and that the suppressed migration in 2.5D devices helps MPP stability under inert conditions. With this suppressed ion migration, we achieved a 19.9% PCE 2.5D photovoltaic device with no observable PCE decrease after operating under MPP tracking conditions for 80 h, whereas the 3D device degraded by more than 50% following the first 24 h of MPP operation. To study the impact of ion migration on the long-term operation of PSCs, we fabricated control devices using the planar n-i-p structure ITO/TiO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMe-TAD/Au. The perovskite layer has a triple cation/anion composition of Cs 0.05 FA 0.8 MA 0.15 PbI 2.88 Br 0.04 Cl 0.08 . To synthesize the 2.5D perovskite active layers, we substituted 5% (molar ratio) of the A-site cations with the organic ligand molecule ALA in the precursor solution. This corresponds to an average of n = 40 layers per grain (n = number of monolayers in perovskite). We selected ALA as the ligand because, compared to other bulky organic ligand molecules such as PEA and BTA, ALA provides a smaller population of lower-n perovskite quantum wells.  30  This provides a smoother energy landscape within the film and at the same time offers similar dark stability to that provided by PEA and BTA.  27, 30  The device structure is shown in Figure  1a . We first looked for morphological differences correlated with ALA incorporation. In Figure  1b ,c, we show scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the 3D and 2.5D perovskite films. The pristine 3D perovskite film shows a pinhole-free surface, which indicates no shunt in the perovskite layer. The 2.5D perovskite is similar to the 3D perovskite film, with some flake-like stacking structures corresponding to the 2.5D perovskite.  21   To provide an initial stability comparison between 3D and 2.5D perovskite, we aged the devices under a N 2 atmosphere at room temperature to exclude oxygen. This also allowed us to exclude moisture and heat-induced degradation of the perovskites. We then compared X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns before and after aging (Figure  1d ). Even in inert conditions, the 3D devices show a significant increase in PbI 2 after aging. For 3D perovskites, the PbI 2 /perovskite XRD peak ratio increased over 20% after aging compared to fresh 3D samples, whereas for 2.5D perovskite, the PbI 2 /perovskite ratio stayed the same (Table  1 ). We note that the PbI 2 peak in XRD is very sensitive to the film composition, and even a few percent excess of PbI 2 can give rise to a large PbI 2 signal in XRD.  30, 31  This sensitivity enables us to report a signal related to the degradation of perovskite in a N 2 atmosphere, but we point out that the peak area represents a relative change in the amount of PbI 2 before vs after aging. We also looked for changes in carrier dynamics related to the incorporation of ALA. Figure  2a ,b shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of the 3D and 2.5D perovskites. The samples are encapsulated using poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to avoid degradation from oxygen and moisture.  31, 32  We observe that the PL peak position shows no notable difference between 2.5D and 3D perovskites, a result of the high ⟨n⟩ value in the 2.5D case: the quantum confinement of the n = 40 grains is too small to be spectrally resolved, in agreement with previous observations.  33  Figure  2c  shows the change of PL intensity versus time for the 3D and 2.5D perovskite films. The PL intensity of 3D perovskite quickly decreases while the 2.5D perovskite remains stable: for the 2.5D perovskite, its change compared to its initial value is less than 20% relative as a result of 10 h of aging under photoexcitation.  34  To characterize any ion migration and to determine the identity of moving species in working devices, we carried out TOF-SIMS measurements on fresh vs MPP-operated devices. We operated both the 3D and 2.5D perovskite devices under AM1.5 conditions at MPP in nitrogen at room temperature. We first measured the depth profile of fresh and aged 3D and 2.5D devices (Figures  S1  and S2 ) and compared all major ion species. As the I -and FA + counts in the perovskite layer saturated the detector, we also provide depth-dependent traces for I 2 -and 13 C-FA in Figures  S1, S2 , and S4. The Pb, FA, MA, and Cs ions show no major difference (Figures  S3-S6 ) before and after aging for both 3D and 2.5D perovskites. However, in the 3D perovskite, the iodine signal shows prominent changes, especially at the interface between the gold and spiro-OMeTAD (hereafter referred to just as spiro) layers (Figure  S2 ), while the 2.5D device shows little change (Figure  S1 ). We conclude that I -is the dominant species migrating during these experiments and that the n = 40 2.5D perovskite suppresses this migration (Figure  3a ). Figure  S7  shows the 3D tomography reconstruction from the TOF-SIMS experiments, and it indicates the uniformity and low concentration of I -in the spiro layer in the fresh device. We conclude that in the present study the I -signal away from the perovskite layer is a result of migration and not due to permeation of ions through large pinholes.  35  We also identified a significant amount of Au 2 I -signal in the TOF-SIMS spectra. We note that this signal does not directly confirm the existence of such a complex at the interface; it is possible that this complex forms following the sputtering pulse in our TOF-SIMS experiments before being swept into the detector (i.e., the sputtering of two gold atoms and one iodine atom leads to the formation of a singly charged secondary ion complex shortly upon entering the vacuum after being sputtered from the sample). It does, however, confirm the presence of iodine at this interface. The depth profile shows that the Au 2 I -signal has increased significantly in aged 3D perovskite devices compared to fresh devices (Figure  3b ). In contrast, in the case of the 2.5D perovskite, the Au 2 I -signal is unchanged before and after aging (Figure  3c ). These findings suggest that in 3D devices, I -migrates from the perovskite layer through the spiro layer and all the way to the spiro/gold interface in MPP operating devices even at room temperature in a nitrogen atmosphere. In n = 40 2.5D perovskite devices, this migration is greatly suppressed: comparing the ratio of Au 2 I -signal at the gold/spiro interface before and after aging, we see that this signal increases roughly    ×5 for the 3D devices, whereas the increase is only about ×1.25 for the 2.5D devices. We performed additional TOF-SIMS experiments with slower sputtering rates in order better to resolve ion migration within the Au and spiro layers of the device. Plots of Au -, I -, and C 5 N -versus sputtering depth are shown in Figure  4  for the 3D (Figure  4a ) and 2.5D (Figure  4c ) devices. Because these devices are aged at room temperature, Au does not penetrate through the spiro layer but exists only in the surface layer.  36  Figure  4b ,d presents enlarged figures that show the I - distribution in the spiro layer for fresh and MPP aged 3D and 2.5D devices, respectively. The MPP-operated 3D perovskite device exhibits a 60% higher I -signal than fresh devices throughout the spiro layer, while the 2.5D perovskite shows a much smaller change following the same duration of AM1.5 MPP operation. This directly proves the iodine migration throughout the spiro and gold layers in the 3D device and the suppression of iodine migration in the 2.5D perovskite device. 
 ACS Energy Letters Letter To investigate further iodine migration in 3D perovskites, we carried out sputtering X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of full devices, sputtering from the top of the gold layer through to the gold/spiro interface and further into the spiro layer, keeping track of the elements Au, I, and N at the various sputter depths (Figure  S8 ). We observed that the Au counts decrease significantly at line scan 5, corresponding to the Au/ spiro interface. Upon reaching this interface, in the aged sample, a shoulder peak with higher binding energy appears in the Au 4f spectrum: the binding energy of Au 4f 7/2 for Au 0 is ∼84.2 eV, whereas oxidized gold Au + has a binding energy of ∼85.6 eV.  37  These values are consistent with the peak positions we see in our Au 4f spectra, indicating oxidation of Au near the spiro/gold interface. No such peak is observed in fresh samples. This suggests that gold forms complexes with iodine that have migrated to this interface as this is observed to be the dominant species migrating during device operation. We note that these oxidized peaks do not appear as a result of damage to the material during the sputtering process because mostly Au 0 peaks are again obtained after sputtering deeper into the material, and no extra peaks are observed in the fresh samples that are sputtered under identical conditions. From these experiments, we conclude that iodide ions are activated within the perovskite active layer under MPP conditions and that they migrate within the active layer but also through the spiro layer before they reach the spiro/gold interface. This study identifies that at room temperature the moving species are indeed I -ions rather than metal ions.  36, 38  This migration and the subsequent deterioration of the Au/ spiro interface is much more severe in the 3D device compared to that in the 2.5D device, and this agrees with the ability of 2.5D perovskites to suppress iodide ion migration in MPP conditions. To examine the influence of this ion migration on photovoltaic performance, we studied the MPP stability of PSCs based on 3D and 2.5D devices. The current-voltage (J-V) characteristics of champion devices are given in Figure  5a , and the performance metrics are summarized in Table  2 . The external quantum efficiency (EQE) is shown in Figure  5c . The stable output at MPP gives 20% PCE for the 3D device and 19% for the 2.5D device (Figure  5b ), demonstrating that high average n value 2.5D perovskites provide a similar performance to 3D devices.  27  When the devices are operated at MPP in a nitrogen atmosphere, the 3D devices degrade rapidly, losing more than 50% of their initial PCE within 24 h of operation. In contrast, the 2.5D device shows no change in performance following 80 h of continuous AM1.5 MPP operation (Figure  5d ). In contrast with other reports of MPP stability for 2.5D perovskites, we do not observe an initial burn-in.  21, 22  Because the MPP tests are performed at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere, oxygen-and water-induced degradation pathways can be ruled out. We conclude that the main degradation of these devices comes from ion migration, consistent with the observed iodide migration in 3D perovskite devices and suppressed migration in 2.5D perovskite devices. To further evaluate how the ALA molecules suppress ion migration and stabilize the perovskite, we also tested the stability of ALA-post-treated devices under the same operating conditions. We found that post-treated devices do not show an appreciable difference in stability compared to the pure 3D device (Figure  S9 ). Covering the surface of the perovskite with ligands is thus not sufficient to suppress ion migration: we offer that the formation of 2.5D structured grains, with their more negative (more favorable) formation energy, is key to stabilization. To conclude, this work investigated degradation processes within n-i-p planar PSCs in inert photovoltaic working conditions. By comparing fresh and MPP aged devices operating in an inert atmosphere, we correlate vertical ion migration in a planar n-i-p device with degradation of operating performance. The studies are designed such that they exclude external factors such as oxygen and moisture. We also identified iodide ions to be the dominant migrating species. We are the first to report that iodide ions are sufficiently activated under standard working conditions to migrate within the perovskite active layer, penetrate through the spiro layer, and reach the spiro/Au interface, where they possibly form an iodine-gold complex. We saw that forming 2.5D perovskites by adding ALA ligands suppresses this migration and allows for significantly enhanced stability. The 2.5D PSC has an initial PCE of 19.9% that shows no degradation (including no initial drop in efficiency due to burn-in) following 80 h of continuous AM1.5 operation at MPP, whereas PSCs with 3D active layers show an initial PCE of 20% that degrades to an AM1.5 PCE of less than 10% within 24 h of operation. This work offers insights into the degradation mechanisms in PSCs in inert MPP conditions and highlights how 2.5D perovskites can contribute to increased stability in PSCs, in addition to their effects of protecting against moisture-and oxygen-induced degradation. To retard further the migration of other atoms, other layers can be modified. For example, gold migration can occur at 70 °C, and adding Cr can suppress this process.  36  Such modifications, along with the use of 2.5D perovskites, can be expected to improve stability further.

For the control perovskite films without PEAI treatment, as similar as our previous reports 8, 25 , there are two separated phases. The dark grain region is perovskite crystal, and the white grains surrounding perovskite phase are PbI 2 8, 25 . After PEAI coating, the PbI 2 layer has been fully covered as we can Supplementary Fig.  3b . The roughness of perovskite layer has been reduced from 32 to 24 nm after PEAI coating, indicates that PEAI salt are more easily deposited at grain boundary (usually, there is a valley at grain boundary, Supplementary Fig.  7 ), and thus reduces the height difference between the grain surface and grain boundary.

Supplementary Table  4| . Summary of the device performance while treating perovskite surface with different organic salts. Supplementary Fig.  22|  The initial current density-voltage (J-V) curve for the devices with and without PEAI layer while using PTAA as the hole transport layer (HTL), these devices have been used for the thermal stressing test at 85 o C. T he power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) swiftly increased from 3.8% to more than 20% in 10 years due to composition engineering, perovskite film growth control and perovskite/transport layer interface engineering  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]  . To further increase the PCE of PSCs, improvement of the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) and fill factor (FF) could be more feasible than the short-circuit current (J SC ), considering that the J SC is almost close to its limit (~26 mA cm -2 ) for a bandgap of around 1.55 eV. 
 Perovskite Supplementary It is known that the V OC of solar cells is strongly related to the recombination of defects in the bulk or on the surface of the absorber layer  [14] [15] [16] [17]  . Solution-processed perovskite films are usually polycrystalline, which means they contain substantial structural disorder, such as grain boundary defects and crystallographic defects  [14] [15] [16] [17]  . Although it has been theoretically predicted that most of the defects formed in the perovskite layer are shallow defects  18  , several experimental results have shown that the suppression of defects in solution-processed perovskite films is critical for further enhancing the performance of PSCs towards their thermodynamic limits  9, 19, 20  . The surface is the place where defects are most easily formed, and passivation of the surface defects is always the most important task in any type of solar cells  11, 15, 21  . In PSCs, several efficient surface passivation methods have been adopted. For example, excess PbI 2 in the perovskite layer, on the surface or at the grain boundary can suppress charge recombination by formation of I-type band alignment  [22] [23] [24]  . Wide bandgap perovskites such as FAPbI 3-x Br x (ref.  25  ), two-dimensional (2D) perovskite materials, for example, PEA 2 PbI 4 and BA 2 PbI 4 (refs.  [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31]  ), and super-thin insulated materials such as polystyrene  15  have been utilized. More recently, several halide compounds such as quaternary ammonium halides  11  , diammonium iodide  20  , potassium halide 32 and iodopentafluorobenzene  33  have been employed to passivate dangling bonds in the perovskite layer by exploiting the associated intermolecular interaction. Here, we develop an organic halide salt, phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI), for post-treatment of mixed perovskites FA 1-x MA x PbI 3 (FA: HC(NH 2 ) 2 ; MA: CH 3 NH 3 ) to suppress the surface defects of perovskite polycrystalline films for efficient solar cells. Surprisingly, the organic halide salt PEAI, rather than the 2D layered PEA 2 PbI 4 perovskite proposed in many recent studiess  [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31]  , serves as a much more effective passivation additive for a 3D perovskite. We carefully control the conversion process of PEAI to PEA 2 PbI 4 in the actual devices using direct X-ray diffraction (XRD) evidence and show that the existence of PEAI instead of PEA 2 PbI 4 in the perovskite thin-film devices is the key to increasing the V OC to as high as 1.18 V, which is 94.4% of the Shockley-Queisser limit V OC (1.25 V). As a result, a 23.32% certificated PSC has been achieved. 
 Design and fabrication of the perovskite films The perovskite layer FA 1-x MA x PbI 3 was deposited using a twostep spin-coating method  8, 24, 34, 35  , and the mixed organic salts FAI and MAI were diffused into the PbI 2 bottom layer via annealing. Comparing with previous reports and ours  5, 8, 24  , we replaced the methylammonium bromide (MABr) in the traditional high-performance perovskite material (FAPbI 3 ) 1-x (MAPbBr 3 ) x with methylammonium iodine (MAI) to form FA 1-x MA x PbI 3 perovskites, which is expected to further lower the absorption threshold of the perovskites to absorb more sunlight (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). We found that a small amount of MAI incorporation (8% in precursor) can stabilize the α-phase of FAPbI 3 (Fig.  1c ), which is consistent with the tolerance factor empirical rule  36, 37  . To introduce a passivation layer, a PEAI salt solution was spin-coated onto the perovskite surface. It is noted that no additional process was carried out for PEAI layer. The device structure of the perovskite solar cells we adopted in this study is shown in Fig.  1a . We infer that the PEAI coating on the perovskite layer fills the iodine vacancies on the surface (Fig.  1b ), and at the grain boundary (Supplementary Fig.  2 ), resulting in passivation of the surface defects and enhancement of the device performance  20  . 
 Characterization of the perovskite films We carried out grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) for the perovskite films with and without a PEAI layer (Fig.  1c ) to clearly show the states of PEAI on the surface. We found that the diffraction peaks for the perovskite with PEAI treatment are almost the same as for the control film without PEAI. However, a new diffraction

 In recent years, the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has increased to reach over 20%. Finding an effective means of defect passivation is thought to be a promising route for bringing further increases in the power conversion efficiency and the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of perovskite solar cells. Here, we report the use of an organic halide salt phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) on HC(NH 2 ) 2 -CH 3 NH 3 mixed perovskite films for surface defect passivation. We find that PEAI can form on the perovskite surface and results in higher-efficiency cells by reducing the defects and suppressing non-radiative recombination. As a result, planar perovskite solar cells with a certificated efficiency of 23.32% (quasi-steady state) are obtained. In addition, a V OC as high as 1.18 V is achieved at the absorption threshold of 1.53 eV, which is 94.4% of the Shockley-Queisser limit V OC (1.25 V). 
 Corrected: Author Correction NAture PhotoNiCS | VOL 13 | JULY 2019 | 460-466 | www.nature.com/naturephotonics peak appeared at 4.7°, which is consistent with the diffraction pattern for PEAI powder, and there is no obvious diffraction peak at 5.4° corresponding to the 2D perovskite PEA 2 PbI 4 (Fig.  1c  and Supplementary Fig.  3 ). It can be concluded that the dominant form of PEAI salt on the perovskite surface is the PEAI crystal itself, which is in contrast to previous reports on the formation of a 2D perovskite on a 3D perovskite surface  [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31]  . We will show that PEAI itself has a much better passivation effect than a 2D PEA 2 PbI 4 thin layer. From scanning electron microscopy results (Supplementary Fig.  2a, b ), we found that the perovskite surface was covered by a PEAI layer. In addition, the roughness of the perovskite layer was reduced from 32 to 24 nm according to atomic force microscopy results (Supplementary Fig.  2c, d ), indicating that the PEAI salt is more easily deposited at the grain boundary (usually, the grain boundary is the deepest place on the surface, Supplementary Fig.  7 ). Therefore, this reduces the height difference between the grain surface and the grain boundary. We conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to confirm the existence of PEAI on perovskite (Fig.  1d ). For the perovskite with PEAI treatment, in addition to C-C and C-N peaks located at 284.6 eV and 286.1 eV, respectively, we also found that a peak emerges at a binding energy of 292.0 eV, consistent with π-π bonding in the phenyl functional group of the PEA + cations  26  . We also noticed that the C=O peak (288.1 eV) seen for the control film associated with oxygen/moisture is significantly suppressed after PEAI modification, indicating that the PEAI coating can slow the degradation of the perovskite layer. Furthermore, according to the Pb 4f and I 3d core-level energy spectra (Supplementary Fig.  4 ), it can be estimated that the Pb:I ratio for the control perovskite film is 1:1.55, which indicates that the surface is seriously iodine deficit, which could lead to obvious point defects (Fig.  1b ). After PEAI modification, the Pb:I ratio dramatically increased to 1:2.34, indicating the presence of abundant iodide on the perovskite surface and that the iodine vacancy is likely to be filled (Fig.  1b ). We monitored the steady photoluminescence (PL) of the perovskite films with PEAI treatment under different conditions (Fig.  2a ). We found that the PL intensities are obviously increased after PEAI treatment without additional thermal annealing, indicating that recombination in the perovskite layer has been largely suppressed  38, 39  . We also mapped the PL intensities of perovskite films with 470 nm excitation (Supplementary Fig.  5 ), and found that the PL from the perovskite films with PEAI treatment becomes much more intense and uniform compared with the control film. Owing to the strong absorption of perovskite at short wavelengths, we anticipate that only the perovskite surface (<100 nm) is excited when using 470 nm excitation. Therefore, strong PL enhancement indicates that PEAI treatment suppresses the surface non-radiative recombination defects. According to the time-resolved PL results (Fig.  2b , Supplementary Fig.  6  and Supplementary Table  1 ), the carrier lifetime of the perovskite is significantly increased from 0.3 μs to more than 2 μs, and the recombination rate has been reduced by fivefold after PEAI treatment. It is interesting that we found that the PL intensity and lifetime of the perovskite films become slightly weaker and shorter when the the PEAI layer is annealed above 50 °C (Fig.  2a, b ). This phenomenon becomes more obvious for thermal annealing of the perovskite/ PEAI film at 100 °C (Fig.  2a, b ), and the PEAI-treated perovskite film shows almost the same emission properties as the control film, indicating that the passivation effect has almost disappeared. From the XRD results (Fig.  2c ), we found that the PEAI is gradually converted into the PEA 2 PbI 4 phase during the thermal annealing process, and when the perovskite/PEAI layer is annealed at at 100 °C for 5 min, the PEAI crystal diffraction totally disappears (Fig.  2c ). According to the PL and XRD results (Fig.  2 ), it can be concluded that the PEAI itself shows a much better passivation effect than the 2D perovskite of PEA 2 PbI 4 . Therefore, in this study, we utilized the PEAI layer, not the conventional 2D perovskite  [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31]  , to passivate the defects in the perovskite layer. 
 Device fabrication and characterization Keeping in mind that PEAI can efficiently passivate the surface defects in the perovskite layer, we fabricated devices with the structure ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au 8,24 (ITO: indium tin oxide; spiro-OMeTAD: 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-dipmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene). The thicknesses of the electron transport layer SnO 2 , the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer spiro-OMeTAD were about 40 nm, 800 nm and 250 nm, respectively (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). The dependence of the device performance on the PEAI concentration (Fig.  3a , Supplementary Fig.  8  and Supplementary Table  2 ) shows that the PCE jumped significantly when the perovskite films were treated with a low concentration of PEAI solution, and the PCE reached a maximum at 20 mM of PEAI. For this best condition, the mass thickness of the PEAI is about 16 nm when deposited on a smooth silicon substrate (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). It is noted that several tens of nanometres of PEAI films deposited on a very rough perovskite surface (roughness = 32 nm, Supplementary Fig.  2 ) via a solution process cannot be conformal, and the resulting PEAI film should be discontinuous or thin enough for charge transport (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). While the device performance began to drop at high PEAI loading even the recombination rate was low (Supplementary Fig.  6 ), which could be due to the highly insulating properties of PEAI. The typical J-V curve of the device with PEAI (20 mM) and without PEAI treatment is shown in Fig.  3b . It can be seen that the J SC remains almost the same, while V OC substantially increases compared with the control device. We also observed that the hysteresis can be eliminated when the perovskite surface is treated with PEAI. Both the improvement of device performance and elimination of hysteresis could be related to the reduction of the surface defects, which can result in suppression of charge recombination and also charge accumulation  20  . We tested the device performance when the the PEAI layer was processed at different temperatures and found that the device performance degraded while thermal annealing the PEAI layer (Supplementary Fig.  11  and Supplementary Table  3 ). This is consistent with the PL results (Fig.  2a, b ), confirming that the PEAI itself has a better passivation effect for perovskite layer. We also screened several organic iodine salts for perovskite surface treatment and found that the device performance either showed no significant enhancement or inferior performance compared with the control device (Supplementary Fig.  12  and Supplementary Table  4 ). After optimization of the PEAI-treated device, we obtained the best device with an efficiency of 23.56%, a V OC as high as 1.16 V, a J SC of 24.9 mA cm -2 and a fill factor (FF) of 81.4% (Fig.  3c ), and there is almost no hysteresis for the device (Supplementary Fig.  13  and Supplementary Table  5 ). The steady output for the best device shows a quasi-steady output of 23.2%, while for the device without PEAI, the output is 21.3% (Supplementary Fig.  14 ). The integrated current density from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) is 24.5 mA cm -2 (Fig.  3d ), which is almost in agreement with the measurement from the solar simulator in this study. In addition, according to the EQE decrease to half the peak value and the differential of the EQE  40  , it can be estimated that the absorption threshold is 1.53 eV. This value is consistent with the result from the differential of absorption (Supplementary Fig.  15 ). The statistics of the PCE distribution confirm the reproducibility of our results and that the PEAI treatment can undoubtedly improve the performance of PSCs (Supplementary Fig.  16 ). We sent the best device to an accredited laboratory (Newport, USA) for certification. The devices showed 23.32% certificated efficiency with a V OC of 1.18 V, J SC of 25.2 mA cm -2 and FF of 78.4% (Supplementary Figs.  17  and 18 ). Furthermore, it is noted that the certificated efficiency obtained here is the quasi-steady-state efficiency  41  . In this new measurement standard, the J-V parameters were measured under a 13-point IV sweep configuration wherein the bias voltage (current for V OC determination) is held constant until the measured current (voltage for V OC ) is determined to be unchanging at the 0.03% level. This is intended to represent the quasi-steady-state performance of the device. We tested the device response under different light intensities (Supplementary Fig.  19 ). We found that both the control and PEAItreated devices show a linear J SC versus light intensity relationship (Supplementary Fig.  19c ). This indicates that carriers can transport smoothly in the device and that there is no obvious charge barrier induced at the interface even though insulating PEAI was introduced. The relationship between V OC and light intensity is also plotted (Fig.  4a ). It can be seen that the control device shows a slope of 1.88k B T/q, while PEAI-treated devices show a much smaller slope  
 Articles Nature PhotoNics (1.27k B T/q), where k B is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature and q is the electric charge. It is known that deviation of the slope from k B T/q reflects defect-assisted recombination in the devices  42  . These results further confirmed that the recombination has largely been suppressed in the perovskite layer. We derived the charge recombination and transport time constants (τ r and τ t , respectively) from the transient photovoltage and photocurrent decays measured at open and short circuit, respectively  43  . The τ r of the PEAI-treated device is as high as 138.2 μs (Fig.  4b ), which is even longer than that of MAPbI 3 perovskite single-crystal devices under one-sun conditions  44  . Furthermore, this value is substantially longer than that of the control device (versus 8.8 μs, Fig.  4b ), which could be attributed to slower surface charge recombination. We also found that the τ t slightly decreases from 3 μs to 2.3 μs after PEAI treatment (Supplementary Fig.  20 ). The insertion of insulting PEAI cannot enhance the hole extraction from perovskite to spiro-OMeTAD and decrease τ t. Therefore, the slight reduction of τ t could also be due to the reduction of charge recombination on introduction of PEAI. A V OC as high as 1.18 V is obtained (Supplementary Figs. 17 and 18), which is 94.4% of the Shockley-Queisser limit V OC (1.25 V) for the absorption threshold of 1.53 eV (ref.  45  ). In addition, there is only 0.35 V of V OC loss (E abs /q -V OC ) at the absorption threshold (E abs ) 1.53 eV, which is even less than that of crystal silicon solar cells (0.38 V) and comparable to GaAs solar cells (0.30 V)  13  . It has been shown that the EQE of the EL of the solar cells under bias voltage (operating as a light-emitting diode (LED)) can be used to estimate the recombination in the devices  45  . Higher radiative recombination emission efficiency could deliver high V OC based on the equation:              = + V k T q J J In EQE 1 (1) OC B EL ph em,0 where EQE EL is quantum efficiency when the injection current in the dark is equal to the photocurrent (J ph ) of the device under light illumination and J em,0 is the current of re-emitted photons at room temperature  45  . We tested the solar cell device operating as a LED in the dark and under a voltage bias. We found that PEAI-treated devices showed obvious EL and an emission peak located at 805 nm (Fig.  4c ). Furthermore, the device can even emit under lower applied voltage (1.2 V), which is lower than the absorption threshold of perovskite (1.53 eV)-the apparent violation of energy conservation could come from heat extracted from the diode  46  . It is encouraging that the device showed close to 7% EL efficiency under an injection current of 25.2 mA cm -2 (equal to short-circuit current J SC = J ph ) (Fig.  4d  and Supplementary Fig.  21 ). For comparison, the control device only shows 0.8% EL efficiency under same injection current (Fig.  4d  and Supplementary Fig.  21 ). Based on equation (1), it can be estimated that the V OC improvement (ΔV OC ) after PEAI treatment is: ΔV OC = k B T/qIn(EQE PEAI /EQE without PEAI ) = 0.056 V. This result is almost consistent with the J-V results, while the control and PEAItreated devices showed V OC around 1.12 V and 1.18 V, respectively. Reverse scan (1.2 V to 0 V) and forward scan (0 V to 1.2 V) were both collected, and the average of the reverse and forward scans is included. b, The typical J-V curve of the device with PEAI (20 mM) and without PEAI treatment under one-sun (100 mW cm -2 ) conditions. The reverse and forward scans are both included. c, The best device we achieved in our laboratory by optimizing the PEAI condition (20 mM). A 23.56% PCE is achieved with a V OC of 1.16 V, J SC of 24.9 mA cm -2 and FF of 81.4%. d, EQE of the best device. The integrated J SC from the EQE is 24.5 mA cm -2 . We also calculated the internal quantum efficiency of the devices, which were 9.7% and 50.4% for the control and PEAI-treated devices, respectively, according to the relationship between external and internal emission  47, 48  . This result shows that the non-radiative losses in the perovskite layer have been significantly suppressed by PEAI passivation. We could increase the V OC close to its limit (1.25 V) if we could fully suppress the non-radiative recombination in the perovskite layer, on the surface or at the interface, and then the PCE of PSCs could be improved beyond 25%. 
 Stability of the devices We tested the device stability at 85 °C for more than 500 h (Fig.  5 ). A more thermally stable hole transport layer poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) was used to replace spiro-OMeTAD for thermal stablility testing  49, 50  . The initial PCE of the PEAI-treated devices with a PTAA hole transport layer was 19.1% (Supplementary Fig.  22  and Supplementary Table  6 ), which is lower than the best device performance using spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer. This is a common issue and could be addressed in future studies. We found that the PCE of the PEAI-treated device decreased at the start of several hours of annealing at 85 °C, and then the performance remained almost constant up to 500 h of heating. Time-resolved PL for the perovskite films/hole transport layer showed that the lifetime of the perovskite layer was significantly shortened in minutes after heating at 85 °C (Supplementary Fig.  23 ). This is fully consistent with the results shown in Fig.  2b . Then there is no obvious change when the heating time is extended to hours (Supplementary Fig.  23 ). The shortening of lifetime during heating could be ascribed to the disappearance of the passivation effect by converting PEAI into PEA 2 PbI 4 according to Fig.  2 , which results in device performance degradation during heating. PTAA was used to replace spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer for thermal testing. The device performance without PEAI has been divided by the initial device performance of PEAI-based devices, and the initial performance of the devices with PEAI has been normalized. The starting efficiency of the cells is 19.1% and 17.2% for the devices with and without a PEAI layer, respectively (Supplementary Fig.  22  and Supplementary Table  6 ). For each type of device, ten devices were utilized for the thermal stability test, 5% of error bars has been adopted. These results showed that the thermal stability of PEAI-based devices is not good enough, and that other passivation materials with good thermal stability should be screened. We also preliminarily tested the device stability under continuous light soaking at the maximum power point (25 °C, 100 mW cm -2 ) and found that there is no obvious decrease in device performance over 40 h (Supplementary Fig.  24 ). In summary, we have provided an efficient and simple method for passivation of the perovskite surface through which the defects are significantly reduced and the recombination is suppressed. As a result, a 23.32% certificated efficiency was obtained by adopting a low-temperature solution-processed planar structure. This method could be helpful for obtaining low-cost, efficient and highly flexible solar cells.

As shown in Fig.  1c , the pristine PbBr2 film showed a characteristic diffraction peak at 18.48°, corresponding to the lattice plane of (020). After dipping the film in the FAI solution, this peak completely disappeared, and a new peak at 13.84° corresponding to the (001) plane of the 3D perovskite emerged. When PEG, PS and PMMA were coated onto the PbBr2 film, the transition from PbBr2 to 3D perovskite still proceeded, as evidenced by the emergence of (001) peaks with comparable intensities to those of the pristine PbBr2 film. Notably, when the CLP was deposited on the PbBr2, the film maintained the (020) peak of PbBr2 after dipping in the FAI solution, and the (001) peak corresponding to 3D perovskite was significantly weaker. The peak intensity and integral area are presented in Supplementary Table  2 . When PbBr2 films were dipped in the 4F-PEAI solution, similar results were observed. Pristine PbBr2 reacted with 4F-PEAI, and formed 4F-PEA2Pb(IxBr1-x)4, showing a characteristic diffraction peak at 5.48°. When PEG, PS, and PMMA were used to cover the PbBr2 film, the transition from PbBr2 to 2D perovskite was not prevented. However, for PbBr2 films covered with the CLP, the intensity of the (100) peak of 2D perovskite 4F-PEA2Pb(IxBr1-x)4 was significantly reduced. The peak intensity and integral area are presented in Supplementary Table  3 . These results revealed that the CLP layer can effectively inhibit the intercalation of FA + and 4F-PEA + into the inorganic template of PbBr2. Supplementary Note 2: pEDMA and the CLP were employed to prevent the reaction between PbBr2 films and FAI at an elevated temperature of 100 °C (Supplementary Fig.  6 ). The FAI solution was spin-coated on PbBr2/pEDMA and PbBr2/CLP films, and annealed at 100 °C for 10 to 300 min. After only 30 min, XRD patterns of PbBr2/pEDMA/FAI films showed a distinct peak corresponding to 3D perovskite. On the contrary, the diffraction peak of 3D perovskite in PbBr2/CLP/FAI films remained at a much weaker intensity even after 300 min of thermal annealing. This indicates that the CLP is more effective at inhibiting ion diffusion than pEDMA under thermal stress. To investigate the stabilization effects of EDMA monomers and pEDMA in the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructures, we aged 3D/EDMA/2D and 3D/pEDMA/2D films at 100 °C for 120 min, and compared the evolution of PL spectra. As shown in Fig.  2d , EDMA and pEDMA only offer partial stabilization the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructures under thermal stress. After thermal ageing, the PL emission intensity of 2D perovskite 4F-PEA2PbI4 in both the 3D/EDMA/2D and 3D/pEDMA/2D films reduced, and PL emission of the quais-2D perovskite 4F-PEA2FAPb2I7 emerged. Thus, we conclude that the high degree of crosslinking and the network structure of the POSS-EDMA-based CLP play crucial roles in stabilizing the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructures. Supplementary Note 3: It is challenging to directly measure the thickness of the CLP layer that was prepared using a concentration of 3 mg mL -1 . Instead, we prepared CLP layers with concentrations of 10, 15 and 20 mg mL -1 , and directly measured the thickness of the CLP layers using a profilometer (Bruker, Dektak). As shown in Supplementary Figure  8a , as the concentration increases from 10 to 20 mg mL -1 , the thickness of the as-prepared CLP layer increases from ~14 nm to ~40 nm. Using polynomial fitting to simulate the layer thicknesses, we estimate the thickness of the CLP layer for the concentration of 3 mg mL -1 to be 2~3 nm. Additionally, we conducted XPS depth profiling, as shown in Supplementary Figure  8b . We used the signals of oxygen (O 1s) to track the existence of the CLP. After etching for only 30 seconds, the signals of oxygen disappeared. The etching rate of the argon gun towards the reference material (NPB, the molecular structure is shown in Supplementary Figure  8c ) was calibrated to be 0.5~0.6 Å s -1 , and thus the thickness of the CLP layer should be below 1.8 nm. Supplementary Note 4: Previously, we have incorporated 3F-PEAI for surface treatment of 3D perovskite in p-i-n inverted PSCs [5]  . Herein, for n-i-p PSCs, the principle for selecting the organic ligand and tuning band alignment is entirely different. In p-i-n PSCs, the 2D layer on the surface of the 3D perovskite should be suitable for electron transfer and can block holes. However, this requirement is not easily met by regular 2D perovskite modification strategies. The 2D perovskite layer usually has a conduction band minimum (CBM) that is much higher than that of the 3D perovskite, which results in an electron-blocking effect. Thus, using a 2D perovskite layer on 3D perovskite in a p-i-n device is likely to reduce the efficiency of PSCs. Using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and absorption spectroscopy, the band alignment of low dimensional perovskite films of differing quantum well widths (n = 1 -4) was estimated. It was found that quantum confinement upshifted the CBM, which induced electron blocking in p-i-n PSCs. In order to achieve efficient electron transfer, it is necessary to increase the n values of the low dimensional perovskites in order to minimize CBM offset. Using transient absorption (TA) spectra to evaluate the n values of the low-dimensional perovskites, it was revealed that the ligand of 3F-PEA produced low-dimensional perovskite containing majority n = Supplementary Figure  9  | XPS spectra of 3D perovskite (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 (a) and 2D perovskite 4F-PEA2PbI4 (b). The peaks are fitted with Gaussian function.
3, while 2F-PEA and 4F-PEA produced low dimensional perovskite containing majority n = 2. Therefore, we selected 3F-PEA as the target ligand to conduct further optimization in p-i-n inverted PSCs. Herein, for n-i-p PSCs in this work, the band alignment requirements for the 2D perovskite layer are the opposite. In n-i-p devices, the 2D perovskite should have a CBM that is as high as possible to block electrons. Thus, we selected the ligand of 4F-PEA which produces the smallest n values when preparing low dimensional perovskites.

Supplementary Figure  6  | TGA of polymerized EDMA (pEDMA) with x mol% POSS. Comparison of the device performance obtained by 3D, 3D/2D, 3D/CLP and 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructures. The standard error is represented in boxplots, for which the box extends from the 25 th to the 75 th percentiles, the empty squared dot depicts the average value, the short dash lines depict the minima and maxima. For each structure, sixteen cells were fabricated at the same condition.      Two-dimensional (2D) and quasi-2D modifications of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite active layers have contributed to advances in the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the ionic diffusion between the surface 2D and bulk 3D perovskites leads to the degradation of the 3D/2D p er ov sk ite h et er os tr uc tures and limits the long-term stability of PSCs. Here we incorporate a cross-linked polymer (CLP) on the top of a 3D perovskite layer and then deposit a 2D perovskite layer via a vapour-assisted two-step process to form a 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure. P ho to lu mi nescence spectra and thickness-profiled elemental analysis indicate that the CLP stabilizes the heterostructure by inhibiting the diffusion of cations (formamidinium, FA + and 4 -f u or op henyl et hy la mm onium, 4F-PEA + ) between the 2D and 3D perovskites. For devices based on carbon electrodes, we report small-area devices with an efficiency of 21.2% and mini-modules with an efficiency of 19.6%. Devices retain 90% of initial performance after 4,390 hours operation under maximum power point tracking and one-sun illumination at elevated temperatures. Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently undergone a rapid rise in certified power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) to exceed 25% for sub-1 cm 2 PSCs 1-4 and 20% for perovskite solar modules (PSMs)  [5] [6] [7]  . Many of the best PSCs employ two-dimensional (2D) or quasi-2D modified (three-dimensional) 3D perovskite (3D/2D perovskite) heterostructures, which provide defect passivation  [8] [9] [10]  and favourable band alignment  [11] [12] [13]  and thus can improve open-circuit voltage (V OC ) and fill factor (FF)  [14] [15] [16]  . These 3D/2D perovskite heterostructures are Article  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01205-y  inspiration from rechargeable batteries or fuel cells, where ion diffusion is inhibited by inserting separation materials (such as POSS-and EDMA-based polymers) as proton exchange membranes  [40] [41] [42] [43]  . POSS consists of a rigid, cubic Si-O-Si cage-type core with eight ethylene groups that can bridge the linear EDMA chains in various directions via olefin polymerization. Approximately 3 mol% POSS dispersed in EDMA provides abundant cross-linking points and leads to the formation of a polymer film with highly cross-linked networks  [44] [45] [46]  . When the self-polymerization was carried out on a glass substrate, a uniform and free-standing transparent CLP film was obtained (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). The self-polymerization reaction was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). Moreover, the CLP film was found to be insoluble in polar solvents such as H 2 O, isopropanol (IPA) and dimethylformamide (DMF) (Supplementary Fig.  4  and Supplementary Video 1). Pristine PbBr 2 films are transparent and colourless. However, PbBr 2 films dipped in FAI or 4F-PEAI solutions rapidly turn brown or yellow. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements verified the formation of 3D FAPb(I x Br 1-x ) 3 (brown) and 2D 4F-PEA 2 Pb(I x Br 1-x ) 4 (yellow)  [47] [48] [49]  , as shown in Fig.  1c, d . For PbBr 2 films covered by PEG, PS, PMMA and EDMA monomers, similar phenomena were observed. This indicates that these small molecules and linear polymers are not ideal candidates for inhibiting the diffusion of FA + and 4F-PEA + cations. On the contrary, the PbBr 2 / pEDMA and PbBr 2 /CLP films maintained their original colour after dipping in FAI or 4F-PEAI solution. The XRD patterns show the PbBr 2 films were not fully transformed into 3D FAPb(I x Br 1-x ) 3 or 2D 4F-PEA 2 Pb(I x B r 1-x ) 4 , which indicates that the cross-linked pEDMA and CLP layer can effectively inhibit the diffusion of FA + and 4F-PEA + cations. Meanwhile, the formation of a small 2D diffraction peak in the PbBr 2 /pEDMA and PbBr 2 /CLP films indicates a small amount of FA + and 4F-PEA + can still pass through the CLP layer to form 3D or 2D perovskites (Fig.  1c, d  and Supplementary Note 1). Our further studies show that the CLP layer is more effective at inhibiting ion diffusion and has better stability under thermal stress due to the incorporation of POSS (Supplementary Figs.  5  and 6  and Supplementary Note 2). 
 Stabilization effect of CLP on perovskite heterostructures To fabricate the conventional 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure, we deposit a (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 (formamidinium, FA; methylammonium, MA) 3D perovskite layer on a SnO 2 -coated ITO glass substrate and then post-treat the surface with a solution of 4-fluorophenylethylammonium iodide (4F-PEAI) in IPA solvent (Fig.  2a )  8, 17, 50  . XRD patterns in Fig.  2b  show a characteristic diffraction peak at 5.2°, which indicates the formation of 2D 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4 ((4F-PEA)  17, 49  . After thermal ageing at 100 °C for 120 min, the 2D 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4 diffraction peak in the 3D/2D heterostructure disappears. Additionally, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra show that the emission peaks of 3D (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 and 2D 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4 are located at 800 nm and 511 nm respectively for the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure (Fig.  2c ). After thermal ageing, the emission peak of 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4 for the 3D/2D heterostructure also completely disappears. These results are indicative of the instability of the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure, which is attributed to ion diffusion between the surface 2D and bulk 3D perovskites  21, 22  . 2 FA n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 , n = 1) To fabricate the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure, we first deposited a 3D perovskite layer. The CLP layer is formed by spin coating a POSS and EDMA mixed solution in chlorobenzene and ethyl acetate mixed solvent on the above 3D perovskite and annealing at 100 °C for 10 min (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). These low-polarity solvents are compatible with 3D perovskites and thus do not induce degradation of the 3D perovskite. The thickness of the CLP layer is estimated to be <3 nm (Supplementary Fig.  8  and Supplementary Note 3). The 2D perovskite layer was deposited by a vapour-assisted two-step process  [51] [52] [53]  . Lead iodide (PbI 2 ) was first evaporated on the CLP layer and commonly prepared by spin coating an organic cation salt solution on top of 3D perovskites and in situ formation of thin low-dimensional perovskites (such as 2D and quasi-2D) on the surface  [17] [18] [19] [20]  . The ion diffusion between the surface 2D and bulk 3D perovskites (for example, cations in the 3D perovskite layer move towards the 2D layer) is known to contribute to the degradation of 3D/2D perovskite heterostructures under bias, illumination and heat  13, 21, 22  . Currently, the long-term operational stability of these highly efficient PSCs is limited to <2,000 hours at room temperature, and ~500 hours at elevated temperatures (≥60 °C) under maximum power point (MPP) tracking and continuous illumination (Supplementary Table  1 ). For ion diffusion within the perovskite absorbing layer, mitigation strategies have been sought after via halide compositional tuning  [23] [24] [25]  , the incorporation of large organic cations  [26] [27] [28] [29]  and the introduction of ionic additives  [30] [31] [32] [33] [34]  . For ion diffusion across interfaces and the stacked layers within PSCs, the construction of interlayers has been proven effective  [35] [36] [37] [38] [39]  . In particular, Bi et al. chose tri-s-triazine-based graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets to form an iodide diffusion barrier layer in p-i-n PSCs  35  . Wang et al. deposited a chlorinated graphene oxide layer between the perovskite and hole transporting layer (HTL) in n-i-p PSCs to prevent the iodide ions in the perovskite layer from diffusing into the HTL  36  . However, inhibiting ion diffusion between the 3D and 2D perovskites and stabilizing the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructures remains an ongoing challenge  13, 21, 22  . To construct a stable 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure, we propose to introduce an interlayer between the 3D and 2D perovskite layers. The interlayer needs to effectively inhibit ion diffusion and, meanwhile, not hinder charge transport between the 3D and 2D perovskite layers. For the deposition of the interlayer and 2D perovskite layer, the technique and process need to be operated without degrading or damaging the underlying layers. Comparing small molecules versus regular polymers as the interlayer, we found that a highly cross-linked polymer (CLP) was more effective at inhibiting ion diffusion and stabilizing the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure. We selected a polymer prepared by self-polymerization of ethylene dimethacrylate (EDMA) and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) under moderate conditions (≤100 °C) and processed the polymer layer from a solution that does not degrade the 3D perovskite. For simplicity, CLP represents the POSS-EDMA-based polymer below. At the same time, we developed a vapour-assisted two-step deposition process to form the 2D perovskite layer on the 3D perovskite/CLP bilayer, which prevented the destruction of the underlying 3D perovskite during the deposition of the 2D perovskite. We fabricated carbon-electrode-based PSCs using the 3D/ CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure with an efficiency of 21.2% (aperture area of 0.16 cm 2 ), and demonstrate a carbon-electrode-based PSM with a certified efficiency of 18.2% (aperture area of 17.1 cm 2 ). The cell achieved a T 90 (the time taken for device efficiency to reduce to 90% of its initial value) of 4,390 hours under one-sun illumination and MPP tracking at 60 °C, showing superior stability compared with the PSCs based on conventional 3D/2D perovskite heterostructures at elevated temperatures. 
 Selection of CLP The molecular structures of EDMA, POSS, CLP and preparation process of the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure are presented in Fig.  1a . For the design and selection of CLP, it should inhibit the diffusion of FA + and 4F-PEA + cations between the 3D and 2D perovskite layers and stabilize the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure. Some organic materials including small molecules and polymers were screened based on an experiment studying the reactions of lead bromide (PbBr 2 )/organic films with formamidinium iodide (FAI) or 4-fluorophenylethylammonium iodide (4F-PEAI) (Fig.  1b ). These organic materials include a small molecular EDMA monomer; three linear polymers of polyethylene glycol (PEG), polystyrene (PS) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) (Supplementary Fig.  1 ) and two cross-linked polymers of EDMA (pEDMA) and the CLP. We decided to investigate pEDMA and the CLP by taking Article  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01205-y  then a 4-fluorophenylethylammonium iodide (4F-PEAI)  17, 50  solution (15 mmol in IPA) was spun on the above 3D/CLP/PbI 2 stacked film and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min (Supplementary Note 4 details the selection of 4F-PEAI). XRD spectra in Fig.  2b  show a stronger characteristic diffraction peak at 5.2° for the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure than the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure, which indicates the formation of a thicker 2D perovskite layer  49, 50  . The cross-sectional SEM images show a ~500 nm 3D perovskite layer and a ~10 nm low-dimensional perovskite layer for the 3D/2D heterostructure and a ~500 nm 3D perovskite layer, a several nanometre CLP layer and a thicker ~30 nm 2D perovskite layer for the 3D/CLP/2D heterostructure (Fig.  2a ). The XRD spectrum of the aged 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure shows that the characteristic diffraction peak at 5.2° remains relatively unchanged. A similar effect is observed for the PL spectra, where the PL emission peaks for the aged 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure retain their initial positions and intensities (Fig.  2c ). A thick 2D perovskite layer was directly prepared on a 3D perovskite without the CLP layer by the same vapour-assisted two-step process as in the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure. Notably, the red-shift PL peak position of the 2D perovskite in the 3D/thick 2D (vapour-deposited) heterostructure compared with the normal solution-processed 3D/2D heterostructure is attributed to the difference in thickness and quantum confinement effect  50, 54  . The intensity of the PL emission peak of 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4 largely decreases, and a new peak corresponding to 4F-PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7 (n = 2) appears after thermal ageing of the 3D/thick 2D heterostructure  21, 22  . This indicates that the 3D/thick 2D heterostructure shows better stabi lity than normal solution-processed 3D/2D heterostructure; however, its stability remains inferior to that of the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite hetero structure. The PL spectra of the heterostructure using EDMA as the interlayer showed similar behaviour with that of the 3D/thick 2D heterostructure (Fig.  2d ). pEDMA as the interlayer resulted in suppression of the formation of the peak for 4F-PEA 2 FAPb 2 I 7 ; however, the intensity of the PL emission peak of 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4 still decreased. These results indicate that the CLP layer plays the dominant role of stabilizing the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure under thermal stress. To correlate the degradation of the 2D perovskite to ion diffusion, we employed atomic force microscopy-based infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR) measurements to investigate the surface properties of the perovskite heterostructures. Imaging results were recorded at 1,712 cm -1 , which corresponds to the symmetric C = NH 2 + bending of FA + . As shown in Fig.  2e , initially, the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure showed distinct signals of FA + cations, while there were low signals of FA + cations in the initial 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure. This indicated that the 2D perovskite layer in the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure achieved more complete and uniform coverage on the Article  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01205-y  3D perovskite layer than that in the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure. After the perovskite heterostructures are aged at 100 °C for 120 min, the FA + signals largely increase on the surface of the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure, which indicates the upward diffusion of FA + ions and the phase transformation from the 2D perovskite of 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4 into 3D perovskite during thermal stress. On the contrary, the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure shows an almost unchanged FA + signal, which verifies the limited ion diffusion between the 3D and 2D perovskites and the enhanced stability of the 3D/CLP/2D heterostructure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra show that the characteristic peaks of N in FA + for the 3D perovskite layer and 4F-PEA + for the 2D perovskite layer are at 400.8 eV and at 402.0 eV, respectively (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). XPS depth profiling in Fig.  2f  shows that the characteristic peak of F in 4F-PEA + can be detected only on the top surface for ~45 s. For the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure, 4F-PEA + can be detected on the film surface for ~120 s, which is also indicative of the thicker 2D layer in the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure. Meanwhile, the downward diffusion of 4F-PEA + ions in the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure is observed after thermal ageing, which is inhibited by the CLP layer in the 3D/CLP/2D heterostructure. Furthermore, we conducted ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy measurements of 3D/2D and 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructures as shown in Fig.  2g    55, 56  . Both initial perovskite heterostructures show the characteristic peaks at 773 nm from 3D perovskite, and at 515 nm from 2D perovskite 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4 (n = 1)  56  . Additionally, small n = 2 2D perovskite peaks are also observed for the two heterostructures. This indicates that a small amount of FA + diffuses into the 2D perovskite through the CLP layer to form n = 2 perovskites. After ageing at 100 °C for 120 min, the characteristic peak from 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4 (n = 1) for the 3D/2D heterostructure almost completely vanished, while the peak for the 3D/CLP/2D heterostructure remained unchanged. Thus, we conclude that the CLP layer not only largely inhibits the ion (including both FA + and 4F-PEA + ) diffusion between the stacked perovskite layers but also effectively stabilize the phase states of the 3D and 2D perovskites under thermal stress. 
 Charge carrier dynamics and device performance To investigate the carrier dynamics within the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure and with perovskite/HTL stacks, we conducted time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. On glass  substrates, the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure and the 3D/CLP film show longer average carrier lifetimes (τ avg ) (315 ns and 341 ns) than the pristine 3D perovskite (248 ns) (Fig.  3a  and Supplementary Table  4 ). The τ avg of the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure further increases to 423 ns. This is indicative of synergistic passivation from the CLP and 2D perovskite. When a 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) layer was deposited on top of the samples, the 3D perovskite, 3D/2D, 3D/CLP and 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructures show similar τ avg and τ 1 (Fig.  3b ). This indicates efficient charge extraction from the perovskites to the HTL can still be achieved after incorporating the CLP layer in the perovskite heterostructure. Consistent results were also obtained for the steady-state PL spectra (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). Space charge-limited current spectra  [57] [58] [59]  of the perovskite heterostructures show that the 3D/2D and 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructures generate current densityvoltage (J-V) curves with similar shapes and comparable current values (Supplementary Figs.  11  and 12 ) for both electron-only and hole-only devices. By fitting the linear regions, the electron and hole mobilities of the 3D/CLP/2D heterostructure are similar compared with that of the 3D perovskite or 3D/2D heterostructure. Thus, the CLP layer has not hindered the transport of either the electrons or the holes within the heterostructures. We conducted ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis) measurements to estimate the energy levels of the perovskite heterostructures (Supplementary Fig.  13 ). Compared with the 3D perovskite (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MA    V OC (V) J SC (mA cm -2 ) FF PCE (%) 
 Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01205-y   PbBr 3 ) 0.05 , the incorporation of the CLP on the 3D perovskite leads to negligible change of the bandgap (1.55 eV), conduction band minimum and valence band maximum (Fig.  3c ). The 2D perovskite 4F-PEA 2 PbI 4 possesses a much larger bandgap of 2.36 eV and forms type-I band alignment with the 3D perovskite  60  . The close valence band maximum position of the 3D and 2D perovskites do not hinder the transport of holes from the 3D perovskite layer to the HTL  10, 11  , while the higher conduction band minimum of the 2D perovskite than the 3D perovskite acts as an electron-blocking layer, effectively preventing the recombination of electrons in the perovskite and holes in the HTL for the 3D/2D and 3D/CLP/2D heterostructures  10, 13  . This favourable band alignment contributes to the enhanced V OC of as-fabricated cells, and the selection of 4F-PEAI is discussed in Supplementary Note 4. To avoid the instability issues associated with metal electrodes  36, 61, 62  , we prepared carbon electrodes based on the screen-printing technique (Supplementary Fig.  14 ) to fabricate PSCs with a device architecture of ITO/SnO 2 /3D/CLP/2D/spiro-OMeTAD/ carbon. We optimized the concentration of the CLP solution and found that the CLP layer prepared with a concentration of 3 mg ml -1 delivered the optimal cell efficiency (Fig.  3d ). We fabricated cells using 3D perovskite, 3D/2D, 3D/CLP and 3D/CLP/2D heterostructures as the light-absorbing layers, and the distribution of efficiencies is presented in Fig.  3e , Supplementary Table  5  and Supplementary Fig.  15 . The cells based on 3D perovskite achieve an average efficiency of 18.83%. The average efficiencies of devices based on 3D/2D and 3D/CLP heterostructures are improved to 19.81% and 19.91%, respectively. The cells based on the 3D/CLP/2D heterostructure deliver an average efficiency of 20.29%. The efficiency improvement mainly results from the enhanced V OC , which is attributed to the synergistic passivation effect of the CLP and 2D perovskite. Figure  3f  shows the representative J-V curves of the cells. For the champion 3D/CLP/2D cell, we achieve a high efficiency of 21.2% with a V OC of 1.13 V, a current density (J SC ) of 24.00 mA cm -2 and a FF of 0.78 for carbon-electrode-based PSCs (Supplementary Table  6 ). The steady-state power output (SPO) efficiency of the cell reaches ~20.87% (Supplementary Fig.  16 ). The external quantum efficiency spectrum of the 3D/CLP/2D PSC shows an integrated short-circuit current density of 23.34 mA cm -2 (Fig.  3g ), which is in agreement with the J-V scanning result. We further fabricated a PSM with six sub-cells in series, as shown in Fig.  3h  and Supplementary Fig.  17 . The champion PSM based on the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure with a carbon electrode and an aperture area of 17.1 cm 2 achieves a PCE of 19.6% with V OC of 6.73 V, short-circuit current of 66.2 mA and FF of 0.751. Furthermore, it exhibits SPO efficiency of 19.1% under a bias voltage of 5.5 V for 100 s (Fig.  3i ). Meanwhile, the PSM achieves a certified efficiency of 19.3% and SPO of 18.2% (Supplementary Fig.  18 ). 
 Device stability To study operational stability, we monitored the cell performance under MPP tracking conditions and continuous one-sun illumination at 60 °C (Supplementary Fig.  19 ). The estimated T 90 lifetime of the 3D/2D PSC is 560 h. The PSC based on the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure maintains ~92% of the initial efficiency after 1,000 hours under continuous illumination. According to time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) of these 1,000 h-aged cells, the diffusion of iodide ions from the perovskite layer to the spiro-OMeTAD layer is effectively suppressed in the 3D/CLP/2D PSC (Supplementary Fig.  20 ). Combined with the XPS depth profiling (Supplementary Fig.  21 ), we find that the CLP layer and 2D perovskite synergistically contribute to the suppressed diffusion of iodide. To eliminate the negative effect of spiro-OMeTAD on the cell stability and verify the stability of the perovskite heterostructures, we carry out four repairing cycles of the cell by re-depositing the spiro-OMeTAD layer. The cell maintains ~90% of the initial efficiency after 5,000 h continuous operation (Fig.  4a ). The cell performance recovery indicates that the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure is highly stable against light and heat stress. Furthermore, a more stable poly(3-hexylthiophene)-spiro-OMeTAD (P3HT-spiro-OMeTAD) (3:1 w/w) mixed HTL is adopted to replace the unstable spiro-OMeTAD  12  . The initial efficiencies of as-fabricated PSCs slightly reduce to 18.6% based on 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure and 18.0% based on 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure (Supplementary Fig.  22 ). For the long-term operational stability, the efficiency of the 3D/2D PSC decays a 0 500 1,000  
 Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01205-y  to ~90% of the initial value after 672 h of continuous operation, while the 3D/CLP/2D PSC maintains 90% of its initial efficiency after continuous operation for 4,390 h at 60 °C (Fig.  4b ). 
 Conclusion In summary, we successfully suppress the ion diffusion between surface 2D and bulk 3D perovskites by introducing a highly cross-linked network polymer. A highly stable 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure is constructed and combined with a carbon electrode to fabricate PSCs with an efficiency of 21.2% and mini-PSMs with an efficiency of 19.6% (certified stabilized efficiency of 18.2%). After 4,390 hours of continuous operation under MPP tracking and one-sun illumination, the device retains 90% of its initial performance. Other materials were purchased from Aladdin and all the materials were used as received unless otherwise specified. 
 Methods 
 Materials 
 Synthesis of the additive in carbon paste 1.0 g of DMSA (5.5 mmol), 0.99 g of ethylene dimethacrylate (EDMA) (5 mmol), 79.1 mg of octavinyloctasilasesquioxane (POSS) (0.125 mmol) and 38 mg of 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (2 wt% of reactants) were well dispersed in the tetrahydrofuran (THF) (20 ml) in a quartz flask. The mixture was irradiated using a 365 nm UV lamp (25 W) for 2 h at room temperature. After the reaction was complete, n-hexane was added to obtain a solid crude product. The obtained product was dissolved in THF and precipitated in excess hexane again. Then, the solid was washed with deionized water and further dried under vacuum. Finally, 1.57 g of white additive powder was obtained. 
 Preparation of the carbon electrode Six g graphite, 2 g carbon black powder, 1.76 g of above additive powder and 0.8 g polyacrylate were mixed in the 2-butoxyethanol/pentyl acetate/ethyl acetate (volume ratio of 5:3:2) mixed solvents and kept ball milling for 12 h to obtain the carbon paste. The pre-prepared carbon paste was coated onto a carbon cloth via a screen-printing process to obtain the carbon film. The carbon paste/carbon cloth-based electrode was peeled off and then soaked in ethanol while sonicating for 10 min to remove the residual solvent. Finally, the carbon electrode was taken out and dried at room temperature. 
 Fabrication of perovskite solar cells and mini-modules ITO glass was patterned by laser etching (Universal Laser Systems, VLS2.30) with a femtosecond laser. Then the glass substrates were cleaned by sequential ultrasonication in a detergent solution, deionized water and anhydrous ethanol. The SnO 2 dispersion was spin coated on the substrates at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. After that, a 1.4 M (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 perovskite precursor solution containing of 0.5 M MACl was prepared in DMF/DMSO/ GBL (v/v = 2:1:2). The perovskite precursor solution was spin coated on SnO 2 at 1,000 r.p.m. for 10 s and 5,000 r.p.m. for 20 s. The wet film was then immediately put into a sealed sample chamber connected to a home-built vacuum-pumping system and immediately exposed to low pressure (20 Pa) for 10 s. Subsequently, the perovskite film was put on a hotplate and annealed at 120 °C for 40 min to obtain the pristine 3D perovskite film. Next, 15 mM 4F-PEAI/IPA solution was spun on the above 3D perovskite at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s to prepare 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure. For the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite film, 3 mg EDMA, POSS (3 mol% of EDMA) and 2,2′-Azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) initiator (2 wt% of EDMA) were first dissolved in 1 ml of chlorobenzene and ethyl acetate mixed solution (v:v = 1:1) to prepare the CLP solution, and then spun on the above 3D perovskite at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Then a 30 nm-thick layer of PbI 2 was evaporated at a rate of 0.3 Å s -1 onto the 3D/CLP bilayer film in a vacuum chamber. Subsequently, the same concentration of 4F-PEAI/ IPA solution was spun on the above 3D/CLP/PbI 2 film at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min to prepare the 3D/CLP/2D perovskite heterostructure. After cooling down to room temperature, a HTL (73 mg ml -1 spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene with 9.36 mg Li-TFSI salt in acetonitrile and 30 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine) was deposited on the perovskite film by spin coating at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. For the stability test, the P3HT-spiro-OMeTAD mixed HTL (54.75 mg P3HT and 18.25 mg spiro-OMeTAD with 4.68 mg Li-TFSI in acetonitrile and 15 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine) was deposited with the same spin-coating process. Finally, the pre-prepared carbon electrode was pressed onto the HTL under a pressure of 0.3 MPa at 60 °C for 15 s via a pneumatic hot press to complete the whole devices fabrication. For fabricating carbon-based modules, laser scribing was performed twice, before and after perovskite film deposition, to form P1 and P2 with 1,064 nm wavelength to complete the series interconnection between sub-cells in the module. Meanwhile, mechanical scribing was performed on the carbon electrode to obtain sub-electrode units insulated from each other before assembly. Finally, the electrode was pressed onto the HTL with the same process of small-area devices. 
 Repairing of PSCs by re-depositing the HTL The degraded PSCs were first disassembled to obtain the free-standing carbon electrode and perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD semi-cell. The spiro-OMeTAD on the semi-cell was washed out with chlorobenzene, followed by the deposition of the new spiro-OMeTAD HTL. Finally, the above disassembled carbon electrode was reassembled on the semi-cell to complete the repair of degraded PSCs. 
 Characterization The cross-sectional morphology of perovskite film was investigated by a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi SU8010). The TRPL spectra were measured by a HORIBA Jobin-Yvon Fluorolog-III fluorimeter. The steady-state PL spectra were measured with a 405 nm wavelength excitation source and the PL emission was collected using an optical fibre coupled with an Ocean Optics spectrometer ('Flame') calibrated by the manufacturer. UV-vis absorption of perovskite films was measured by UV-vis spectrometer (lambda 750 S, PerkinElmer). Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out using a TA Instruments TGA 2050 thermogravimetric analyser. The XRD patterns were collected from X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance). AFM-IR experiments were carried out using a commercial AFM-IR set-up (NanoIR3s, Bruker) that consists of an AFM microscope operating in contact mode and a Quantum Cascade Laser or QCL laser (MIRcat, Daylight Solutions Inc.) that was tunable from 2,350 cm -1 to ≈870 cm -1 (from 4.25 μm to 11.49 μm). The J-V curves were measured using a solar simulator (Oriel 94023 A, 300 W) with a source meter (Keithley 2400) under 100 mW cm -2 illumination (AM 1.5 G) with a scan rate of Supplementary Figure 8 |Supplementary Figure 10 |Supplementary Figure 13 |Supplementary Figure 15 | 8101315 Estimation of the thickness of the CLP layer. a, The dependence of CLP layer thickness on solution concentration.

scale may be associated with intrinsic changes of the defect structure in the perovskite, which is beyond the scope of the present work. The barrier properties of the AZO and AZO/SnO x EELs have been studied by using Cacorrosion test. Detail of this test have been describe previously.  6  Specifically, we have used a setup as shown in Supplementary Fig.  5a . The substrate was a PET/ITO foil, which has an intrinsic water vapor transmission rate of 3×10 -2 gm -2 day -1 . On top of this substrate we have deposited the PCBM layer and the EEL in an identical way as in case of the solar cells. Subsequently, an array of Ca dots has been thermally evaporated (thickness 100 nm). The top-side of this stack has been encapsulated by a 200 nm thick Al 2 O 3 gas diffusion barrier using ALD. The WVTR of the Al 2 O 3 top-encapsulation is expected to be on the order of 10 -6 gm -2 day -1 (ref. 7). Thus only the water ingress from the bottom side through the substrate and the PCBM/EEL will be relevant for the corrosion of the Ca. While the Ca appears metallic in the pristine samples, the corrosion due to moisture will render the Ca transparent Supplementary Fig.  5b . Obviously, in the case of AZO the degradation of the Ca pads is substantially faster, as after 36h in air almost all the pads have vanished. Therefore the WVTR of the AZO layer does not provide any significant barrier against the ingress of moisture. On the contrary, in case of the AZO/SnO x EEL the Ca pads appear far less corroded. This corroborates the barrier functionality of the ALD grown SnO x layer on top of the AZO. It has to be noted that some statistical failure may be due to particle defects that may void the effectivity of the top encapsulation layer.  8  Reviewers' comments: 
 Supplementary Reviewer #1 (Remarks to the Author): This manuscript describes a inverted perovskite photovoltaic in which the the electron extraction layer consists of PCBM-only, PCBM + AZO nanoparticles, or PCBM + AZO nanoparticles + SnO2 ALD overcoat. The work convincingly shows an improvement in PV stability with the 3-step overcoat as well as supports a hypothesis for the mechanism by which the devices are stabilized. The originality and interest of the report is good but modest. Although the authors do not highlight previous ALD-over-pervoskite work there are other examples including J. Mater. Chem. A, 2015, 3,  20092-20096.   The thickness of the SnO2 layer is suggested to be 20 nm, but this ignores the high likelihood that the ALD SnOx has coated a significant fraction of porous interior of the nanoparticle AZO on which it is grown. Overall the paper is modestly well written and its conclusions are sound. However, the impact appears to be below the very high bar of nature communications as the lifetime is good (350 hrs) but never pushed to the real boundaries previous pervoskite systems (1000 hrs of illumination, high relative temperature and humidity, etc) the methods is not totally novel, and efficiency is modest (although unoptimized). While I don't believe all high impact papers need to be 18+ % efficient, the mechanism by which the most efficient devices fail is important. Suggested improvements are stability tests that push the device to failure including light soaking under temperature and humidity followed by publication in a journal similar to E&ES. Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author): This manuscript described the use of a bi-layer oxide AZO/SnOx as electron extraction layer to improve the stability of perovskite solar cell. Stability is a crucial issue for perovskite solar cell before it can be considered as a promising alternative for current existing technologies. The finding and phenomena reported in this communication could be interesting for the community. However, several issues need to be addressed before the acceptance by high-ranking journal. 1. The results of the most successful device on stability [ Ref 17, Science 350, 944-948 (2015)] shall be briefly described and discussed in the introduction. The device architecture of this communication is conceptually similar to that Science paper, except the use of bilayer oxide. I think the advantages and novelty (vs that Science paper work) shall be clearly expressed in the introduction to show the importance of this work. Otherwise, changing materials can only be considered as a minor progression or follow-up. 2. For the XRD results, the spectra seem to contain only the diffraction pattern of perovskite. As the author said in the manuscript the sample is a full device, I think the author shall see the diffraction of those constituent layers to prove that the sample is the full device and cover with EEL and metal contact. Please clarify this issue. It is quite unusual that under ambient condition, no PbI2 signal were observed. In general the formation of PbI2 prevails extremely fast in air. The explanation of ""noncrystalline nature of the degradation product"" is not very convincing as no amorphous feature in the XRD spectra. 3. For the XPS results, the baseline of fresh devices made with SnOx and AZO/SnOx shall be included. Since XPS is a surface technique that investigates on the first few 3~5 nm, I wonder if the perovskite can be detected if protected after 10 nm Ag and AZO. The authors shall provide the whole spectrum to show what they have detected on the surface. The signal of Eb close to 622 eV for the blue line on Fig  3 (b) shall be identified and discussed. Is it something other than AgI? 4. Are the SEM images taken on top of Ag or on top of oxides? I think that matters for proposing the mechanism. 5. To demonstrate real stability for solar cells, light soaking is necessary. Especially for perovskite solar cell, light soaking results can really substantiate the claim for long term stability. To be published in such high impact journal like Nature Communications, I think the authors shall show stability under light soaking. 6. The unit of EQE on Figure  1b  is wrong. 7. The first inverted perovskite solar cell using PEDOT:PSS and PCBM shall be cited in the introduction. Adv. Mater. 2013, 25, 3727. Overall, I suggest a minor revision for this manuscript. Reviewer #3 (Remarks to the Author): The manuscript by Brinkmann et al address the use of AZO/SnOx electron extractor layers in hybrid perovskite solar cells. More specifically, the paper reports improved device stability when such AZO/SnOx layers are used in inverted type solar cells. The paper is interesting but in the current state the paper is not suitable for a journal like Nature Communications. There are a number of significant issues that must be addressed. 1 The more detailed mechanism of how the combined AZO/SnOx layer interlayer improves stability needs to be established. This is not at all clear from the data presented in the paper. 2 Following from above, what is the mechanism by which the SnOx layer improves stability? How does it block water getting in the device? Surely most of the diffusion occurs from the sides of the devices and through the silver? Why can't the metal electrode act as a barrier to water? It is not beyond the realms of possibility that approximately 100 nm thick (or several 10's nm thick) metal electrodes can function good physical blocking layers. Perhaps this should be investigated. 3 The authors suggest that the silver electrode may be involved in the degradation of the device in presence of water. Have the authors tried to replace the silver electrode with lets say gold (which is known to be more stable than silver) in control devices that do now contain the SnOx layer: ITO/PEDOT/active layer/gold. 5 The authors should provide more information about how the device stability experiments were performed. Was this done with maximum power point tracking? Were the experiments performed whilst continuously illuminating the solar cells under load with the solar cells put in ambient environment? Or, are the authors just referring ""shelf life"" stability. To get a true indication of stability it is important that he authors consider the former (e.g) measurements under continuous illumination under load with MPP tracking. 6 In the temperature stability measurements shown in figure  4 . It is shown the drop in performance is mainly due to a drop in the fill factor. The authors should discuss the origin of this. The authors should also perhaps repeat temperature stability experiments using a thicker electrode layer -certainly thicker than 10nm !! It is not surprising that with such thin layers of silver (e.g. 10nm) increase the chance that the degradation products escape. 
 REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: Reviewer #1 (Remarks to the Author): I am satisfied with the revisions to the manuscript. Although a simultaneous temperature and moisture (damp heat) test, which all commercial PV must pass, would be most interesting there is sufficient data included here for an initial report. The changes raise the quality of this revised work to those required by Nature Comm. I support prompt publication. 
 Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author): The revised version has addressed most of the comments and questions raised by the reviewer properly. I would recommend its publication. Reviewer #3 (Remarks to the Author): Based on the responses and reading the revised paper the referee believes that the paper may now be suitable for publication in Nature communications. Point 1 and 2: The role of metal contact versus SnOx layer in protecting against water vapour ingress has been clarified. The comparison between vapour transmission rates for metal versus ALD grown SnOx is welcome. Point 3: Though a comparison of gold and silver as an electrode and the investigation of the use of SnOx/AZO as a blocking layer (ie reducing migration of metal atoms from electrode) are important issues the referee accepts that this is potentially beyond the scope of the current work. Point 5: The additional solar cell stability experiments (Figure  S8 ) are welcome and serve to clarify the concerns of referee 3. Point 6: comments regarding thickness of Ag layer clarified. Concerning the origin of the drop in the fill factor (FF): the discussion is welcome. However, the referee has an additional question here: Did the authors observe a change in hysteresis in fresh versus aged samples. (referring to a device that is treated in the same way as in Figure  5 ; main manuscript). For example, a device that is using an AZO/SnOx extraction layer (with and without heating at 60C)? Reviewer #1 (Remarks to the Author): This manuscript describes an inverted perovskite photovoltaic in which the electron extraction layer consists of PCBM-only, PCBM + AZO nanoparticles, or PCBM + AZO nanoparticles + SnO2 ALD overcoat. The work convincingly shows an improvement in PV stability with the 3-step overcoat as well as supports a hypothesis for the mechanism by which the devices are stabilized. 
 Reply: We appreciate the referee's assessment of our work. We were pleased to read that he finds our results convincing. The originality and interest of the report is good but modest. Although the authors do not highlight previous ALD-over-pervoskite work there are other examples including J. Mater. Chem. A, 2015, 3, 20092-20096. 
 Reply: We are aware of the previous work, in which single ALD layers have been deposited on top of a perovskite to protect it against ambient gases (e.g. moisture) and thereby to improve its resilience in ambient air. The functionality of ALD layers in these earlier papers is that of a permeation barrier. These ALD layers are not a functional part of a device structure and their electrical properties are more or less irrelevant and neglected. Opposed to that, our work is essentially different, as the SnOx ALD layer is a functional part of our devices. The SnOx layer is unique in a sense that it provides outstanding gas permeation barrier properties with a water vapor transmission rate orders of magnitude better than that of sputtered ITO or that of solution processed metal-oxides, and at the same time it is optically highly transparent and electrically conductive. Thus it can be positioned right between the sensitive metal cathode and the photo-active perovskite. Thereby, the SnOx layer provides outstanding protection of the perovskite against the ingress of moisture and, even more importantly, at the same time it serves as powerful permeation barrier against the out-diffusion of decomposition products of the perovskite, e.g. CH3NH3I, (CH3)3N, CH3I, HI, etc. We show that the sealing properties of the SnOx layer contain the decomposition products inside the cell, and thereby, the overall decomposition of the perovskite is significantly suppressed. We feel that this concept goes significantly beyond the ""ALD-on-top-of-perovskite"" reports cited by the referee. To make things more clear we referenced the above citation and added a sentence to clarify the differences: ""Please note, there are reports where ALD layers have been directly deposited on top of a perovskite layer to improve its resilience against ambient atmosphere and heat.  1  However, these ALD layers were not a functional part of a device, and therefore most of the experiments were based on electrical insulators like Al2O3."" The thickness of the SnO2 layer is suggested to be 20 nm, but this ignores the high likelihood that the ALD SnOx has coated a significant fraction of porous interior of the nanoparticle AZO on which it is grown. 
 Reply: This is an excellent point! Indeed, ALD is known for its conformal, shadow-free type of growth which implies the coating of the interior of porous media. With the specification of a 20 nm thick SnOx layer we referred to a nominal thickness as derived when the layer is coated onto a flat, non-porous substrate. We believe that the ability of the SnOx ALD layer to seal pinholes and/or pores will substantially improve the permeation barrier properties of the AZO/SnOx assembly vs. that of a single AZO layer. To analyze this point deeper and to address the point raised by the referee, we performed Rutherford backscattering (RBS) measurements on two samples as shown in the Figure below (which became the new Figure  S1  in the revised supporting information). Specifically, we have deposited SnOx in one process on top of an AZO layer grown by ALD (ALD-AZO), which is thereby expected to have no pinholes, and on top of an AZO layer derived from a NP dispersion -both AZO layers have an identical thickness. From the RBS spectra attributed to Sn, we are able to determine the number of Sn atoms per area, which is indicative of the amount of SnOx actually deposited. For the SnOx on top of the pin-holefree ALD-AZO we measured (44.5±0.2)×10  15  Sn-atoms/cm 2 , which is in excellent agreement with our earlier RBS measurements of ALD grown SnOx layers (on top of a flat Silicon wafer) with a thickness of 20 nm (determined by stylus profilometry). On the contrary, for the SnOx deposited on top of the AZO (NP) layer we found (72.2±0.9)×10  15  Sn-atoms/cm 2 , which is a factor of 1.62 higher than for the non-porous substrate. This result clearly supports the hypothesis of the ALD growth of the SnOx inside the pores of the nanoparticle derived AZO layer, which increases the total amount of SnOx deposited. 
 To clarify the growth of the SnOx on top of the AZO and into the pores, we added in the revised version of the manuscript: ""The nominal thickness of the SnOx layer is 20 nm. As the AZO layer is derived from a nanoparticle dispersion, it contains pores which are partially coated with SnOx due to the conformal nature of the ALD process. A more detailed discussion of the SnOx growth on top of the AZO layer is provided in the supporting information."" We also added to the experimental section: ""Rutherford backscattering (RBS) was measured at the RUBION (University of Bochum, Germany), using a dynamitron tandem accelerator with 2 MeV 4 He + beam (beam current of 20-40 nA). A silicon surface barrier detector was placed at an angle of 160 degree with respect to the beam axis. The solid angle of the detector was 1.91 msrad."" Overall the paper is modestly well written and its conclusions are sound. However, the impact appears to be below the very high bar of nature communications as the lifetime is good (350 hrs) but never pushed to the real boundaries previous pervoskite systems (1000 hrs of illumination, high relative temperature and humidity, etc) the methods is not totally novel, and efficiency is modest (although unoptimized). While I don't believe all high impact papers need to be 18+ % efficient, the mechanism by which the most efficient devices fail is important. Suggested improvements are stability tests that push the device to failure including light soaking under temperature and humidity followed by publication in a journal similar to E&ES. 
 Reply: As outlined above, we believe that the integration of the SnOx layer inside the device is conceptually significantly different from earlier work. To be able to position a permeation barrier (SnOx) inside the device stack, the SnOx layer must be optically highly transparent and electrically conductive. As a part of the electron extraction layer, the SnOx provides outstanding protection of the perovskite against the ingress of moisture and, even more importantly, at the same time it serves as powerful permeation barrier against the outdiffusion of decomposition products of the perovskite, and thereby, the overall decomposition of the perovskite is significantly suppressed. As the referee said, the efficiency of our cells is limited by the perovskite precursor used in this study. We agree with him that high impact papers do not necessarily need to report 18+ % efficient devices. The study of failure mechanisms of more efficient perovskite systems is certainly an important field, but it is beyond the scope of the present paper. Our paper focusses on a novel impermeable bi-layered electron extraction layer that serves as a diffusion barrier inside the perovskite solar cell. Thus, we decided to consider the most commonly used perovskite photo-active layer MAPbI3. However, as stated in the manuscript, we believe that the concept of an impermeable electron extraction layer is generally applicable and therefore is expected to provide an avenue to achieve a substantially improved device lifetime of solar cells based on organo-metal halide perovskites even beyond MAPbI3. As requested, we have updated the lifetime data for the cells aged at elevated temperature (60°C) which now extends to 1032 h (new Figure  4 ). We believe that these numbers now more impressively underline the stability enabled by our inverted device structure with impermeable AZO/SnOx EELs. In this set of samples, the thickness of the ALD SnO x layer was 20 nm and that of the Ag electrode was 100 nm. The characteristics have been determined from the J/V measurements in reverse direction (Figure  S7 ). We also agree with the referee that light soaking tests under concomitant heating are an important (and more demanding) stress condition. However, we want to note, that according to a very recent ""Research Update"" published by the Snaith group in APL Materials [APL Mater. 4, 091503 (2016)], the number of reports on the stability of perovskite solar cells in which the cells are actually stressed by light soaking and heat simultaneously, is very scarce. This may in part be due to the fact that upon ""multi-stress"" conditions the individual degradation mechanisms are difficult to be separated. Nevertheless, as requested by the referees, we conducted a new set of long-term light soaking tests at 60°C. Briefly, the devices were illuminated with a white LED to achieve the same Jsc as upon AM1.5G solar irradiation. At the same time, the devices were kept in an oven at 60°C under N2 atmosphere (all experimental details are mentioned in the methods section). We have deliberately chosen the N2 environment for the light-soaking experiment, as we had already clarified the influence of humidity in Figure  1 , and we had clearly shown that the encapsulation due to the AZO/SnOx layer is efficiently blocking the ingress of moisture. The results of the new light-soaking/heating stress tests are shown in the new Figure  S8 . In the manuscript we added the following discussion: ""Aside from so-called ""mono-stress"" conditions, like elevated temperature, multi-stressing can be considered. To this end, we conducted set of long-term light soaking tests at 60°C under N2, in which the devices were simultaneously illuminated with a white LED to achieve the same Jsc as upon AM1.5G solar irradiation (for details see the experimental section). The results of this multi-stress experiment are shown in the supporting information (Figure  S8 ). Briefly, again the AZO/SnOx cells are substantially more stable than the AZO cells under concomitant heat and illumination. This difference is in part due to the suppressed decomposition of the perovskite due to heat in case of the AZO/SnOx (in agreement with the discussion of Figure  4 ). However, there is a clear degradation even of the AZO/SnOx samples where the PCE decays to roughly 60 % of its initial value after 300 hours. This is in contrast to the case where only thermal stress has been used. Earlier   S8f ). This is why we conclude that photo-induced trap-state formation occurs in our cells. However, there have been recent reports confirming that photo-induced degradation is not a general problem of organo-lead halide perovskites, and very recently some optimized mixed cation / mixed halide perovskite active materials were shown to be far less prone to light soaking degradation.  4, 5  . Heat was found to be a dominating source of degradation in these mixed cation perovskite cells.  6  Note, our inverted device structure based on the impermeable AZO/SnOx electron extraction layer is generally applicable and can also accommodate these next-generation perovskite photo-active systems with enhanced stability and efficiency.  7  "" V oc,0 , FF 0 , and PCE 0 are the characteristics of the cells before stressing. In this set of samples, the thickness of the ALD SnO x layer was 20 nm and that of the Ag electrode was 100 nm. The characteristics have been determined from the J/V measurements in reverse direction. Spectrum of the white LED used for the lightsoaking stress test under concomitant heating (e). J/V characteristics of an AZO/SnO x /Ag cell, non-stressed (fresh), stressed for 300 hours (light/heat), and subsequently recovered in in darkness at room temperature for nine days (in the glove box). 
 work has unraveled the photo-induced degradation of solar cells based on MAPbI3. While Misra et al. identified a photo-activated decomposition mechanism 2 , more recently Nie et al. reported that continuous illumination of MAPbI3 caused the formation of trap states which spoiled the solar cells performance, especially Jsc. 3 While our sealing approach based on the impermeable AZO/SnOx electron extraction layer has been shown to efficiently suppress the decomposition of the perovskite, it cannot suppress the formation of trap states in the perovskite. Similar to the report of Nie et al., the cell characteristics recover after stressing, if the cells are kept in darkness (Figure Finally, we agree with the referee that Energy&Environmental Science (E&ES) would also be a potential outlet for our work. While we are convinced that both journals are highly respected, we decided to choose Nature Communications in this case. Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author): This manuscript described the use of a bi-layer oxide AZO/SnOx as electron extraction layer to improve the stability of perovskite solar cell. Stability is a crucial issue for perovskite solar cell before it can be considered as a promising alternative for current existing technologies. The finding and phenomena reported in this communication could be interesting for the community. However, several issues need to be addressed before the acceptance by high-ranking journal. 1. The results of the most successful device on stability [ Ref 17, Science 350, 944-948 (2015)] shall be briefly described and discussed in the introduction. The device architecture of this communication is conceptually similar to that Science paper, except the use of bilayer oxide. I think the advantages and novelty (vs that Science paper work) shall be clearly expressed in the introduction to show the importance of this work. Otherwise, changing materials can only be considered as a minor progression or followup. Technology, 205, 5088 (2011)]. The SEM images in their supporting information also show some granularity of the layers. Grain-boundaries are pathways for gas diffusion. Opposed to that, our ALD grown SnOx layers are amorphous and dense. In addition the authors had to limit the thickness of the sol-gel TiNbOx to 10 nm due to its poor electrical conductivity of 10 -5 S cm -1 . For thicker TiNbOx layers some notable deterioration in the J/V characteristics is found. As already discussed in the original version of the paper, our ALD grown SnOx layers show a more than two orders of magnitude higher electrical conductivity of 5x10 -3 S/cm which does not impose such a thickness limitation. Even though the authors did not provide any permeation data for their 10 nm thin Ti(Nb)Ox layers, for the reasons discussed above, it can be expected that the water permeation rate is substantially higher than that of ALD grown SnOx layers with similar thickness. As result, the authors showed device stability only in a dry cabinet or with additional encapsulation of the devices. Opposed to that our devices proved stable in ambient air even without additional encapsulation. Likewise, even though the authors did not provide any experiments at elevated temperatures of 60°C, it must be expected that the 10 nm sol-gel TiNbOx will not form a serious barrier against the egress of perovskite decomposition products. We have clearly shown that in our case the barrier functionality of the AZO/SnOx electron extraction layer not only provides outstanding protection of the perovskite against the ingress of moisture, but at the same time it serves as powerful permeation barrier against the out-diffusion of decomposition products of the perovskite, and thereby, the overall decomposition of the perovskite is significantly suppressed. 
 Reply: The Science paper mentioned by the referee used an inverted planar device structure. The authors employ NiMgLiO as hole extraction layer and Ti(Nb)Ox as electron extraction layer. Specifically, the Ti(Nb)Ox was prepared by a sol-gel process. It is known that sol-gel layers other than ALD layers do not form conformal pin-hole free coatings and thus they typically afford rather poor permeation barriers [see e.g. Hirvikorpi et al. Surface and Coatings As suggested by the referee, we have added the following clear differentiation of our work compared to the report in Science 350, 944-948 (2015) in the introduction of our paper. ""Chen employed a sol-gel Ti(Nb)Ox electron extraction layer, which was aimed to protect the perovskite against moisture from ambient atmosphere.  8  Due to its poor electrical conductivity of 10 -5 S cm  -1  , in devices the authors had to limit the thickness of the sol-gel Ti(Nb)Ox to 10 nm. Moreover, it is known that sol-gel derived layers state only relatively poor permeation barriers.  9  As a result, the device stability tests which afforded a lifetime of 1000 h, were done with additional encapsulation."" 2. For the XRD results, the spectra seem to contain only the diffraction pattern of perovskite. As the author said in the manuscript the sample is a full device, I think the author shall see the diffraction of those constituent layers to prove that the sample is the full device and cover with EEL and metal contact. Please clarify this issue. It is quite unusual that under ambient condition, no PbI2 signal were observed. In general the formation of PbI2 prevails extremely fast in air. The explanation of ""non-crystalline nature of the degradation product"" is not very convincing as no amorphous feature in the XRD spectra. 
 Reply: We fully understand the comment of the referee. To explain: The XRD spectra shown in Figure  3a  were not measured with the uttermost sensitivity of our equipment, which means that (the weak) signals from Ag or ITO were not clearly visible. Even though, upon closer inspection of the spectrum in Figure  3a , a number of additional weak peaks are present. To clarify the question of the referee, we measured an identical sample again in XRD with a 10 times longer integration time (measurement time for one spectrum: 18 hours) to obtain a better signal to noise ratio and to render these weaker peaks better visible. Moreover we chose a logarithmic representation and included this spectrum as new Figure  S3  in the supporting information. Aside from the dominating MAPbI3 reflections, we were able to clearly identify signals attributed to PbI2, Ag and ITO. The AZO layer was not visible. AZO is a nano-crystalline material, however, the size of the AZO particles is only 12 nm, and therefore even in this more sensitive measurement we were not able to detect signs of the AZO layer. We have also prepared single AZO layers (80 nm thickness) on top of a glass substrate but we did also not see any XRD signal from these layers under similar XRD measurement conditions. 
 Figure S3 : Logarithmic representation of the XRD spectrum of a fresh perovskite cell based on AZO as EEL with an assignment of the peaks to layers in the device. The peak positions of MAPbI3, 10 PbI2,  11  ITO,  12  and Ag,  13  were taken from the respective references. We also updated Figure  3a  and the inset in Figure  3a  with the spectra measured with greater sensitivity. In the manuscript we now note the small PbI2 peak that is present in the fresh samples, already. We also notice that after 7 days of storing the device in ambient air, the PbI2 peak did not show a notable increase. In the revised manuscript it now reads: ""As this XRD measurement has been made on a full device stack, further signals related to the Ag and ITO electrodes are visible. A detailed assignment of these peaks is shown in the supporting information (Figure  S3 ). Only a very weak signal due to PbI2 was found, which did not significantly increase even after seven days in air (Figure  3a ). Thus, no severe decomposition of the perovskite to PbI2 upon storage in air can be inferred from the XRD data."" Moreover, we agree with the referee, that there is a general belief that MAPbI3 exposed to air forms PbI2 quite readily. However, a careful review of reports in the literature shows a more ambiguous picture. Especially, a more detailed specification is needed for ""ambient conditions"" or ""exposure to air"" (in terms of temperature and relative humidity). For example, Christians et al. have reported XRD studies of MAPbI3 (fresh and after 28 days in air at 23±1°C and 50% relative humidity (similar to our lab)) and did not see any notable change in their XRD spectra [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2015, 137, 1530-1538]. While at 23±1°C and 90% rH the same authors evidenced the formation of a hydrate phase clearly seen as additional peaks at 10.46° and 16.01°) after 7 days. In our case, at 23°C and 50% relative humidity, we also did not see a notable growth of the PbI2 peak even after 7 days (inset of Figure  3a ). However, the detection of iodine at the surface (XPS data Figure  3b ) and the severe degradation of the Ag electrode (Figure  3c, d ) infer that iodine compounds leaked out of the perovskite. The more reasonable explanation is that the amount of PbI2 that is formed upon storage in air is even smaller compared to the small amount of PbI2 already present in the pristine perovskite layer. We note, however, that likely only very small amounts of halide containing decomposition products are required to degrade the interface of the Ag electrode to the device and lead to the deteriorated device characteristics We agree with the referee, that we cannot provide unambiguous evidence for amorphous PbI2, and thus we deleted this sentence. 3. For the XPS results, the baseline of fresh devices made with SnOx and AZO/SnOx shall be included. Since XPS is a surface technique that investigates on the first few 3~5 nm, I wonder if the perovskite can be detected if protected after 10 nm Ag and AZO. The As requested by the referee, we have added the baseline spectra of the fresh samples with SnOx and AZO/SnOx in the revised Figure  3b . We have also added the survey spectra for all samples in the supporting information (Figure  S4 ). As expected, no signal due to the perovskite (e.g. Pb4d) can be detected, because the perovskite in these samples is covered by PCBM/AZO/Ag, or PCBM/SnOx/Ag, or PCBM/AZO/SnOx, respectively. Note, the position where the Pb4f signals would be located is overlaid by Zn3s and Sn4s signals as indicated in the figure, thus we refer to the Pb4d signal. The peak around 622 eV in the XPS spectrum shown in Figure  3b , does not represent another bonding state of the iodine, it is rather a so called ""shake-up"" peak. The shake-up process is a two electron process in which a part of the kinetic energy of the photoelectron is used to lift-up an additional electron into an excited state, resulting in an excited ion. Due to the loss in kinetic energy, the apparent binding energy of the emitted and analyzed photoelectron is hereby increased by the energy necessary for the excitation (typically a few eV). Such shake-up peaks are commonly observed in any strong XPS signal. To show that the feature in Figure  3b  is not due to an interaction of Iodine with e.g. silver, we analyzed the iodine XPS spectra of pure MAPbI3, as well as of the precursors MAI and PbI2 (see figure below). All of these spectra show this shake up feature at around 622 eV (red curve). 
 To clarify, we added in the revised version of the paper: ""The peak around 622 eV in the XPS spectrum of the aged AZO sample does not represent another bonding state of the iodine, it is rather a so called ""shake-up"" peak. Such shake-up peaks are commonly observed in strong XPS signals."" 4. Are the SEM images taken on top of Ag or on top of oxides? I think that matters for proposing the mechanism. 
 Reply: The measurements were taken on top of Ag. It may have been overseen, but in the original version of the manuscript we had already specified this in the respective figure caption. 
 5. To demonstrate real stability for solar cells, light soaking is necessary. Especially for perovskite solar cell, light soaking results can really substantiate the claim for long term stability. To be published in such high impact journal like Nature Communications, I think the authors shall show stability under light soaking. 
 Reply: We also agree with the referee that light soaking tests (under concomitant heating) are an important (and more demanding) stress condition. However, we want to note, that according to a very recent ""Research Update"" published by the Snaith group in APL Materials [APL Mater. 4, 091503 (2016)], the number of reports on the stability of perovskite solar cells in which the cells are stressed by light soaking and heat simultaneously, is very scarce. This may in part be due to the fact that upon ""multi-stress"" conditions the individual degradation mechanisms are difficult to be separated. Nevertheless, as requested by the referees, we conducted a new set of long-term light soaking tests at 60°C. Briefly, the devices were illuminated with a white LED to achieve the same Jsc as upon AM1.5G solar irradiation. At the same time, the devices were kept in an oven at 60°C under N2 atmosphere (all experimental details are mentioned in the methods section). We have deliberately chosen the N2 environment for the light-soaking experiment, as we had already clarified the influence of humidity in Figure  1 , and we had clearly shown that the encapsulation due to the AZO/SnOx layer is efficiently blocking the ingress of moisture. The results of the new light-soaking/heating stress tests are shown in the new Figure  S8  (also shown above in this reply). In the manuscript we added the following discussion: ""Aside from so-called ""mono-stress"" conditions, like elevated temperature, multi-stressing can be considered. To this end, we conducted set of long-term light soaking tests at 60°C under N2, in which the devices were simultaneously illuminated with a white LED to achieve the same Jsc as upon AM1.5G solar irradiation (for details see the experimental section). The results of this multi-stress experiment are shown in the supporting information (Figure  S8 ). Briefly, again the AZO/SnOx cells are substantially more stable than the AZO cells under concomitant heat and illumination. This difference is in part due to the suppressed decomposition of the perovskite due to heat in case of the AZO/SnOx (in agreement with the discussion of Figure  4 ). However, there is a clear degradation even of the AZO/SnOx samples where the PCE decays to roughly 60 % of its initial value after 300 hours. This is in contrast to the case where only thermal stress has been used. Earlier work has unraveled the photo-induced degradation of solar cells based on MAPbI3. While Misra et al. identified a photo-activated decomposition mechanism 2 , more recently Nie et al. reported that continuous illumination of MAPbI3 caused the formation of trap states which spoiled the solar cells performance, especially Jsc.  3  While our sealing approach based on the impermeable AZO/SnOx electron extraction layer has been shown to efficiently suppress the decomposition of the perovskite, it cannot suppress the formation of trap states in the perovskite. Similar to the report of Nie et al., the cell characteristics recover after stressing, if the cells are kept in darkness (Figure  S8f ). This is why we conclude that photo-induced trap-state formation occurs in our cells. However, there have been recent reports confirming that photo-induced degradation is not a general problem of organolead halide perovskites, and some optimized mixed cation / mixed halide perovskite active materials were shown to be far less prone to light soaking degradation.  4, 5  . Heat was found to be a dominating source of degradation in these mixed cation perovskite cells.  6  Note, our inverted device structure based on the impermeable AZO/SnOx electron extraction layer is generally applicable and can also accommodate these next-generation perovskite photoactive systems with enhanced stability and efficiency.  7  "" 6. The unit of EQE on Figure  1b  is wrong. 
 Reply: Thank you for pointing us to this error. We have revised Figure  1  b accordingly. 7. The first inverted perovskite solar cell using PEDOT:PSS and PCBM shall be cited in the introduction. Adv. Mater. 2013, 25, 3727. 
 Reply: As requested, we have added the reference to Adv. Mater. 2013, 25, 3727 in the introduction. Overall, I suggest a minor revision for this manuscript. 
 Reply: We deeply value your comments that helped us to improve our paper. Reviewer #3 (Remarks to the Author): The manuscript by Brinkmann et al address the use of AZO/SnOx electron extractor layers in hybrid perovskite solar cells. More specifically, the paper reports improved device stability when such AZO/SnOx layers are used in inverted type solar cells. The paper is interesting but in the current state the paper is not suitable for a journal like Nature Communications. There are a number of significant issues that must be addressed. 1 The more detailed mechanism of how the combined AZO/SnOx layer interlayer improves stability needs to be established. This is not at all clear from the data presented in the paper. 2 Following from above, what is the mechanism by which the SnOx layer improves stability? How does it block water getting in the device? Surely most of the diffusion occurs from the sides of the devices and through the silver? Why can't the metal electrode act as a barrier to water? It is not beyond the realms of possibility that approximately 100 nm thick (or several 10's nm thick) metal electrodes can function good physical blocking layers. Perhaps this should be investigated. 
 Reply: Comments 1+2 point into the same direction, thus we are going to reply to them combined: As detailed in the manuscript the root cause of the improved stability due to the addition of the SnOx layer is in its functionality as a permeation barrier. The SnOx provides outstanding protection of the perovskite against the ingress of moisture and, even more importantly, at the same time it serves as powerful permeation barrier against the out-diffusion of decomposition products of the perovskite, e.g. CH3NH3I, (CH3)3N, CH3I, HI, etc. We showed that the sealing properties of the SnOx layer contain the decomposition products inside the cell, and thereby, the overall decomposition of the perovskite is significantly suppressed. Water ingress via the sides (so-called: ""side-leakage"") is severely suppressed by thin-film barrier, as no glues are involved. Permeation via the Ag may occur but please note that the barrier is below the Ag (see Fig.  1a ). The metal electrode can form some barrier against moisture. They are used for food packaging, e.g. for potato-chips bags. But as is known, metal films do not form the kind of barriers that are required to protect sensitive thin-film devices such as OLEDs or, here, perovskite solar cells. To give some numbers: The water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) through 300 nm thick metal layers has been determined, see e.g. Appl. Phys. Lett. 93, 133307 (2008), to be on the order of 0.2 g/(m 2 day), while the ALD grown SnOx layers provide WVTRs on the order of 7x10 -5 g/(m 2 day). Thus, just like in the case of OLEDs and organic solar cells, the top metal electrode will not provide the level of protection required. Special to perovskites: There is the intrinsic decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 to CH3NH3I and PbI2, which is thermally activated and which occurs even under inert conditions. The corrosion of metal electrodes due to these decomposition products has been identified to be a critical issue. Thus a permeation barrier against the out-diffusion of decomposition products of the perovskite is required. As we show, the sealing properties of the SnOx layer contain the decomposition products inside the cell, and thereby, the overall decomposition of the perovskite is significantly suppressed and the deterioration of the electrode is prevented. 3 The authors suggest that the silver electrode may be involved in the degradation of the device in presence of water. Have the authors tried to replace the silver electrode with lets say gold (which is known to be more stable than silver) in control devices that do now contain the SnOx layer: ITO/PEDOT/active layer/gold. 
 Reply: We are aware of some reports claiming improved stability of perovskite solar cells due to the use of Au. On the other hand, this claim is not free of ambiguity, as there are also reports that found long-term stability issues related to the migration of Au.  6   
 While we assume that our impermeable AZO/SnOx electron extraction layer could be well suited to also prevent the migration of electrode metal atoms into the active layer, we feel that this is beyond the scope of the present communication. A further reason why we did not consider Au is its high cost, which might render Au electrodes less attractive for future commercialization. Note: Point 4 was missing in the original referee report! experiments were performed. Was this done with maximum power point tracking? Were the experiments performed whilst continuously illuminating the solar cells under load with the solar cells put in ambient environment? Or, are the authors just referring ""shelf life"" stability. To get a true indication of stability it is important that he authors consider the former (e.g.) measurements under continuous illumination under load with MPP tracking. 
 Reply: We applied so-called ""mono-stress"" conditions, i.e. either in air or under N2 at 60°C without light soaking. [APL Mater. 4, 091503 (2016)], the number of reports on the stability of perovskite solar cells in which the cells are stressed by light soaking and heat simultaneously, is very scarce. This may in part be due to the fact that upon ""multi-stress"" conditions the individual degradation mechanisms are difficult to be separated. Briefly, our devices were illuminated with a white LED to achieve the same Jsc as upon AM1.5G solar irradiation. At the same time, the devices were kept in an oven at 60°C under N2 atmosphere (all experimental details are mentioned in the methods section). We have deliberately chosen the N2 environment for the light/heat stress experiment, as we had already clarified the influence of humidity in Figure  1 , and we had clearly shown that the encapsulation due to the AZO/SnOx layer is efficiently blocking the ingress of moisture. 
 Nevertheless, as requested by the referees, we conducted a new set of long-term light soaking tests at 60°C. However, we want to note, that according to a very recent ""Research Update"" published by the Snaith group in APL Materials 
 The results of the new light-soaking/heating stress tests are shown in the new Figure S8 (also shown above in this reply). In the manuscript we added the following discussion: ""Aside from so-called ""mono-stress"" conditions, like elevated temperature, multi-stressing can be considered. To this end, we conducted set of long-term light soaking tests at 60°C under N2, in which the devices were simultaneously illuminated with a white LED to achieve the same Jsc as upon AM1.5G solar irradiation (for details see the experimental section). The results of this multi-stress experiment are shown in the supporting information (Figure  S8 ).

It is shown the drop in performance is mainly due to a drop in the fill factor. The authors should discuss the origin of this. The authors should also perhaps repeat temperature stability experiments using a thicker electrode layer -certainly thicker than 10nm !! It is not surprising that with such thin layers of silver (e.g. 10nm) increase the chance that the degradation products escape. 
 work has unraveled the photo-induced degradation of solar cells based on MAPbI3. While Misra et al. identified a photo-activated decomposition mechanism 2 , more recently Nie et al. reported that continuous illumination of MAPbI3 caused the formation of trap states which spoiled the solar cells performance, especially Jsc. 3 While our sealing approach based on the impermeable AZO/SnOx electron extraction layer has been shown to efficiently suppress the decomposition of the perovskite, it cannot suppress the formation of trap states in the perovskite.

 Reply: Obviously, there is a misunderstanding. The devices presented in Figure  4  were based on 100 nm thick silver electrodes. The 10 nm Ag layers were only used in the XPS experiments to provide more sensitivity in the degradation effect. To avoid further misconceptions we have specified the electrode thickness in the caption of Figure  4 : ""In this set of samples, the thickness of the ALD SnOx layer was 20 nm and that of the Ag electrode was 100 nm."" Regarding the origin of the loss in FF in Figure  4 : We discussed in the manuscript: ""Under inert atmosphere, the thermally activated degradation of the perovskite leads to decomposition products that can easily diffuse through the PCBM/AZO/Ag layers on top of the perovskite. The less volatile PbI2 phase remains in the active layer leading to a substantial decay of the FF of the corresponding devices (Figure  4c ). Moreover, it has been shown earlier that a change in film stoichiometry (Pb-poor to Pb-rich) may substantially alter the electronic properties of the perovskite and especially the position of the conduction and valence band with respect to the vacuum level.  14  Towards increasingly Pbrich conditions, the ionization energy of the perovskite has been shown to increase significantly to values in the order of > 6eV, which would render the extraction of holes more and more challenging."" Again, we would like to thank the referees for their very helpful comments. We hope that in the revised version, our paper has now become acceptable for Nature Communications. Here is our point-by-point reply to the referees (please note our answers are in italic): Reviewer #1 (Remarks to the Author): I am satisfied with the revisions to the manuscript. Although a simultaneous temperature and moisture (damp heat) test, which all commercial PV must pass, would be most interesting there is sufficient data included here for an initial report. The changes raise the quality of this revised work to those required by Nature Comm. I support prompt publication. 
 We value the efforts of the referee and appreciate his supportive recommendation Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author): The revised version has addressed most of the comments and questions raised by the reviewer properly. I would recommend its publication. 
 We value the efforts of the referee and appreciate his supportive recommendation Reviewer #3 (Remarks to the Author): Based on the responses and reading the revised paper the referee believes that the paper may now be suitable for publication in Nature communications. Point 1 and 2: The role of metal contact versus SnOx layer in protecting against water vapour ingress has been clarified. The comparison between vapour transmission rates for metal versus ALD grown SnOx is welcome. Point 3: Though a comparison of gold and silver as an electrode and the investigation of the use of SnOx/AZO as a blocking layer (ie reducing migration of metal atoms from electrode) are important issues the referee accepts that this is potentially beyond the scope of the current work. Point 5: The additional solar cell stability experiments (Figure  S8 ) are welcome and serve to clarify the concerns of referee 3. Point 6: comments regarding thickness of Ag layer clarified. Concerning the origin of the drop in the fill factor (FF): the discussion is welcome. However, the referee has an additional question here: Did the authors observe a change in hysteresis in fresh versus aged samples. (referring to a device that is treated in the same way as in Figure  5 ; main manuscript). For example, a device that is using an AZO/SnOx extraction layer (with and without heating at 60C)? 
 Reply: We value the efforts of the referee and appreciate his supportive recommendation We added in the manuscript: ""Note, the hysteresis did not increase in the course of aging."" The area of thin-film photovoltaics has been overwhelmed by organometal halide perovskites. Unfortunately, serious stability concerns arise with perovskite solar cells. For example, methyl-ammonium lead iodide is known to decompose in the presence of water and, more severely, even under inert conditions at elevated temperatures. Here, we demonstrate inverted perovskite solar cells, in which the decomposition of the perovskite is significantly mitigated even at elevated temperatures. Specifically, we introduce a bilayered electronextraction interlayer consisting of aluminium-doped zinc oxide and tin oxide. We evidence tin oxide grown by atomic layer deposition does form an outstandingly dense gas permeation barrier that effectively hinders the ingress of moisture towards the perovskite and-more importantly-it prevents the egress of decomposition products of the perovskite. Thereby, the overall decomposition of the perovskite is significantly suppressed, leading to an outstanding device stability.

NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8:13938 | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms13938 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications S olar cells based on organolead halide perovskites have seen tremendous progress over the past 5 years 1 . Although their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has skyrocketed to reach a level of 420% (ref.  2 ), concerns about their stability are still intimately linked to this technology  [3] [4] [5]  . Generally, there is consensus that perovskites like CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 decompose to their constituents, that is, HI, CH 3 NH 2 and PbI 2 , in the presence of water  6  . Moreover, the intrinsic decomposition of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 to CH 3 NH 3 I and PbI 2 , which is thermally activated and which occurs even under inert conditions, states a more fundamental problem  7, 8  . At the same time, there are secondary effects of perovskite decomposition such as the degradation of functional building blocks in the solar cell because of the corrosive effect of the perovskite decomposition products  9  . Specifically, the corrosion of metal electrodes like Ag or Al has been identified to be a critical issue  10  . Overall, without proper concepts to overcome these reliability issues, the prospects of wide-spread application and commercialization of organolead halide perovskite technology may be significantly compromised. Among the various device architectures for perovskite solar cells, the inverted planar geometry has been shown to yield devices essentially free of hysteresis  11, 12  . Here, the photogenerated holes are extracted via the bottom electrode using a hole-extraction interlayer (for example, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)), while the electron extraction proceeds via the top electrode. The energetic alignment of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 and [6,6 0 ]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) has been shown to be especially favourable for the extraction of electrons from the conduction band of the perovskite  13  . To overcome the stability issues discussed above, several groups have introduced inverted planar perovskite cells based on metal oxides as electronand hole-extraction interfacial layers adjacent to the cathode and anode, respectively  14, 15  . Chen et al.  15  employed a sol-gel Ti(Nb)O x electron-extraction layer that was aimed to protect the perovskite against moisture from ambient atmosphere. Because of its poor electrical conductivity of 10 À 5 S cm -1 , the authors had to limit the thickness of the sol-gel Ti(Nb)O x to 10 nm. Moreover, it is known that sol-gel-derived layers state only relatively poor permeation barriers  16  . As a result, the device stability tests that afforded a lifetime of 1,000 h were done with additional encapsulation. Kaltenbrunner et al.  17  have used Cr 2 O 3 /Cr at the cathode side to protect the metal cathode and thereby to improve the stability under ambient conditions, but still the efficiency was found to drop to 80% of its initial value after only 28 h. Very recently, Guerrero et al.  18  confirmed the protective effect of the Cr 2 O 3 /Cr interlayer but still found some severe degradation after only a few hours. You et al.  14  have shown that devices based on indium tin oxide (ITO)/NiO/perovskite/ZnO/Al were stable for tens of days in ambient conditions, whereas a reference device based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/Al showed severe degradation within half a day. Especially, the ZnO layer, which has been spin coated from a nanoparticle dispersion on top of the perovskite, has been claimed to protect the Al electrode against corrosion. Very recently, Bush et al.  19  have found that in their devices a similar nanoparticle-based ZnO layer next to the cathode did not provide any sufficient protection at elevated temperatures. As solar cells in outdoor conditions may reach a temperature significantly above 25 °C, the latter result appears to be extremely relevant. Other reports have evidenced rapid decomposition of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 when in direct contact with ZnO  20  . Here we propose an inverted cell architecture, where a bilayered aluminium-doped ZnO (AZO)/tin oxide (SnO x ) electron-extraction layer (EEL) affords perovskite solar cells with a remarkable resilience against moisture and heat. AZO is excellently suited to extract electrons from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of fullerenes  21  . However, the nanoparticlebased AZO layer does not provide sufficient protection against the ingress of moisture or the egress of perovskite decomposition products. Thus, we add a thin SnO x layer to form a bilayered AZO/SnO x EEL assembly. The SnO x is grown by low-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 80 °C that affords extremely dense, conformal and pinhole-free layers. Please note that there are reports where ALD layers have been directly deposited on top of perovskites to improve their resilience against ambient atmosphere and heat  22  . However, these ALD layers were not a functional part of a device, and therefore most of the experiments were based on electrical insulators like Al 2 O 3 . SnO x layers grown by ALD are optically highly transparent, electrically conductive and provide outstanding gas permeation barrier properties with a water vapour transmission rate as low as 7 Â 10 À 5 g (m À 2 day À 1 ), even when grown at a low temperature  23  . Their water vapour transmission rate is orders of magnitude better than that of sputtered ITO thin films or that of solution processed metal oxide layers. The electrical conductivity of the SnO x layer on the order of 5 Â 10 À 3 S cm À 1 allows us to place it between the sensitive electrode and the photoactive layers without adding any noticeable series resistance. Thereby, the SnO x provides outstanding protection of the perovskite against the ingress of moisture and, more importantly, at the same time it serves as permeation barrier against the out-diffusion of decomposition products of the perovskite. We will show that the sealing property of the SnO x layer contains the decomposition products inside the cell and, thereby, the overall decomposition of the perovskite is significantly suppressed. Although cells based on LiF/Al or AZO degrade within tens of hours in ambient air (23 °C and 50% relative humidity (rH)), devices based on AZO/SnO x show superior stability of their solar cell characteristics even on a timescale of 4350 h. More strikingly, at 60 °C under inert atmosphere, AZO-based devices degrade within 100 h because of thermally induced decomposition of the perovskite. On the contrary, the suppressed out-diffusion of decomposition products because of the diffusion-barrier properties of the AZO/SnO x EEL affords cells that are essentially unchanged even after 41,000 h under the same conditions. Our paper reports a general strategy to achieve a substantially improved device lifetime in the case of photoactive materials that may come with concerns about their intrinsic compositional stability. 
 Results Planar inverted cells. The devices used in this study are based on a planar inverted cell layout, where the holes are extracted via the bottom electrode (substrate electrode). The layer sequence is shown in Fig.  1 . As hole-extraction layer, PEDOT:PSS is used, whereas for electron extraction a 100 nm thick PCBM layer is deposited on top of the typically 180 nm thick CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite layer. Directly adjacent to the PCBM we have used a 100 nm thick AZO layer prepared from a nanoparticle dispersion in isopropylalcohol. In some cells, a SnO x layer is deposited on top of the AZO layer by ALD at 80 °C to form the bilayered electron-extraction assembly (AZO/SnO x ). The nominal thickness of the SnO x layer is 20 nm. As the AZO layer is derived from a nanoparticle dispersion, it contains pores that are partially coated with SnO x because of the conformal nature of the ALD process. A more detailed discussion of the SnO x growth on top of the AZO layer is provided in the Supplementary Fig.  1 . Please note that we have also prepared devices with SnO x deposited directly on top of PCBM, but the stability of the resulting devices was inferior to that of the AZO/SnO x cells (see discussion below). Reference devices based on ITO/PED-OT:PSS/Perovskite/PCBM/LiF/Al have also been included in our study. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of a typical AZO/SnO x -based perovskite solar cell is shown in Fig.  1b . The J/V characteristics of the device measured in forward and reverse direction (scan speed: 500 mV s À 1 ) are presented in Fig.  1c . No substantial hysteresis is found in the J/V data. The extracted characteristics V oc ¼ 0.95 V, FF ¼ 74% and a J sc ¼ 18 mA cm À 2 result in a PCE of 12.8%. We want to note that the perovskite precursor used in this study was commercially obtained from Ossila Ltd with a typically specified efficiency in the range of 11-13% (see Methods for details). Significantly higher PCEs can be achieved by using, for example, optimized precursor inks or mixed-cation/mixedhalide perovskite absorbers  24  . As the EEL is in the core of this report, further optimization of the perovskite system itself was considered to be beyond the scope here. Stability in ambient air. A very striking advantage of the bilayered AZO/SnO x EEL in direct comparison with AZO is displayed in Fig.  2 . Here, the stability of the cell characteristics is shown for devices that were continuously exposed to ambient air at 23 °C and 50% relative humidity. The devices that were based on a single layer of AZO as EEL degrade swiftly within B50 h. A severe decay of the FF from B70% to o25% and a concomitant drop of the J sc from B17 to 8.2 mA cm À 2 is found. Opposed to that, the characteristics of the corresponding cells with the bilayered EEL of AZO/SnO x do not show any degradation even after 4300 h in air. Note that the thickness of the SnO x layer is only 20 nm in these devices. There is a slight increase of the V oc in the AZO/SnO x samples that happens on a timescale of several tens of hours. This increase is only observed in the AZO/SnO x samples, as the LiF/Al and the AZO cells already undergo strong degradation on the same timescale. A similar increase of V oc on such a long timescale has been seen by other authors and it has been explained by an ageing effect that reduces the density of trap states in the perovskite  25  . As a reference, the cells based on LiF/Al are essentially degraded within B1 day. In order to analyse the reasons underlying the strikingly different degradation phenomena shown in Fig.  2 , we have performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies of the respective device structures. Note that in case of the XPS measurements, a thinner top Ag electrode was chosen (10 nm) compared with the actual solar cells (100 nm) because of the small probing depth of the technique. Looking first at the AZO-based device, the XRD spectrum shows the (110) and (220) reflections of tetragonal MAPbI 3 at angles of 14.11°and 28.14, respectively. As this XRD measurement has been made on a full device stack, further signals related to the Ag and ITO electrodes are visible. A detailed assignment of these peaks is shown in the Supplementary Fig.  3 . Only a very weak signal due to PbI 2 was found that did not significantly increase even after 7 days in air (Fig.  3a ). Thus, no severe decomposition of the perovskite to PbI 2 upon storage in air can be inferred from the XRD data. On the other hand, when XPS was used to look for degradation products on the surface, a notable amount of iodine was evidenced on the AZO sample (Fig.  3b ) after exposure to air for 2 days, whereas on identical samples kept in nitrogen no such iodine signal is found. Please note that the peak of B622 eV in the XPS spectrum of the aged AZO cell does not represent another bonding state of the iodine, but it is rather a so-called shake-up peak. Such shake-up peaks are commonly observed in strong XPS signals. The survey XPS spectra can be found in the Supplementary Fig.  4 . Plan-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the AZO samples aged in air show the formation of spot-like degradation motifs (Fig.  3c, d ). These spots point to the local ingress of moisture and out-diffusion of decomposition products of the perovskite, supported by the appearance of the iodine signal in XPS. In the degraded spots, needle-like features occur. Similar features have been reported for Ag electrodes corroded by the decomposition products of MAPbI 3 (ref. 26). Our findings are also in line with the results of Kato et al.  10  who unveiled a moisture promoted corrosion mechanism of Ag which resulted in the formation of products like AgI. The role of water in the electrode corrosion is further clarified below in cells aged under inert conditions. To explain the spot-like degradation, we can assume that structural defects, such as pinholes, in the AZO NP layer would give rise to locally enhanced water permeation. Opposed to that, the sample with the bilayered EEL of AZO/SnO x does not show any sign of degradation in SEM (Fig.  3e ) under identical conditions. In XPS, only a negligible amount of iodine at the surface of the AZO/SnO x samples can be detected. For comparison, we have also studied layer stacks where only SnO x , that is, without AZO between the PCBM and the SnO x , has been used as EEL. We have recently shown that SnO x with a work function of 4.1 eV forms an excellent EEL layer in inverted organic solar cells  27  . Here, the resulting perovskite solar cells based on SnO x were more stable than the devices based on AZO. However, they showed a statistical failure on a timescale of 100 h (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). This finding could be explained by a nonideal ALD growth of the SnO x directly on top of the organic PCBM layer. ALD as a chemical deposition technique relies on self-limiting chemical reactions on the sample surface  28  . For the ALD deposition of oxide layers, -OH surface groups form the nucleation sites for layer growth. In this sense, on organic surfaces like PCBM the nucleation of an ALD layer may deviate significantly from the growth on a surface rich of -OH groups  29  . Therefore, we can assume that the SnO x layer grown on PCBM is not free of some pin-hole defects that compromise its functionality as diffusion barrier. Consequently, substantially more iodine is detected on the surface after exposure to air compared with the AZO/SnO x device (Fig.  3b ). Thus, we conclude that the AZO serves two purposes in the bilayered AZO/SnO x EEL: (1) its electronic structure has been shown to facilitate electron extraction from the PCBM (ref. 21) and (2)  the AZO layer provides an improved (oxide-) surface for the nucleation of the subsequent SnO x ALD layer that can thus from a dense, pin-hole-free permeation barrier. Figure  3f ,g shows schemes portraying the specific differences between AZO and AZO/SnO x as EEL in devices exposed to air. As indicated before, the AZO layer prepared from the NP dispersion does not provide a significant diffusion barrier against the local ingress of moisture from the ambient air. As a result, decomposition of the MAPbI 3 perovskite occurs and yields iodine-based products that migrate to the surface. In the case of AZO/SnO x , substantially better moisture barrier properties prevent the penetration of water. The claim of superior moisture barrier properties of the bilayered AZO/SnO x EEL compared with that of the AZO NP layer is also supported by Ca-corrosion tests (Supplementary Fig.  6 ). It has to be noted that the detrimental effects of ambient air could in principle be avoided by using a proper encapsulation of the entire solar cell. However, the out-diffusion of decomposition products from the perovskite and the degradation of the metal electrode (Fig.  3c, d ) may impose a more fundamental issue. This is even more important, as earlier reports evidenced the thermally activated decomposition of the MAPbI 3 perovskite even under inert atmosphere  7  . Stability at elevated temperatures. To study the long-term stability of our solar cells under inert conditions, we have stored a set of devices in a glove box under N 2 atmosphere. All the devices were placed on a hot plate at 60 °C and their characteristics were measured repeatedly. Most remarkably, the characteristics of devices based on AZO EELs degraded on a timescale of 100 h (Fig.  4 ). Although the J sc and V oc of these devices remain fairly stable, the decay of the FF results in the severe drop of PCE to B2% after 360 h. The degradation motif in the AZO-based cells is essentially different from that found in ambient air, where all cell characteristics decayed within a day (Fig.  2 ). Again in striking contrast, the characteristics of devices based on the bilayered AZO/SnO x EEL remain almost unchanged even after 1,032 h. Note that the hysteresis did not increase in the course of ageing. To unravel the mechanisms behind these results, we have again performed XRD and XPS studies of the respective device structures. After heating the device stacks for 6 days under inert atmosphere, the XRD spectrum of the AZO samples reveals a significant signal due to PbI 2 that is absent in pristine stacks (Fig.  5a ). The formation of PbI 2 indicates the thermally activated decomposition of the perovskite upon heating, in agreement with earlier reports  7  . Opposed to that, the devices based on the bilayered AZO/SnO x EEL do not show any signature of a PbI 2 phase after identical ageing conditions (Fig.  5b ). The formation of PbI 2 in the AZO samples is in contrast to the degradation experiments in air, where no PbI 2 phase in the AZO samples was found in XRD (Fig.  3a ). At the same time, the I3d 5/2 XPS spectra (Fig.  5c ) do not reveal any significant increase of the amount of iodine at the surface of any of the samples aged in N 2 . Please note that the noise in the XPS spectra indicates that the concentration of I3d 5/2 at the surface of all the samples is close to the detection limit and variations between the samples are within the measurement error. A plan-view SEM image of the aged AZO samples does not reveal any degradation of the Ag electrode, in contrast to the experiment where the ageing took place in air (Fig.  3c, d ). Thus, we conclude that in the case of AZO, volatile decomposition products of the MAPbI 3 perovskite evaporate from the cell stack without degradation of the Ag electrode. In air, other than in N 2 , the presence of water would promote the corrosion of Ag because of CH 3 NH 3 I and other halide compounds  10  . However, the loss of CH 3 NH 3 I etc. drives the further decomposition of the perovskite. 
 Discussion Taken together, the device characteristics (Fig.  4 ) and the XRD and XPS spectroscopy point to a scheme of degradation as shown in Fig.  5e, f . Under inert atmosphere, the thermally activated degradation of the perovskite leads to decomposition products that can easily diffuse through the PCBM/AZO/Ag layers on top of the perovskite. The less volatile PbI 2 phase remains in the active layer leading to a substantial decay of the FF of the corresponding devices (Fig.  4c ). Moreover, it has been shown earlier that a change in film stoichiometry (Pb poor to Pb rich) may substantially alter the electronic properties of the perovskite and especially the position of the conduction and valence band with respect to the vacuum level  30  . Towards In this set of samples, the nominal thickness of the ALD SnO x layer was 20 nm and that of the Ag electrode was 100 nm. The characteristics have been determined from the J/V measurements in reverse direction (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). increasingly Pb-rich conditions, the ionization energy of the perovskite has been shown to increase significantly to values in excess of 6 eV that would render the extraction of holes more and more challenging. Opposed to the case of the AZO cells, the AZO/SnO x -based cells do not show any formation of PbI 2 under otherwise identical conditions. We therefore conclude that the decomposition products are contained inside the cell stack because of the dense SnO x layer forming a permeation barrier. Thereby, the equilibrium of the decomposition/formation reaction would be shifted to stabilize the perovskite. Thus, the decomposition of the MAPbI 3 obviously is significantly slowed down, and the cells do not show significant degradation even after heating for 41,000 h (Fig.  4 ). It has to be noted that it is favourable to position the permeation barrier between the perovskite and the Ag electrode, as thereby the known long-term corrosive effect of residual halide components on the Ag electrode  31  and on the interface EEL/Ag can be efficiently suppressed. In further work, this concept could even be extended to a setup, in which the perovskite layer is sandwiched between diffusion barriers at the cathode and anode side, in case permeable substrates like polymer foils are used. For example, there are reports on using ALD to prepare V 2 O 5 layers 32 . V 2 O 5 is a high work function transition metal oxide that has successfully been used for hole extraction in organic and perovskite solar cells  [33] [34] [35] [36]  . ALD prepared V 2 O 5 would presumably provide similar gas permeation barrier properties as those shown for the SnO x . Thereby, the intrinsic decomposition of the perovskite active layers would be substantially delayed or even prevented as volatile decomposition products would be hindered from evaporating. Aside from the so-called mono-stress conditions like elevated temperature, multi-stressing can be considered. To this end, we conducted set of long-term light soaking tests at 60 °C under N 2 , in which the devices were simultaneously illuminated with a white light-emitting diode (LED) to achieve the same J sc as upon AM1.5G solar irradiation (for details see the Methods section). The results of this multi-stress experiment are shown in the Supplementary Fig.  8 . Briefly, again the AZO/SnO x cells are substantially more stable than the AZO cells under concomitant heat and illumination. This difference is in part because of the suppressed decomposition of the perovskite owing to heat in case of the AZO/SnO x (in agreement with the discussion of Fig.  4 ). However, there is a clear degradation even of the AZO/SnO x samples where the PCE decays to roughly 60% of its initial value after 300 h. This is in contrast to the case where only thermal stress has been used. Earlier work has unravelled the photo-induced degradation of solar cells based on MAPbI 3 . Whereas Misra et al.  37  identified a photoactivated decomposition mechanism, more recently Nie et al.  38  reported that continuous illumination of MAPbI 3 caused the formation of trap states that spoiled the solar cell performance, especially J sc . Although our sealing approach based on the impermeable AZO/SnO x electron extraction layer has been shown to efficiently suppress the decomposition of the perovskite, it cannot suppress the formation of trap states in the perovskite. Similar to the report of Nie et al.  38  the cell characteristics recover after stressing, if the cells are kept in darkness (Supplementary Fig.  8f ). This is why we conclude that photo-induced trap-state formation occurs in our cells. However, there have been recent reports confirming that photo-induced degradation is not a general problem of organolead halide perovskites, and some optimized mixed cation/ mixed halide perovskite active materials were shown to be far less prone to light soaking degradation  24, 39  . Heat was found to be a dominating source of degradation in these mixed cation perovskite cells  40  . Note that our inverted device structure based on the impermeable AZO/SnO x electron extraction layer is generally applicable and can also accommodate these nextgeneration perovskite photoactive systems with enhanced stability and efficiency  41  . In summary, we have shown an ultra-stable inverted cell architecture, where a bilayered AZO/SnO x EEL has been demonstrated to afford perovskite solar cells with a remarkable resilience. The 20 nm thin ALD grown SnO x has been evidenced to form an outstandingly dense gas permeation barrier that effectively hinders the ingress of moisture towards the perovskite and-more importantly-it prevents the egress of decomposition products like CH 3 NH 3 I, HI out of the perovskite. Although the efficiency of cells based on LiF/Al or AZO degraded to o50% of the initial value within less than a day in ambient air, devices based on AZO/SnO x showed superior stability of their solar cell characteristics even on a timescale of 4350 h. Under inert atmosphere, AZO-based devices degraded to roughly 50% of its initial efficiency within 100 h because of thermally induced decomposition of the perovskite. On the contrary, the suppressed out-diffusion of decomposition products because of the diffusion-barrier properties of the AZO/SnO x EEL has been shown to significantly slow down the thermally activated decomposition of the perovskite. This afforded cells that did not change even after 41,000 h. The concept of impermeable EELs is generally applicable and therefore is expected to provide an avenue to achieve a substantially improved device lifetime of solar cells based on organometal halide perovskites even beyond MAPbI 3 . 
 Methods Material synthesis and device preparation. The inverted perovskite solar cells studied in this work are based on the following layer sequence: glass/ITO/ PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/EEL/Ag (see Fig.  1a ). The PEDOT layer (AI4083) has been spin coated in ambient air and dried on a hot plate at 120 °C for 20 min in air and for another 20 min in a glove box under N 2 atmosphere. The perovskite layer has been spin coated under inert atmosphere from a commercially available precursor solution (Ossila) and the resulting layers were thermally annealed at 100 °C for 80 min. The typical layer thickness was 180 nm. On top of the perovskite, PCBM (American Dye Sorce Inc., ADS61BFA) was spin coated from a solution in chlorobenzene (concentration: 100 mg ml À 1 ). AZO has been deposited from a commercial nanoparticle dispersion (2.5 wt% in isopropanol, Prod. No. 8045, Nanograde AG, Switzerland). Tin oxide has been prepared by atomic layer deposition in a Beneq TFS 200 system (base pressure 1.5 mbar). As precursors, tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin(IV) (TDMASn), kept at 45 °C and water, kept at room temperature, were used. At a substrate temperature of 80 °C the growth rate per cycle was 1.1 Å. Further details on the materials properties of the SnO x can be found in our earlier work  23, 27  . Ag (100 or 10 nm) layers were thermally evaporated in high vacuum (10 À 7 mbar). In some reference devices, LiF (1 nm) and Al (100 nm) have been thermally evaporated as cathode. Materials and device characterization. The electrical conductivity was measured with the Van der Pauw method. The SEM studies were conducted using Neon 40 (Zeiss). XRD was measured using a monochromatic Cu-Ka 1,2 source (Philips X'Pert Pro MPD). XPS has been performed using a non-monochromatic Mg K a X-ray source (VG) and a Phoibos 100 (Specs) electron analyser. Rutherford backscattering was measured at RUBION (University of Bochum, Germany) using a dynamitron tandem accelerator with 2 MeV 4 He þ beam (beam current of 20-40 nA). A silicon surface barrier detector was placed at an angle of 160°with respect to the beam axis. The solid angle of the detector was 1.91 msrad. The solar cells were characterized in ambient air without encapsulation using a Keithley 2400-C source meter and a solar simulator (300 W Newport, model 91160, AM1.5G, 100 mW cm À 2 ). We used a commercial Si reference cell (Rera Systems) that is IEC 60904-9 compliant and certified. Short circuit current was obtained from the EQE data. EQE has been measured with a home-built tunable light source, calibrated with a power meter (Thorlabs). The spectral mismatch factor was 1.163. Some of the devices have been kept in a glovebox under N 2 atmosphere on a hot plate at 60 °C. The J/V characteristics were measured in forward and reverse direction at a scanning speed of 500 mV s À 1 . Cells were measured using a mask with round aperture of 1.5 mm diameter. Stabilized current was measured in the same J/V setup using a voltage source. Long-term light soaking tests at 60 °C under N 2 were conducted by simultaneously illuminating the cells with a white LED to achieve the same J sc as upon AM1.5G solar irradiation. The LED spectrum is shown in the Supplementary Fig.  8e . The cells were mounted in a home-built oven inside a glove box. They were kept in short circuit conditions during the ageing experiment. Figure 3 : 4 . 34 Logarithmic representation of the XRD spectrum of a fresh perovskite cell based on AZO as EEL with an assignment of the peaks to layers in the device. The peak positions of MAPbI 3 (ref. 2), PbI 2 (ref. 3), ITO (ref. 4), and Ag (ref. 5), were taken from the respective references. The survey XPS spectra for cells based on AZO, SnO x and bi-layered AZO/SnO x EELs, are shown in Supplementary Fig. As expected, no signal due to the perovskite (e.g. Pb4d) can be detected, because the perovskite in these samples is covered by PCBM/AZO/Ag, or PCBM/SnO x /Ag, or PCBM/AZO/SnO x , respectively. Note, the position where the Pb4f signals would be located is overlaid by Zn3s and Sn4s signals as indicated in the figure, thus we refer to the Pb4d signal. Supplementary Figure 4: Survey photoemission spectra. Spectra for cells based on AZO (fresh sample (blue), aged sample (green)), SnO x (fresh sample (red), aged sample (orange))and bi-layered AZO/SnO x (fresh sample (black), aged sample (grey)) EELs are shown, respectively. Samples were either fresh or aged for two days in air, respectively. The top Ag layer was only about 10 nm to see the metal-oxide underneath. The spectral region, where the signals due to electrons resulting from the respective atomic orbitals are found or expected are shaded in grey and labelled with the element and atomic orbital. The spectral region where the Pb4d signal would be expected is shaded on orange. Supplementary Figure 5: Stability of devices based on only SnO x as EEL.

Temporal and spatial pinhole constraints in smallmolecule hole transport layers for stable and efficient perovskite photovoltaics †
Small molecules, such as Spiro-OMeTAD, are widely used in photovoltaic devices including perovskite and dye-sensitized solar cells due to their excellent hole transport properties. However, this kind of small molecule is often used with hygroscopic additives and dopants suffering from aggregation and demixing under environmental stress and thus leading to pinholes/voids in the resultant films. By using typical molecular Spiro-OMeTAD as an example, we herein introduced a hydrophobic polymeric poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) component to substantially reduce the undesired pinholes during device fabrication and operation. It leads to a significant improvement of the long-term stability of devices, which kept 80% of their original PCE for over 6000 h in ambient air and the promotion of light stability. In addition, P4VP can saturate uncoordinated Pb sites in perovskite crystals, resulting in improved device performance (certified PCE of 20.6%) with negligible hysteresis. These results emphasize the effects of pinhole constraints in both the temporal and spatial perspectives, which provides a feasible approach to improve the stability of smallmolecule-based hole transport materials for perovskite solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.
Introduction Organic-inorganic halide perovskites have attracted tremendous attention in the photovoltaic eld due to their excellent optoelectronic properties including a high absorption coefficient, 1,2 long charge carrier lifetime,  3, 4  low trap density, 5 lowcost fabrication  6  and so on. With the continuous efforts from all over the world, the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have increased dramatically from 3.8% to a certied 23.7%.  2, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]  Among all architectures, particularly regular (n-i-p) structured PSCs were extensively developed due to their simple fabrication and high efficiency.  [13] [14] [15]  A great deal of effort has been devoted into the exploration of ideal hole transport layer (HTL) materials, including polymers, small molecules, and inorganic species. Inorganic HTLs, mainly represented by CuI,  16  CuSCN 17 and NiO,  18  possess the advantages of both high mobility and low cost. However, it is difficult to deposit these inorganic HTLs on the top of perovskite materials without their damage and interaction, as the corresponding fabrication processes are mostly incompatible with the absorber underneath.  19  Polymeric materials such as commercial PTAA  [20] [21] [22]  and P3HT  [23] [24] [25]  can be well deposited on the perovskite layer. Due to their relatively low conductivity and consequently ultra-small thickness, they require perovskite lms with great wettability, which makes the resulting solar cells rarely achieve a similar reproducibility level to that of the state-of-the-art device.  26  Small molecules are another class of HTLs that have been successfully used in perovskite solar cells due to their excellent photoelectric properties and the ease of processing. However, as an interlayer between the perovskite and electrode, these small molecules are not only required to transport holes but also are desired to be dense enough to retard the invasion of ambient small molecules (especially H 2 O and O 2 ), as well as ion diffusion between the perovskite components and electrode, which are crucial to efficient and stable PSCs. Among small-molecule organic HTLs, Spiro-OMeTAD (Spiro) represents the most superb HTL because of its suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and excellent hole-extraction and transportation abilities.  27  Most of the stateof-art PSC devices are designed by using Spiro as the HTL.  11  However, as a small molecule, it is hard for Spiro to form pinhole free and uniform thin lms during spin coating due to its amorphous nature and the immiscibility of the Li-TFSI. The presence of pinholes largely deteriorates the optoelectronic properties and long-term stability of the resulting device. In addition, the conductivity of Spiro fails to meet the requirement for high performance devices. Therefore, most of the studies adopted a certain amount of Li-TFSI and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) as effective additives/dopants 28 into Spiro to improve its conductivity. Unfortunately, these additives are highly hygroscopic, and can adsorb ambient moisture to segregate in the Spiro lm, which results in extra pinholes in the doped lm. These pinholes may allow small molecular species (such as H 2 O and O 2 ) in ambient air to invade the entire device, which leads to further degradation of PSCs. Meanwhile, the volatile species in the perovskite lm such as CH 3 NH 2 and HI could easily diffuse out via the pinholes to interact with electrodes,  29  leading to the formation of metal halides that corrode the electrodes.  30  In view of the disadvantages of Spiro, some reports have accordingly prepared pinhole-free Spiro by changing the solvent from the commonly used chlorobenzene to chloroform,  29, 31  or deposited Spiro lms via vacuum evaporation, to improve the long-term stability of related devices.  32  These methods only work with Spiro lms without additives, while for lms with additives, a large number of pinholes are generated due to water adsorption and accumulation during device operation, inducing further degradation. Therefore, preventing pinhole formation in Spiro layers under outdoor operating conditions is a key challenge to achieve long-term stable PSCs based on small-molecule HTLs. Here, by using Spiro as an example, we rst proposed a simple approach to greatly improve the lm quality of small molecule HTLs and the resulting long-term stability of the device. By introducing a long chain hydrophobic polymer poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) into the Spiro precursor solution, we successfully smoothed, strengthened and reduced the pinholes in the as-deposited HTL during the lm deposition. Meanwhile, the pinhole formation caused by the water absorption of additives during device storage in high humidity was effectively suppressed, as is clearly revealed by in situ optical microscopy measurement. Non-encapsulated P4VP modied PSCs exhibit better long-term stability in ambient air (about 25-50% relative humidity) and retain 80% of their original PCE for over 6000 h storage. In addition, the efficiency of the PSC based on P4VP was elevated to be 20.6% (certied) with negligible hysteresis, since P4VP can effectively passivate the under-coordinated Pb in the perovskite lms. These ndings highlight the effective HTL modication by suitable molecules for both better long-term stability and improved photovoltaic performance of PSCs. 
 Results and discussion To reduce the number of pinholes during small-molecule-based HTL formation using Spiro-OMeTAD, it is preferable to apply materials with excellent lm-forming capability which are hydrophobic and miscible with Spiro. To this end, a ""so"" polymer with a long carbon chain such as P4VP becomes an ideal candidate. The chemical structure of commercially available P4VP is shown in Fig.  S1 . † We use P4VP as an example to investigate the compatibility between the small molecule and polymer for highly efficient perovskite solar cells with improved stability. For convenience, we denote the reference (Spiro doped with Li-TFSI and TBP) as Spiro and the target sample (Li-TFSI and TBP doped Spiro modied with P4VP) as Spiro:P4VP. As a small molecule, Spiro is prone to easily form a certain number of pinholes during lm deposition by the spin-coating method.  29, 31  We observed similar results by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig.  1a ) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig.  1c ). Such pinholes dramatically reduce the quality of the HTL lm, further deteriorating the corresponding photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs. Surprisingly, by introducing an optimal amount of P4VP (1 mg mL À1 ), we successfully reduced the pinholes in the HTL lm (Spiro:P4VP) compared to the pristine Spiro lm, as shown in Fig.  1b  and d . In addition, the obvious surface roughness caused by such pinholes existing in Spiro is largely reduced by P4VP, as shown in Fig.  1c  and d , indicative of a dense and uniform HTL lm. The root mean square roughness (RMS) for Spiro and Spiro:P4VP samples was measured to be 66 nm and 36 nm, respectively (Fig.  S2 † ). In consideration of the ""so"" characteristics of P4VP , which is easy to be cast into lms, it is reasonable to expect that these polymers help to reduce such pinholes occurred in the Spiro layer. In addition to the pinhole formation when depositing the small molecule, extra pinholes developed because the Li-TFSI serves as a moisture adsorption center. Prevention of the possible moisture effects for PSCs is a key issue, and protects both the perovskite layer and carrier transport layer simultaneously. The molecules with a hydrophobic long alkyl group generally have lower wettability with water. Accordingly, we measured the contact angle of water on the top of the Spiro lm and Spiro:P4VP lm. The obtained value is 44 for Spiro and 91 for Spiro:P4VP lm, respectively, as shown in Fig.  1e  and f . This implies that the P4VP modied HTL has superior hydrophobicity, which might better protect the perovskite and carrier transport lm from water invasion. Actually the invasion process of water into Li-TFSI doped Spiro lms is an adhesion process that involves three phases e.g. liquid, gas, and solid. Assuming a unit area at the interface of each phase, the change of Gibbs free energy during the process is as follows: DG ¼ g l-s À g l-g À g s-g (1) where g l-s , g l-g , and g s-g are the surface energies of liquid-solid, liquid-gas and solid-gas. Among all surface energies, g l-g can be directly measured through experiment and the value for water at room temperature is 0.072 N m À1 . According to Young's wetting formula, g s-g ¼ g l-s + g l-g cos q (2) where q is the contact angle that can be deduced using DG ¼ Àg g-l (1 + cos q) (3) According to formula (3) we calculate DG for the Spiro lm and Spiro:P4VP lm to be À0.124 and À0.071 J m À2 , respectively. The Spiro lm exhibits lower DG upon P4VP addition (Fig.  1g ), which indicates that the water adhesion process is less favored from a thermodynamic point of view. It is further inferred that the P4VP modied Spiro lm potentially improves the long term stability of the resultant devices, which is shown in the following part. Accordingly, the in situ morphology evolution of the Spiro lm and Spiro:P4VP lm was characterized to gain further insight into the differences of the pinhole formation processes under moist conditions (80% relative humidity). In order to control humidity during the in situ evolution of the optical microscopy test, we set up a small humidier and a hygrometer to precisely control the humidity when testing the sample. It has also been proved that the deviation of humidity in this case is less than 3%. As shown in Fig.  2a  and e, we selected the regions (0.20 Â 0.25 mm 2 ) of Spiro and P4VP modied Spiro lms before testing in a humid environment. It is observed that some pinholes were witnessed in the Spiro based lm, but were absent in the P4VP modied lm. With the prolongation of exposure time in the humid environment, we could observe that the pinholes in the Spiro lm (Fig.  2a-d ) were increased dramatically. By comparison, the introduction of P4VP into the Spiro lm leads to a signicantly reduced number of pinholes in the case of high humidity (Fig.  2e-h ). We calculated the number of pinholes in Spiro and Spiro:P4VP samples as a function of time, as shown in Fig.  2i . The signicant difference between the two lms indicates that P4VP is an effective polymer to prevent pinhole formation in the HTL in humidity. Therefore, through the P4VP molecule modication, it not only lls up the pinholes in small molecule during its fabrication, but also prevents extra void formation due to hydrophilic Li-TFSI, which complies well with the results of contact angle measurements. Combined with the in situ observation from optical microscopy images and hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics of the P4VP component, the expected functionality of Spiro:P4VP hole transport materials is shown in Fig.  2j . On one hand, hygroscopic Li-TFSI is much easier to adsorb surrounding water and thus produces extra pinholes. On the other hand, such pinholes existing in Spiro may provide more diffusion pathways for undesired ions, thereby causing further degradation of the entire solar cell. The presence of P4VP improves the mechanical properties of the whole layer due to elimination of pin holes, which helps to prevent the diffusion of small molecules (such as H 2 O and O 2 from surroundings and CH 3 NH 2 and HI from the perovskite lm), and thus offers an efficient method to enhance the long-term stability of Spiro based PSCs. The photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs based on Spiro:P4VP were evaluated, and the Spiro based cells are used as a reference. As shown in Fig.  S3 , † the devices based on Spiro:P4VP achieved an average PCE of 20.16%, which is higher than that of the Spiro-based cells (19.11%). The enhancement of the PCE is mainly associated with the signicant improvement in the open-circuit photovoltage (V oc ) and ll factor (FF). Fig.  3a  Fig.  3   shows the best Spiro:P4VP based device which produces a PCE of 20.84%, with a V oc of 1.129 V, a J sc of 23.49 mA cm À2 , and a FF of 78.57%. The forward and reverse scanning current densityvoltage (J-V) curves showed reduced hysteresis in the resultant device compared to the reference. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table  1 . By holding a bias near the maximum power output point, we obtained a stabilized efficiency of 19.31% for Spiro based and 20.34% for Spiro:P4VP based PSCs, respectively (Fig.  3b ). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the two devices exhibit almost the same shape over the entire absorption wavelength range (Fig.  3c ). The integrated photocurrent densities are also close to each other, indicating that P4VP has no obvious effect on the spectral response of the PSC devices. In addition, the best P4VP modi-ed device was sent to the National Institute of Metrology, China (NIM, China) for certication, which conrmed a PCE of 20.6% under AM 1.5 G full-sun illumination (1000 W m À2 ) by reverse scan (1.2 to À0.1 V) and 19.8% under forward scan (À0.1 to 1.2 V), with a slow scan rate (33 mV s À1 ). The measurement details and results are shown in Fig.  S4 . † This certied efficiency also agrees well with our internal measurement results. To gain insight into the improvement of the V oc and the reduced hysteresis in the Spiro:P4VP based device, we fabricated hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVSK/Spiro or Spiro:P4VP/Au) to measure the trap-state density and the hole mobility in the full device. Fig.  3d  shows the dark state I-V curves of these two devices. The linear relationship indicates an ""ohmic region"" response of the hole-only device at low bias voltage. With the bias voltage increasing, the current quickly increases nonlinearly, demonstrating that the trap-states begin to be lled until the trap-lled limit is achieved. The trap-lled limit voltage (V TFL ) of the perovskite lms covered with Spiro and Spiro:P4VP is 0.98 and 0.64 V, respectively. Then the trapstate density can be determined from the V TFL using the equation: V TFL ¼ qn trap L 2 233 0 , where q is the elementary charge of the electron, L is the perovskite lm thickness, and 3 and 3 0 are the relative dielectric constant and the vacuum permittivity. Therefore, the hole trap-state density of the Spiro based perovskite is 9.64 Â 10 15 cm À3 , in good agreement with previous reports,  33  while this value is reduced to 6.29 Â 10 15 cm À3 for the Spiro:P4VP based perovskite, indicating that the lm quality is much improved. At a high bias voltage the current shows a linear relationship with the square of the voltage (I f V 2 ). We thus obtain carrier mobility from the Mott-Gurney law:  34  the mobilities (m) of the samples with and without P4VP modication are calculated to be 0.18 cm 2 V À1 s À1 and 0.17 cm 2 V À1 s À1 , respectively. The enhancement of hole mobility and the reduction of defect state density in the perovskite lm improve the resulting optoelectronic properties of the devices. This is also consistent with the reduced photoluminescence (PL) spectral response and shorter lifetime obtained by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement (Fig.  S5 , S6, Table  S1  †). The increase in carrier mobility and the decrease in the density of defects are likely attributed to the lone pair electrons of nitrogen which may coordinate with dangling lead atoms near the perovskite/HTL interface, passivating positive under-coordinated Pb defects and inhibiting the recombination of carriers.  35, 36  In order to provide more direct evidence regarding the Pb coordination situation, we conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement. As shown in Fig.  S7 , † the binding energy with respect to 4f 7/2 of divalent Pb 2+ in the reference (bare perovskite lm) and the sample covered with P4VP was measured to be 138.9 eV and 138.6 eV, respectively. Compared with the pristine perovskite lm, the binding energies of Pb valence electrons exhibit a slight shi toward lower values when treated with P4VP. It is reported that species with lone pair electrons of the pyridine group in P4VP can form coordination bonds when interacting with undercoordinated Pb atoms, which decreases the binding energy of Pb 4f orbitals. This thus indicates that P4VP plays an important role in defect passivation, which is in line with previous reports.  37  Additionally, to further understand the charge carrier dynamics in the PSCs, we performed a transient photovoltage (TPV) measurement which is related to charge carrier recombination and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurement which is related to charge carrier transportation. These tests have proven to be effective and have been extensively applied to Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 solar cells  38  and PSCs.  15, 39  According to Fig.  3e , we found that the Spiro:P4VP based cell had a longer photovoltage decay time than that of the Spiro based device (the values are 0.70 ms and 0.51 ms, respectively, in Table  S2  †), which implied that the introduction of P4VP reduced the PVSK/HTL interfacial defects and thus decreased the charge carrier recombination rate consistent with published literature results.  36, 37  As shown in Fig.  3f , the devices modied with PV4P exhibited faster photocurrent decay (220 ns) than that of Spiro based devices (310 ns), which further conrmed that the carrier transport in the devices was improved by P4VP modication. Fig.  3g  shows Nyquist plots of the solar cells tested in the dark with applied bias. From the two separate arcs and the corresponding equivalent circuit, we could derive the recombination resistance (R rec ) at low frequency and the contact resistance (R co ) at high frequency. Obviously, the Spiro:P4VP based device has a larger value of R rec (about 50.3 kU) than the Spiro based cell (about 44.7 kU). The larger R rec could effectively suppress the charge recombination, to improve the device performance. With respect to R co , it was observed that the Spiro:P4VP based device has a smaller value than the Spiro based cell. This result revealed that the Spiro:P4VP based cell has more efficient hole transportation within the entire device. To further study the recombination kinetics, we measured the J sc and V oc of the cells at various light intensities from 105 mW cm À2 to 34 mW cm À2 . Fig.  3h  shows a linear relationship between J sc and light intensity. Specically, the Spiro and Spiro:P4VP based devices show a slope of 0.98 and 0.99, respectively. Both slopes are essentially equal to 1 (the cell with Spiro:P4VP is closer), indicating that there are no signicant energy barriers and space charge limits for the charge extraction process in the two devices.  40  Fig.  3i  shows that V oc varies logarithmically (ln(I)) with light intensity, and the slopes for the Spiro and Spiro:P4VP based devices are 1.61kT/q and 1.57kT/q, respectively. Generally, the corresponding charge carrier recombination process is reected by the value of ideality factor (n), which is determined by the slope of the V oc versus incident light intensity J D ¼ 933 0 mV 2 8L 3 ; V oc ¼ E g À nk B T ln J 0 =J q , where q is the elementary charge, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. It is known that the ideality factor n approaching 2 reects the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) type trapassisted recombination. Therefore the solar cells based on Spiro:P4VP possess reduced trap state density, resulting in suppressed J-V hysteresis and improved device efficiency. Then we tracked the stability of the PSC devices. In order to reduce the deviation caused by the small number of samples, 10 devices were measured in each group, which is considered of statistical signicance. The normalized PCE as a function of the storage time in air environment (relative humidity: 25-50%, temperature: 25-40 C) is shown in Fig.  4a . The unencapsulated Spiro:P4VP cells retain 80% of their original PCE (the average value is 19.02%) for over 6000 h storage in ambient air, which is comparable with other reports (Fig.  S8 † ). This means that the modication of HTL lm quality and hydrophobicity by introducing P4VP plays an important role in the long-term stability of the device. We further explored the illumination stability and thermal stability of these devices. Fig.  4b  reveals the device performance evolution upon continuous 1 sun illumination. When P4VP was employed in the Spiro, the device retained 90% of its original PCE aer about 700 h (while that of the device based on Spiro under the same illumination conditions dropped to 80% aer 550 h). In addition, with respect to thermal stability, several previous studies reported that small molecule Spiro-OMeTAD would form pinholes under thermal conditions due to its low glass transition temperature, which increased the contact between the perovskite and electrodes and further induced the device performance degradation.  41  However, by modifying the Spiro lm with P4VP we obtained an impressive result: 80% of the original PCE was maintained under continuous 85 C heating aer 300 h (that of the device based on Spiro under thermal conditions drops to 80% aer 50 h). All of these stability tests demonstrate that the decrease of pinholes by P4VP inhibits the pinhole formation, due to the hydrophobic carbon chain and its so characteristics, which effectively suppress the lm degradation and lead to a better device stability. In order to explore the underlying mechanism of stability improvement, we performed high angle annular dark eld scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy measurements on the devices. The spatial distribution of Ag in the aged devices, including Spiro and Spiro:P4VP, is shown in Fig.  5 . The thickness of the perovskite containing Pb and I (mainly) elements, HTL and Ag electrode was about 500, 200 and 100 nm respectively. Apparently, for the Spiro based devices (Fig.  5a ), substantial Ag signals were observed to penetrate through the entire device layer aer 30 days of aging in a humid environment. However, in the sample with Spiro:P4VP, the Ag signals were only observed in the original layer without apparent diffusion (Fig.  5e ). This suggests that P4VP modied Spiro effectively inhibits the diffusion of Ag ions. The reason is obvious that the P4VP was used early as a selective ion-exchange and chelate-forming resin which can achieve optimum sorption of metal ions via coordinating with pyridine groups.  42  Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that P4VP can also inhibit the penetration of Ag ions through chelation and coordination since it contains pyridine nitrogen which is known as an excellent ligand for silver ions. This also explains why P4VP can prevent Ag ions from spreading. In addition to the suppression of Ag diffusion, we also found that Spiro:P4VP could suppress the diffusion of iodine ions. It is reported that when compared to inert nitrogen, ambient air easily accelerates the corrosion of Ag electrodes, and factually this means that oxygen from air oxidizes HI into water and iodine and the iodine and metallic silver form AgI easily, where methyl ammonium iodide migration is facilitated by the small pinholes in the hole transport layer Spiro-MeOTAD.  29  The formation of silver iodide signicantly increased the series resistance and J-V hysteresis of the corresponding devices. Moreover, the inter-diffusion of ions further accelerates the degradation of the device which is unfavorable to long-term stability.  43  The device based on Spiro:P4VP effectively reduces the pinhole of the HTL, thus inhibiting the diffusion of Ag and I ions, improving the device optoelectronic performance and long-term stability. 
 Conclusion In summary, we have developed a general pinhole suppression method to improve the stability of small-molecule-based HTLs in perovskite solar cells. It successfully reduces the intrinsic pinholes of Spiro during lm fabrication and suppresses the void formation during long-term exposure to humid air. The improvement of device stability is ascribed to the pinhole constraint in both temporal and spatial perspectives. P4VP modied PSCs exhibited excellent stability and can endure more than 6000 h in ambient air (still keeping 80% of their original PCE) without any encapsulation. This is partially attributed to the successful suppression of iodine migration and silver diffusion. Moreover, aer using P4VP, we obtained a certied PCE of 20.6% in the resulting device. These ndings provide a new approach to the fabrication of pinhole free HTLs for efficient perovskite solar cells with improved stability. 
 Experimental section 
 Materials All reagents were used as received without further purication, including PbI 2 (99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich), CsI (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), P4VP (AR 98%, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), Spiro-OMeTAD (Lumtec), SnO 2 colloid precursor (Alfa Aesar, tin(IV) oxide, 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion), N,N-dimethylformamide (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), dimethyl sulfoxide (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), isopropanol (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), chlorobenzene (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), acetone (AR Beijing Chemical Works), ethanol (AR Beijing Chemical Works), aminomethane (CP Beijing Chemical Works), hydrogen iodide (57%, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), 4-tert-butylpyridine (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), acetonitrile (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) and ITO substrate (Shanghai B-Tree Tech. Consult.). The methylamine iodide (CH 3 NH 3 I), formamidine iodide (HC(NH 2 ) 2 I), methylamine chlorine (CH 3 NH 3 Cl) and methylamine bromine (CH 3 NH 3 Br) were synthesized using the methods reported everywhere. 
 Device fabrication The ITO substrate was sequentially cleaned with ultrapure water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol. Aer 45 minutes of UV-O 3 treatments, an 80 nm-thick layer of the SnO 2 lm was spin-coated on the substrate with a SnO 2 nanocrystal solution at 4000 rpm for 30 s two times, and then annealed at 150 C for 30 min in air. The standard perovskite lm was fabricated by a twostep solution process: PbI 2 (1.3 M, dissolved in DMF : DMSO (9 : 1, v:v)) mixed with 5% CsI was spin coated on ITO/SnO 2 at 2500 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 70 C for 1 min in a nitrogen glovebox. Aer cooling the PbI 2 coated substrate to room temperature in the nitrogen glovebox, mixed organic cation solution (MAI 0.12 M; MABr 0.05 M; MACl 0.07 M; FAI 0.23 M, dissolved in isopropanol) was spin-coated at 2300 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 150 C for 15 min in air. Then the HTM solution, a Spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (60 mg mL À1 ) solution with the addition of 28 mL Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (260 mg mL À1 ) and 24 mL 4-tert-butylpyridine, was deposited by spincoating at 3500 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the device was nished by thermal evaporation of Au (100 nm) under vacuum. For the P4VP doped perovskite lm we just dissolve P4VP with CB and lter, getting a clear solution, and use it as a solvent to dissolve Spiro-OMeTAD, and the content of P4VP is about 0.2 mg mL À1 . Other sections are all the same with the standard sample. 
 Characterization The morphology of Spiro-OMeTAD was determined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). Photoluminescence (PL) and transient-state photoluminescence (TRPL) were measured by using an FLS980 (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd) with an excitation at 470 nm. The TPV and TPC measurements were performed on a Molex 180081-4320 simulating one sun working conditions, and the carriers were excited by using a 532 nm pulse laser. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed by using an electrochemical workstation (Germany, Zahner Company), employing light emitting diodes driven by Export (Germany, Zahner Company). The current densityvoltage characteristics of the perovskite devices were obtained using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit under AM 1.5 G illumination at 1000 W m À2 with a Newport Thermal Oriel 91192 1000 W solar simulator. External quantum efficiencies were measured by using an Enli Technology (Taiwan) EQE measurement system. The high angle annular dark eld scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) measurement was performed by using a FEI Titan G2 microscope equipped with an aberration corrector for probe forming lens.

Engineering ligand reactivity enables high-temperature operation of stable perovskite solar cells
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) consisting of interfacial two-and three-dimensional heterostructures that incorporate ammonium ligand intercalation have enabled rapid progress toward the goal of uniting performance with stability. However, as the field continues to seek ever-higher durability, additional tools that avoid progressive ligand intercalation are needed to minimize degradation at high temperatures. We used ammonium ligands that are nonreactive with the bulk of perovskites and investigated a library that varies ligand molecular structure systematically. We found that fluorinated aniliniums offer interfacial passivation and simultaneously minimize reactivity with perovskites. Using this approach, we report a certified quasi-steady-state power-conversion efficiency of 24.09% for inverted-structure PSCs. In an encapsulated device operating at 85°C and 50% relative humidity, we document a 1560-hour T 85 at maximum power point under 1-sun illumination. 
 RESEARCH
M etal-halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are emerging photovoltaic (PV) technologies that hold promise in terawattscale deployment  (1) . They unite high power-conversion efficiencies (certified PCEs up to 25.7%)  (2)  with low-cost solution processing that uses abundant materials  (3) (4) (5) . To compete with crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells and to be applied with c-Si in tandem cells, PSCs will need improved evidence of bankability  (6) , such as operating stability at elevated temperatures in accelerated aging  (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Interfaces, which have high defect densities  (13, 14)  and low barriers to ion transfer  (15, 16)  and are susceptible to moisture-and oxygeninduced degradation  (17, 18) , can provide pathways for energy loss and degradation in PSCs  (19, 20) . In record-efficiency PSCs, interfaces have been passivated by using two-and threedimensional (2D/3D) hybrid structures  (21) (22) (23) , where a thin layer of Ruddlesden-Popper 2D perovskites terminates the 3D-perovskite surface. These 2D/3D structures are constructed by exposing perovskite surfaces to a solution containing ammonium ligands, during which the 3D lattice is fragmented into 2D layers  (24, 25) . This approach is beneficial because the 2D overlayer increases the resistance of perovskites to degradation  (17, 26) . There is a diversity of findings in reports on the stability of 2D overlayers under stress. Some studies have indicated limited stability of the 2D/3D interface under thermal stress  (27) (28) (29) . Progress has been made, with a recent study demonstrating 500-hour operating stability under conditions of 65°C, 50% relative humidity (RH), and maximum power point (MPP) tracking [International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS)-L-3-65°C], enhanced by the incorporation of 3-fluorophenethylammonium (3FPEA) intercalation  (23) . Another study  (30)  that used an oleylammonium-intercalated 2D overlayer showed promising results in a 1000-hour damp-heat test, although this study was based on silicon PV module IEC 61215:2016 standards (85°C and 85% RH, dark). Given these promising performance and stability improvements, the field continues to pursue ever-higher durability targets. There is interest in raising the standard to 85°C ISOS-L-3 (MPP tracking at 85°C and 50% RH). However, the reactivity of ammonium ligands with 3D perovskites may lead to further penetration into the bulk perovskite film  (28, 31, 32)  and may contribute to deterioration in device performance under these very demanding stress conditions  (27, 28, (31) (32) (33) . Thus, we explored noninvasive surface-passivating ligands, but we did note that in prior studies, these have yet to achieve the remarkable benefits of the 2D/3D strategy. We sought to understand how molecular structure affects ligand reactivity with 3D perovskites. Previous studies used bulkier ammonium ligands to suppress ligand intercalation, whereas certain small-sized ammonium ligands exhibit low reactivity  (34, 35) . We attribute this difference to the limited availability of characterization techniques that allow one to compare ligand reactivity among different ammonium molecules-a particularly challenging pursuit in view of the ultrathin nature (typically <10 nm) of the passivating overlayer  (23) . 
 Spectroscopy studies of ammonium ligands in perovskites We used angle-resolved x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AR-XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) to investigate the penetration of a library of ammonium ligands into the bulk of perovskites (Fig.  1A ), which include varying tail groups and alkyl chain lengths. A small-sized ammonium ligand, anilinium (An), had the lowest reactivity with 3D perovskites. We then explored derivatives of An with different degrees of fluorination to couple low ligand reactivity with effectual interfacial passivation. These molecules improved operating stability for the encapsulated PSC at 85°C and 50% RH. Ammonium ligands were deposited on Cs 0.05 MA 0.05 FA 0.9 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 perovskite films (materials and methods), and films were annealed at 100°C  (31) . We used AR-XPS to probe the spatial distribution of ammonium ligands in the out-of-plane direction (Fig.  1B ). AR-XPS is a nondestructive depth-profiling technique used to determine the composition of ultrathin layers (<10 nm) at the top surfaces of films  (36, 37) . We varied the probe depth by changing the angle between the normal of the perovskite sample and the analyzer. Three different electron takeoff angles (0°, 45°, and 75°) were selected, with probe depths varying from ~6 to 8 nm at 0°to ~1 to 2 nm at 75°(Fig.  1C ). To obtain the proportion of ammonium ligands at a given probe depth, we compared the ratio of C-N, where N signals originated from methylammonium (MA) and ammonium ligands at a binding energy of ~401.5 eV, with the N signals originating from formamidinium (FA) at a binding energy of ~399.8 eV in the peak area in the N 1s XPS spectrum (figs. S1 and S2). The C-N/FA N ratio plots (Fig.  1D ) revealed that the aryl ammoniums phenethylammonium (PEA) and 3FPEA had relatively uniform depth distributions. By contrast, alkyl ammoniums butylammonium (BA) and octylammonium (OA) tended to accumulate on the top surfaces, as evidenced by the C-N/FA N ratio increasing with larger electron takeoff angles. However, each of the ligands yielded C-N/FA N ratios greater than those of untreated perovskites (control) for all electron takeoff angles (Fig.  1E ), indicating their distinct contributions to C-N signals and their intercalation into the bulk of perovskites. We then examined long-chain alkyl ammonium decylammonium (DA), along with smallsized An  (34, 35, 38) . For DA, the C-N/FA N ratio decreased with a larger electron takeoff angle (Fig.  1D ). The reversed trend, as compared with other alkyl ammoniums, suggested that DA molecules diffused into the bulk of perovskites. By contrast, An exhibited low reactivity and had limited penetration into perovskites. The C-N/FA N ratios for An were a factor of ~2 less than those for PEA at different electron takeoff angles and are similar to control perovskites (Fig.  1E ). At these low C-N/FA N ratios, quantifying the extent of ligand penetration was difficult, given the prominent C-N contribution from MA cations (fig.  S2  and table  S1 ). We thereby performed TOF-SIMS and found that, whereas PEA cations were distributed throughout the thickness of the perovskite film, An cations were detected only at the top surface of the film (fig.  S3 ). The combination of AR-XPS and TOF-SIMS supported An remaining surface localized. Although An exhibited low ligand reactivity, it has also been reported to have limited passivating capacity  (35, 39) . To promote interfacial passivation, we explored fluorinated An, including 4-fluoroanilinium (4FAn), 2,6-difluoroanilinium (26FAn), and 3,4,5-trifluoroanilinium (345FAn), as well as tert-butyl-substituted 3,5-di-tertbutylanilinium (35tbuAn)  (17, 40, 41) . The C-N/ FA N ratios (Fig.  1E ) revealed that, compared with An, the newly synthesized ligands retained similarly low reactivity with perovskites. For fluorinated An, this low reactivity was also seen in the C-F signal in the F 1s XPS spectrum (fig.  S4 ). We identified a distinct C-F peak for 3FPEA, whereas the C-F signals from 4FAn, 26FAn, and 345FAn were all below the detection limit at the different electron takeoff angles. TOF-SIMS further confirmed that 345FAn cations were localized to the surface of the perovskite film (fig.  S5 ). We then characterized the phase transformation of perovskites driven by their interaction with ammonium ligands. Ultrafast transient reflection (TR) spectroscopy was used initially to detect 2D perovskite formation  (42) . For the PEA-treated perovskite films, negative reflectance features associated with n = 1, 2, and 3 layered 2D perovskites were observed in the TR spectra (Fig.  2A ). The relative proportion of 2D phases increased as the solution exposure time was prolonged (fig.  S6 ) and was indicative of progressive phase transformation. For the An-and 345FAn-treated perovskite films, no 2D phases were observed (Fig.  2, B  and C ), which we attributed to their inability to convert 3D perovskites into 2D phases (fig.  S7 ). These results reinforce the model proposing that inhibiting 2D phase conversion would also reduce ligand penetration. We also investigated phase transformation with grazing incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. Consistent with the TR studies, n = 2 2D perovskites were observed at around q = 0.29 Å -1 along q z for the PEA-treated perovskite film (Fig.  2D ) that blocks vertical carrier transport  (32) . Incidence angle-dependent diffraction patterns of PEA-treated perovskites revealed that the 2D phase formation was more pronounced near the surface (fig.  S8 ). No 2D phase was detected in the An-and 345FAn-treated perovskites (Fig.  2, E  and F ). In addition, we observed the formation of PbI 2 at q = 0.9 Å -1 for An-treated perovskite films, which we attributed to polar solvent-induced decomposition during solution exposure, as seen in x-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization (fig.  S9 ). This is a topic that requires further in-depth investigation. GIWAXS characterization showed that 345FAn protected the underlying perovskites from this solventinduced degradation (Fig.  2F ). We associate the reduction in surface degradation with increased hydrophobicity of this fluorinated ligand (fig.  S10 )  (26) . 
 Theoretical calculations The interactions of ammonium ligands and perovskites are depicted in Fig.  3A . We performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore how molecular structure affected these interactions. We first calculated the binding energies (E b ) of two adjacent perovskite fragments at their interface with the insertion of ammonium ligands (Fig.  3B ). A more negative E b implies that it is thermodynamically more favorable to form the 2D/3D heterostructures  (24) . Consistent with the AR-XPS studies, penetrating PEA had a more negative E b value than alkyl ammoniums OA and BA, whereas An and its derivatives showed the least tendency to form 2D/3D structures (Fig.  3C ). It has been suggested that the formation of 2D perovskites is related to the steric hindrance around the NH 3 + group  (43) . We calculated the steric effect index (STEI, defined as the steric environment around the NH 3 + group) of the ammonium ligand  (43)  and found that An had a much larger STEI (2.34) than that of PEA  (1.21) . Furthermore, phase transformation entailed the replacement of A-site cations at 2D/3D interfaces  (24) . DFT calculations indicated that this process demanded more energy for An-intercalated interfaces than for PEAintercalated ones (fig.  S11 ). This evidence further supported our finding that An was less likely to penetrate the bulk of perovskites through ligand intercalation. We proceeded to examine the interactions between ammonium ligands and perovskite surfaces. We calculated the interaction energy (E int ) for the scenario in which an ammonium ligand occupied an MA-vacancy site on the perovskite surface (Fig.  3D ). Electrostatic potential calculations showed that fluorine substitution resulted in a higher positive charge density near the ammonium group (fig.  S12 ) that could enhance its binding with the negatively charged MA vacancy  (13) . Indeed, the E int values were -0.74, -0.89, -0.92, and -1.22 eV for An, 4FAn, 26FAn, 345FAn, respectively (Fig.  3E ), indicating that 345FAn exhibited the strongest interaction with the perovskite surface. Future computational studies could beneficially predict the binding energy of the N 1s XPS peak. 
 Perovskite degradation and solar cell studies We used TR and TOF-SIMS to study perovskite degradation. The TR results indicated that PEAbased 2D perovskites were thermally unstable on the film surface and decomposed into PbI 2 after thermal aging at 85°C for 2 hours (Fig.  4,  A  and B ). This process we associated with the diffusion of PEA cations into bulk perovskites, as was seen with TOF-SIMS (Fig.  4C ) and AR-XPS (fig.  S13 ). The dynamic nature of 2D/3D heterostructures was also confirmed for BA, OA, DA, and 3FPEA (fig.  S14 ). By contrast, neither ligand penetration nor phase degradation was observed for An-and 345FAn-treated films (Fig.  4C  and fig.  S15 ). These results suggested that suppressing ligand intercalation into 3D perovskites improved interface stability under thermal stress. We monitored the photoluminescence (PL) stability of perovskite films after annealing at 85°C (Fig.  4D ). The emission intensity of the untreated control and PEA-treated films degraded to 30% of its initial value within 144 hours (Fig.  4E ), as seen in the previous reports  (31) . By contrast, An-and 345FAn-treated films show improved thermal stability, and 345FAn-treated perovskites retained 85% of their initial brightness after annealing. We fabricated inverted-structure PSCs to investigate how ammonium ligands influenced the efficiency and stability of PSCs. We used both Cs 0.05 MA 0.05 FA 0.9 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 and Cs 0.05 MA 0.15 FA 0.8 PbI 3 perovskites as the absorber, the self-assembled monolayer 2PACz as the hole transport layer, the thermally evaporated C 60 /bathocuproine (BCP) bilayer as the electron transport layer, and indium tin oxide (ITO) as the transparent electrode (materials and methods). Three representative ammonium ligands, including the 2D-forming PEA cation and the noninvasive An and 345FAn cations, were used for interfacial engineering. We sent a 345FAn-treated Cs 0.05 MA 0.15 FA 0.8 PbI 3 device to National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL, USA) for independent characterization. The device delivered a certified PCE of 24.09% by using a quasi-steady-state (QSS) I-V   S19 ). The QSS-certified efficiency reported for inverted PSCs is compared with that of other devices in table  S2 . Seeking a better understanding of the improved performance, we used ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to characterize the electronic structure of the perovskite films. The secondary electron cutoff spectra (fig.  S20 ) showed that 345FAn decreased the work function of perovskites from 4.64 to 4.17 eV and shifted the valence-band maximum from 1.15 eV below the Fermi level in the control perovskites to 1.50 eV below the Fermi level. These results show that 345FAn induced more n-type character in the perovskite film (fig.  S20 ), which in inverted PSCs leads to favorable band bending for electron extraction and a decrease in nonradiative carrier recombination  (44, 45) . We performed optoelectronic characterization to investigate carrier recombination. From photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) measurements, we identified nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/C 60 interface as the limiting factor for the performance of control devices (fig.  S21 ). This recombination loss corresponded to a reduction of the quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) by ~100 meV (table  S3 )  (46, 47) . We found that PEA and 345FAn passivation could reduce the interfacial nonradiative recombination, as reflected by the improved QFLS relative to the control stack, by ~15 and ~30 meV, respectively. We further analyzed the energy loss of PSCs on the basis of the device diode characteristics (figs. S22 and S23)  (48) . Consistent with the PL studies, nonradiative losses were reduced for PEA and 345FAn devices (12.7 and 12.1% for PEA and 345FAn, respectively) compared with those of the control device (16.5%) (fig.  S24 ). We evaluated the effect of ligand reactivity on the material processing of PSCs. We varied the solution exposure time between 0 s (dynamic spinning) and 120 s and tracked the PV parameters of PSCs accordingly (Fig.  5D  and fig.  S25 ). The average PCE of PEA devices (eight devices for each condition) dropped to 15.8%, with an average fill factor (FF) of merely 67.4% over the course of solution exposure for 30 s, whereas 345FAn devices maintained an average PCE of 23.0% (Fig.  5D ). Wide solution-processing windows were also achieved for other nonpenetrating ligands, such as 35tbuAn, 4FAn, and 26FAn (fig.  S26 ). In pursuit of initial evidence of capacity to scale area, we fabricated perovskite solar modules (PSMs) with an active area of 22 cm 2 and nine interconnected subcells (materials and methods). The champion PCE under reverse voltage scan was improved from 19.9 to 20.8% for the 345FAn-treated PSMs, with an open-circuit voltage (V oc ) of 10.13 V, an FF of 74.2%, and a J sc of 2.77 mA cm -2 (fig.  S27 ). We studied the operating stability of PSCs using ISOS protocols  (49) . Accelerated lifetime testing was performed at the ISOS-L-3-85°C level, constituting light-soaking tests at 50% RH and 85°C with MPP tracking. We used atomic-layer deposition for SnO 2 as the buffer layer and Cs 0.05 MA 0.05 FA 0.9 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 perovskites as the absorber (materials and methods). The initial PCEs of the encapsulated control, PEA, and 345FAn devices were 18.9, 20.1, and 20.2%, respectively (fig.  S28 ). The stability results are shown in Fig.  5E . We recorded a similar T 80 of ~220 hours for the control and PEA devices, in accordance with the limited thermal stability of perovskite films (Fig.  3E ). We found that 2D/3D PSCs based on alkyl ammonium BA and OA were even less stable than the control device (fig.  S29 ). By contrast, the 345FAn device retained >80% of its initial value after the 800-hour test. We estimate the T 80 for the 345FAn device to be ~810 hours (fig.  S30 ), representing a fourfold enhancement over the operating lifetime of the PEA device. To improve the T 80 further, we moved to fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) as an alternative transparent electrode (fig.  S31 ) because of its chemical stability  (50, 51) . We monitored the MPP of the encapsulated device under 1-sun illumination at 50% RH and 85°C. The initial PCE was 19.0%, which increased progressively to a peak value of 19.9% after ~50 hours of operation (Fig.  5F ). This maximum PCE (PCE max ) corresponds to a temperature coefficient of -0.12% /°C relative to the room temperature device PCE (21.5%), which is con-sistent with reported results for inverted PSCs  (52) . After 1586 hours of continuous operation, the PCE dropped to 16.8% (84% of the PCE max ), primarily because of a reduction in current density (Fig.  5G ). We determined the T 85 to be ~1560 hours (Fig.  5F ). A comparison with other ISOS-L-3-stable PSCs is provided in table S4. 
 Discussion Two types of 2D/3D heterostructures have been reported for ISOS-L-3-stable PSCs: 3FPEAintercalated 2D/3D perovskites (  23  all-inorganic heterostructures  (12) . For allinorganic PSCs, the T 85 reached an impressive 4000 hours at 85°C, but with further room for progress in PCE (≤17% when measured at 85°C). 3FPEA-based PSCs have achieved PCEs exceeding 23% at room temperature, but stable operation over 500 hours was limited to 65°C. Aided by spectroscopic techniques, including AR-XPS, TOF-SIMS, and TR, we see evidence here that certain 2D/3D heterostructures, such as those employing typical ammonium ligands including PEA, 3FPEA, BA, and OA, may evince thermal degradation, something we assign to the dynamic nature of the interfaces at elevated temperatures. Anilinium and its fluorinated derivatives offer a more robust interface structure correlated with limited penetration into the bulk of perovskites. Fluorinated An contributes interface passivation linked to strong interactions with perovskite surfaces. The resultant optimized 345FAn devices are among the most stable PSCs seen under ISOS-L-3 protocols at 85°C, achieving PCE of 19.9% during MPP tracking at this elevated operating temperature.

 Perovskite film fabrication The precursor solution (1.5 M) was prepared from CsI, MAI, FAI, PbBr2, and PbI2 precursors dissolved in mixed solvents of DMF and DMSO with a volume ratio of 4:1. For the Cs0.05MA0.15FA0.8PbI3 perovskite, the molar ratio for FAI/MAI/CsI was 0.8:0.15:0.05, and 10 mg mL -1 MACl was added in the solution to improve the film morphology; For the Cs0.05MA0.05FA0.9Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3 perovskite, the molar ratios for FAI/MABr/CsI and PbI2/PbBr2 were 0.9:0.05:0.05 and 0.95:0.05, respectively. The precursor solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane before use. 60 μL of perovskite solution was deposited on the substrate and spun cast at 1000 rpm for 10 s followed by 6000 rpm for 30 s. 150 μL anisole was dropped onto the substrate during the last 5 s of the spinning, resulting in the formation of dark brown films that were then annealed on a hot plate at 100°C for 20 min. 
 Device fabrication The pre-patterned ITO or FTO glasses were sequentially sonicated in aqueous detergent, deionized water, acetone, and IPA each for 10 min. After drying with nitrogen, the substrates were exposed to UV-ozone treatment for 15 min to remove organic contaminants. 100 μL of 2PACz in anhydrous ethanol (1 mmol/l) solution was spun-cast at 3000 rpm for 30 s inside the nitrogen-filled glovebox (<0.1 ppm of O2 and H2O) and annealed at 100°C for 10 min. Following the 2PACz coating, Cs0.05MA0.15FA0.8PbI3 perovskites were deposited on the substrate as detailed above. 200 μL of ammonium ligand solution (1mg/mL) in CF with an additional 3% of IPA was then drop cast within 2-3 s on the perovskite film spinning at 4000 rpm (i.e., dynamic spinning) and annealed at 100°C for 5 min. For the exposure time-dependent measurements, 200 μL of ammonium ligand solution was left on the perovskite film for a certain period before spinning at 4000 rpm. Both control and treated films were then transferred to the thermal evaporator (Angstrom engineering), and C60 (30 nm) and BCP (7 nm) were deposited sequentially with a rate of 0.3 Å/s and 0.5 Å/s, respectively, at a pressure of ca. 2 x 10 -6 mbar. Finally, Ag contact (120 nm) was deposited on top of BCP through a shadow mask with the desired aperture area. For the stability testing, Cs0.05MA0.05FA0.9Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3 perovskites were instead deposited as described above, and C60 (30 nm) and ALD-SnO2 were used as the electron transport layer. The deposition of ALD-SnO2 was carried out in the PICOSUN R-200 Advanced ALD system. H2O and TDMASn were used as oxygen and tin precursors. Precursor and substrate temperature were set to 75°C and 85°C, respectively. 90 SCCM N2 was used as carrier gas. Pulse and purge times for H2O were 1 s and 5 s, and 1.6 s and 5 s for TDMASn. The total deposition cycle is 150, corresponding to 20 nm of SnO2. 
 Module Fabrication Perovskite solar modules were fabricated on pre-cleaned FTO glass substrates with a size of 6 x 6 cm 2 , which were patterned by a 1030 nm laser (LPKF ProtoLaser R) with nine sub-cells connected in series. FTO substrates were patterned with a laser power of 5 W (P1). The SnO2 was used as the electron transport layer (ETL) using the chemical bath deposition method. The solution was prepared by adding 2.5 g of urea (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), 3.5 mL of HCl (Sigma-Aldrich, 37% wt. % in water), 50 μL of thioglycolic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), and 0.55 g of SnCl2•2H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) into 200 mL of deionized water. The FTO substrates were immerged into the solution at 90°C for 5 hours, followed by annealing at 190°C for 1 hour. Then 1.5 M perovskite precursors with PbI2 (TCI America, 99.99%): FAI (GreatCell Solar, 99.99%): MAI (GreatCell Solar, 99.99%): CsI (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%): MACl (GreatCell Solar, 99.99%) = 1: 0.85: 0.05: 0.05: 0.20) were dissolved in the mixed DMF (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%): DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) = 4:1 (volume ratio) solvent. The perovskite films were deposited by spin-coating at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s. At the 20 s of the second step, 200 µL of chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) was dropped onto the perovskite films to facilitate crystallization. The perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min and 150 °C for 10 min. The passivation layer was fabricated by spinning 100 μL 345FAn solution (1 mg/mL) in isopropanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) and chlorobenzene (1:1 volume ratio) at 5000 rpm 30s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. The hole transport layer was deposited by spin-coating 0.06 M spiro-OMeTAD (Sigma-Aldrich, SHT-263 Solarpur) solution in chlorobenzene at 3000 rpm for 20 s. 0.03 M bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide lithium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.0%) in acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%), 0.2 M 4-tert-Butylpyridine (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) and 0.0035 M FK 209 Co(III) TFSI salt (GreatCell Solar) in acetonitrile were added to the spiro-OMeTAD solution as additives. Then the P2 lines were patterned aligning with P1 using a laser power of 0.5 W. Finally, the electrode was realized by thermal evaporating a 70 nm gold under high vacuum, followed by P3 etching using a laser power of 0.5 W. The geometric fill factor (GFF) of 92% was defined as the active area (22.0 cm 2 ) divided by the aperture area (23.9 cm 2 ). 
 Solar cell characterization The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under the illumination of solar simulator (Newport, Class AAA) at the light intensity of 100 mW cm -2 as checked with a calibrated reference solar cell (Newport). Unless otherwise stated, the I-V curves were all measured in a nitrogen atmosphere with a scanning rate of 100 mV s - 1 (voltage steps of 10 mV and a delay time of 100 ms). The active area was determined by the aperture shade mask (0.049 cm 2 ) placed in front of the solar cell to avoid overestimation of the photocurrent density. EQE measurements were performed using Newport system (QuantX-300) with monochromatic light and white bias light (~0.2 Sun). The system was calibrated by a certified silicon solar cell. 
 Stability tests of solar cells Devices were placed in a homemade stability tracking station. The illumination source is a white light LED with intensity calibrated to match 0.8-sun conditions. For the ISOS-L-3 ageing protocol, the device chamber was left open in a room with 50±10% humidity and solar cell was mounted on a metal plate kept at 85°C by a heating element. A thermal couple attached to the metal plate was used to monitor and provide feedback control to the heating element to ensure temperature consistency. MPP was tracked using a home-build MATLAB-based MPP tracking system using a 'perturb and observe' method. The MPP was updated every 1000 minutes. Encapsulation was done by capping the device with a glass slide, using UV-adhesive (Lumtec LT-U001) as a sealant. 
 AR-XPS measurements AR-XPS measurements were performed with a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha system with 180° double-focusing, hemispherical analyzer. The system is equipped with a 128-channel detector and monochromated small spot XPS. An Al Kα source (1486.6 eV) was used for excitation and a pass energy of 147.6 eV was used for XPS acquisition. Three electron take-off angles (α = 0°, 45°, and 75°) were defined as the angle between the normal of the perovskite sample and the analyzer (Fig.  1b ). Samples mounted on a metal specimen holder were rotated along x, y, z directions to match the analyzing spots. All data were analyzed with Thermo Avantage software. 
 TR measurements A regeneratively amplified Yb:KGW laser at a 5 kHz repetition rate (Light Conversion, Pharos) was used to generate femtosecond laser pulses, and a pulse picker was used to lower the frequency to 1 kHz. A portion of the 1,030 nm fundamental was sent into an optical bench (Ultrafast, Helios), where it passed through a retroreflector and was then focused into a calcium fluoride crystal, translated at 1 mm s -1 , to create the white light continuum probe. An optical parametric amplifier (Light Conversion, Orpheus) was used to generate the 450 nm pump pulse by upconversion of the fundamental wavelength. This was then sent to the optical bench and was chopped at 500 Hz. Both the pump and probe were sent to the sample, with the time delay adjusted by changing the path length of the probe (time resolution ~350 fs). The probe pulse was then collected by a CCD after dispersion by a grating spectrograph (Ultrafast). Time zero was allowed to vary with wavelength to account for the chirp of the probe. 
 GIWAXS measurements GIWAXS measurements were performed at CMS beamline, NSLS II. The monochromatic X-ray with the energy of 13.5 keV shone upon the samples at different grazing incident angles of 0.08°, 0.12°, 0.25°, and 0.5° with an exposure time of 10 s. A Pilatus800K detector was placed 259 mm away from the sample to capture the 2D diffraction pattern. 
 PL and time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements Photoluminescence lifetime (TCSPC) was measured using an Edinburgh Instruments lifespec II fluorescence spectrometer; a picosecond pulse diode laser (EPL-510, excitation wavelength 510 nm, pulse width < 60 ps, fluence < 3 nJ cm -2 ) was used. Absolute intensity photoluminescence spectra were measured using an integrating sphere, and Andor Kymera 193i spectrograph, and a 660 nm continuous-wave laser set at 1-Sun equivalent photon flux (1.1 µm beam full-width halfmaximum, 632 µW); photoluminescence was collected at normal incidence using a 0.1 NA, 110 µm-diameter optical fiber. 
 TOF-SIMS Measurement The time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurements were performed on the IONTOF M6 instrument with a Bi 3+ (30 keV) primary ion beam for analysis and an Arcluster gun (5 keV) for sputtering due to its low damage depth. Data was acquired for positive ions in an analysis area of 49 × 49 μm 2 centered inside the cluster raster area of 200 × 200 μm 2 . No distribution gradient was observed for FA cations, indicating that measurement artifacts were successfully minimized  (53) . Other characterizations XRD spectra were collected with a Bruker-AXS D8 advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. Contact angles were measured with a standard goniometer (Ramé-hart) equipped with a camera was used to measure. A 4 μl drop of deionized water was placed onto the target surface and pictures were captured after 2 s of depositing the drop. The images were analyzed using ImageJ software to extract macroscale contact angle data. UPS measurements were taken with an Excitech H Lyman-α photon source (10.2 eV) with an oxygen-filled beam path coupled with the same PHI 5600 UHV and analyzer system. A sample bias of -5 V was applied and a pass energy of 5.85 eV was used for UPS acquisition. Highresolution SEM images were obtained using the Hitachi S5200 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 1.5 kV. A low accelerating voltage and a low beam current were deployed to reduce surface damage of perovskite films under electron beam bombardment. 
 DFT calculations First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)  (54) . The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was employed as the exchange-correlation functional  (55) . We adopt DFT-D3 method for the van der Waals (vdW) correction  (56) . The plane-wave cutoff energy of 400 eV was used. The energy and force convergence criteria were set to 10 -5 eV and 0.02 eV•Å -1 , respectively. In 2D perovskite formation calculations, the binding energies (Eb) of adjacent fragments was defined as  (24) : 𝐸 𝐵 = 𝐸 𝑡𝑜𝑡 -𝐸 𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡1 -𝐸 𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡2 , where 𝐸 𝑡𝑜𝑡 , 𝐸 𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡1 and 𝐸 𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡2 are the total energies of the entire system, and two fragments cut from the optimized system. The interaction energies (Eint) of different ammonium cations (L) with tetragonal MAPbI3 perovskite surface were calculated as Emol/pvsk-Epvsk-EL, where Emol/pvsk, Epvsk and EL are the total energies of the adsorption system, the perovskite system and LI, respectively. We used a vacuum of 20 Å to separate two surfaces along the z-direction.                  S3 . Fig.  S22 . Voc-light intensity dependence of PSCs. The values of the ideality factor for control, PEA, An, and 345FAn devices are 1.13, 1.19, 1.12, and 1.07, respectively. It is noted that no direct correlation between ideality factor and device performance is found herein. This can be explained by recent findings: Although non-radiative bulk recombination leads to a higher ideality factor, surface and interface recombination can lead to a lower one  (59, 60) . In addition, the ideality factor in perovskites solar cells can also be critically affected by the ionic nature of the absorber layer  (61) . The details behind the shown J-V curves can be found in supplementary text. Losses due to nonradiative recombination appear in Voc and FF, transport losses apparent between the transport limit J-V curve and the measured J-V curve additionally lower the FF.

 The cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a complete device is shown in fig.S16.Device performance (Fig.5A) showed that compared with control devices, PEA-treated Cs 0.05 MA 0.15 FA 0.8 PbI 3 PSCs (16 devices) pro-vided improved PV performance with an average PCE of 23.2% (Fig.5Aand fig.S17). The average PCE of An devices decreased to 19.9%, a finding we linked to perovskite decomposition. Because of the improved surface passivation, 345FAn treatment increased average PCEs of Cs 0.05 MA 0.15 FA 0.8 PbI 3 and Cs 0.05 MA 0.05 FA 0.9 Pb (I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 PSCs to 23.3 and 22.9%, respectively (Fig.5Aand fig.S18). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the champion cells (Fig.5B) for PEA and 345FAn devices exhibited improved charge collection compared with controls, and their integrated short-circuit current density (J sc ) values matched well with those from the current-voltage (I-V) sweep.

For An and 345FAn treated films, no 2D phases were detected, irrespective of the exposure time. It is noted that TR spectroscopy is utilized only for examining the phase distribution of quasi-2D perovskites, while photoinactive δ-FAPbI3 and PbI2 are detected by GIWAXS.

The asterisk symbol (*) indicates PbI2 species. b-d, XRD patterns of 4FAn (b), 26FAn (c), and 345FAn (d) treated perovskite films. The generation of PbI2 during exposure to both pure solvent and An-solution is comparable, which suggests that the decomposition of perovskites is caused by solvents. Films exposed to 26FAn and 345FAn solution exhibited minimal PbI2 generation, indicating these ammonium ligands can protect perovskites from degradation more efficiently than An.

The pink peak fits the C-N bond and the blue to the C=N bond. At a 75° electron take-off angle, the C-N signals diminish significantly in comparison to the fresh sample for both films, suggesting decreased surface presence due to ligand penetration.

Figure S1: a) Comparison of n-i-p and p-i-n cell stability including data from Table  S2 .

Of the 42443 entries in The Perovskite Database, 1834 are provided with the T80 lifetime, the number of hours required for the cell performance to degrade to 80% of its initial value. However, these lifetimes cannot be compared as they were measured at various temperatures, relative, humidities and illumination intensities. We calculate a normalised lifetime T80 defined at temperature 298K, 25% RH under 1-sun illumination. This is done by accounting for the degradation acceleration introduced by these stressors. We model the temperature dependence of degradation with an Arrhenius factor with the activation energy 𝐸 𝑎,𝑇 = 0.6 eV, which corresponds to the most prominent microscopic degradation mechanismthe migration of iodide vacancies.  1  Thus, we can define a thermal degradation rate 𝑟 𝑇 (𝑇) = 𝐴𝑒 -( 𝐸 𝑎,𝑇 𝑘𝑇 ) where 𝑘 is the Boltzmann constant. Comparing between the reference case (298K, 25% RH under 1-sun illumination) and the unnormalized case we can get an acceleration factor: Here 𝐸 𝑎,𝐻 is the activation energy for humidity-driven decomposition, 𝑃 𝐻 2 𝑂 is the partial pressure of water vapour and 𝐼 is the illumination intensity. By definition, partial pressure can be calculated as the product of the saturation pressure (calculated with the August equation), and the relative humidity: 𝐴𝐹 = 𝑟 𝑢𝑛𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚. 𝑟 𝑟𝑒𝑓 𝑃 𝐻 2 𝑂 = 𝑅𝐻 • 𝑃 𝑠𝑎𝑡 = 𝑅𝐻 • 𝑒  20.386 -5132   
 𝑇 To prevent the degradation rate from going to zero with the illumination intensity, we introduce a constant term of 0.345 that reproduces the acceleration factor of 2.9 between no illumination and 1 sun illumination observed in the data reported by Zhao et al.  3  Finally, we can write an acceleration term that combines the effects of humidity and light The normalised T80 lifetime for aging at 25C, 25% RH, in the dark can be calculated as: 𝑇 ̃80 = 𝑇 80 • 𝐴 𝑇 (𝑇) • 𝐴 𝐻,𝐼 (𝑅𝐻, 𝐼) Table  S1  Reference of PSCs stability data in Fig.  2c .

 Review article than distorting to one specific orientation (like in the case of water), several local minima exist, and at room temperature the perovskite lattice is continually moving and reorienting. This behaviour is not clearly resolved by X-ray diffraction, which reveals the average lattice spacing, but is obvious in the Raman spectra of perovskites, which at room temperature appear similar to fluids  17  (Fig.  1d ). The dynamic nature of the perovskite lattice has many profound consequences for its stability. The thermal expansion coefficients of metal-halide perovskites are typically 10 times that of silicon, which is an important consideration when evaluating the mismatch in expansion and thus strain between perovskite and contacts. Additionally, the dynamic lattice increases the density of interstitials and vacancies, and aids ion migration  16  . Ion migration is of great consequence in perovskite photovoltaics. High defect densities generate high ion densities (up to 10 17 cm -3 ) (ref. 18)  and provide pathways for ion migration through the lattice or along grain boundaries. The ion migration energy of halides is lower than for cations or metal species  19  , meaning halide drift is generally attributed as the reason that perovskites act as both electronic and ionic conductors. PSCs are typically made by sandwiching a mostly intrinsic perovskite semiconductor layer between an electron-transport layer (ETL) and a hole-transport layer (HTL). Mobile ions in the perovskite migrate to the interfaces until they screen the built-in electric field that would normally exist when a semiconductor with a relatively low carrier density is between electrodes with different work functions. If the voltage across a PSC is changed so quickly that the ions cannot redistribute fast enough, then, depending on the direction of the voltage scan, the field can either be larger than normal (which favours electron extraction) or it can point in the wrong direction (which hinders electron extraction)  18  . On initial testing, hysteresis is measured between forward and reverse current-voltage (J-V) scans with strong dependency on scan speed  20, 21  . In the long term, ion redistribution results in a loss of current over time due to either flattening bands at the device interface or a build-up of insulating interface material  22  . More troublingly, we now know that in iodide-based MHPs, the density of mobile ions is increased under illumination. As the VBM is formed from iodide bonds, photogenerated holes could oxidize iodide to make neutral iodine interstitials and iodide vacancies (Fig.  1e ) causing several knock-on effects: iodine interstitials act as recombination centres and, because iodide vacancies are conductive, they move towards the interfaces  23, 24  , I 2 gas is produced and can leave the perovskite, and iodine ions diffuse 
 Introduction Because of their remarkable properties, metal-halide perovskite (MHP) semiconductors have ushered in a new era of solar cell research. MHPs form an ABX 3 structure in which the A site is a monovalent cation (typically a mixture of caesium, methylammonium or formamidinium), the B site is a divalent metal (usually Pb or Sn) and the X site is a pure halide or mixture of halides (I, Br, Cl) (Fig.  1a ). Owing to their large absorption coefficients, high mobilities, long diffusion lengths and tunability, polycrystalline thin films of perovskite have been used to fabricate perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with bandgaps from 1.2 to 2.3 eV (refs. 1,2) and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) approaching 26% (~1.5 eV)  3  . Metal-halide perovskites are commonly known to have intrinsic defect tolerance, but modest temperatures (≥60 °C) can cause perovskite crystal decomposition  4, 5  , and 1-sun illumination can break bonds to induce degradation  6, 7  . Unsurprisingly, the time taken for early PSCs to drop to 80% of their original performance (their T 80 lifetime) was only a few hours  8  . Since then, great strides have been made, and some PSCs have demonstrated thousands of hours of operational stability at ≥65 °C with negligible PCE loss  9, 10  . Despite these improvements, the fundamental understanding of instabilities and the mechanisms behind stability-enhancing methods are often overlooked. In this Review, we focus on lead-based perovskites used in single-junction PSCs. First, we discuss the special properties of perovskite materials and the major advances in PSC stability. Then we discuss the factors affecting PSC stability, the techniques used thus far to combat them, and potential routes to further improvement. Several reports have demonstrated encapsulation that renders humidity and oxygen effects negligible on timescales up to 1 year (ref.  11 ). Hence, it seems reasonable to consider moisture and oxygen ingress separately as an encapsulation issue. The need for robust, long-term encapsulation techniques and the best ways to encapsulate PSCs are discussed at length elsewhere  12  . Here, we instead focus on illumination, bias and temperature-based degradation. 
 Differences between perovskites and traditional semiconductors Perovskites and traditional semiconductors (such as Si, CdTe and III-V semiconductors) have several key differences (Fig.  1a, b ) that ultimately affect their stability. Paramount to the success of perovskites is their defect tolerance, a result of their band structure (Fig.  1a , right). In typical semiconductors, the valence band maximum (VBM) is formed from bonding orbitals and the conduction band minimum (CBM) from antibonding orbitals  13  . When these bonds are broken, dangling bonds form close to where the original bonds were, creating defects deep within the semiconductor bandgap (Fig.  1b , right). Perovskites instead form their bandgap from antibonding orbitals at both the VBM and CBM, and thus breaking these bonds produces states away from the bandgap, either shallow defects or states within the valence band. The upshot of this is that polycrystalline perovskite films with defect densities 10 6 times greater than single-crystal silicon can produce similar solar cell performance  14  . The downside is that high defect densities reduce the energy needed for ions to migrate through the film, and defects tend to propagate over time, resulting in faster degradation of the absorber  15  . A second important difference between perovskites and traditional semiconductors is the lone pair effect. The divalent metal B site (usually Pb or Sn) forms with a lone pair of electrons that dictates the local geometry of the perovskite lattice  16  (Fig.  1c ). Similarly to how a water molecule is bent by the lone electron pairs on the oxygen, the perovskite lattice is distorted by the lone pair on the B site. However, rather

 Device stability so far The PCE of PSCs now rivals that of Si photovoltaics (PV), and thus device stability is of utmost importance. The stability of PSCs depends on many factors (ageing condition, perovskite composition, CTLs, electrodes, encapsulation and passivation) and is thus a complex issue. Considering ageing conditions alone, a consensus statement on stability testing of PSCs was made in 2020 (ref. 35), and researchers are encouraged to use the ISOS testing protocols to enable comparison between studies. PSCs are classified into two architectural configurations: conventional (n-i-p) and inverted (p-i-n) structures (Fig.  2a, b ). Figure  2c  shows a timeline of PSCs, comparing record certified efficiency in n-i-p and p-i-n cells along with reported stability. We find that even though the efficiency of the record n-i-p devices has improved hugely in the past decade, their stability has improved relatively slowly (Box 1). Some reports on record devices are without stability measurements, others use different device fabrication with lower efficiency for stability testing and those that use the same architecture record T 80 lifetimes at room temperature of only a few hundred hours  36  . These results give the impression that poor stability is abundant among the best PSCs. Scrutinizing further, one finds that the situation is more positive. The stability of record p-i-n devices, for example, has vastly improved, with devices demonstrating stability under illumination and heat (ISOS-L2/3) with T 80 > 1,000 h from initial PCEs >23%. It should be noted that similarly high stability has been demonstrated in n-i-p, but not with record efficiency  8, 10, 22  . Indeed, we also notice that many impressive stability milestones have been achieved. These are generally accomplished with low-efficiency devices first, and a few years is taken to achieve the same stability in a device with record efficiency. Factors other than ageing condition that affect perovskite stability are often considered separately from efficiency, with many reports using CTLs or metal contacts for their stability testing that are different from those used to obtain their best PCEs. This is particularly popular in n-i-p devices where the hole-transporting material (HTM) spiro-OMeTAD is replaced with more stable HTMs  [37] [38] [39] [40]  . This causes two problems: stability is achieved with significantly lower (often unreported) PCEs than the best efficiencies, and cells are optimized for efficiency using spiro-OMeTAD when these optimizations may not be beneficial using other CTLs. As the field matures, it is important to combine stability with efficiency, considering how best to optimize devices within a stable architecture. Another development is outdoor perovskite stability testing. Initially, real-world testing produced T 80 lifetimes of only a few days  41  . More recently, however, the use of lamination-based glass-glass encapsulation has produced cells with no PCE degradation after  
 Review article 10 months of maximum-power-point (MPP) tracking outdoors in Berlin  42  (Fig.  2c ). A small-scale (~3-m 2 active area) perovskite solar farm with lamination encapsulation and an initial efficiency ~12.5% PCE was tested over the course of a year, with a recorded T 80 of 5,832 h (8 months) following the ISOS-O3 protocol  43  . These results indicate that the lifetime of PSCs is increasing beyond what is practically assessable, and there is a need to move from standard test conditions towards accelerated testing. 
 Factors affecting PSC stability To understand the rapid increase in PSC stability and how to improve it further, we must first understand which materials and stressors contribute. Despite differences in configuration between n-i-p and p-i-n devices, both consist of similar layers: the electron-transporting layer (ETL), hole-transporting layer (HTL), perovskite light-absorbing layer, cathode and anode contacts (Fig.  2a, b ). Under different external stressors (that is, illumination, thermal and bias), the instability  The blue and yellow lines represent record certified efficiency (steady-state) in n-i-p and p-i-n, respectively, whereas the red squares denote the earliest report of certain stability milestones: D1, dark storage (room temperature); D2, dark storage (high temperature); D2I, L1I and L2I, corresponding tests carried out in an inert atmosphere (intrinsic stability testing); D3, dark storage (high temperature + high humidity); L2, maximum power point (MPP) tracked under illumination (high temperature); LC1, light-cycled (room temperature); O3, outdoor testing at MPP.

 Perovskite stability Inherent stability of perovskite structure/phase. Before delving into the stability of full PSCs, we should examine the intrinsic stability of the perovskite structure. The majority of highly efficient PSCs are based on a 3D perovskite in a cubic crystal phase (also known as the α-phase). The Goldschmidt tolerance factor τ can be used to determine the stability of a given perovskite from the ionic radii of its constituent ions: τ R R R R = ( + )/√ 2( + ), A X B X where R A , R B and R X are the ionic radii of the corresponding ions. In general, if τ for a given perovskite composition is between 0.9 and 1.0, it forms an ideal cubic structure. If τ is between 0.71 and 0.9, it will form an orthorhombic structure around room temperature. For MHPs, 
 Box 1 The Perovskite Database The data are understandably noisy, as there are various perovskite compositions, device architectures and ageing parameters included. The trendline still demonstrates an increase in T 80 lifetime from ~10 h to ~100 h over 6 years. However, noise brought about by the huge volume of studies under-represents the stability gains. Looking instead at only PSCs aged under illumination (see the figure, panel b), the increase in stability from 2015 to 2020 becomes more obvious, probably because this is a more intense ageing test in which early devices fared poorly. To update the Perovskite Database statistics, we added 26 data points from recent high-impact studies from 2021 onwards (Supplementary Table  2 ). From these data, we can see that in modern studies, 1,000 h operational stability is readily achievable. This higher stability becomes particularly obvious when one realizes that only 4 of the 26 devices decayed to 80% of their original efficiency during stability testing. For the other 22, the number recorded is either the T 90 , T 95 or T 100 lifetime. Indeed, with lifetimes extending well beyond 1,000 h, researchers are turning to accelerated ageing to assess stability, evidenced by the fact that 15 of the 26 devices were tested above room temperature (45 °C to 85 °C). Panel c of the figure compares n-i-p and p-i-n cell stability. Considering cell configuration, we find that (when normalized to ISOS-L1 conditions using a simple acceleration factor model discussed in Supplementary Note 1) there is little difference in stability on average between n-i-p and p-i-n devices, which is surprising, as many state the stability of transport layers in p-i-n as an advantage of the configuration  141, 158, 199  . Still, this equivalence is bolstered when considering our 26 recent data points with high stability, which are evenly spread between n-i-p and p-i-n (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). Finally, we find that the vast majority of PSC stability is reported in cells with bandgaps from ~1.5 eV to 1.65 eV (panel d of the figure). This result is unsurprising as most PSC research is in this range, but demonstrates the need for more work in the areas of low-bandgap (~1.2 eV Pb/Sn) and wide-bandgap (~1.8 eV) cells that are used in all-perovskite tandems. Although not the subject of this Review, it should be noted that in Pb-free, Sn-containing perovskites, the oxidation of Sn(ii) to Sn(iv) results in poorer stability for narrow-bandgap PSCs  200  . Additionally, higher ionic conductivity and halide segregation hamper the stability of wide-bandgap films with >20% Br concentration  201  .

 Review article it has been observed that if τ > 1 or τ < 0.8, then the lattice distortion generated induces a photo-inactive, non-perovskite structure to form, normally known as the δ-phase  44  . MAPbI 3 has a τ value of ~0.9 and an ideal cubic structure at room temperature. FAPbI 3 (τ of ~1) is near the upper boundary for a cubic structure, so it has two phases at room temperature: cubic (α-phase) and hexagonal (δ-phase). High-temperature annealing (>433 K) is required to obtain α-phase FAPbI 3 (ref. 45), but δ-phase formation only needs a temperature of ~285 K (ref. 46). Because the δ-phase is more stable than the α-phase, it is difficult to stabilize cubic FAPbI 3 . By contrast, τ is approximately 0.8 for CsPbI 3 , which is close to the lower range for the cubic perovskite structure. The thermodynamically stable phase of CsPbI 3 at room temperature is the non-photoactive δ-phase, and the photoactive α-phase is obtained by high-temperature annealing of the δ-phase (>633 K)  47  . Perovskite degradation under thermal stress. Some perovskite materials will undergo decomposition reactions under thermal stress. It is important to consider both operational temperatures (-40 °C to 75 °C; a temperature of 65 °C is commonly used as the upper end of PSC operating temperature, but there is evidence that this could be as high as 70-75 °C (refs. 43,48) and temperatures >75 °C for accelerated degradation testing. Note that temperatures used for accelerated ageing should not introduce a new decay mode that would not be observed below 75 °C. MAPbX 3 (X = Cl, Br, I) have low decomposition temperatures (<100 ˚C), with MAPbI 3 in particular degrading within the operational range (~60 °C), which is likely to preclude its use as a stable PSC material  49  . The thermal stability of FAPbI 3 is reportedly higher than MAPbI 3 . FAPbI 3 films exposed to 150 °C for 60 mins are stable without discoloration, whereas MAPbI 3 discolours after ~30 minutes  50  . This enhanced stability is attributed to the stronger interaction between FA + and [PbI 6 ] 4+ compared with MA + (ref. 51). Despite this, FAPbI 3 will undergo thermal decomposition at relatively low temperatures (>50 °C), where formamidinium iodide (FAI) decomposes into formamidine and HI  52  (Fig.  3a ). Both of these reactions are reversible and in a well-encapsulated device might not be fatal. When the temperature is around 95 °C, formamidine decomposes into sym-triazine and ammonia through irreversible reactions  45  (Fig.  3a ). When the temperature exceeds the phase transition temperature of α-FAPbI 3 (160 °C), FAPbI 3 partially decomposes into PbI 2 as FAI evaporates to HCN and NH 3 (ref. 53). This degradation behaviour suggests that FAPbI 3 has potential as a stable PSC material between -40 °C and 75 °C, although accelerated ageing above 95 °C is likely to be non-representative. Because CsPbI 3 does not contain volatile and decomposable organic components, it does not break down at low temperatures, and α-CsPbI 3 is stable at temperatures as high as 390 °C. Above this, PbI 2 volatilizes and leaves CsI as residue  54  . Hence, accelerated ageing beyond 300 °C is feasible, although the stability of other PSC layers would come into question. Perovskite degradation under illumination. Ultraviolet and blue wavelengths have the strongest impact on PSC stability  55  . Perovskites rapidly decompose under illumination when oxygen is present, although without oxygen, illumination can still trigger decomposition through simultaneous reversible and permanent reactions  56, 57  . Our discussion will focus on illumination without oxygen, assuming high-quality encapsulation. PbI 2 films degrade into metallic Pb 0 and I 2 gas under simulated sunlight (Xe lamp), with an activation energy (E a ) of ~9 kcal mol -1 , or 0.4 eV per Pb atom  58  . The activation energy is increased by a factor of 6 (~57 kcal mol -1 ) on using a white-light LED. The degradation is retarded completely for photon energies less than 2.3 eV (ref. 59), which is the bandgap of PbI 2 , suggesting that degradation is caused by light absorption. For MAPbI 3 under a Xe lamp, the E a for Pb 0 /I 2 decomposition is lower than PbI 2 (~6 kcal mol -1 ) owing to the lower bandgap of MAPbI 3 and [PbI 6 ] octahedral distortion which produces shorter I-I bond distances, aiding the release of I 2 (ref. 58). Moreover, when MAPbI 3 is illuminated with energies higher than 450 nm, signals from CH 3 NH 2 and H 2 are detected, indicating that the N-H bond in the perovskite can dissociate under sunlight  60  (Fig.  3b ). Although most studies examining degradation under illumination have been carried out on MAPbI 3 , decomposition into Pb 0 has been witnessed in FACs perovskites also  61  . Most perovskites with a >20% Br to I ratio will segregate into I-rich and Br-rich regions under illumination  62  . Considering stability, the funnelling of charges into lower-bandgap (I-rich) regions effectively reduces the maximum V OC of wide-bandgap devices, resulting in a ~10% decrease in V OC over the first hour or so of operation  27, 63  . Illumination can also induce a similar process in mixed-cation perovskites in which cations aggregate leading to phase transitions. Density functional theory simulations indicate that cation aggregation in a FA 0.89 Cs 0.11 PbI 3 perovskite with a uniform distribution of cations can be triggered with relatively little energy (0.133 kJ mol -1 ) (ref. 64). Perovskite degradation under bias. In a solar module, partial shading by neighbouring trees, dirt or snow prevents some of the cells from generating photocurrent  65  . Because all cells must pass the same amount of current for the panel to generate power, the cells that are illuminated put the shaded cells into whatever reverse bias is needed for current matching to occur. Cells in reverse bias have both short-term reversible and irreversible degradation problems. Several interesting observations have been made on the reverse-bias behaviour of perovskite solar cells. When metal electrodes are used, the metal filaments grow all the way through the device under reverse bias to create a shunt  66  . In a reverse-bias current-voltage scan, the current increases very suddenly when the shunt forms, and localized heating is observed with thermal imaging  67, 68  . The extreme heating at the shunt causes permanent damage to most layers of the cell. By contrast, this behaviour is not seen when transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) and carbon electrodes are used. In these cells, there is an exponential increase in current that starts typically between -1 V and -4 V when sweeping the voltage to increasing negative values. This current is enabled by the tunnelling of holes from the electron-transport layer due to strong band bending associated with mobile ions redistributing to screen the applied field. After current is passed through a cell in reverse bias for as little as a minute, the efficiency can be reduced by more than 50%. Much, but not all, of this efficiency recovers if the cell is exposed to 1 sun at a positive voltage for approximately 30 minutes. The rapid degradation most likely occurs because the hole density while passing the short-circuit current density in reverse bias is similar to what it would be at the MPP under 1-sun illumination, but the electron density is nearly zero. Consequently, the holes can oxidize iodide more rapidly to form smaller neutral iodine species that can move to interstitial sites, creating a vacancy in the process. With few electrons being present, the reverse reaction is slow. The iodine interstitials act as recombination centres, which greatly reduces the efficiency of the cell. During the recovery process at positive voltage, the iodine interstitials are reduced and return to the octahedral corners. The recovery only 
 Review article occurs, however, if the iodine species stay in the perovskite film. For this reason, internal barriers that confine the iodine to the perovskite are critically important. If strategies for preventing degradation in reverse bias are not found, then engineering solutions for preventing degradation due to partial shading will be needed. In silicon solar panels, strings of cells are protected by a few bypass diodes that are located in the junction box. The current can be routed to the diodes through metal ribbons. The approach could be used relatively easily in panels made with perovskite-silicon tandems  69  . The breakdown voltage of the tandem is the sum of the breakdown voltages of the subcells. Many tandems can be protected by one bypass diode because of the high breakdown voltage of silicon. It is not clear, however, how to use bypass diodes in thin-film panels in which cells with a length greater than a metre are separated from each other by laser scribes. If one of these cells were shaded, some of the current would have to travel as far as the length of the cell to get to the bypass diode on the edge of the panel and then travel back. One of the electrodes would probably be a TCO, and the voltage drop over such a large distance would be excessive. It is for this reason that bypass diodes are typically not used in commercial CdTe solar panels. It is quite possible that the degradation in reverse bias is similar in nature to what happens under 1 sun at the MPP in good solar cells that do not have weaknesses associated with poor packaging, mobile additives or reactive electrodes. Because degradation in reverse bias is approximately 100,000 times faster, it might offer an excellent way to test new materials and processing conditions rapidly to assess their impact on stability. In particular, reverse biasing can be used to generate mobile iodine in order to assess barrier quality (Fig.  3c ). 
 Effect of defects on PSC stability. A large number of defects are generated during perovskite crystallization. Defect densities >10 14 cm -3 have been reported for optimized perovskite thin films  70  , most of which appear at surfaces and grain boundaries. Perovskite composition and   V X V Pb V A X i X Pb A Pb Pb X X A Pb A A X A i Pb i d a b c e f g h E C E V 2 
 Review article fabrication conditions have a substantial influence on defect type and concentration  71  . The primary defects affecting PSC performance are point defects at grain boundaries or surfaces  72  , including antisites (MA Pb , MA I , Pb MA , I MA and I Pb ), interstitials (MA i , Pb i and I i ) and vacancies (V MA ,V Pb and V I )  73  (Fig.  3d ). MHPs are defect-tolerant materials, but even shallow defects can lead to non-radiative recombination and reduce V OC , albeit to a much lesser extent than traditional semiconductors. More important to stability, defects aid ion migration, meaning that defects migrate  74  (Fig.  3e-h ), accumulate and propagate leading to irreversible degradation  75  . Calculations of ion migration activation energies find that halide ions contribute the most to ion migration (5 times as much as MA or Pb, for example  76  ). Ion migration energies vary due to measurement, perovskite composition, defect densities and PSC fabrication, but values between 0.1 eV and 0.9 eV have been reported  10, [77] [78] [79]  . Typically, these values are calculated as a function of temperature only, but ion migration is governed by temperature and illumination. For example, ion migration activation energy has been observed to decrease substantially (0.29 eV to 0.1 eV) when films are under low-intensity illumination (10 mW cm -2 ) (ref. 80). Defects also collect and trap carriers, inducing irreversible degradation of perovskite  81, 82  . Two deep-level trap bands, I (0.27 eV) and II (0.36 eV), have been observed in iodine-based PSCs, which correspond to iodide interstitials (I i -and I i + ). Under reverse bias, a trap-filling process occurs between I i -and the injected holes (h + ) to form I i 0 . I i 0 can be oxidized to I i + by valence band oxidation  83  or can form I 2 through a bimolecular reaction, which induces iodide loss and leads to irreversible degradation  67, 84  .  
 Review article 
 Effect of metal electrodes on PSC stability Most highly efficient PSCs use a metal top electrode; gold is the mostused electrode in n-i-p devices, but copper or silver is more common for p-i-n devices. Metal electrodes are easily corroded by halides that migrate from the perovskite layer, which reduces conductivity over time. Furthermore, metal ions generated by corrosion can migrate into the perovskite, accelerating PSC degradation  85  . For example, iodide on perovskite film surfaces can diffuse through CTLs to the surface of a silver electrode. The ions react with silver and form silver iodide (AgI), an insulating layer that hinders charge transport  86  . The opposite is also possible. Au -can migrate through spiro-OMeTAD into the perovskite layer under 70 °C annealing to induce perovskite degradation  87  . It is believed that under illumination, the ion migration in perovskites is reversible and does not cause permanent degradation. However, when ions, especially halides, migrate to a metal electrode and react, this causes irreversible degradation  88  . 
 Effect of charge-transport layers on PSC stability For highly efficient PSCs, charge-transport layers (CTLs) are indispensable. Any physical or chemical alteration of the transport layer material, the perovskite-CTL interface  89  or the CTL-electrode interface can affect the long-term stability of PSCs  90  . For example, TiO 2 , a common electron-transporting material in n-i-p PSCs, has abundant oxygen vacancy defects (Ti 3+ sites, especially at the surface) that are effectively deep electron-donating sites. In the presence of ultraviolet light, iodide ions at the perovskite-TiO 2 interface can be oxidized into iodine, resulting in the decomposition of the perovskite  91  . NiOx and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) can undergo photo-or chemical reactions with lead halides. By contrast, pentathienoacene (PTA) and polybisphenyl(trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA) seem inert to lead halides  92  . Currently, spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs hold the record for single-junction PSC efficiency. Pristine spiro-OMeTAD has intrinsically low hole mobility. As such, it is necessary to increase the hole mobility by adding additives, with the most-used additives being lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) and tert-butylpyridine (tBP)  93, 94  . Although Li-TFSI and tBP improve PSC performance, they also bring challenges to long-term stability: tBP can corrode the perovskite layer through reaction with PbI 2 , and Li + in Li-TFSI can diffuse into the perovskite interior and decompose the perovskite structure  [95] [96] [97]  . 
 Strategies for stable PSCs Several stability-enhancing strategies have been developed, such as increasing ion migration energies and crystal stability through alloying, protecting the perovskite and CTLs from external stressors and passivating interfacial defects using barrier layers, decreasing defect density and suppressing ion migration using functional additives, and using robust CTLs (Figs.  4  and 5 ). 
 Perovskite phase stabilization A-cation alloying. The A site in the perovskite crystal structure does not directly affect the band edge states as these states are formed from Pb and halide orbitals. It does, however, affect the bandgap indirectly through changes to octahedral tilting or distortion of the MX 6 framework, which changes the B-X bond length and induces VBM and CBM changes  98, 99  (Fig.  4a ). Indeed, as the size and geometry of the A cation affects the bond length and bond angle of the perovskite crystal, it has great influence on the crystal stability and the electrical properties of the perovskite. FAPbI 3 has a narrower bandgap (1.48 eV) than that of MAPbI 3 (1.6 eV) (Fig.  4a ), so FAPbI 3 -based perovskites are preferred as their bandgap is closer to optimal for maximum device efficiency (1.34 eV)  100  . Indeed, the majority of high-efficient PSCs are FAPbI 3 -rich recipes. However, as the tolerance factor for FAPbI 3 is close to 1, FAPbI 3 will naturally lose its cubic phase at room temperature. To stabilize α-FAPbI 3 , partial replacement of FA + with smaller-radii cations (MA + , Cs + , Rb + ) is used. The introduction of MA + enables the perovskite to obtain its α-phase at a lower temperature than pristine FAPbI 3 (ref. 101), but is generally thought to decrease the light and thermal stability of FAPbI 3 perovskite as MA + is more volatile than FA + (ref. 102). Counterintuitively, up to ~10% MA incorporation has been shown to improve stability  22, 103  . Partially replacing FA + with smaller-radii cations such as Cs + not only stabilizes α-FAPbI 3 but also improves thermal stability due to the strong chemical bonding between Cs + and [PbI 6 ] 4+ . Cs 0.1 FA 0.9 PbI 3 has shown better photo-and moisture stability than FAPbI 3 . This stability is attributed to the introduction of Cs + , which shrinks the perovskite crystal cubo-octahedral volume and increases the A-site-I bond energy  102  . To further improve stability, complex mixed-cation systems have also been explored, such as CsMAFA and RbCsMAFA. Adding more elements increases the entropy of mixing to stabilize the perovskite phase  40, 104  .

 Review article Various other methods to stabilize α-FAPbI 3 have been discussed in the literature (for example using pseudo-halides  105  or using methylenediammonium  38  or isopropylammonium  106  as additives). For many of these, it is unclear whether perovskite alloying has occurred. Including a small amount of Cs + or MA + to stabilize FAPbI 3 results in a non-cubic perovskite crystal structure with an octahedral tilt of ~2° at room temperature  107  . This α-phase stabilization is not exclusive to alloying additives, as it can also be achieved by additives at the perovskite grain boundaries. Moreover, if alloying cations are unevenly distributed, nanoscale local regions of perovskite can lose their 2° tilt, forming regions of hexagonal polytypes that expand over time, and resulting in δ-phase formation  107  . Increasing the annealing temperature or the annealing time results in more homogenous mixing of A-site cations and higher PSC stability  108  . Introducing large-radius cations such as PEA + or BA + into FAPbI 3 perovskite is another important strategy to improve perovskite stability  109  . The exchange of large-radii cations leads to the collapse of the 3D perovskite crystal structure and the introduction of a quantum-confined, usually 2D structure  110  . If large A cations are mixed directly into the perovskite precursors, then a mixed, quasi-2D film containing various thicknesses of 2D and quasi-2D perovskite tends to form. This mixed film has enhanced stability due to an increased hydrophobicity and the presence of large-cation layers hindering ion transport, but lower efficiency due to an increased bandgap, decreased mobility and higher exciton binding energies  111  . Applying 2D perovskite atop the bulk 3D to passivate the surface and block ion transport out of the cell can be used to remediate these issues. A summary of operational stability enhancements from A-site alloying is found in Supplementary Table  3 . 
 X-anion alloying. Unlike the A-site cation, the X-site anion directly contributes to the band edge of the perovskite. Replacing I -with Br - or Cl -can tune the bandgap, regulate perovskite grain growth and improve the chemical stability of perovskite films. Partially replacing I -with Br -can suppress the δ-phase formation of FA-rich or Cs-rich perovskites  112, 113  , and perovskites with 5% Br have shown better T 80 stability  22  (Fig.  4b ). The introduction of Cl -into perovskite precursors can substantially improve the quality, morphology  114  and crystallinity of majority iodine perovskites, although whether Cl alloys into the perovskite is still debated and probably depends on various factors  115  . Introducing MACl into FAPbI 3 perovskite is one of most popular methods to prepare stable α-FAPbI 3 films  116  , as the Cl-containing perovskite system is more thermodynamically stable and the introduction of MA shrinks the volume of the FAPbI 3 crystal, which also improves the stability of the perovskite structure  117  .

 Review article important amounts of Cs and Br, the lattice parameters are smaller, and more chlorine can be incorporated on the X site  118  . These compounds are more stable against light-induced phase separation. All-inorganic perovskites. All-inorganic perovskites (Cs,Rb)Pb(I,Br) 3 are more thermally stable than their hybrid counterparts. Because the bandgaps of all-inorganic perovskites are wider than those of FA-based perovskites, they are typically considered for tandem applications. The narrowest bandgap available is for CsPbI 3 (~1.7 eV), which is well matched for Si/perovskite tandems. Like for FAPbI 3 , the photoactive phase of CsPbI 3 is difficult to maintain at room temperature. Many strategies have been developed to stabilize α-CsPbI 3 : A-cation alloying, X-anion alloying and additive engineering. For example, 18-crown-6 ether has been used as an additive to stabilize the cubic phase of CsPbI   4c ). Although highly thermally stable, all-inorganic PSCs tend to suffer from lower efficiencies than their hybrid counterparts. These lower efficiencies have been attributed to high defect densities induced by fast crystallization, resulting in short carrier lifetimes and low photoluminescent quantum efficiency  120  . To improve efficiency, dimethylammonium has been used to stabilize the β-phase CsPbI 3 and to control perovskite crystallization  121  , and surface treatments have been used to reduce surface defect densities  120  . Using a CsF surface treatment, an all-inorganic PSC with a 1.74-eV bandgap achieved 21% PCE 122 , ~75% of the thermodynamic limit. The highest-performing hybrid perovskites can achieve >80% of this limit  123  , so there is some room for improvement. The carrier lifetimes recorded for these all-inorganic films are roughly one-quarter that of the highest-performing hybrid films (~700 ns compared with ~2,900 ns), suggesting that defect densities can be further reduced. 
 Barrier layers for stable PSCs Barrier layers are thin layers deposited at interfaces within a PSC to improve efficiency and stability. These layers can protect from external stressors (such as moisture or ultraviolet light), passivate interface defects, block ion migration and inhibit interfacial chemical reactions  124  . 
 CTL-electrode interface barrier layers. The main function of a barrier layer at the CTL-anode interface is to block the migration of perovskite and metal ions crossing the interface without reducing conductivity. There are various barrier layers in use (metal oxides  125  , graphene  126  and organic self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)  127  ). An illustrative example is Au or Ag infiltration in PSCs aged at high temperature. Introducing 10 nm of chromium between a Au anode and the HTL entirely mitigates Au infiltration into the perovskite layer after 75 °C ageing under light, suggesting that Cr is an effective barrier to metal ion migration  87  . Alternatively, bismuth interlayers can protect metal electrodes from iodine corrosion or perovskite ingress, preventing all detectable Ag infiltration into the perovskite layer after ageing at 85 °C for 100 h under light. Bismuth-protected devices maintain 95% and 97% of their initial PCE after 500 h under 85 °C and light soaking conditions, respectively  128  . TCO electrodes such as indium tin oxide or indium zinc oxide can also reduce ion infiltration and increase stability. The most effective TCO layers are fabricated by sputter deposition, but high-energy sputtering can easily damage other layers. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) can remediate this issue as has been demonstrated with SnO 2 in both perovskite tandems and single-junction devices  129  . SnO 2 can act as a barrier layer in its own right, or in conjunction with a sputtered TCO layer  130  . Alternatively, one can replace metal electrodes with carbon electrodes to avoid degradation due to electrode corrosion or metal ion migration. Interface barrier layers are often used to improve the contact or energy-level alignment between the carbon electrode and the perovskite layer, partially offsetting the efficiency decrease caused by the carbon electrode  131  . Perovskite-CTL interface barrier layers. The high surface defect density of perovskite films accelerates degradation while corrupting other layers through ion migration. Barrier layers that can passivate surface defects and block ion migration are highly attractive. Various materials have been demonstrated as perovskite-HTL interface barrier layers, including 2D materials  132  , quantum dots  133  , metal oxides  134, 135  , functional polymers  136  , small molecular compounds  137, 138  and ammonium salts  139, 140  . The most popular passivation/barrier layer in modern PSCs is a layer of 2D perovskite, with several reports of good operational stability at ≥60 °C in 2022 alone  9, 10, 141, 142  . For example, pure-phase 2D perovskite single crystals dispersed in acetonitrile were coated onto 3D perovskite to form a highly controllable 2D/3D interface. An advantage of 2D perovskite is its relatively high conductivity compared with other insulating barrier layers, meaning that layers up to 80 nm in thickness have been used without resistive losses  143  . Using a conformal 50-nm-thick 2D layer, devices with >23% PCE were fabricated, which also demonstrated T 99 > 2,000 h following the ISOS-L1 (MPP, 60 °C) protocols, a large increase compared with control devices (T 80 of ~500 h)  9  (Fig.  4d ). Depositing CsCl onto CsPbI 3 has been used to form an all-inorganic 2D/3D heterostructure (Fig.  4c ). This strategy increased the barrier to ion migration in PSCs by a factor of 2 and increased the T 80 stability (ISOS-L3) by a factor of ~3 at 110 °C to >2,000 h. Device stability was measured at several temperatures and used to extrapolate the T 80 lifetime at 35 °C to be ~5 years  10  . Using non-2D perovskite barrier layers, such as inorganic lead sulfate, also leads to impressive stability results. For example, although the ion migration energy of control devices is ~0.1 eV, no transition to ionic transport was observed in lead-sulfate-capped PSCs below 55 °C (Fig.  4e ). Using this technique produced >20% PCE cells with a T 97 > 1,000 h at 65 °C (ISOS-L3)  80  . In addition, hybrid material ferrocenyl-bis-thiophene-2-carboxylate (FcTc 2 ) strongly binds to the perovskite surface and effectively prevents surface MA + from escaping the film under light (1 sun) and heat (85 °C). Devices with PCE ~24% exhibited a T 98 of 1,500 h (ISOS-L1, room temperature)  144  . 
 Additive engineering Perovskite grain boundaries and surfaces are vital to the stability of PSCs as they contain the majority of defects, and these defects tend to propagate over time  15, 145  . Reducing the density of defects at grain boundaries inhibits degradation and ion migration. Both functional materials and solvent additives can regulate crystallization to increase grain size and passivate grain boundaries  146  . This section investigates the effects of salts and organic compound additives on PSC stability. Additive salts. A popular set of additives are organic ammonium halide salts. These additives exist in different formations at perovskite grain boundaries and surfaces. Some ammonium species form Review article low-dimensional perovskites, which improve PSC stability by inhibiting ion migration  147, 148  . Alternatively, organic cations with large molecular volumes, such as NH 3 I(CH 2 ) 8 NH 3 I, cannot form low-dimensional perovskite but can heal surface defects through hydrogen bonding, X-site vacancy passivation (halogens) and NH 3 groups binding to A-site vacancies or Pb-X antisite defects  2, 149  . Ionic liquids (ILs) are increasingly used to improve the stability of PSCs through three mechanisms  150  . First, the ionic liquid reacts with PbI 2 to form an intermediate complex, which increases the activation barrier to perovskite nucleation growth, thus increasing grain size and reducing grain-boundary density. Next, the formation of hydrogen bonds between the ionic liquid and MA + or FA + inhibits relevant ion migration, thereby increasing PSC stability. Finally, ionic liquids have various functional groups that can passivate different perovskite surface defects, suppress ion migration and retard lead oxidation and the compositional segregation of perovskites. Formamidinium formate (FAHCOO) was used to fabricate >25% PCE PSCs with a T 80 of 400 h (compared with 150 h for control devices)  105  (Fig.  4f ). Organic compounds as additives. Organic compounds are some of the most commonly used perovskite additives. These materials contain N-donor, S-donor or O-donor groups. The electron lone pair of these groups can react with lead halide precursors to form complexes that, similarly to ionic liquids, retard the nucleation rate of perovskites and reduce the density of grain boundaries  151  . Concurrently, these electron donors effectively passivate perovskite defects, thereby improving the stability of PSCs. Some oligomer additives can also be used as linkers between grains to improve grain-boundary stability  152  . Besides the above functions, conjugated organic additives can modify energy-level alignment to promote carrier extraction at interfaces, inhibiting the accumulation of charges and improving stability  153, 154  . A notable example is PMMA, which contains C=O functional groups. When PMMA is added to a perovskite precursor solution, an intermediate adduct is formed between C=O and PbI 2 (Fig.  4g ). The intermediate adduct formation effectively regulates the crystallization process of the perovskite and increases the perovskite crystal size considerably  155  . As another example, the theophylline molecule contains N-H and C = O functional groups. The N-H groups can form a hydrogen bond with iodine and assist the interaction of C=O with antisite Pb (lead) defects on the perovskite surface leading to suppressed ion migration, devices with theophylline showing better stability under operation  156  . It should be noted that there is currently no standard for evaluating which type of additive is better, nor is there any authoritative comparative study indicating additive hierarchy. At present, there is consensus in the field of PSCs that materials containing S, N, O or P atoms can form adducts through Lewis acid-base reactions with lead atoms, which regulate perovskite crystallization and reduce defects in perovskite films  151, 157  . However, how best to compare the efficacy of different additives remains a problem for the field. 
 Robust transport materials and relevant additives for stable PSCs For p-i-n PSCs and p-i-n-based tandem devices, the most commonly used HTLs (PTAA, NiOx and SAMs) have shown good stability  37, 158  , and ALD SnOx as ETL can show good stability and high efficiency. For n-i-p devices, SnO 2 seems to effectively solve the instability induced by TiO 2 (ref. 159), but resolving the instability induced by spiro-OMeTAD while ensuring higher efficiency is a challenge  [160] [161] [162]  . Here we highlight work on improving the stability of spiro-OMeTAD and on the development of additive-free HTMs, as many HTM additives cause degradation when they diffuse into the perovskite. PSCs with record efficiency have consistently been fabricated in the n-i-p structure. Spiro-OMeTAD is the best-performing HTM for these cells in terms of efficiency, but it requires dopant additives to increase its mobility, and stability problems caused by additives in spiro-OMeTAD have resulted in consistently poor stability from record devices (Fig.  2c ). To solve or offset the negative effects of spiro-OMeTAD additives, several strategies have been used, including reducing the use of additives  163  , introducing Li + complex agents to inhibit Li + migration  164, 165  , introducing substances with hydrophobic groups  166  and developing new doping regulators  167  . For example, stable organic radicals have been used as dopants along with ionic salts as doping regulators to oxidize spiro-OMeTAD and increase its hole mobility (Fig.  4h ). The efficiency of devices made using this method exceeded 25% PCE, with the T 80 of unencapsulated devices aged at 70 °C (measured in an N 2 glovebox) increasing from ~264 h to ~796 h (ref. 168). Many researchers are focused on the development of additive-free HTMs, including organic small-molecule materials  93, 169  , polymers  170  and inorganic hole-transport materials  171  . For example, PSCs using compact, conformal CuSCN as a HTL have recorded PCEs exceeding 20% and show excellent stability at 60 °C over 1,000 h (ref. 172). Furthermore, the efficiency of additive-free, polymer-HTL-based PSCs has exceeded 24% and maintain 80% original efficiency after ~1,000 h under 1-sun irradiation (white LED, 100 mW cm -2 , 25 °C, under N 2 )  173  . 
 Accelerated lifetime testing It is impractical to use decades-long protocols for stability testing. Hence, correlation between accelerated testing protocols, degradation models and real-world outdoor testing were used to establish the IEC standards used to certify Si PV panels  174  . These standards do not extend to perovskite PV as the acceleration factors used to correlate simulated and real-world testing are different  35  . Additionally, perovskite PV demonstrates behaviour unknown in Si PV related to ion migration and electrochemistry, such as performance recovery under dark conditions  175, 176  . There are two purposes to stability testing. The first is to identify the rough operational stability of a device in comparison to a control or another study -this type of reporting is common across PSC research. The second is to identify the failure modes of devices and to develop a model for how devices degrade with time. Considering that many PSCs have been reported with little to no degradation under ISOS-L1 conditions for >1,000 h (refs. 9,141,177), accelerated testing and modelling of degradation modes is becoming ever more important. This concept has been used successfully in organic photovoltaics (OPV) and in Si PV where degradation is assumed to derive from a set of individual activation energies that interact multiplicatively  178  , but has seldom been used in perovskite PV. In OPV and Si PV, thermally induced decay is modelled using the Arrhenius equation, to which light intensity is simply assumed to apply multiplicatively. For example, for an arbitrary decay function with some number of constant decay rates k, t f k k k t C PCE( ) = ( , , ,…, ) + 1 2 3 where each decay rate represents a different decay mode in the material (such as halide migration, cation diffusion or B-site oxidation). Traditional models use 
 Review article       k k AF = =e E k T T acc ref 1 - 1 a B ref a cc as the acceleration factor for thermal degradation, where E a is the activation energy for thermal degradation, and T ref and T acc are reference and elevated temperatures, respectively  178  . To include light intensity, a factor is multiplied such that where I acc and I ref represent the light intensity of accelerated and reference testing, respectively. Depending on the decay mode, one might find that only some decay rates are affected by heat and others by illumination intensity  10  . For example, a simple model for N 2 -encapsulated CsPbI 3 PSCs that considers only one light intensity has been reported. The PCE of devices with and without a 2D capping layer degraded according to a biexponential relationship, with two decay rates. Interestingly, both decay rates followed the same relationship with temperature, so were both derived from the same activation energy. Fitting data to this simple model found good agreement, and the lifetime of cells operated at 35 °C could be predicted to be >5 years (Fig.  6a, b ). This result is even more impressive when considering that these cells were under constant 1-sun illumination, which is roughly 5 times the average irradiation experienced by a typical real-world panel, suggesting a similar lifetime to that of established PV technology  25  . An interesting finding from this work is that the common fast initial decay, often classified as 'burn-in', could be generated by the same mechanism that causes slow long-term decay. What is still unclear, however, is why ion migration has two different decay modes and to what extent each of them is reversible. A more comprehensive model for MAPbI 3 that includes humidity, oxygen, light intensity as well as temperature has been developed  179  . In this model, the light intensity acceleration factor is (I acc /I ref ) 0.7 , so less important than the linear multiplicative factor used for established PV, but still indicates that high light intensities could substantially speed up degradation testing. Little work has been done on accelerated testing using high light intensities, although two reports demonstrate stability up to 10-sun intensity (T 90 ~ 150 h, Fig.  6c ) suggesting this could be a useful parameter to accelerate testing timescales  [180] [181] [182]  . Another key consideration when selecting accelerated testing scenarios is the effect of cycling ageing conditions as, in real-world use, a large discrepancy between light-cycled devices (12 h light, 12 h dark) and continuously illuminated devices will occur. For example, in one study, a light-cycled device yielded an average efficiency of 96% initial PCE across 250 h, compared with a continuously illuminated cell that averaged only 88% initial efficiency (Fig.  6d ). In the same study, temperature-cycled devices (65 °C to -10 °C every 2 h) degraded at a rate in between devices held at either -10 °C or 65 °C (ref. 175). Monitoring the performance of a device subjected to simulated weather conditions from two days of each month in the year resulted in several interesting observations. Over the course of each day, the PSC degraded substantially relative to what was expected from single MPP measurements at each light intensity and temperature. Initially, the degradation was reversible and the device completely recovered by the second day, but the proportion of reversible decay reduced over time, and after the first week most degradation was irreversible. Exposure to high light intensities seemed to dominate PSC degradation rather than high temperatures. Understanding what causes reversible and irreversible change to PCE is a pertinent question for future testing. Even this small pool of results suggests that many different testing conditions need to be applied, modelled and compared to build up a reliable testing protocol. Testing with multiple stressors at once is essential to obtain reliable results. For example, in one study, encapsulated Cs 0.05 FA 0.8 MA 0.15 Pb (I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 cells showed no degradation after 2,000 h of IEC standard damp-heat testing. When subjected to MPP tracking under illumination, however, the same cells degraded to 80% of their initial PCE in a few tens of hours under illumination at an elevated temperature (45 °C)  183  . To combat this discrepancy, researchers should compare different ageing conditions individually and in combination. First, researchers should find an encapsulation technique that can allow cells to pass the IEC61215:2016 damp-heat test (85 °C/85% relative humidity), and then operational testing under different light and temperature conditions should be examined. These conditions should include varying light   
 Review article intensity (0.1 to 10 suns, with and without ultraviolet light), temperature cycling (-40 °C to 85 °C) and light cycling (0 to 1 sun). 
 Perspective and conclusion For many years now, stability rather than efficiency has been the most pressing issue in PSC research. In this time, great progress has been made, and the field has produced a toolbox with which we can fabricate highly stable PSCs. Indeed, it should come as no surprise that the strongest operational stability yet reported (ref. 10) used PSCs that are all-inorganic (high-temperature stability), have Cr/Au electrodes, and use 2D perovskite and Al 2 O 3 barrier layers. Clearly the field is advancing, and by using many stability-enhancing techniques in parallel, multiyear operational stability has been achieved. A few final pieces are needed to demonstrate long-term stability: accurate models that allow faster accelerated ageing on a wider range of PSCs, methods to increase predicted T 80 stability to >25 years and techniques to upscale stable methods for large-area modules. Here, we give our view on how best to approach these challenges. 
 Modelling degradation In theory, one can accurately model the degradation from multiple stressors and degradation modes by patiently examining stability curves and fitting them to increasingly complex functions. Instead, it is easier to work on a PSC architecture that is already reasonably robust, which reduces the number of potential degradation modes and simplifies the model. Encapsulating cells in multiple layers and/or using glass-glass lamination seems to negate environmental effects. Then, by using stable transport layers and conformal blocking layers, we can focus on the perovskite film. Limiting temperatures to <90 °C for FA-based perovskites and to <300 °C for inorganic perovskites can restrict unrealistic thermal decomposition. Previous testing suggests that only a few degradation modes are present after such isolation: ion drift, decomposition of PbI to Pb 0 and I 2 gas, cation segregation and halide segregation. Although still a complex system, these processes are governed by ion migration energies and light-induced decomposition, so only a small number of measurements are required. We expect sophisticated models that capture this behaviour to appear soon. Once established, they can be used to accelerate testing protocols further, using high illumination intensities and high temperatures. 
 Methods to increase perovskite stability Although impressive increases to PSC stability have been achieved, these results do not yet meet the requirements for commercial application. To further increase stability, additional techniques should be considered in combination with other strategies. We suggest some underappreciated methods below. Single-crystal PSCs. Single-crystal perovskites are archetypal materials for investigation as they have no grain boundaries and have defect densities several orders of magnitude lower than their polycrystalline counterparts  [184] [185] [186]  . As such, single crystals demonstrate suppressed ion migration, charge accumulation and defect-induced phase transitions  187  . The relatively small number of reports on single-crystal PSCs have shown that single crystals are superior to polycrystalline films at withstanding humidity and heat  188  . Through modified HTLperovskite interface, MAPbI 3 single-crystal devices with 22.1% PCE have been achieved. These devices maintained 90% of their initial PCE after 1,000 h in air, compared with controls maintaining only 61%  189  . Given their inherent advantages, we expect single-crystal PSCs to display impressive stability under operation, but more work is necessary to conclude on the matter. Quasi-single-crystalline PSCs. We currently lack methods to upscale single-crystal PSCs, and cell areas are limited to ~0.1 cm 2 . Quasi-single-crystal film growth (that is, the growth of films composed of micrometre-scale single crystallites through seeded growth) represents a promising middle ground between traditional thin-film processing and single-crystal PSCs. For example, perovskite thin films have been fabricated by first forming a repeating array of 5-µm crystals spaced 5 µm apart, seeding the growth of a continuous film with grain size exceeding 3 µm (ref. 190). Stability tracking of encapsulated devices (FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite/PEAI/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, where FTO is fluorine-doped tin oxide) at room temperature under AM1.5 1-sun intensity (ISOS-L1) demonstrated a T 80 lifetime of 200 h for control devices and a T 90 of 2,000 h for the seeded growth films (initial PCE ~24%). Optimized PSC architecture could further improve the stability of quasi-single-crystal devices. Down-conversion layer. Because shorter-wavelength light is the most detrimental to perovskite stability, introducing a barrier layer to absorb ultraviolet light is an obvious way to enhance PSC stability. However, this approach also reduces the short-circuit current density J SC (ref. 56). Using a down-conversion material as a barrier layer solves this issue by absorbing ultraviolet light and converting it into longer (visible) wavelengths. Although this concept has attracted some attention  62  , it has mostly been applied to non-optimized MAPbI 3 cells in an attempt to increase the current density, rather than to achieve higher stability. Conversion layers with photoluminescent quantum efficiency >80% induce only about a 2% increase in J SC , and this small improvement in current probably does not justify the added cost of the additional layers. These down-conversion layers, however, could be integrated in cells to improve their stability. For example, MAPbI 3 cells using a CsPbCl 3 :Mn quantum dot conversion layer yielded a fourfold increase in stability under ultraviolet light  191  . The use of this method in a highly stable cell architecture is an exciting prospect. 
 Upscaling stability Most of the methods described herein were demonstrated on cells with <1 cm 2 active area. Upscaling this to modules involves a change in approach, moving away from spin coating to techniques such as blade coating, slot-die coating, screen printing or vacuum evaporation. These processes have a whole host of new engineering challenges to produce PCEs and stabilities comparable with small-scale, spin-coated devices. For solution-processed films, volatile solvents such as DMSO are usually used, but unevaporated trapped DMSO can escape to produce voids between the perovskite and CTLs. This issue is accentuated in large-area devices causing rapid degradation under light and heat. Using non-volatile carbohydrazide to replace DMSO can overcome this issue. Carbohydrazide is reported to remain in films even after long-term exposure to 1-sun illumination at 60 °C, and 50-cm 2 modules using carbohydrazine have been fabricated  192  with efficiencies approaching 20% PCE and T 85 lifetimes of 1,000 h under 1-sun illumination at 50 °C. Even more encouraging is the report of a T 97 > 1 year for 20-cm 2 devices under light cycling, produced by replacing DMSO with another less volatile agent (diphenyl sulfoxide)  193  . In monolithically integrated panels, P2 laser scribing can leave thermally damaged perovskite near the edges of the scribe. Furthermore, if metal is used to fill the via (the trench created in the scribing 
 Review article process), the direct contact with the perovskite can cause rapid degradation because halides react with metal  194  . Making singulated cells is advantageous to avoid the use of laser scribes. This approach keeps barriers intact, avoids passing metal through the perovskite, avoids thermal damage associated with laser scribing, and allows the binning of cells by efficiency. If singulated cells are connected with a wire, current can be routed around a cell and through a bypass diode to prevent the cell from being pushed into reverse bias if it is in the shade while the other cells are illuminated. Perovskite-silicon tandems naturally take this approach. These promising results suggest that highly stable modules are achievable. We expect a continued focus on module stability as the field progresses towards commercial stability. 
 Conclusion Despite being a persistent problem in perovskite PV, stability has improved by orders of magnitude in the first decade of mainstream perovskite PV research. With the introduction of various stability-enhancing methods, the operational stability of PSCs is maturing beyond practically achievable testing lifetimes. The introduction of degradation modelling and lifetime estimation has suggested that some current PSC configurations could already have lifetimes similar to established PV. Currently, PSC researchers are using the ISOS protocols adapted from OPV research. Further degradation analysis and comparison with outdoor testing is critical to generate perovskite-specific protocols for calculating cell lifetimes and to understand how to improve stability further. Because many factors cause PSC degradation, solving stability issues using only one method is unrealistic, and the synergistic use of various stability-enhancing methods is the way forward. Considering what has already been achieved and the continued huge effort expended in this field, we expect that perovskite solar modules that retain 90% of their initial performance after 25 years of operation will soon emerge.

Materials and Methods 
 Synthesis Formamidinium iodide (FAI) white powder was synthesized by reacting 20 mg of formamidine acetate salt (99%, Alfa Aesar) with 30 mL of hydroiodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a 250-mL round-bottom flask at 60℃ and 1-mbar pressure for 1 h with rotation. The products were dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized from diethyl ether, and finally dried at RT in a vacuum oven for 24 h. Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) powder was synthesized using synthesized FAI and lead iodide (99.99% PbI2, TCI) mixture (1:1 molar ratio) in 11 mL of 2methoxyethanol (anhydrous 99.8%, Aldrich) in a 70-mL vial with stirring. The mixed solution was heated up to 120℃ and then precipitated by retrograde method. Filtered FAPbI3 black powder was baked at 150℃ for 30 min. Methlammonium lead tri-bromide (MAPbBr3) powder, as an additive for fabricating the control [(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05] device, was synthesized using MABr and lead bromide (98% PbBr2, Alfa) mixture in a 1:1 molar ratio in DMF by capturing single crystal with toluene. Here, methylammonium bromide (MABr) was synthesized by reacting methylamine solution (40 wt% in water, Aldrich) with hydrobromic acid (HBr, 48 wt% in water, Aldrich) (1:1.1 molar ratio) in a round bottomed flask at 0℃ for 3 hours under stirring. The product, was dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized from diethyl ether and dried at room temperature in a vacuum oven overnight. 
 Solar cell fabrication Hole blocking layer titanium oxide (bl-TiO2) was coated onto a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (Asahi FTO glass, 12~13 Ω/cm 2 ) substrate by spray pyrolysis deposition of a 20 mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (Aldrich) solution at 450 ℃. Mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) was spin-coated at 1500 r.p.m. for 40s on the blocking layer (bl)-TiO2/FTO substrate using a TiO2 paste in 2-methoxyethanol (2ME) and terpinol (3.5:1 w/w). The films were calcined at 500℃ for an hour. Perovskite layers were spin-coated on mp-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO using the synthesized FAPbI3 with x mol% methylenediammonium chloride (MDACl2: x = 0, 1.9, 3.8, 5.7 mol%) or with 5 mol% of MAPbBr3 (synthesized) in a mixed solvent of dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (8:1 v/v). The all perovskite precursor solution contained 35 mol% of methylammonium hydrochloride (MACl, 98% Aldrich). The all perovskite layer was first heat-treated at 150 ℃ for 10 minutes and annealed again at 100℃ for 10 minutes. For the surface passivation of perovskite film, octylammonium iodide, dodecylammonium iodide or phenethylammonium iodide (98%, Greatcell Solar) dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (15 mM) was spin coated at 5000 rpm. The surface-treated film was dried at RT in a vacuum oven for 24 h or annealed at 100℃ for 5 min according to the passivation condition, and then spin-coated by hole transporting layer (HTL)/chlorobenzene (90 mg/1 mL) in a mixture of 39.5 µL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), 23 µL of Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI)/acetonitrile (520mg/mL), and 10 µL of cobalt-TFSI dissolved in acetonitrile (375mg/mL) at 3000 r.p.m. for 30 seconds. Finally, a gold counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation (about 65-75 nm of thickness). 
 Characterization J-V characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2420 source meter under illumination by a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Sol3A class AAA) with an AM 1.5 filter and an irradiation intensity of 100 mW/cm 2 . The active area was determined by the metal mask placed in front of the solar cell to avoid overestimation of the photocurrent density. Spectral mismatch factor of 1.05 was used for all J-V measurements. For the measurement of highefficiency devices, an antireflective coating was applied to the surface. The stability test at continuous maximum power point (MPP) operation under 1 Sun, AM 1.5G illumination was carried out in an ambient condition by fixing the voltage at VMPP and then tracking the current output.

 Solar cell fabrication Hole blocking layer titanium oxide (bl-TiO2) was coated onto a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (Asahi FTO glass, 12~13 Ω/cm 2 ) substrate by spray pyrolysis deposition of a 20 mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (Aldrich) solution at 450 ℃. Mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) was spin-coated at 1500 r.p.m. for 40s on the blocking layer (bl)-TiO2/FTO substrate using a TiO2 paste in 2-methoxyethanol (2ME) and terpinol (3.5:1 w/w). The films were calcined at 500℃ for an hour. Perovskite layers were spin-coated on mp-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO using the synthesized FAPbI3 with x mol% methylenediammonium chloride (MDACl2: x = 0, 1.9, 3.8, 5.7 mol%) or with 5 mol% of MAPbBr3 (synthesized) in a mixed solvent of dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (8:1 v/v). The all perovskite precursor solution contained 35 mol% of methylammonium hydrochloride (MACl, 98% Aldrich). The all perovskite layer was first heat-treated at 150 ℃ for 10 minutes and annealed again at 100℃ for 10 minutes. For the surface passivation of perovskite film, octylammonium iodide, dodecylammonium iodide or phenethylammonium iodide (98%, Greatcell Solar) dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (15 mM) was spin coated at 5000 rpm. The surface-treated film was dried at RT in a vacuum oven for 24 h or annealed at 100℃ for 5 min according to the passivation condition, and then spin-coated by hole transporting layer (HTL)/chlorobenzene (90 mg/1 mL) in a mixture of 39.5 µL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), 23 µL of Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI)/acetonitrile (520mg/mL), and 10 µL of cobalt-TFSI dissolved in acetonitrile (375mg/mL) at 3000 r.p.m. for 30 seconds. Finally, a gold counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation (about 65-75 nm of thickness). 
 Characterization J-V characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2420 source meter under illumination by a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Sol3A class AAA) with an AM 1.5 filter and an irradiation intensity of 100 mW/cm 2 . The active area was determined by the metal mask placed in front of the solar cell to avoid overestimation of the photocurrent density. Spectral mismatch factor of 1.05 was used for all J-V measurements. For the measurement of highefficiency devices, an antireflective coating was applied to the surface.

 Computational method We carried out the first-principles pseudopotential total energy calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) within the generalized gradient density approximation (GGA) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)  (45) (46) (47) (48) . The electron-ion interactions are described employing the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) method (  49 ) and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional is used for GGA exchange correlation potential  (50) . To simulate stoichiometric and MDA-and Cl-doped FAPbI3 in α-phase  (33) , we used a 3x3x3 supercell for all the calculations. A kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV and only Γ k-point for Brillouin zone integration is employed. All the atomic positions and lattice parameters are fully relaxed until the total energy is converged within 10 -4 eV.       Table  S1 . Photovoltaic parameters of control and target, measured in reverse and forward mode, as extracted from Figure  2B .     In general, mixed cations and anions containing formamidinium (FA), methylammonium (MA), caesium, iodine, and bromine ions are used to stabilize the black a-phase of the FA-based lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) in perovskite solar cells. However, additives such as MA, caesium, and bromine widen its bandgap and reduce the thermal stability. We stabilized the a-FAPbI 3 phase by doping with methylenediammonium dichloride (MDACl 2 ) and achieved a certified short-circuit current density of between 26.1 and 26.7 milliamperes per square centimeter. With certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 23.7%, more than 90% of the initial efficiency was maintained after 600 hours of operation with maximum power point tracking under full sunlight illumination in ambient conditions including ultraviolet light. Unencapsulated devices retained more than 90% of their initial PCE even after annealing for 20 hours at 150°C in air and exhibited superior thermal and humidity stability over a control device in which FAPbI 3 was stabilized by MAPbBr 3 . P erovskite solar cells (PSCs) have increased power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) with broader solar-light absorption through narrower bandgaps. Among lead halide perovskites (LHPs), the narrowest bandgap is afforded by the formamidinium (FA)-based lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) [1.45 to 1.51 eV (1-3) in thin films], which also affords improved thermal stability (4) relative to MAPbI 3 (where MA is methylammonium) because of its elevated decomposition temperature. However, FAPbI 3 readily transforms from the desired trigonal black a-phase into the undesired wide-bandgap d-phase with hexagonal symmetry under ambient conditions at room temperature  (5) . We have shown that modification of FAPbI 3 with MAPbBr 3 stabilized the a-FAPbI 3 phase and subsequently improved the device efficiency to >18% in (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15  (6) . Efforts to improve the stability of FAPbI 3 have focused on mixed cation-anion hybrid LHPs that incorporate several cations, anions, or both, such as the FA x MA 1-x double cation or the FA 1-x-y MA x Cs y triple cation. This incorporation is achieved by the partial replacement of FA + , MA + , Rb + , Cs + , Br -, and I -(7-11). Nevertheless, when MA and Br are alloyed in FAPbI 3 , various problems such as low thermal stability (4) caused by the addition of MA, phase separation  (12)  caused by the presence of mixed halides, and reduced photon absorption arise, thereby resulting in low current density owing to an undesirable increase in the bandgap. Although the a-FAPbI 3 phase without MA can be stabilized by incorporating phenylethylammonium lead iodide  (13)  through surface functionalization  (14)  or by using both Rb and Cs  (15) , the resulting PCE is still low when compared with that obtained with the use of the FA x MA 1-x double cation. To further increase the PCE by enhancing the photocurrent density resulting from increased light harvesting, a new composition is needed that stabilizes the a-phase while maintaining the inherent bandgap of FAPbI 3 . The ionic radii and molecular configuration of methylenediammonium [ + H 3 N-CH 2 -NH 3 + (MDA), 262 picometers (pm), calculated] and FA ( + H 2 N=CH-NH 2 , 256 pm) are comparable except for the valence-state difference. However, MDA has more hydrogen atoms than FA and even MA, which means that it can form a greater number of H bonds with I -. Thus, MDA could structurally stabilize the a-FAPbI 3 in even smaller amounts than does MA. Some studies have reported the incorporation of divalent cations into monovalent A-site cations  (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) , but most of the divalent diammonium cations reported have been used to realize twodimensional (2D) or 2D/3D LHPs. Safdari et al. ) that used complementary solidstate grinding and solution methods as a 2D/ 3D mixture has also been reported  (21) . The use of 2D or 2D/3D mixed-perovskite-containing diammonium cations increased the stability of perovskite materials by strengthening electrostatic interactions between the layers that rigidify the structure. However, larger organic cations in 2D structures can inhibit charge transport by creating insulating spacing layers between conductive inorganic slabs, so it would be desirable to fabricate 3D LHPs without the 2D perovskite layer. We report highly efficient and stable PSCs fabricated with MA-, Cs-, and Br-free a-FAPbI 3 by incorporating a small amount of MDACl 2 . The resulting FAPbI 3 :3.8 mole % (mol %) MDACl 2 structure stabilized the a-phase with only a slight change in the bandgap. We achieved a short-circuit current density (J sc ) of between 26.1 and 26.7 mA cm -2 (certified), which is the highest reported for PSCs fabricated from FA-based LHPs. The device exhibited a PCE of >24% (certified stabilized 23.7%) and long-term stability compared with the control [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 ], which itself shows the highest efficiency among mesoporous (mp)-TiO 2 -based PSCs. We deposited a thin film of FAPbI 3 incorporating MDACl 2 with a process similar to that reported previously for state-of-art mixed perovskites (9-11) but adding MDACl 2 instead of MAPbBr 3 (see the experimental section in the supplementary materials). The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of FAPbI 3 :xMDACl 2 (x = 0, 1.9, 3.8, and 5.7 mol %) slightly blue-shifted with increasing amounts of MDACl 2 (Fig.  1A ) and were nearly identical to that of a thin film without the addition of MACl (fig.  S1 ) as a mediator  (22) (23) (24) (25) (26)  for high-crystallinity perovskite. This result is consistent with the corresponding shifts of photoluminescence (PL) emission peaks (Fig.  1A  and fig.  S2 ) from 826 nm to 824, 822, and 820 nm, and 816 nm for the control. This result suggests that MACl almost completely disappeared during the annealing process, as previously reported  (27, 28) . The presence of MDA in the perovskite was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (fig.  S3 ) and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (fig.  S4 ). Thus, MDACl 2 may have been incorporated into the perovskite lattice within the experimental x-value range. The bandgap changes in FAPbI 3 caused by the introduction of MDACl 2 were calculated using density functional theory and compared for two cases as per Eqs. 1 and 2: FA vacancy :ðFA þ1 1À2x MDA þ2 x ÞPb 2þ I À1 3 Cl À1 2x → ½ðFA þ1 1À2x MDA þ2 x ÞPb 2þ I À1 3 þ V xFA þ 2xFACl ð1Þ Cl i insertion :ðFA þ1 1Àx MDA þ2 x ÞPb 2þ I À1 3 Cl À1 2x → ½ðFA þ1 1Àx MDA þ2 x ÞPb 2þ I À1 3 Cl À1 x þ Cl xi þ xFACl ð2Þ Equations 1 and 2 represent compositions that assume the FA cation vacancies and the insertion of Cl -with a small ionic radius, respectively, upon the addition of MDACl 2 . The bandgap (1.47 eV) with the FA vacancy (V FA ) composition as per Eq. 1 is slightly greater than that of pristine FAPbI 3 (1.45 eV) and the Cl interstitial composition (Cl i ) based on Eq. 2 yielded an increased bandgap of 1.69 eV (Fig.  1B ). We expected that the addition of MDACl 2 to FAPbI 3 would mainly result in FA defects and the possible induction of PL quenching. However, adding 3.8 mol % MDACl 2 to FAPbI 3 enhanced the PL quantum yield as measured with an integrated sphere, but was greatly reduced with further MDACl 2 addition. This result implies that the FA defects did not act as deep electron traps. As reported previously (4, 29), pristine FAPbI 3 thin films annealed at high temperatures exhibited a black a-phase that absorbed long-wavelength light. However, the a-phase transitions to the yellow d-phase within 10 days at room temperature and within 1 day under high-humidity conditions (5, 30) because the metastable polymorphs stabilized at high temperature are preferably converted back to the thermodynamically stable phase below 120°C. The structural stabilization of the a-phase in FAPbI 3 with added cations can be explained by several factors. First, the a-phase stabilization by smaller cations such as Cs + can be understood from the Goldschmidt tolerance factor t approaching 0.9, which is similar to that of MAPbI 3 , by mixing FAPbI 3 (t ~1) and CsPbI 3 (t ~0.8)  (31) . Second, cation mixing in the FA sites affords entropic stabilization through the resulting entropic gain and small internal energy input to form their solid solution  (32) . Third, the stabilization of a-FAPbI 3 with MA cations can be explained by the presence of strong H bonds between the I -and H-N groups  (33) (34) (35) . The a-FAPbI 3 phase can be more easily stabilized when MA, Cs, or both is used with Br -of small ionic radii, and highefficiency PSCs are normally fabricated using a-FAPbI 3 stabilized by mixed cations and anions. We expected that MDA could stabilize a-FAPbI 3 through the partial replacement of FA sites because MDA has more H groups with an ionic radius similar to that of FA and a stronger ionic interaction of its divalent state. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of FAPbI 3 :xMDACl 2 (x = 0, 1.9, 3.8, and 5.7 mol %) and the control layers exposed to 80% humidity for 24 hours after annealing of the coatings of precursor solution at 150°C for 10 min (Fig.  1C ) show two peaks characteristic of the a-FAPbI 3 phase at 14.3°and 28.6°assigned to the (001) and (002) crystal planes, respectively, and one peak at 11.6°corresponding to the d-phase. The as-annealed films (fig.  S5 ) exhibited a pure a-phase for all compositions, but after exposure to high humidity for 24 hours, pure FAPbI 3 completely converted to the d-phase and FAPbI 3 with 1.9 mol % MDACl 2 exhibited a strong phase transition, with the control also exhibiting a certain amount of the d-phase. By contrast, FAPbI 3 incorporating 3.8 and 5.7 mol % of MDACl 2 retained the a-phase. Furthermore, as shown in fig.  S5 , the overall signal intensity increased for MDACl 2 addition up to 3.8 mol % without any impurity peaks. The incorporation of >3.8 mol % MDACl 2 may result in increased crystallinity because of the reduced lattice strain at FA defects (fig.  S6 ). As can be inferred from Eqs. 1 and 2, the perovskite structure may contain defective FA + or interstitial Cl -to satisfy the electrical neutrality rule with the release of FACl as a by-product when MDA 2+ ions are substituted into the FA sites in FAPbI 3 . The addition of MDACl 2 likely formed FACl or substituted residual MDACl 2 . However, the final annealed perovskite films did not exhibit any impurity peaks such as those of FACl and MDACl 2 . This result implies that MDACl 2 was successfully incorporated into the FAPbI 3 perovskite lattices, and the resulting FACl was eliminated by annealing at 150°C for 10 min, because FACl easily volatilized during heat treatment. The structural phase of FAPbI 3 with and without the substitution of the representative 3.8 mol % MDA and the presence of other phases such as FACl or MDACl 2 was further characterized using grazing-incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS). In The PbI 2 components remaining in both perovskite layers showed similar out-of-plane orientations. The GIWAXS ring patterns of a-FAPbI 3 :xMDACl 2 (x = 0 and 3.8 mol %) did not exhibit appreciable differences, and the fitted azimuthal circular average GIWAXS 1D full spectra were also nearly identical, without showing any peaks related to FACl or MDACl 2 . This result indicated that MDA is substituted into the FAPbI 3 lattice, as estimated from the conventional XRD analysis. Point defects corresponding to V FA or Cl i expressed by Eqs. 1 or 2, respectively, could decrease the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) and the fill factor (FF) rather than the current density J SC , although V FA defects form shallow traps near the conduction band  (37) . Fig.  4 . We used copper phthalocyanine (CuPC) as the hole-transporting material (HTM) to prevent degradation by hygroscopic dopants and spiro-OMeTAD itself at 150°C. The initial device parameters and J-V curves are presented in table S2 and fig.  S12 , respectively. The target device exhibited higher humidity stability, retaining >90% of the initial PCE after 70 hours under high humidity [85% relative humidity (RH), 25°C], than the control PCE, which reduced to 40% of the initial value (Fig.  4A ). The thermal stability monitored at 150°C and ~25% RH (Fig.  4B ) indicates that the control device PCE degraded gradually, reaching <20% of the initial PCE after 17 hours due to MA evaporation. The target device maintained >90% of its initial PCE and exhibited greatly improved thermal stability. In addition, the long-term photostability (encapsulation and ambient condition) of the PSC, including spiro-OMeTAD as HTM, was tested with maximum power point tracking under full solar illumination without a UV filter (Fig.  4C ). Despite the use of a TiO 2 photoelectrode with high photocatalytic effect, the target device exhibits very high photostability, maintaining ~90% of its initial PCE (>23.0%) over 600 hours of irradiation. This result can be attributed to both the high centration of Cl ions in the interface between photoelectrode and perovskite  (42)  and the stabilization of the a-phase on FAPbI 3 by MDACl 2 .

Perovskite Bifunctional Device with Improved Electroluminescent and Photovoltaic Performance through Interfacial Energy-Band Engineering
The organic-inorganic halide perovskite receives great attention for various high performance optoelectronic applications due to its excellent properties, such as strong light absorption, high charge carrier mobility, and long intrinsic carrier lifetime.  [1, 2]  For perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the state-of-the-art device has surged to a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 24.2%, mainly owing to the recent efforts in morphological control, defect management, and component optimization for the bulk perovskite absorbed layer.  [3] [4] [5]  In addition, the
[6, 7]   The highest reported electroluminescent (EL) external quantum efficiencies (EQE EL ) of PLEDs have surpassed >20%.  [8] [9] [10] [11]  Due to the similar device architectures for PSC and PLED, one attractive possibility is to develop photovoltaic/ electroluminescent (PV/EL) bifunctionalities in the same device. However, there is a fundamental tradeoff between solar cell (SC) and light emitting diode (LED) due to the inverse photoelectricity interconversion process and this concept is thus rarely demonstrated yet with high performance.  [12] [13] [14]  Based on the detailed balance (Shockley-Queisser, S-Q) theory, the voltage loss in SC can be attributed to the two basic factors shown in Equation (1)  [15, 16]   where E g is the bandgap energy; V OC the open-circuit voltage; q the elemental charge, k is the Boltzmann constant; and T is the Kelvin temperature. V V , oc rad oc nonrad ∆ ∆ are V OC losses via radiative recombination and nonradiative recombination, respectively. The first term due to the radiative recombination is unavoidable for SC and the energy loss is around 0.28 eV for the PSCs.  [17, 18]  According to Equations ((1) and (  2 )), the same approach to S-Q limit for SC and LED performance is to reduce the nonradiative recombination. In PLED, it is found that near 100% internal quantum efficiencies can be achieved by minimizing interfacial and bulk nonradiative losses.  [11]  In PSCs, the EL metrics can be used to monitor the photovoltage loss, for example, high EQE EL always means high-voltage for SC.  [16, 19, 20]  Several methods have been reported to improve the EQE EL of PSCs, such as improving the perovskite crystal quality by antisolvent engineering, suppressing nonradiative defects by small excess of PbI 2 and using a solution-processed secondary growth (SSG) technique.  [12, 14, [21] [22] [23]  Notably, the EQE EL of PSCs has reached 3.8% through incorporation of rubidium cation into perovskite due to enhanced optoelectronic properties.  [3]  Very recently, surface passivation by PEAI layer has also improved the EL properties of PSCs.  [44]  In principle, nonradiative recombination in perovskite device mainly originates from the interfacial defect states at various interfaces and the native defects.  [24] [25] [26]  In the state-of-the-art perovskite device, recombination in the bulk seems to be negligible since the high quality of perovskite absorber materials have been achieved through morphological control and defect management, confirmed by the long carrier lifetime and diffusion length.  [27, 28]  It is reported that TOPOpassivated MAPbI 3 films can achieve a quasi-Fermi-level splitting as high as 1.28 ± 0.01 eV.  [29]  If such perovskite films could be successfully implemented in a SC device with appropriate selective contacts, it is possible to deliver a V OC of 1.28 V with only 0.04 V loss to S-Q limit, which corresponds to an encouraging EQE EL of ≈21.5% according to Equation (2). Therefore, in principle, it is possible to develop PV/EL PBDs with high comprehensive performance. Except for high quality perovskite films with low defect states, the main challenge is to reduce the energy band barrier at the interface between the perovskite and charge transport layers, which determine the charge extraction or injection loss.  [24]  For the SC, it requires light-generated electron-hole pairs being effectively separated from the perovskite layer and therefore prefers to the type II (staggered gap) charge extraction band alignment as shown in Scheme 1a.  [30]  Inversely, the LED with charge injection alignment is shown in Scheme 1b (straddling gap, type I alignment), to enhance the electron/hole recombination through charge confinement in the active layer.  [7]  Therefore, the energy driving forces in SC and LED are inverse to each other. However, if we can modulate the energy offset at the interface approaching to zero and ensure a barrier free bidirectional charge transfer as shown in Scheme 1c, it is possible to minimize the V OC loss and maximum the EL performance.

We firstly reveal that the serious surface states of perovskite show n-type and thus uplift the Fermi energy of adjacent HTLs using Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM) measurement. Such perovskite/HTLs interface energy band shows a downward band-bending misalignment, leading to serious nonradiative recombination at interface. The FN-Br can turn the n-type perovskite surface into p-type and lower the Fermi level (E F ) of HTL as well. The tailed device forms a well-defined N-I-P heterojunction structure to approximate the Scheme 1c, and hence reduces the energy offset at the perovskite/HTLs interface. The best-performing MAPbI 3 devices achieve a maximum PV efficiency of 21.54% and an improved EQE EL of 4.3%, which is among the highest comprehensive performance so far for PBDs. Due to nondestructive additives, our unencapsulated devices show an excellent stability and maintain >92% of their initial PV performance after continuous operation for 500 h at maximum power point (MPP) under 1-sun illumination. We demonstrate it is a general interface energy band engineering for efficient and stable perovskite photoelectric device. The structure of N-I-P planar PBDs in our study is ITO/ SnO 2 /perovskite/HTLs/Au, showing a switchable dual functionality of SC and LED (Figure  1a ). Here, we blend small amount of FN-Br additive into spiro-OMeTAD to form composite HTLs and the chemical structure is shown in Figure  1a . We assume that there is a thin interlayer formed at the perovskite/HTL interface due to self-organization of -N(CH 3 ) 2 functional group. In order to achieve stable SC/LED PBDs, we use dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD (DFS) as HTLs, without the humidity sensitive additives of LiTFSI and detrimental 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) which are generally thought to be necessary for high performance PSCs. Interestingly, we find that the PV efficiency of devices based on DFS can be improved largely through reducing the DFS thickness which dominates the series resistances in PBD (Figures  S1-S3 , Supporting Information). The highest PCE of 17.29% with a V OC of 1.05 V, a fill factor (FF) of 72.6%, and a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 22.70 mA cm -2 can be achieved when the thickness of DFS is ≈80 nm (Figure  1b ; Table  S1 , Supporting Information). After introducing FN-Br, the device based on DFS (DFS:FN-Br) achieves an improved V OC of 1.16 V and reaches an efficiency of 19.31% (Figure  1b ; Table  S1 , Supporting Information). To understand the improvement of V OC , we estimated the ideality factor (n), which is an indicator of the dominant recombination mechanism occurring within a working device. The n values of the control and DFS:FN-Br based devices are 1.76 and 1.34, respectively, through fitting the J SC dependence of the V OC curves using the equation S1 in the Supporting Information  [31]  (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information). The much smaller n value indicates that the serious interfacial recombination has been effectively reduced by FN-Br. To achieve high V OC in a SC, not only external photoluminescence of the perovskite should be maximized, but also any additional nonradiative losses at the interface in the devices must be minimized.  [28]  Figure  1c ,d compares the EL intensity of the perovskite devices based on the same structure with and without FN-Br. We can indeed observe enhanced EL intensity which is the consequence of a significantly improved hole injection at the perovskite/HTL interface (Figure  1d ). However, in the control device without FN-Br, current injection is much lower and EL becomes weaker (Figure  1c ). To find the physical mechanism for the improved V OC of SC mode and enhanced EL of LED mode, we measured the work function (WF) of the perovskite layer and DFS HTLs by using KPFM. As shown in Figure  2a ,b, we perform the surface potential mappings of MAPbI 3 -Au interface on a HTLfree device with the structure of ITO/SnO 2 /MAPbI 3 (with and without treating by FN-Br solution)/Au and MAPbI 3 /DFS-Au interface on a complete device with the structure of ITO/SnO 2 / MAPbI 3 /DFS(with or without FN-Br additive)/Au, respectively. It is noticed that the Au electrode should be freshly prepared without contamination, which has a WF of ≈5.1 eV calibrated by highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) electrode and thus can be used as a reference to investigate the energy level change of perovskite and DFS in practical device. We observe that both the pristine MAPbI 3 and MAPbI 3 /DFS have a large surface potential gap with Au electrode, which are ≈0.69 and ≈0.58 eV, respectively (Figure  2a, b ). The WF of DFS (4.52 eV) on the perovskite is even lower than its intrinsic value of ≈4.9 eV, which suggests that the surface state of perovskite influences the WF of DFS (Figure  2b   Based on these measurements, we deduce the band diagram at the interface between perovskite and DFS with/without FN-Br (Figure  2d, e ). First, our results show that the pristine perovskite surface is n-type because its E F (-4.41 eV by KPFM; -4.3 eV by UPS) is closed to the conduction band (E C ) (-4.2 eV), which can be seen from the energy band of MAPbI 3 perovskite (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information). In previous study, it was demonstrated that the n-type character of crystal perovskite is caused by donor-type surface states (Pb 0 )  [32]  (Figure  2d ). The formation of surface state on the perovskite film seems to be inevitable, since the periodic array of lattice is broken at the terminal of crystal, and meanwhile organic component of perovskite shows relatively low thermal stability during annealing.  [33]  Under thermal equilibrium, the energy bands show a downward bending at the perovskite surface since the crystal perovskite is close to an intrinsic semiconductor in the bulk  [32, 34]  (Figure  2d ). The electron concentration of perovskite and hole concentration of DFS have been attained by Hall measurement, which are ≈8.0 × 10 16 and ≈1.1 × 10 15 cm -3 , respectively. When contacting with the perovskite active layer, the DFS will also show downward band bending on the perovskite layer side, and the MAPbI 3 /DFS interface form an N-P -junction (Figure  2d ). It can be attained that the depletion region will distribute in the side of DFS according to the equation D >> N A ) N x N x A p D n = (3) where the N D is the electron concentration; N A is the hole concentration; x P , x n are the widths of the positive and negative space charge region, respectively. Namely, in thermal equilibrium the hole concentration in DFS will largely decrease due to the diffusion of electron from perovskite surface, leading to the reduction of WF in DFS. It could be verified by the Boltzmann relation  [35]  p N E E kT exp V V F = × -       ( 4 ) where p is the number of holes (occupied valence-band levels); E V is the valence-band edge; N V is the effective density of states in the valence band; k is the Boltzmann constant; and T is the Kelvin temperature. This interfacial band structure of N-P -junction would block the hole and trap electron at the interface between perovskite and HTLs, leading to serious recombination (Figure  2d ). As the FN-Br is dipole molecule with electron-rich sites on the side of -N(CH 3 ) 2 functional group, the lone electron pairs at the N can be delocalized to the empty 6p orbits of positive metal center (Pb 2+ ). The binding energy of the FN-Br on the MAPbI 3 surface was estimated to be 44.3 kJ mol -1 by density function theory calculation (Figure  S10 , Supporting Information). The molecular adsorption of FN-Br can be used to indicate the elimination of donor-type states (Pb 0 ) on perovskite surface. Figure  S11  in the Supporting Information shows Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra for FN-Br, PbI 2 /FN-Br, and MAPbI 3 /FN-Br film. Stretching frequency of C-N appears at 1270 cm -1 for the bare FN-Br, which is shifted to 1253 and 1249 cm -1 for PbI 2 /FN-Br and MAPbI 3 /FN-Br, respectively. The decreased C-N stretching frequency of PbI 2 /FN-Br indicates that the CN bond strength is decreased due to the interaction with Pb 2+ ions and we find that there exists the similar stretching frequency of C-N in PbI 2 /FN-Br and MAPbI 3 /FN-Br, indicating the coordination between MAPbI 3 and FN-Br. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted to investigate the surface composition for perovskite films. For the pristine perovskite film, two additional peaks can be observed at 138.0 and 142.9 eV, which can be attributed to metallic lead on the surface  [36]  (Figure  S12 , Supporting Information). After treating by FN-Br, the metallic lead peak almost disappears. Excess FN-Br at the interface even may attract mobile holes to compensate for the negative charge and then p-dopes the surface of perovskite, resulting in a slight upward band bending (Figure  2e ). In the HTLs, the FN-Br incorporation can also lower the E F of DFS toward a deeper level as well (Figure  2c ; Figure  S8 , Supporting Information), which will reduce the energy barrier at the perovskite/DFS interface. Based on these results, we deduce that the FN-Br can effectively tune the band structure of device from N-[N]-I-[N]-P -to N-[N]-I-[P]-P ([] represents the interface). This adjusted energy band structure is beneficial to suppress the interfacial nonradiative recombination both for photogenerated electron/hole extraction in SC and electron/hole injection in LED (Figure  2e ). Figure  2f  gives the Mott-Schottky (MS) plots 1/C 2 versus voltage attained by EIS measurements for the control and FN-Br device. According to the Equation (  5 ), the slope gives the charge concentration of the substrate (-2/qɛN), and the intercept of 1/C 2 = 0 gives the built-in potential (ψ bi -2kT/q)  [35, 37]   C A q N V kT q bi 1 2 2 2 2 0 ε ε ψ = --       (5) where C is the depletion-layer capacitance; ψ bi the built-in potential at equilibrium; q the unit electronic charge (1.60 × 10 -19 C), V the applied voltage, A the active area, ɛ the relative permittivity ( = 32), ɛ 0 the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10 -12 F m -1 ), N the charge concentration. By fitting the voltage dependence of the 1/C 2 curves, we find that the slope of the FN-Br devices is one order of magnitude higher than control devices, illustrating the much lower charge density at the perovskite/HTL interface due to the passivation of FN-Br (Figure  2h ). Meanwhile, it is clear that the intercept at 1/C 2 = 0 based on the device with FN-Br is much larger than that based on control device. It illustrates that the built-in potential in device is improved due to adjusted energy band structure, leading to the improved V OC in SC mode. In addition, it is found that this tailed N-I-P structure can achieve a better charge injection balance when the device is operated as a LED mode. As shown in Figure  2g , we measured the J-V characteristics of electron-only devices (ITO/SnO 2 / perovskite/PCBM/Au) and hole-only devices (ITO/PTAA/ perovskite/with or without FN-Br/DFS/Au). The results show that electrons dominate injection into the devices, whereas the FN-Br can improve the hole injection and balance the charge injection which is critical for the PLED. We find that adding the FN-Br into DFS can achieve a better PV performance and reproductivity than spin coating the FN-Br and DFS on the perovskite layer in sequence (Figure  S13  and Table  S2 , Supporting Information). It is possible that a thin FN-Br interlayer could form well through self-organizing on the perovskite surface due to the chemical bonding between the functional group -N(CH 3 ) 2 and under-coordinated Pb as aforementioned, and the FN-Br incorporation can shift the E F of spiro-MeTAD toward a deeper level (Figure  2c ). We systematically optimized the FN-Br concentration dependent performance, as shown in Figure  S14  in the Supporting Information, which suggested that FN-Br could increase the V OC in small concentration. In order to further improve the device efficiency, we added slight FK209 (≈0.5 wt%) into the HTLs and it results in a mild improvement for V OC and J SC , and an obvious enhancement for FF (Figure  S15 , Supporting Information). In previous reports, FK209 was usually used as a p-dopant to enhance the hole transport and overall efficiency.  [38, 39]  In this study, the FK209 additive plays the similar role for improving the device performance. The J-V curves of the champion device after optimization are shown in Figure  3a . The device exhibits a V OC of 1.186 V, a J SC of 23.25 mA cm -2 , and a FF of 78.2%, achieving an overall PCE of 21.54% under reverse scan (V OC to J SC ) and an overall PCE of 20.88% with a V OC of 1.188 V, a J SC of 23.28 mA cm -2 , and a FF of 75.6% under forward scan. It shows a rapid increase in stabilized output PCE to a value of 21.4%, confirming the little hysteresis in our device. The superior performance of our MAPbI 3 -based PSCs is mainly attributed to the improved V OC , which shows an average value of 1.168 V, much higher than those of device doped by conventional LiTFSI/TBP (Figure  S16  and Table  S2 , Supporting Information).  [40, 41]  The J SC value obtained by integrating the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum is 22.8 mA cm -2 , which is consistent with the measured value (Figure  3b ). In some devices, we have measured a record V OC of 1.208 V and it has been confirmed by the V OC over time (Figure  3c ). The only 0.39 V loss-in-potential is one of the lowest energy losses recorded in PSCs and 91.5% of the S-Q limit in potential, implying the effectivity of our strategy. To verify our device efficiency measurements, we sent one of our unsealed devices to the National Institute of Metrology, China, for independent certification and obtained a PCE of 20.24% (V OC = 1.151 V, J SC = 23.16 mA cm -2 , and FF = 76.15%) (Figure  S17 , Supporting Information). It has been demonstrated the universality of our strategy to different HTLs, including poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), poly(9,9-dioctyl-fluorene-co-N-(4-butylphenyl)diphenylamine) (TFB), and poly (diketopyrrolopyrrole-terthiophene) (PDPP3T). It can be seen that all the PSCs based on FN-Br additive exhibits the V OC in a range of 1.1-1.2 V, which is much higher than those of referenced PSCs, with a value around 1 V (Figure  S18 , Supporting Information). The MAPbI 3 is used because it has a single phase and constant bandgap which are beneficial to exactly determine the V OC loss in device. At present, mix-cation based PSCs with a tunable bandgap show an efficiency advantage than MAPbI 3 based PSCs.  [4, [42] [43] [44]  Encouragingly, it is found that our strategy is effective regardless of composition of perovskite materials (Figure  S19 , Supporting Information). The results show that all of the devices based on double cation (MAFA, CsFA) or triple cation (CsMAFA) achieve an improvement of V OC through interfacial energy band management (Figure  S20 , Supporting Information). The device based on triple-cation (CsFAMA) perovskite exhibits a highest PCE of 20.6% with an improved V OC of 1.20 V from 1.06 V (Figure  S20 , Supporting Information). One of these devices even reaches a high V OC of 1.247 V (Figure  S21 , Supporting Information). However, compared with the MAPbI 3 based devices, our mix-cation based PSCs show a relative low performance mainly due to the reduced J SC or FF parameters (Figure  S20 , Supporting Information). It is because that halide segregation usually occurs during the device preparation, which leads to bandgap instabilities in mixed-halide perovskite systems, and thus reduces the performance and reproductivity of device (Figure  S22 , Supporting Information). The tailored N-I-P energy band configuration also delivered an improved EL performance when the MAPbI 3 -based PBDs were operated as LED mode under a bias voltage (Figure  3d ). The EQE EL -V characteristics of the best-performing PBDs show a maximum EQE EL of 4.3% at 2.3 V, which is among the highest values reported so far in PSCs  [12, 14, [19] [20] [21] [22] 45, 46]  and the EL emission peak is located at 772 nm. The EQE EL value can maintain above 4% at a high current density from 150 to 350 mA cm -2 mostly due to the improved balance of the electron/hole injection. Owing to the low interfacial energy barrier, the EQE EL of 2.6% can be attained for a driving current density of around the J SC of 23.2 mA cm -2 (Figure  3e ) and a nonradiative V OC loss of 98 mV has been achieved according to Equation (2). Figure  3f  shows the J-V and radiance versus voltage (L-V) characteristics of the champion bifunctional device, showing a high radiance and current density with a low driving voltage of 1.3 V due to the reduced energy losses from carrier injection and transport. We present a video in the SM showing that the device with FN-Br displayed an obviously visible red emission under ambient light. In Figure  S23  and Table  S3  in the Supporting Information, we give the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decays for the MAPbI 3 and MAPbI 3 /HTLs films with/ without FN-Br, which was fitted to a biexponential equation: Y = A 1 exp(-t/τ 1 ) + A 2 exp(-t/τ 2 ). We attributed quenching of the short PL lifetime to defect-induced nonradiative recombination and of the long PL lifetime to radiative recombination. When contacting the HTLs, the DFS can lead to PL quenching of perovskite due to charge extraction. Obviously, it is found that the suppression of the interfacial defect states by FN-Br can improve both short and long decay times in MAPbI 3 and MAPbI 3 /HTLs films, illustrating a reduced nonradiative recombination. It can be double confirmed by the improved external photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQYs) in FN-Br based films (Table  S4 , Supporting Information). The stability is the most important for the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaic device. Compared with the PSCs based on conventional additives TBP/LiTFSI, our PBDs show much better photovoltaic stability (Figure  4a, b ) since FN-Br is corrosion-free for the perovskite active layer (Figure  4c -f; Figure  S24 , Supporting Information). The unencapsulated devices stability has been tested under AM1.5 G Sun illumination at maximum power point (MPP) tracking in ambient air with ≈60% humidity (Figure  4a ). The device based on TBP/LiTFSI doped spiro-OMeTAD shows a rapid loss of PCE and only remains ≈30% initial value. However, the device with FN-Br/FK209 has an excellent stability, maintaining 95% of their initial performance after continuous operation for 4 h. In a nitrogen atmosphere, the control device showed a rapid loss of PCE within 2 h and retained >85% of their initial PCE after continuous MPP for 25 h (Figure  S25 , Supporting Information), indicating that the additives of TBPs and Li-salt in spiro-OMeTAD play a vital role in stability. It has been demonstrated that the TBP can react with perovskite or evaporation, thus become the source of degradation  [47, 48]  (Figure  4c, e ). Encouragingly, as seen from the XRD results, no decomposition product was observed in perovskite film after FN-Br treatment (Figure  S26 , Supporting Information). As a result, the device based on FN-Br can maintain 92% of its initial photovoltaic performance after continuous operation for 500 h of MPP under 1-sun illumination. These results demonstrate the importance of corrosion-free interfacial materials for the stability of perovskite devices. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of interfacial energy band engineering using FN-Br for reducing the nonradiative recombination and maximizing the luminescence which are crucial for high PV as well as EL. FN-Br can turn the n-type surface of perovskite into p-type to form a welldefined N-I-P structure for device and thus tailor the interfacial energy band misalignment. The resultant SC/LED PBD achieves a high PV efficiency of up to 21.54% (certified 20.24%) and 4.3% EQE EL . Furthermore, by using nondestructive additives, the unsealed devices can maintain >92% of their initial photovoltaic performance for 500 h under continuous operation at their maximum power point. Therefore, this corrosion-free interfacial energy band engineering opens an attractive route for the realization of high PV/ EL comprehensive performance of PBD with excellent stability.

Device Fabrication: The ITO was cleaned sequentially in deionized water, cleaning fluid, acetone, and ethanol under sonication for 5 min, respectively. Then the ITO was dried by nitrogen gas and treated with a UV-ozone machine for 20 min. The SnO 2 ETLs were attained through spin coating the SnCl 2 • 2H 2 O ethanol solution (23 mg mL -1 ) with adding 0.5% graphene quantum dots (GQDs) water dispersion on the ITO.  [41]  The films were annealed in air at 180 °C and then treated with a UV-ozone machine for 5 min. The prepared MAPbI 3 solution was dropped on the ITO/SnO 2 substrates and then rapidly spin coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for another 20 s. 0.6 mL of diethyl ether was drop casted quickly 15 s before the 5000 rpm spin coating ended. The perovskite films were heated at 70 °C for 1 min and 100 °C for 10 min on a hot plate, respectively. All the MAPbI 3 perovskite films were fabricated in air under a relative humidity below 45%. For the mixed-cation perovskite, the spin-coating procedure was performed by 1000 rpm for 5 s followed with 6000 rpm for 30 s. At 15 s before the last spin-coating step, 100 mL of CB was dropped onto the substrate. The mixed-cation perovskite films were heated at 100 °C for 30 min in N 2 glovebox. All the hole-transport materials were spin coated on the top of perovskite film at the rotation speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s in N 2 glovebox. At last, 100 nm thick Au electrodes were deposited under a high vacuum (<1.0 × 10 -3 Pa). Current-Voltage Measurements: For all devices, photovoltaic performance was measured by masking on the active area with a metal mask (certified area was 0.08567 cm 2 ). The current density-voltage (J-V) curves of solar cells were measured a Keithley 2400 source meter with a solar simulator (94022A, Newport) under AM 1.5 G condition at an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm -2 , calibrated by a standard Si solar cell (PVM937, Newport) with KG5 filter. The J-V measurements were carried out in ambient air. The sweeping conditions were: reverse scan (1.4 V → -0.2 V, scan rate 10 mV s -1 , and delay time 200 ms) and forward scan (-0.2 V → 1.4 V, scan rate 10 mV s -1 , and delay time 200 ms). Stability Test: For the device stability in a nitrogen atmosphere, the test of the nonencapsulated solar cell was carried in a nitrogen glovebox and measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit under100 mW cm -2 simulated 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator (Enli Technology Co., Ltd., SS-F5-3A). The light intensity was calibrated by a standard Si solar cell solar cell (SRC-2020, Enli Technology Co., Ltd.). A 420 nm UV filter was applied when testing the stability. For the device stability in a ambient air, the test of the nonencapsulated solar cell was measured a Keithley 2400 source meter with a solar simulator (94022A, Newport) under AM 1.5 G condition at an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm -2 , calibrated by a standard Si solar cell (PVM937, Newport). KPFM Test: The KPFM mapping images were measured by Kelvin Probe (Bruker Dimension Icon system) in air. The type of cantilever used was NSG10/Pt (Chip size: 3.6 × 1.6 × 0.4 mm, length: 100 ± 5 µm, width: 35 ± 5 µm, resonant frequency: 190-325 kHz, force constant: 5.5-22.5 N m -1 ). Kelvin probe measurements were taken on the perovskite-Au and DFS-Au interface. To avoid the moisture, O 2 and organics in the air shift the WF of sample, the sample was measured once the preparation had been finished. Before measurement, each sample was stored in a single glass bottle filled with nitrogen, avoiding contamination by the ambient. Electrical & Magnetic Lift Mode and Surface potential (AM-KPFM) mode were adopted. The drive frequency was 276 kHz. The lift scan height was 50 nm. The voltage was applied to the tip, and the work function of the sample was given by φ sample = φ tip -eV CPD . V CPD was the contact potential difference between the tip and sample. The HOPG was used as a reference to calibrate the tip WF and the measured WF of gold electrode was 5.1 eV. The WFs of perovskite or HTL could be attained according to their potential differences with Au. UPS and XPS Test: The samples were coated on the highly conductive and clean ITO substrates. UPS and XPS measurements were performed in two interconnected vacuum chambers, one for sample loading and the other for spectroscopy analysis with a base pressure at the order of 1 × 10 -9 Torr. The photoelectrons from UPS and XPS were counted with a hemispherical analyzer with an overall resolution of 0.05 eV, as determined from the width of the Fermi step measured on a gold substrate cleaned by Ar-ion sputtering. All the UPS measurements of the onset of photoemission for determining the work function were done using standard procedures with a -9.8 V bias applied to the sample. The spectra were recorded with an Imaging Photoelectron Spectrometer (Axis Ultra), with a nonmonochromated He Iα photon source (hν = 21.22 eV). The work function of a metal can be determined from the UPS spectrum using: WF = hν -E SECO , where hν = photon energy (21.22 eV) and E SECO = secondary electron Cutoff energy. An error of 0.12 eV was a typical value of the energy analyzer resolution. FTIR Spectroscopy Measurements: FTIR spectroscopy of pure FN-Br, PbI 2 /FN-Br, and MAPbI 3 /FN-Br thin film samples were performed using a on a Vertex 70 V (Bruker). Hall Measurement: The DFS film was prepared on a glass substrate by spin coating a 15 mg mL -1 DFS CB solution. All four electrodes were Au. Hall effect measurement was conducted on the DFS films. The majority carrier was determined to be holes based on the Hall voltage sign. The free hole carrier concentration (n) in DFS was attained by n = -IB/eV H t, where I is the applied bias current across the DFS, B is the magnetic field, V H is the measured Hall voltage, t is the thickness of the DFS (about 50 nm), and e is the elementary charge. LED Test: Electroluminescence was performed by applying different voltages to the device with Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. The device was placed on a Fiber Optic Integrating Sphere (FOIS-1), and the emitted photon flux was recorded by OceanView spectroscopy software with graphical user interface. The HL-3 plus Vis-NIR Calibrated Light Source was used to calibrate the Integrating Spheres. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM): The SEM data were scanned by an S-4800 (Hitachi) field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Photoluminescence Spectroscopy: The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy was measured with the PL spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS 920). The samples were excited by a pulsed laser, with a wavelength and frequency of 635 nm and 1 MHz. A band pass filter at 655 nm was used to filter out the excitation light in the transient PL measurements. EQE Measurement: The EQE of solar cells was measured by an EQE measurement system (Model QEX10, PV Measurements, Inc.) across a wavelength range of 300-850 nm. DFT Calculation: The first-principles calculation was based on the density functional theory (DFT) and implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP), with the frozen-core all-electron projectoraugment wave (PAW) method. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was adopted to describe the exchange and correlation potentials. A p(2 × 2) unit cell was considered for the (110) surface of MAPbI 3 , and the reciprocal space was sampled by a grid of (4 × 4 × 1) k-points using the Monkhorst-Pack method. A 15 Å vacuum region between the slabs was used to separate the surface from its periodic image in the direction along the surface normal. The geometry optimizations were performed until the forces on each ion were reduced below 0.03 eV Å -1 . The adsorption energies reported herein were calculated using the equation where E ads was the binding energy of adsorbate on MAPbI 3 (110), E adsorbate was the energy of the free adsorbate, E surface was the energy of the clean slab, and E adsorbate/surface was the energy of the adsorbate/ surface adsorption system. By this definition, a positive E ads implies a stable adsorption system. E E E E Figure S1 . S1 Figure S1. J-V characteristics of the devices based on DFS with different concentrations.

 ) Currently, photovoltaic/electroluminescent (PV/EL) perovskite bifunctional devices (PBDs) exhibit poor performance due to defects and interfacial misalignment of the energy band. Interfacial energy-band engineering between the perovskite and hole-transport layer (HTL) is introduced to reduce energy loss, through adding corrosion-free 3,3′-(2,7-dibromo-9H-fluorene-9,9-diyl) bis(n,n-dimethylpropan-1-amine) (FN-Br) into a HTL free of lithium salt. This strategy can turn the n-type surface of perovskite into p-type and thus correct the misalignment to form a well-defined N-I-P heterojunction. The tailored PBD achieves a high PV efficiency of up to 21.54% (certified 20.24%) and 4.3% EL external quantum efficiency. Free of destructive additives, the unencapsulated devices maintain >92% of their initial PV performance for 500 h at maximum power point under standard air mass 1.5G illumination. This strategy can serve as a general guideline to enhance PV and EL performance of perovskite devices while ensuring excellent stability.

 ; FigureS6, Supporting Information). After introducing the FN-Br, the barriers of MAPbI 3 -Au and MAPbI 3 /DFS:FN-Br-Au are largely reduced and WF increases from ≈4.41 to ≈5.15 eV for perovskite, from ≈4.52 to ≈5.08 eV for MAPbI 3 /DFS (the value of WF can be calculated from the relationship shown in FigureS5in the Supporting Information), illustrating that the energy barrier among perovskite, DFS and Au has been almost eliminated. Separate ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) measurement further confirms that the role of FN-Br for the energy band adjustment. WFs of bare DFS, MAPbI 3 /DFS and MAPbI 3 /DFS:FN-Br are 4.8, 4.3, and 5.0 eV, respectively, according to the secondary electron cutoff spectrum (Figure2c; FigureS7, Supporting Information). The quantitative values of the WF measured by KPFM and UPS experiments are consistent with each other although they are carried out in different conditions (ambient condition vs ultrahigh voltage (UHV)). In addition, systematic KPFM measurements show that MAPbI 3 /DFS:FN-Br has a little deeper energy level with increasing the concentration of FN-Br (FigureS8, Supporting Information), approaching to energy alignment in Scheme 1c.Adv.

Stable perovskite solar cells using tin acetylacetonate based electron transporting layers †
Organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites with over 23% power conversion efficiency have attracted enormous academic and industrial attention due to their low-cost fabrication and high device performance. Self-passivated tin oxide as an electron transport layer has shown potential mainly due to the enhanced electron transfer, stability and reduced hysteresis device features. Here we report on novel, non-colloidal tin oxide precursors based on acetylacetonate (one halide free and two halogenated with Cl and Br respectively). We explore the unique film morphology acquired from the non-colloidal precursors and the improved device performance they yield. Our results show that the halide residue in the films plays an impactful role in the thermal durability of the fabricated SnO 2 film, as well as providing a passivation layer. Moreover, our optimized tin oxide films achieved an unprecedented power conversion efficiency of 22.19% in planar perovskite solar cells (21.4% certified by Newport), and once upscaled to large-area modules, 16.7% devices based on a 15 cm 2 area were achieved. 
 Broader context Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are efficient photovoltaic devices composed of a light absorbing layer which is sandwiched between two charge extracting layers. Passivated tin oxide is extensively used as an electron extracting layer due to its excellent optoelectronic properties. Here, we fabricate high-performing passivated tin oxide films with three novel metalorganic precursors based on acetylacetonate complexes. We demonstrate with various tools the film morphology, optoelectronic properties, and elemental analysis yielded with each precursor and correlated with the device performance. Our champion devices obtained a 22.19% and 16.7% power conversion efficiency for small-sized cells and 15 cm 2 mini-module devices, respectively.
Introduction Hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells are swiftly emerging as standalone photovoltaic technology. Since the first study by Kojima et al., the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has undergone rapid improvement from 3.8% to over 23% in under a decade of development.  [1] [2] [3]  The high efficiency attained from perovskite materials is due to their excellent optoelectronic properties, which were optimized by adjusting the composition and ratio of cations and anions within the perovskite lattice.  4, 5  These compositionally engineered, photoactive perovskite layers can be deposited using either one or two step solution processable methods.  [6] [7] [8] 15, 22  In addition to the perovskite composition, the horizon of research has expanded to enhancing the electron transporting layer (ETL),  [9] [10] [11]  perovskite absorber and hole transporting layers (HTL)  12, 13  and implementing scalable fabrication techniques.  14  For TiO 2 based ETLs, relatively high resistivity is known to cause insufficient charge separation at the compact TiO 2 (c-TiO 2 )/perovskite interface.  [16] [17] [18]  Therefore, an additional layer of mesoporous TiO 2 (mp-TiO 2 ) is usually adopted to complement the deficient charge collection.  [16] [17] [18]  Recently, SnO 2 based electron transporting layers have been extensively used due to SnO 2 's high conductivity and superior charge collection ability compared to TiO 2 ETLs.  [19] [20] [21]  SnO 2 has a wide bandgap ranging between 3.6 and 4.1 eV, and its favourable conduction band edge in relation to perovskites makes SnO 2 a good candidate to overcome challenges which occur particularly with c-TiO 2 ETLs.  23  Previously, low-temperature processes were mostly used to form SnO 2 layers to avoid pin-holes on an FTO or ITO substrate with a rough film surface. However, the metal-like nature shown in degenerate semiconductors, i.e., the carrier density of non-doped SnO 2 is ca. 10 20 cm À3 (in the range of semimetals), seems to generate another serious shunting pathway, decreasing the fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (V oc ).  25, 26  We have demonstrated previously that the low PCE is due to the deteriorated hole-blocking ability of the SnO 2 ETL caused by loss of self-passivating materials such as SnOCl 2 and residual precursor of tetrakis-dimethyl-amine-tin (TDMASn).  21, 24  By using different precursors and depositing them with various techniques such as spin-coating and atomic layer deposition methods, we proved the advantages of the low-temperature process are not limited to preventing pin-holes but also include electrically passivating the SnO 2 ETL.  21, 24  In this work, we investigated the film and device performance for planar-type perovskite solar cells using tin acetylacetonate based precursors for SnO 2 . To better understand the role of halides, one of the chosen precursors is halide-free and two are based on chloride and bromide respectively. The optimized devices achieved a high efficiency of 22.19% in a small-size cell and 16.73% in a large area 15 cm 2 module. 
 Device structure Fig.  1  shows the device architecture of a planar perovskite solar cell consisting of fluorine-doped SnO 2 (FTO)/c-TiO 2 /SnO 2 / perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/gold layers. In our previous work, we confirmed that the 'Type 1' passivation ETL by combining a c-TiO 2 underlayer with the passivated tin oxide (PTO) top layer provides better hole-blocking ability than a single passivated SnO 2 layer, which resulted in the further enhanced PCE.  21, 24  For tin oxide layers, we investigated three metalorganic tin precursors from the same family, tin(II) bis(acetylacetonate) (hereafter Acac), tin(IV) bis(acetylacetonate) dichloride (hereafter Cl 2 ) and tin(IV) bis(acetylacetonate) dibromide (hereafter Br 2 ), with DMF as a solvent. 
 Film and device characteristics The structure of the SnO 2 films is characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Films are prepared by dropping precursor solutions on a carbon support grid and heat-treating at 180 1C for 1 h in air. Pairs of bright field (BF) and dark field (DF) TEM images and corresponding selected area electron diffraction patterns (SAEDP) are presented in Fig.  2 . The SAEDP show reflections for [110], [101], [200], and [211] index planes for all films, corresponding to rutile-type SnO 2 . TEM images show that the films are comprised of small crystallites (o2 nm), as is further confirmed by high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images (Fig.  S2, ESI † ). The acquired TEM images and SAEDPs indicate the co-presence of short to medium range ordered regions in the SnO 2 films, a property which we previously observed in SnO 2 films prepared with e.g. colloidal SnCl 4  21  and atomic layer deposited   
 Paper Energy & Environmental Science To evaluate the compatibility for the ETL, we measured the photoluminescence (PL) of the bi-layered electron transporting layer (BETL)/perovskite films as seen in Fig.  3a . Despite differences in the PL intensity, all BETLs show a faster electron quenching efficiency than the c-TiO 2 film. According to the result, Acac shows the fastest quenching rate, and Cl 2 and Br 2 show slightly slower electron transfer as indicated by the PL peaks. Therefore, a higher PCE was expected with the Acac devices, but the device performance demonstrated in Fig.  3b  shows that the trend of the PL measurement does not match well with the device efficiency. The highest PCE is gained from the Cl 2 precursor due to the contribution of enhanced FF and V oc . For Br 2 , the high V oc is promising. However, the Br 2 devices show a relatively low FF and a slightly lower short-circuit current density ( J sc ) than c-TiO 2 . Unlike the PL result, we found that the Acac precursor may not contribute to distinct efficiency enhancement. To explain this observation, we utilized scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to examine the surface morphology of SnO 2 fabricated with Acac. The full-size image of the complete cells is shown in Fig.  S3 (ESI † ). Moreover, we performed absorbance and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) on SnO 2 samples spin-coated with perovskite as seen in Fig.  S4 (ESI † ) and examined the perovskite surface morphologies with SEM as seen in Fig.  S5 (ESI † ). The absorbance, XRD pattern and SEM imaging confirm that the perovskite films deposited on SnO 2 have roughly similar thickness and morphology regardless of the SnO 2 precursor. However, in the cross-sectional SEM images in Fig.  S5 (ESI † ), the Cl 2 and Br 2 films clearly show an increase in the SnO 2 film thickness. However, for the Acac devices, there is no observable increase of the ETL thickness when compared with the c-TiO 2 SEM cross-sectional image. Fig.  S6 (ESI † ) shows SEM top-view images of c-TiO 2 and c-TiO 2 /PTO films formed on the FTO substrate. The magnified images show all SnO 2 precursors form a thin and similarly uniform top layer over the c-TiO 2 underlayer. However, different film morphology can be observed for the SnO 2 prepared with Acac when the magnification is increased. Randomly distributed big particles potentially caused by the aggregation of the precursor are detected on the film surface. The particle sizes range from 1 to 2 mm in diameter and induce huge bumps on the perovskite film as seen in Fig.  S7  (ESI †). The poor morphology in Acac films could be due to the meta-stability of the tin oxidation state. For Acac, the Sn 2+ metal center is four coordinate with two bidentate acetylacetonate ligands. While for Cl 2 and Br 2 , the Sn 4+ metal atom is six coordinate with two bidentate acetylacetonate ligands and two monodentate halogen ligands. In this configuration, Sn 4+ is more likely to be stable in a DMF solution, unlike the case with Sn 2+ , which could be oxidized more readily in DMF. In a preliminary test, we found that Acac dissolves easily in DMF and forms a transparent solution, but starts to precipitate in a couple of hours as seen in Fig.  S7 (ESI † ). Whereas for Cl 2 and Br 2 dissolved in DMF, the solutions do not lose transparency over a month. For Acac, the bumps observed in Fig.  S7 (ESI † ) could potentially provide a shunting route particularly for planar-type cells by forming a thin PTO layer which increases the possibility of pinhole formation. These findings indicate that there are complex challenges associated with Acac in terms of film reproducibility and performance. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was further performed to characterize the Cl 2 and Br 2 films. Strong peaks at 486 and 494 eV attributed to Sn 4+ ions indicate the formation of SnO 2 as seen in Fig.  3d . A weak asymmetry shown in all spectra can be explained by Sn 2+ ions originating from oxygen vacancies (V oc ) on the SnO 2 surface, which are assumed to be the origin of the high conductivity of the SnO 2 film.  24  Strong asymmetry of the spectra indicating the presence of sub-bonds is also observed in the O 1s region (Fig.  3e ), which is associated with the binding energy for the O-S bond (Sn 4+ ) with higher intensity at 529.2 eV. The smaller peak at 530.5 eV can be associated with oxygen impurities such as OH ligands and water adsorption on the film.  27  In addition, we found a small peak assigned to Cl 2p at 197 eV from the Cl 2 film, and a strong peak of Br 3d at 68 eV from the Br 2 film. This is in good agreement with the result of EDX analysis in Fig.  S1  (ESI †). For the Cl 2 film, when varying the annealing temperature, the highest intensity peak of the film slightly decreases from 100 1C to 180 1C annealing. Moreover, the Cl bond peak is still present at 220 1C but is significantly minimized. A similar trend is observed from the Br 2 film, however, it is noteworthy that the intensity of the Br 3d peak remains strong even when annealing at 220 1C. To find the optimal annealing temperature, we carefully prepared SnO 2 films between 160 1C and 350 1C for Cl 2 and Br 2 . Fig.  4a  shows a statistical summary of the device efficiency with respect to temperature. The best PCE is found at 200 1C for Cl 2 , while the highest PCE is obtained at 220 1C for the Br 2 device. It should be noted that the Br 2 devices show a relatively gentle drop of PCEs at high temperatures while the Cl 2 devices demonstrate a steep decrease after the maximum value. Both devices show a rapid increase of J sc according to the ramping of the temperatures until the maximum J sc is reached (close to 24 mA cm À2 at 200 1C). An analogous trend is observed in the FF. Although a high FF is shown with the 160 1C devices, we found a severe drop of electron transfer as seen in Fig.  S8 (ESI † ). Here, it is noteworthy to remember the film formation of the tin oxide layer from SnCl 4 and other chloride-based precursors.  18, 19  Unlike Cl 2 /Br 2 precursors in DMF, SnCl 4 immediately reacts with H 2 O to form SnO 2 nanoparticles and amorphous SnOCl 2 which are not reversibly dissolved in water, indicating the solution is in fact colloidal.  18  As with water-based colloidal SnO 2 precursors i.e., AlfaAesar 15% SnO 2 , an impressively low temperature processing is required, 150 1C.  20  However, surface passivation can potentially occur by SnOCl 2 and base sources potentially added for stable dispersion of the colloid, i.e. NaOH, KOH,  28  if SnO 2 nanoparticles are synthesized using chlorine based tin precursors (Fig.  S9, ESI † ). Therefore, despite a lower device performance, the film contains more crystalline SnO 2 , therefore no current loss (decrease of J sc ) is found despite film drying at 100 1C. However, the Cl 2 /Br 2 precursors do not visibly react with DMF and sustain their solution form, which means smaller or fewer SnO 2 crystallites can be formed at low temperatures, and more residual precursor exists on the film, which can cause higher series resistance at low-temperature annealing. This explains the reason for the different behaviour shown in Fig.  4a  and b . With the same reason, a high V oc is measured for the 160 1C film probably caused by electron accumulation. An unexpected result is found from the V oc trend of the Br 2 devices. A gradual drop of V oc is seen when increasing the annealing temperature beyond 250 1C. Nevertheless, the Br 2 devices maintain a V oc over 1.1 V even at 350 1C. This result implies that the bromide residue is more strongly bound to the film than the chloride counterpart, even at exceptionally high annealing temperature. Further statistical comparison with mp-TiO 2 based cells is summarized in Fig.  S10 (ESI † ). To supplement this analogy thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted and is displayed in Fig.  4b . For both Cl 2 and Br 2 the precursors start to lose weight at ca. 150 1C, mainly attributed to thermal decomposition. For Cl 2 , roughly 90% of weight is lost by crystallization at 250 1C, followed by a gradual weight drop implying complete removal of Cl on the film. Br 2 shows rather slower weight loss, and the conversion to SnO 2 appears to finish roughly at 300 1C. The subsequent drop that goes up to 500 1C can be attributed to removal of residual Br. Considering Cl sublimes more easily than Br, this finding is reasonable. The TGA curves further support the result and agree well with the EDX and XPS results. J-V curves at the optimal conditions are depicted in Fig.  4c . PTO layers clearly show better PCEs. The highest PCE of 21.12% is obtained from Cl 2 . A bit lower PCE is measured with Br 2 , but it also shows a high PCE over 20%, which is still higher than that with a single c-TiO 2 ETL. We confirmed the optimized bi-layered c-TiO 2 /PTO layers show lower PL emission than the 180 1C films (Fig.  4d ). We measured the reflectance of the films, and the optical bandgap (E g ) was calculated by applying the Kubelka-Munk (F(R)) method  27  by plotting (F(R) Â hn) 2 as a function of energy. Subsequently, an E g of 3.92 and 3.93 eV for Cl 2 and Br 2 respectively was estimated (Fig.  4e ). Fermi-levels (E f ) were measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), confirming that both Cl 2 and Br 2 films have the same E f of 4.21 eV. The E g and E f estimations imply that the Cl 2 and Br 2 films possess similar optical and electronic properties. Additionally, the c-TiO 2 /Cl 2 ETL was tested for a monolithic series module, and a 16.73% PCE was obtained with a 15 cm 2 aperture area (Fig.  S11, ESI † ). The champion small cell was fabricated using a two-step deposition method for the perovskite.  15  The best device seen in Fig.  5a  shows promising photovoltaic values in a planar structure with a J sc of 24.78 mA cm À2 , a V oc of 1.13 V, a FF of 0.79, and a PCE of 22.19% under 1 sunlight illumination conditions when scanned backward. With forward scanning, the values are slightly lower, and very small J-V curve hysteresis is measured in a planartype device. We assume the better PCE is from extended light absorption and enhanced perovskite film quality as seen in the EQE and SEM top-view images (Fig.  S12  and S13, ESI †). We confirmed the J sc value from the solar simulator agrees with the calculated J sc . The device shows excellent performance in the stabilized condition measurement (Fig.  5b ). We also found BETL based  
 Conclusions We investigated the film and device performance with noncolloidal SnO 2 precursors based on acetylacetonate, namely tin(II) acetylacetonate (Acac), tin(IV) bis(acetylacetonate) dichloride (Cl 2 ) and tin(IV) bis(acetylacetonate) dibromide (Br 2 ). We have confirmed with TEM the presence of rutile type SnO 2 in the film with varying degrees of crystallinity, contributing to self-passivation and improved device performance. Moreover, while the Acac precursor produced randomly sized and distributed SnO 2 crystallites, Cl 2 and Br 2 produced dense SnO 2 films with a passivating, halogenated by-product. In addition, we demonstrated the ability of Br 2 to retain the V oc of the devices with up to 350 1C annealing post-treatment due to the delayed sublimation of the bromide by-product as confirmed with TGA. This finding could extend the application of passivated tin oxide to high-temperature processed perovskites such as lead-free CsSnI 3 . Ultimately, we confirm the importance of surface passivation for SnO 2 , specifically for perovskite solar cell applications due to its metal-like nature.  
 Film characterization XRD analysis was carried out using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer in an angle range of 2y = 101 to 401. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were carried out on a ZEISS Merlin at 5 kV, and images were acquired by an in-lens secondary electron detector. Transmission electron microscopy imaging and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis were performed on a FEI Tecnai Osiris at 200 kV. This microscope is equipped with a high brightness X-FEG gun and silicon drift Super-X EDX detectors and Bruker Esprit acquisition software. Samples for TEM imaging were prepared via depositing the SnO 2 film on a TEM grid with a carbon support film. The TEM grids were then heat-treated at 180 1C. XPS analysis was done using equipment (a Quantum 2000 system) with an Al Ka X-ray source (hn: 1487 eV) and a hemispherical electron analyzer. The XPS results provide average chemical information on a spatial area of 100 mm diameter and a depth of 5-10 nm. Absorbance and reflectance were measured with an integrating sphere using UV/vis/NIR spectroscopy (PerkinElmer Lambda 950S). The photoluminescence emission was measured with a fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer LS 55). TGA analysis (TGA 4000 PerkinElmer) was done at a scan rate of 10 1C min À1 from 30 1C to 500 1C. The UPS measurements were performed using a home-made photoemission spectroscopy system, which consists of an ultraviolet source (VUV 5000) and an electron analyzer (SES-100) in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber. A He II source of 40.8 eV, controlled using a monochromator, enables us to obtain precise electronic structures from UPS spectra. 
 Device measurement The solar cell measurement was done using an Oriel solar simulator (450 W xenon, AAA class). The light intensity was calibrated with a Si reference cell equipped with an IR-cutoff filter (KG3, Newport), and it was recorded prior to measurement. Current-voltage characteristics of the cells were obtained by applying an external voltage bias while measuring the current response with a digital source meter (Keithley 2400). The voltage scan rate was 100 mV s À1 and no device preconditioning, such as light soaking or forward voltage bias applied for a long time, was applied before starting the measurement. The cells were masked with an active area of 0.16 or 0.89 cm 2 to fix the active area and reduce the influence of the scattered light. The EQE was measured with an IQE200B (Oriel) without bias light. TDMASn 24  at low temperature. We monitored the composition of the films using energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry in scanning TEM mode (EDXS-STEM). High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM images and corresponding EDXS elemental maps (Fig.S1, ESI †) indicate that the layers formed from all the precursors are comprised of Sn and O elements, as well as residual halogenated by-product, after post-annealing at 180 1C for Cl 2 and Br 2 films. High-resolution TEM images are shown in Fig.S2 (ESI †). For the Acac film, plenty of pinholes and randomly sized crystallites are observed. On the other hand, other precursor films have compact surfaces with an average crystallite size of around 2 nm and 1 nm respectively for Cl 2 and Br 2 films.

 Cl 2 and Br 2 are proved to provide excellent surface passivation to enhance the hole-blocking ability. The champion cell achieved a PCE of 22.19% and was obtained using Cl 2 .

Film and device fabrication FTO glass substrates (Nippon sheet glass) were sequentially cleaned with detergent and ethanol. A compact TiO 2 layer was coated by spray pyrolysis deposition on the cleaned FTO substrates heated at 450 1C. SnO 2 layers are prepared by spin- coating a precursor solution of tin acetylacetonate based pre- cursors dissolved in dimethylformamide. 0.1 M SnCl 4 aqueous solution was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 10 s on the substrates to get a B20 nm thickness. Then the substrates were transferred onto a hotplate and heated between 160 1C and 350 1C for 1 h and cooled down. The (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 precursor solution was prepared by mixing PbI 2 (1.15 M, TCI), PbBr 2 (0.2 M, TCI), FAI (1.05 M, Dyesol), and MABr (0.2 M, Dyesol) in a mixed solvent of DMF : DMSO = 4 : 1 (volume ratio). The precursor solution was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s and continuously at 5000 rpm for 30 s. During the second step, 100 mL of chlorobenzene was poured on the film at 15 s. Films are post- annealed at 100 1C for 60 min. For the two-step deposition method, PbI 2 (1.3 M) containing 2.5 mol% PbBr 2 was dissolved in 1 mL of DMF and DMSO (ratio = 4 : 1) solution at 80 1C. Then the solution was spin coated on the SnO 2 substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and a mixture solution of FAI : MABr : MACl (80 : 10 : 10 mg in 1 mL IPA) was spin coated on the PbI 2 substrate at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Films were annealed at 150 1C for 25 min and 100 1C for 30 min. Finally, spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 25 s. The 70 mM spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving in chloro- benzene with 4-tert-butylpyridine, Li-TFSI in acetonitrile, and Co[t-BuPyPz] 3 [TFSI] 3 (FK209, Dyesol) in acetonitrile at a molar ratio of spiro : FK209 : Li-TFSI : TBP of 1 : 0.03 : 0.5 : 3.3.

23.7% Efficient inverted perovskite solar cells by dual interfacial modification
Despite remarkable progress, the performance of lead halide perovskite solar cells fabricated in an inverted structure lags behind that of standard architecture devices. Here, we report on a dual interfacial modification approach based on the incorporation of large organic cations at both the bottom and top interfaces of the perovskite active layer. Together, this leads to a simultaneous improvement in both the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of the devices, reaching maximum values of 1.184 V and 85%, respectively, resulting in a champion device efficiency of 23.7%. This dual interfacial modification is fully compatible with a bulk modification of the perovskite active layer by ionic liquids, leading to both efficient and stable inverted architecture devices.
INTRODUCTION Metal halide perovskites have experienced a rapid progress in highimpact optoelectronics, with particularly notable advances made in the field of perovskite photovoltaics  (1) (2) (3) . In single-junction devices, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 25.5% have been demonstrated to date  (4) . The record efficiency devices follow the standard device architecture, in which the perovskite active layer is deposited on top of an electron transport layer (ETL) such as titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) or tin oxide (SnO 2 ) and is then coated with a hole transport layer (HTL)  (5) (6) (7) . Despite tremendous interest in inverted architecture perovskite solar cells-in which the order of charge extracting layers is inversed-the PCE of these devices lags behind, with maximum values rarely approaching 23%  (8, 9) . For a detailed overview over the recent progress in inverted architecture perovskite solar cells, the readers are referred to several excellent reviews on the topic  (10, 11) . The generally lower performance of inverted architecture perovskite solar cells is mainly associated with a reduced current extraction and nonradiative recombination losses that limit the device photovoltage and fill factor (FF)  (12, 13) . The development of strategies to overcome these limitations has been subject to intense research, including interface and bulk passivation of traps, such as crystallographic defects, point defects, or higher-dimensional defects (at grain boundaries)  (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) . Predominantly, these approaches led to an improvement in device performance due to increased open-circuit voltage (V OC ), with FFs remaining in the range of 75 to 80%. This highlights the need to develop new methods that would simultaneously improve the V OC and the FF of inverted architecture devices. Here, we demonstrate an innovative strategy for the dual modification of both the HTL/perovskite and perovskite/ ETL interfaces by introducing a series of large organic cations (Fig.  1A ): 2-phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI), 4-chlorophenylethylammonium iodide (Cl-PEAI), and 4-fluorophenylethylammonium iodide (F-PEAI) in both these interfaces. Despite this class of cations being commonly used for the formation of low-dimensional perovskites  (23) (24) (25) (26) , in our work, we adopt a different strategy and use a very low concentration to modify both interfaces of inverted perovskite solar cells. We find that this approach does not change the bulk perovskite crystal structure or its dimensionality but rather improves the interfaces by facilitating high-quality film formation on top of the HTL and inducing efficient defect passivation at the perovskite/ETL interface. We show that the modification of the buried bottom interface leads to a more homogeneous film formation and the elimination of nanovoids at the perovskite/HTL interface. These improvements result in a significant increase in the FF accompanied by a small increase in the shortcircuit current (J SC ). The modification of the top perovskite surface, on the other hand, leads to its efficient passivation, resulting in a substantial increase in the V OC . The implementation of both modifications at the same time results in a simultaneous increase in all of the photovoltaic parameters leading to a superior device performance. As a result, we achieve a high PCE of 23.7%, with a net improvement of device V OC up to 1.184 V and very high FF of 85%. 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 Dual interfacial modification approach In developing the approach for the dual optimization of the perovskite active layer interfaces, we focused on integrating the modification into deposition steps that are already present in the device fabrication of reference devices. In the case of the HTL/perovskite interface, the highly hydrophobic nature of poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) amine] (PTAA)  (27, 28)  HTL makes it necessary to perform a prewashing step before the deposition of the perovskite precursor solution in which the solvent N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) is spin-coated atop the PTAA layer  (29) . This has been shown to improve the wettability of the perovskite precursor solution on PTAA, allowing for the formation of the perovskite active layer. To modify this interface, we introduce the various PEAI cations (Fig.  1A ) into the DMF solution used for the prewash step at a 20 mM concentration. Following the prewash step that either contains (HTL-modified) or does not contain (reference) the PEAI cation, the perovskite solution is deposited as previously reported using the solvent engineering approach  (30) . To trigger the crystallization of the perovskite layer, an antisolvent is dispensed onto the 2 of 9 perovskite solution shortly before the end of the spin-coating step. For the modification of the top surface (ETL-modified), we introduce the PEAI cations into the antisolvent at a low concentration of 0.5 mM and complete the layer fabrication by thermal annealing. These steps are schematically summarized in Fig.  1B . Considering that each of the modifications can be introduced on its own, we used this approach to fabricate four types of devices (Fig.  1C ): reference, HTL-modified, ETL-modified, and dual HTL + ETLmodified, which enable us to study the effect of each interface separately. 
 HTL/perovskite interface modification by PEAI cations The introduction of the PEAI cations into the DMF wash step leads to an improvement in the photovoltaic performance, which can be seen in Fig.  2  (A to D). While no change in the V OC can be observed, a small increase in the J SC is observed and a significant increase in FF. Together, these changes lead to an overall increase in the performance and a narrower distribution of the PCE. To investigate the origin of this increase in FF, we characterized the microstructure of the perovskite layers by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Topview SEM images acquired on reference perovskite layers (deposited on DMF-washed PTAA) exhibit a typical microstructure for triple cation perovskites, which consists of perovskite grains in the range of several hundreds of nanometers and small amount of excess lead iodide, which appears brighter in the SEM images (Fig.  2E ). Nanosized pinholes (marked in circles) are also visible between some of the grains. Cross-sectional SEM reveals that small voids are also formed at the interface between the perovskite layer and the DMFwashed PTAA. On the other hand, samples that include an PEAI cation in the DMF wash step (Fig.  2 , F to H) compact layers with no observable pinholes. This is also supported by the cross-sectional SEM images that show a continuous interface between the PTAA and the perovskite layers for the HTL-modified samples. Such a continuous and more intimate interface is expected to improve the efficiency of interfacial charge extraction and increase the shunt resistance of the photovoltaic devices. A similar effect has been  S C I E N C E A D V A N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E 4 of 9 previously observed in standard architecture devices, where the introduction of a self-assembled monolayer at the perovskite/ZnO interface led to a much-improved microstructure and an enhanced charge extraction  (31) . Recently, it has also been shown that reducing the voids formed at the buried interfaces of blade-coated perovskites also improves the photovoltaic performance of perovskite modules  (32) . Thus, our observation of a small increase in the extracted current density and the significantly enhanced FF of the PEAI cation HTL-modified photovoltaic devices is a result of the improved microstructure of perovskite layers formed on the PEAI cation-treated PTAA. This optimized interface to the PTAA HTL increases the shunt resistance of the solar cells (fig.  S1 ), leading to an enhanced FF. The improvements in the microstructure suggest that the inclusion of the PEAI cations in the DMF wash step leads to a modification of the PTAA surface. This is confirmed by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements performed on PTAA and modified PTAA (Fig.  2 , I to L). All of the samples show the characteristic C 1s and N 1s peaks associated with the PTAA polymer, the latter appearing at a binding energy of 399.5 eV, as expected from a triarylamine unit  (33) . The presence of the PEAI cation on the PTAA after the DMF wash step is confirmed by the appearance of an additional N 1s peak at 401.8 eV, a I 3d doublet, and in the case of Cl-PEAI and F-PEAI, also the Cl 2p and F 1s signals. The atomic concentrations are summarized in table  S1 . This corroborates that a certain amount of the PEAI cations is left on top of the PTAA layer after the PEAI cation/DMF washing step. The presence of such organic salts-which are known to be polar-on top of the normally hydrophobic PTAA layer leads to an increase in its surface energy and consequently, a better wetting by the perovskite solution. This can be directly observed during the deposition procedure: The perovskite solution wets better the PEAI cation/DMF-washed PTAA than the pure DMF-washed PTAA (fig.  S2 ). The improved wetting leads to an improved microstructure of the perovskite layer and the elimination of nanovoids at the perovskite/HTL interface. We note that the presence of the PEAI cations at the PTAA/perovskite interface does not change the energetic alignment at this interface, as is confirmed by ultraviolet (UV) photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) measurements (fig.  S3 ). The fact that the perovskite layer is deposited from a solution of DMF and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mixture-which can dissolve the PEAI cations-raises the question of whether any cations are left at that interface after the deposition of the perovskite layer. To simulate this scenario, but still have excess to probe the PTAA surface via XPS, we rinsed the halogenated PEAI-modified PTAA layers with a solvent mixture of DMF:DMSO (4:1) without the perovskite precursors. As can be seen in fig.  S4 , a small I 3d and Cl 2p/F 1s signal is observed in the rinsed samples, which demonstrates that a small fraction of PEAI cations remains on the surface and is not washed away. We note that the second, high binding energy species of iodine is associated with a small amount of elemental iodine at the surface of the sample. To estimate the fraction of remaining PEAI cations, we compare the atomic % of the marker F and Cl elements in the rinsed samples as compared to the data collected on the samples before the rinsing (table  S1 ). We find that the atomic % is reduced from approximately 2 to 0.2% suggesting that only 10% of the PEAI cations remain on the PTAA surface after the rinsing with DMF:DMSO. We note that this experiment differs slightly from the case in which a perovskite layer is deposited atop the modified PTAA since, in that case, the perovskite precursors are available to react with the PEAI cations and potentially a slightly larger fraction of these cations will remain at that buried interface, so our estimate represents a lower boundary to the amount of PEAI cations at that interface. However, we highlight that the role of PEAI cations at the bottom interface is related to their impact on the wettability of the PTAA layer, which is greatly improved due to their polar nature. The improved wettability prevents the formation of nanovoids and results in a more uniform and homogeneous interface between the perovskite and the PTAA layer. Even if most of the cations are dissolved in DMF and washed away during the spin-coating, their function was already achieved by improving the perovskite film formation process. 
 Perovskite/ETL interface modification by PEAI cations To examine the effect of introducing the PEAI cations into the antisolvent step, we fabricated devices in which the HTL was left unmodified. Figure  3  (A to D) displays the photovoltaic performance parameters of the devices that clearly demonstrate that the modification leads to a significant increase in V OC and FF. Such an improvement is typically associated with a passivation of the three-dimensional (3D) perovskite interface by a two-dimensional (2D) perovskite formed upon the introduction of large organic spacer cations  (34) (35) (36) . To investigate whether a separate 2D perovskite layer is formed, we performed x-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments on the reference and PEAI cation-modified perovskite layers (Fig.  3E ). Indexing the diffraction reflections (fig.  S5 ) reveals that only contributions from the 3D perovskites are observed. Since we observe no diffraction reflections that are associated with a 2D perovskite, it suggests that either no 2D perovskite layers are formed or it is below the detection limit of XRD. Similarly, no evidence of 2D perovskite is observed in UV-visible absorption measurements (fig.  S6 ). Surface and crosssectional SEM images (fig.  S7 ) also do not display any evidence supporting the formation of a surface 2D perovskite layer. Moreover, should a 2D perovskite layer were to form at the perovskite/ ETL interface, its low electron affinity would hinder the electron extraction into the  [6, 6] -phenyl-C 60 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) ETL; however, no such effect is observed since the J SC remains largely unchanged (Fig.  3B ). These results, together with the fact that only a very small amount of PEAI cations is introduced during the antisolvent step, suggest that it is insufficient to form a separate 2D perovskite layer. We note that the concentration of PEAI cations in the antisolvent step can be easily controlled. In fig.  S8 , we show the performance of photovoltaic devices fabricated with varying amounts of F-PEAI (0.01, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/ml). We find that the concentration (0.5 mg/ml) resulted in the optimal performance, which is why we selected to use it throughout the study. Increasing the concentration to 1 mg/ml led to a decreased performance, with a significant drop in both the J SC and FF. We believe that at this concentration, a thin layer of 2D could form atop the 3D perovskite layer, which would lead to a reduced electron extraction due to the high bandgap of the 2D perovskite layer. A possible reason for the increase in V OC can be a change in the energetic alignment at the perovskite/PCBM interface by the presence of PEAI cations  (37) . UPS measurements show, however, that no changes in the energetic levels of PEAI-modified perovskite layers occur (fig.  S9 ). These results and the absence of a 2D perovskite layer suggest that the increase in V OC is associated with a passivation of Downloaded from  https://www.science.org  at University of California San Diego on November 07, 2024 the interface to the ETL by the PEAI cations  (14) . Photoluminescence (PL) measurements confirm that the PL quantum efficiency (PLQE) of the perovskite films is significantly enhanced in films that were modified by including the PEAI cations in the antisolvent (Fig.  3F ). The PLQE of the reference film is 7%, while that of the modified films is more than doubled at 14 to 16% (fig.  S10 ). This increase in PLQE suggests that the modified perovskite films exhibit suppressed nonradiative losses, leading to an increase in their V OC . The incorporation of the PEAI cations via the antisolvent quenching step raises an important question regarding their distribution in the perovskite layer. XPS measurements performed on the reference and modified perovskite films confirmed that the PEAI cations are present in the modified perovskite layers (table  S2 ). To investigate whether the PEAI cations are located exclusively at the surface of the films or also in their bulk, we monitored the amounts of Cl and F in the Cl-PEAI-and F-PEAI-containing samples via XPS depth profiling (Fig.  3, G  and H ). It can be seen that already after 20 to 30 s of etching using an argon cluster ion beam, the Cl 2p and F 1s signals are diminished. Considering the slow etching rate by the argon clusters (1.08 nm/min), a 30-s etching duration would remove less than 1 nm from the surface, thus confirming that the PEAI cations are exclusively located at the surface of the perovskite layers and there passivate the perovskite surface defects at the interface to the ETL. 
 Combined interfacial modification of both interfaces Having examined the effects on each interface separately, it is important to explore whether both modifications can be combined in a single device. To test this, dual modified perovskite solar cells were fabricated and characterized (fig.  S11 ). We observe that dual modified devices combine the improvements observed at each interface, resulting in a number of devices with PCE above 22% and a maximum value of 23%. Moreover, for such a dual interfacial modification to find broad use in inverted architecture solar cells, its efficacy needs to be examined in combination with a modification of the bulk of the perovskite layer  (38, 39) . For example, recent reports suggest that the introduction of ionic liquids into the perovskite active layer can significantly increase their stability  (40) (41) (42) . To explore this, we fabricated photovoltaic devices that combine both interfacial optimizations shown above along with the introduction of an ionic liquid (piperidinium salt [BMP] + [BF 4 ] -) into the perovskite active layer. Figure  4  (A to D) displays the photovoltaic parameters of the devices. In addition, in this case, we observe that both interfacial modifications can be successfully combined to increase simultaneously the V OC , J SC , and FF of the devices. The V OC of the F-PEAI and Cl-PEAI devices was particularly high, reaching a maximum of 1.184 V. Similarly, the FF of these devices was also higher, reaching a maximum of 85%. Together, these improvements have led to high PCE reaching a maximum of 23.7% for the F-PEAImodified device (Fig.  4E ). The photovoltaic performance of the champion devices of each type is summarized in Table  1 . Devices fabricated using F-PEAI cations consistently outperformed those made using the other derivatives. We believe that this is associated with the fact that a larger quantity of F-PEAI remains at both the HTL and ETL interface as evidenced, for example, by the higher atomic % of F at both these interfaces as compared to Cl. We propose that this is associated with differences in the solubility of the PEAI cations. We observe that F-PEAI cations are less soluble in the antisolvent (fig.  S12 ), thus they will precipitate of solution earlier during the drying process of the antisolvent, thus resulting in a larger overall amount remaining on the surface. We note that the biggest contribution to the increased performance comes from the increase in V OC . This is also evident from PLQE and electroluminescence QE (ELQE) measurements performed on  S C I E N C E A D V A N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E 6 of 9 representative solar cells (Fig.  4, F  and G ). The PLQE of reference devices is very low at 0.14%. On the other hand, F-PEAI-modified devices reach a value of ~1%. Similarly, the ELQE of the devices is increased by a factor of ~4 at current injection equivalent to J SC , confirming a significant decrease in nonradiative losses in the dual modified devices (see fig.  S13  for J-V-L measurements). The minor increase in J SC is consistent with an improved charge extraction due to the more homogeneous, void-free perovskite/PTAA interface. This is also supported by our observation that the dependence of V OC and J SC on light intensity is not affected by the dual interfacial modification, as both the reference and the modified device (fig.  S14,  A  and B ) display the same slope, thus suggesting that the bulk recombination in both cases is very similar. However, examining the photocurrent decay (fig.  S14C ) shows that it is faster in the case of the modified device, suggesting an improved charge extraction. The integration of ionic liquids into the active layer leads to an excellent stability of the dual passivated devices. For example, Fig.  4H  displays the evolution of the PCE of both the reference and PEAI cation dual modified devices under continuous illumination in N 2 . It can be seen that the reference device is very stable, maintaining 90% of its initial performance after 2000 min of continuous illumination. The dual passivated devices, however, are even more stable, maintaining their original performance for the entire duration of the experiment. Examining the evolution of all the photovoltaic parameters (fig.  S15 ) reveals that the loss in the performance of the reference device originates from a loss in J SC , possibly as a result of degradation at the perovskite/HTL interface mediated by the presence of nanovoids at that interface  (30) . No deterioration in any of the photovoltaic parameters is observed for any of the dual modified devices. The observation that the dual interfacial modification approach developed here is fully compatible with the integration of ionic liquids into the perovskite active layer is highly promising for the application of this methodology for further development of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells in an inverted architecture. It is important to explore the applicability of the dual modification approach for the fabrication of other types of inverted architecture solar cells. The increasing recent interest in methylammonium (MA)-free perovskite compositions  (9, 43, 44)  motivated us to examine whether the performance of Cs 0.1 FA 0.9 PbI 2.9 Br 0.1 inverted architecture solar cells can also be enhanced by dual modification with PEAI cations. Figure  S16  displays the photovoltaic performance of the devices, which, similar to the results on triple cation perovskite solar cells, exhibit a significant improvement in all of their photovoltaic parameters. These results confirm that the approach can be easily translated to the fabrication of inverted architecture solar cells based on other perovskite compositions. It is of potential interest to investigate whether the dual modification approach can be applied also to standard architecture photovoltaic devices. To preliminarily examine this, we fabricated devices with the architecture glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/SnO 2 /perovskite/ SpiroOMeTAD/Au and performed the same interfacial modification procedure as described above with the PEAI cation. The photovoltaic results show that, while not fully optimized, the dual modified device performs significantly better than the reference ones (fig.  S17 ), particularly due to an enhancement in their V OC and FF. This suggests that our approach can be applicable also to standard architecture solar cells. The observation that the dual modification approach can significantly increase the FF of the devices can be particularly useful in the case of large-area solar cells, which are known to suffer from low FFs  (45) . To investigate this, we fabricated devices with an area of  S C I E N C E A D V A N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E 7 of 9 70 mm 2 , significantly larger than the small-area devices shown above (4.5 mm 2 ). We find that the dual modification approach is entirely applicable to large-area devices, with significant enhancements observed in all the photovoltaic parameters as compared to the reference device (fig.  S18  and table  S3 ). We observe a major increase in the FF of the devices, suggesting that our approach can be used also for the fabrication of large-area solar cells. In summary, we present a dual interfacial modification approach by integrating large organic cations at both the electron and HTL interfaces. We find that modification of the bottom interface leads to an improved wettability, which eliminates the formation of nanovoids at the interface with the HTL. The modification of the top perovskite surface leads to its efficient passivation and a reduction in nonradiative recombination losses. These two different mechanisms for improved photovoltaic performance can be combined to achieve a simultaneous improvement in all the photovoltaic parameters. Moreover, the dual modification approach can be easily combined with the incorporation of ionic liquids into the perovskite active layer, thus leading to both efficient and stable devices, reaching a maximum power conversion efficiency of 23.7%. 
 MATERIALS AND METHODS Unless otherwise stated, all materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Alfa Aesar and used as received. Perovskite films and devices were fabricated using PbI 2 and PbBr 2 (99.99% purity) purchased from TCI, organic halide salts were purchased from Great-Cell Solar, and cesium iodide (99.99% purity) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. The poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The PC 61 BM was purchased from Solenne. The bathocuproine (BCP; sublimed grade, 99.99% purity) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the anhydrous solvents were purchased from Acros Organics. 
 Perovskite film preparation and device fabrication Prepatterned ITO/glass substrates were sequentially cleaned with acetone and 2-propanol (IPA) by ultrasonication for 15 min in each solvent. The ITO/glass substrates were then dried with N 2 and treated with oxygen plasma at 100 mW for 10 min. The HTL and the perovskite films were fabricated in a drybox (relative humidity (RH) <1%), while the ETL and the contacts were deposited inside a glovebox filled with inert atmosphere N 2 . For reference devices, an HTL of ∼10nm thickness made of PTAA with a concentration of 1.5 mg ml -1 dissolved in toluene was spin-coated at a speed of 2000 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 100°C for 10 min. After the annealing step, the samples were washed by DMF by spin-coating it on the prepared PTAA films at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The perovskite precursor solution (1.2 M) contained mixed cations (Pb, Cs, FA, and MA) and halides (I and Br) dissolved in a solvent mixture (DMF/DMSO = 4/1) according to a formula of Cs 0.05 (FA 5/6 MA 1/6 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 with an excess of PbI 2 of 1%. For devices containing an ionic liquid, a piperidinium salt [BMP] + [BF 4 ] -was dissolved in the perovskite solution at a molar ratio of 0.25 mole percent. The perovskite layer was deposited via a two-step spin-coating procedure with 1000 rpm for 12 s and 5000 rpm for 27 s. A mixture of antisolvents [chlorobenzene (CB)/IPA = 9/1, 150 l] was dripped on the spinning substrate during the 21 s of the second spin-coating step. Subsequently, the samples were annealed at 100°C for 30 min. The ETLs were dynamically deposited from a PC 61 BM solution (20 mg/ml in CB) and spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at the speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s (with a ramping speed of 1000 rpm/s) and annealed for 10 min at 100°C. Next, thin layers of BCP (0.5 mg/ml in IPA) were spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s (with a ramping rate of 1000 rpm/s) as hole blocking layers. The small-area devices with an area of 4.5 mm 2 were completed by thermally evaporating of Ag (80 nm). For large-area devices, Ag electrodes with an area of 70 mm 2 were thermally evaporated. The devices with modified interfaces were prepared by dissolving a small amount of the PEAI-cations in DMF (20 mM) used for washing the PTAA and in the mixture CB/ IPA (0.5 mM) used in the antisolvent step. For the fabrication of MAfree perovskite solar cells, a 1.1 M Cs 0.1 FA 0.9 PbI 2.9 Br 0.1 perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving powders of CsI, FAI, PbI 2 , and PbBr 2 in the molar ratio of 2:18:19:1 in 4:1 (v/v) DMF/DMSO. All other device fabrication steps were unchanged. Standard architecture devices were fabricated using the glass/ ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au architecture. SnO 2 nanoparticles (15% in a H 2 O colloidal dispersion, Alfa Aesar) were diluted in deionized water with the volume ratio of 1:2. The prepared SnO 2 solution was spin-coated on clean ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s. After annealing the samples at 180°C for 30 min in ambient air, the substrates were treated by UV ozone for 15 min and transferred into a drybox [<1% relative humidity (RH)] for further use. The perovskite layer was deposited as described above. Spiro-OMeTAD (99.8%; Borun New Material Technology Co. Ltd.) was dissolved in CB (80 mg/ml) with 28.8 l of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 l of Li-TFSI solution (520 mg/ml in acetonitrile) and spin-coated on top of the perovskite layer. Last, the devices were completed by thermally evaporating Au electrodes (80 nm).

Polymer-templated nucleation and crystal growth of perovskite films for solar cells with efficiency greater than 21%

O magnitude faster than the homogeneous nucleation due to the lowering of the nucleation free energy barrier  16  . On the other hand, PMMA slows down the perovskite crystal growth by forming an intermediate adduct with PbI 2 to allow the randomly formed nuclei to adjust their orientation to minimize the total Gibbs free energy and grow in the thermodynamically preferred orientation  17  . The cooperation of these two effects results in smooth perovskite films with fewer defects and larger oriented grains, enabling us to fabricate perovskite solar cells with a PCE over 21%. 
 Polymer-templated nucleation and crystal growth Although PMMA has been widely used as a moisture protection barrier on top of the back contact of PSCs or mixed with carbon nanotubes to form the hole collection layer  18  , it has so far not been employed to affect the formation of the perovskite itself during solution processing. We produce the mixed cation perovskite films in a single step from a solution of formamidinium iodide (FAI), PbI 2 , methylammonium bromide (MABr) and PbBr 2 in a mixed solvent of dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)  13, 19  . During the spin-coating of the perovskite solution, we introduce PMMA in a chlorobenzene/toluene mixture to template crystal formation and growth of the perovskite. The PMMA serves as a support to induce nucleation of small perovskite crystals and directs the ensuing growth of these crystals. By using this technique for film deposition we fabricate perovskite solar cells with the structure Au/ Spiro-OMeTAD[2,2,7,7-tetrakis(N,N -di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine) 9,9-spirobifluorene]/perovskite/mesoporous TiO 2 /compact TiO 2 / fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of which is shown in Fig.  1a . Employing this solar cell configuration, we achieve the best PCE of 21.6% with a PMMA concentration C PMMA = 0.6 mg ml -1 . The photovoltaic metrics of the device are as follows: short- circuit current density (J SC ) = 23.7 mA cm -2 , open-circuit voltage (V OC ) = 1.14 V, and fill factor (FF) = 0.78 (Fig.  1b ). One of the devices was sent for certification to Newport Corporation Technology and Application Center PV Lab, an accredited PV testing laboratory, confirming a PCE of 21.02% (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). The commonly observed hysteresis  20  is virtually negligible in our devices, as confirmed by J-V curves shown in Fig.  1b . A histogram of two batches of cells (Supplementary Fig.  2  and Table  1 ) indicates excellent reproducibility with an average PCE of 21.0%. Preliminary stability investigations show that the unsealed devices containing PMMA are stable, showing only a 3.3% decay in PCE during exposure to ambient air for two months in the dark (Supplementary Fig.  3  and Tables  2  and 3 ). The photovoltaic metrics of the PSCs fabricated from the PTNG method varying C PMMA are summarized in Fig.  1c . Upon increasing the PMMA concentrations (C PMMA , mg ml -1 ) in mixed chlorobenzene and toluene (volume ratio of chlorobenzene and toluene is 9:1) solution, the PCE first augments and subsequently decreases with a peak at C PMMA = 0.6. Upon increasing the C PMMA from 0 to 0.6 mg ml -1 , the V oc rises from 1.10 V to 1.14 V, and the FF from 0.74 to 0.78. Figure  2  shows the SEM images of perovskite films deposited on m-TiO 2 /bi-TiO 2 /FTO substrate by varying C PMMA . As illustrated in Fig.  2a , the morphology of the pre-perovskite intermediates  21  present before annealing changes from a mixture of randomly distributed nanoparticles into homogeneous nanorods. Figure  2b  and c  show the perovskite film after annealing, indicating that the grain size of the perovskite film produced by the PTNG method increases with C PMMA and most of the grain boundaries become perpendicular to the substrate, benefiting a reduction in the surface area of the grain boundaries. Hence, the PMMA is expected to uniformly trigger heterogeneous nucleation over the perovskite precursor film, improving the grain size and facilitating the perovskite to grow in a preferred direction, with reflection of the facet with (111) indices being dominant because of the low symmetry of the trigonal perovskite (p3m1) phase, as indicated in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in Fig.  3a . Whereas numerous grain boundaries exist in cross-sectional SEM of the reference film, no obvious boundary exists in the PTNG-treated film. On the other hand, for C PMMA > 0.6 mg ml -1 , new species appeared on the surface of the perovskite grains, which we attribute to PMMA particles, as the brighter signal indicates charge accumulation resulting from poor conductivity. This phenomenon accounts for the deterioration of the PV metrics when C PMMA exceeds 0.6 mg ml -1 PMMA because the excess of PMMA will impair charge carrier collection. 
 Material characterization To further examine the crystal structure, we conducted thin-layer XRD measurements for perovskite films deposited on mp-TiO 2 /bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrates (Fig.  3a ). The peak at 12.5 • arises from the (001) lattice planes of hexagonal (2H polytype) PbI 2 . The excess PbI 2 is believed to passivate surface defects, increasing the solar cell performance  13, 22  . All the samples show the same trigonal perovskite phase with the dominant (111) lattice reflection. We speculate the (111) plane to exhibit the smallest surface energy because the majority of grains exhibit this orientation to minimize the total Gibbs free energy of the system. With increasing C PMMA , the (111)-oriented grains grew faster by consuming neighbouring nonoriented crystals, either by regular grain growth or grain attachment, as evidenced by the increased ratio between the (111) and (123) peak at 13.9 • and 31.5 • in the presence of PMMA. By taking the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the (111) reflection, we calculate the crystallite size using Scherrer's equation. Their dimension increases from 41 to 55, 70, 94 and 112 nm on increasing C PMMA from 0 to 4 mg ml -1 . We attribute the larger crystal sizes to the templating effect of PMMA on the crystal growth. The carbonyl groups in PMMA form an intermediate adduct with PbI 2 , as revealed by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra in Fig.  3b . The stretching vibration of C=O bond in pure PMMA appears at 1,735 cm -1 , while it shifts to 1,723 cm -1 upon interaction with PbI 2 . The shift of the C=O vibration in PMMA to lower wavenumber upon interaction with PbI 2 is indicative of the formation of an intermediate PMMA-PbI 2 adduct, since it is a consequence of a weakened C=O bond strength caused by interaction with the Lewis acid PbI 2 . The formation of such an adduct 7 is expected to retard the crystal growth and improve the crystallinity of the perovskite film. 
 Time-resolved photoluminescence decay To analyse the dynamics of recombination, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay measurements (Supplementary Figs  4  and 5 ). The PL decays for perovskite films with C PMMA = 0 and 0.6 mg ml -1 deposited on a m-TiO 2 /c-TiO 2 / FTO substrate are shown in Fig.  3c , revealing a much faster PL decay for the reference than the PMMA-treated film. The PL decay curves were fitted to a bi-exponential rate law: Y = A 1 exp(-t/τ 1 ) + A 2 exp(-t/τ 2 ) + y 0 (1) where A 1 and A 2 are the relative amplitudes and τ 1 and τ 2 are the lifetimes for the fast and slow recombination, respectively  23  . The decay is attributed mainly to trap-assisted recombination at defects. The film with the PMMA treatment exhibits fast and slow phase lifetimes of τ 1 = 23.9 ns (fraction A 1 = 0.37) and τ 2 = 259.3 ns (fraction A 2 = 0.63), respectively. In contrast, the sample without the PMMA treatment gives τ 1 = 18.7 ns (fraction A 1 = 0.66) and τ 2 = 123.6 ns (fraction A 2 = 0.34), respectively. This indicates a lower defect concentration and hence superior electronic quality for the PMMA-containing perovskite polycrystalline film, consistent with the higher V oc of the corresponding PSC  13  . 
 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in Fig.  3d  shows Pb 4f spectra. There are two main peaks Pb 4f 7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 at 138.0 and 142.8 eV, respectively. We attribute the two small peaks located at 136.4 and 141.3 eV to the presence of metallic Pb (ref. 24). The presence of a substantial amount of atomic Pb is an indication of the existence of iodide vacancies in the perovskite lattice of the control sample. The metallic lead species in the film are likely to act as non-radiative recombination centres which impair solar cell operation. Thus, elimination of the metallic lead content is critical to realize perovskite films of better electronic quality  23  . Interestingly, the atomic Pb peak is greatly reduced in the PMMA-treated films, probably due to a lower level of iodide vacancies in the crystal lattice of the PMMA-treated films. A lower level of Pb defects can reduce the non-radiative recombination and increase the PL lifetime, in line with the TRPL results. 
 Conclusion In conclusion, we introduce a method for preparing perovskite films of high electronic quality and implement it for the fabrication of PSC with an excellent performance and certified PCE attaining 21%. Future development of the method will enable further performance gains. 
 Methods 
 Solar cell preparation. A 30 nm TiO 2 blocking layer was deposited on the pre-cleaned FTO (NSG) by spray pyrolysis using O 2 as the carrying gas at 450 • C from a precursor solution of 0.6 ml titanium diisopropoxide and 0.4 ml bis(acetylacetonate) in 7 ml anhydrous isopropanol. A 150 nm mesoporous TiO 2 layer was coated on the substrate by spin-coating at a speed of 4,500 r.p.m. for 10 s with a ramp of 3,000 r.p.m. s -1 , from a diluted 30 nm particle paste (Dyesol) in ethanol (the weight ratio of TiO 2 (Dyesol paste) and ethanol is 1:6), then the substrates was sintered at 500 • C for 20 min. The perovskite film was deposited by spin-coating onto the TiO 2 substrate. The [(FAI) 0.81 (PbI 2 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 ] precursor solution was prepared in a glovebox from 1.35M Pb 2+ (PbI 2 and PbBr 2 ) in a mixed solvent of DMF, NMP and DMSO (where the molar ratio of DMF/DMSO is 5:1, and the molar ratio of Pb 2+ /[(DMSO) 0.8 (NMP) 0.2 ] is 1:1). The spin-coating procedure was done in a dry air flow in a glove box at a spin-coating speed of 6,500 r.p.m. for 30 s. At 15 s before the last spin-coating step, PMMA solution with different concentrations from the mixed solvent of chlorobenzene and toluene (volume ratio of chlorobenzene and toluene is 9:1) was pipetted onto the substrate. Thereafter, the substrate was put onto a hotplate for 1 h at 100 • C. After cooling down to room temperature, the solution with the hole-transporting material spiro-OMeTAD was deposited on top by spin-coating. The spin-coating procedure was done in a dry air flow in a glove box at a spin-coating speed of 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The spiro-OMeTAD solutions were prepared dissolving the spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 60 mM, with the addition of 30 mM bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide from a stock solution in acetonitrile, 200 mM of tert-butylpyridine. Finally, 80 nm of gold was deposited by thermal evaporation using a shadow mask to pattern the electrodes. Characterization. Current-voltage characteristics were recorded by applying an external potential bias to the cell while recording the generated photocurrent with a digital sourcemeter (Keithley Model 2400). The light source was a 450-W xenon lamp (Oriel) equipped with a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter (Praezisions Glas and Optik GmbH) to match the emission spectrum of the lamp to the CFigure 1 | 1 Figure 1 | Device structure and performance. a, A coloured high-resolution cross-section SEM image of a complete solar cell fabricated by the PTNG method, where a smooth and compact perovskite capping layer fully covers the mesoporous TiO 2 layer (mp-TiO 2 ) infiltrated with perovskite.

 , Anders Hagfeldt 2 and Michael Grätzel 1 * The past several years have witnessed the rapid emergence of a class of solar cells based on mixed organic-inorganic halide perovskites. Today's state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employ various methods to enhance nucleation and improve the smoothness of the perovskite films formed via solution processing. However, the lack of precise control over the crystallization process creates a risk of forming unwanted defects, for example, pinholes and grain boundaries. Here, we introduce an approach to prepare perovskite films of high electronic quality by using poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as a template to control nucleation and crystal growth. We obtain shiny smooth perovskite films of excellent electronic quality, as manifested by a remarkably long photoluminescence lifetime. We realize stable PSCs with reproducibility showing a power conversion e ciency (PCE) of up to 21.6% and a certified PCE of 21.02% under standard AM 1.5G reporting conditions.","{'passivating_molecule': 'poly(methyl methacrylate)', 'additive_molecule': ['dimethylformamide', 'dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO'], 'test_1': {'treatment_element': 'poly(methyl methacrylate)', 'treated_pce': '21.6', 'treated_voc': '1.14', 'efficiency_tret': '96.7', 'stability_type': 'ISOSD'}, 'structure_pin_nip': 'NIP', 'electron_transport_layer': 'TitaniumDioxide', 'hole_transport_layer': 'Spiro-OMeTAD'}"

 Yes No Figure 6 M etal halide perovskite semiconductors have seen rapid progress in their optoelectronic applications due to their broadly tunable compositions achieved using simple processing approaches  1, 2  , and in light of their strong light absorption  3  , high charge mobility  4  and long carrier diffusion lengths  [5] [6] [7]  . In photovoltaics (PVs), the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of singlejunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) started at 3.8% in 2009 and has now reached 25.2% (refs.  1, 8  ). The highest-efficiency devices use the regular (n-i-p) structure. However, removing ionically doped hole transport materials in inverted (p-i-n) devices has contributed to recent advances in device operating stability  9  . Recently, Bai et al. reported long-term operationally stable inverted PSCs with a PCE loss of less than 5% under continuous simulated AM1.5 irradiation for more than 1,800 h at 70-75 °C in the efficiency dervied from the current density-voltage (J-V) relationship  10  . Yang et al. reported inverted PSCs that maintained 97% of the initial efficiency after operation at the maximum power point (MPP) under simulated AM1.5 irradiation for 1,200 h at 65 °C (ref.  11  ). Unfortunately, the PCEs of inverted PSCs lag significantly behind those of regularly structured devices (20.9% vs 25.2%, according to certified records)  8, [12] [13] [14]  . Photo-voltage loss due to non-radiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers is a key factor in the inferior PCEs of inverted PSCs, despite various attempts at addressing this issue  13, 15  . The photo-voltage of a solar cell depends on the splitting of the electron (E Fn ) and hole (E Fp ) quasi-Fermi levels of its photoactive layer. This splitting is a function of the steady-state charge density and the bandgap of the absorber. Nonradiative carrier recombination impairs charge-density buildup and diminishes the device's photo-voltage. Electronic trap states caused by crystallographic defects including point defects or higher-dimensional defects (such as grain boundaries) are sources of non-radiative chargecarrier recombination; numerous studies have pointed to the critical role of the passivation of point defects and grain boundaries in achieving high-efficiency PSCs  12, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20]  . These defect sites not only militate against a high photo-voltage, but also shorten the operational lifetime of perovskite devices, as they present a vulnerable initiation site for degradation by extrinsic environmental species  [21] [22] [23]  . Here we demonstrate the use of long AALs with an optimized alkyl-chain length as grain and interface modifiers to improve optoelectronic properties by promoting favourable grain orientation and suppressing trap-state density. These augmented film properties enable the demonstration of a record certified PCE of >22.3% (23.0% PCE for lab-measured champion devices) for inverted-structured devices. The devices show no PCE loss after 1,000 h of operation at the MPP under simulated AM1.5 illumination. Here we reduce this efficiency gap using a trace amount of surface-anchoring alkylamine ligands (AALs) with different chain lengths as grain and interface modifiers. We show that long-chain AALs added to the precursor solution suppress nonradiative carrier recombination and improve the optoelectronic properties of mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite films. The resulting AAL surface-modified films exhibit a prominent (100) orientation and lower trap-state density as well as enhanced carrier mobilities and diffusion lengths. These translate into a certified stabilized power conversion efficiency of 22.3% (23.0% power conversion efficiency for lab-measured champion devices). The devices operate for over 1,000 h at the maximum power point under simulated AM1.5 illumination, without loss of efficiency.

 Optical and structural properties of AAL-treated perovskites AALs have a long alkyl hydrophobic chain as well as an amine group capable of anchoring to the A-site of perovskites. Molecules with an amine group have been implicated in promoting specific facets for perovskite films and single crystals  24, 25  , and also filling point defects (A-site vacancies can potentially be filled by amine groups)  26, 27  . After the self-assembly of AALs in the perovskite matrix, the molecular modified perovskite interfaces are composed of densely packed ligands that are stabilized by van der Waals interactions between hydrophobic organic moieties of the ligands. Such van der Waals interactions become stronger with increasing alkyl-chain length  28  . This thin insulating layer (quantum tunnelling layer) on the surfaces and grain boundaries suppresses nonradiative charge-carrier recombination  19, [28] [29] [30] [31]  and acts as an ion migration barrier  32, 33  . The alkyl-chain length influences the ligand packing density, ligand desorption energy, carrier dynamics and ion migration, and eventually impacts the device efficiency and stability  28, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38]  . Therefore, as a proof-of-concept, we first studied the influence of AALs with different alkyl-chain lengths, namely n-butylamine (BA), phenethylamine (PEA), octylamine (OA) and oleylamine (OAm), on the perovskite film quality. In contrast with procedures that are meant to generate a 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure, we only introduced a trace amount of AALs, <0.3 mol.%. Over 5 mol.% large A-site cations is typically required to form 2D/3D heterostructures  19, [39] [40] [41]  . Cs 0.05 (FA 0.92 MA 0.08 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.92 Br 0.08 ) 3 (referred to as CsFAMA; FA, formamidinium; MA, methylammonium) was used as the baseline perovskite composition. The AALs (0.1 wt%) were directly added into the perovskite precursor, and the perovskite films were fabricated using a one-step anti-solvent crystallization approach  42  . We first used time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL; Fig.  1a ) to roughly assess the perovskite films' quality after introducing AALs with different alkyl-chain lengths. The perovskite films with long-alkyl-chain AALs (OA or OAm) exhibit carrier lifetimes (τ) that are much longer (OA, τ = 789 ns; OAm, τ = 1,049 ns) than those of pristine films (τ = 114 ns) and of films with short-alkyl-chain AALs (BA, τ = 195 ns; PEA, τ = 265 ns). This indicates that the carrier nonradiative recombination was significantly suppressed upon the introduction of a trace amount of long-alkyl-chain AALs.   q z (Å -1 ) q r (Å -1 ) -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 q r (Å -1 ) q z (Å -1 
 Articles Nature eNergy Supplementary Fig.  1  shows the water contact angles of perovskite films with AALs of different alkyl-chain lengths (0.1 wt%). The water contact angle for the pristine film is 60°, and it increased to 63° and 71° for the perovskite films with BA and PEA, respectively, which are short-alkyl-chain AALs. By contrast, the perovskite films with long-alkyl-chain AALs exhibited much larger water contact angles: 88° and 98° for the perovskite films with OA and OAm, respectively. This observation indicates that the long-alkyl-chain AALs assembled on the perovskite film surface, thus dramatically enhancing the hydrophobicity of the films. The water contact angles (Supplementary Fig.  2 ) for the perovskite films with 0.05 wt% and 0.2 wt% AALs are 97° and 100°, respectively, suggesting a similar coverage of anchoring AAL molecules after anti-solvent washing. The distinct improvement of film quality motivated us to investigate the unique role of the trace amount of long-alkyl-chain AALs. For the rest of the discussion, AAL refers to OAm unless otherwise noted. Figure  1d ,e shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of CsFAMA films without and with the introduction of AALs. The films with AALs show a similar grain size to that of pristine films. The SEM image cross-section (Fig.  1f ) shows a 750-nmthick, highly crystalline perovskite absorber layer with a single grain throughout the thickness of the film. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD; Fig.  1c ) patterns show a notably increased ratio of the (100) plane to the other crystal planes' peaks ((110), (  111 ), (  210 ) and (  211 )) in the films with AALs, which indicates that the (100) grains grew faster by consuming neighbouring, randomly oriented grains. Since powder XRD conveys information primarily from the film's bulk, we also used grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS; Fig.  1g ,h and Supplementary Fig.  3 ) to study the surface of the perovskite films. GIWAXS analysis of the films confirmed that the promotion of (100) occurred while other random orientations were suppressed; moreover, no signal that could be attributable to a 2D component was detected. In reported 2D/3D perovskites, 2D perovskite platelets can be observed in SEM images and a clearly detectable 2D component signal appears in GIWAXS  19, 43  . However, we did not observe evidence of a 2D component formation from either SEM images or GIWAXS upon the introduction of trace amounts of AALs, which indicates that 2D perovskite is effectively absent from our films. The absorption of the CsFAMA films is unaltered by the introduction of AALs (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). The Tauc plot from the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra shows an optical bandgap of 1.56 eV for CsFAMA films. The steady photoluminescence (PL; Supplementary Fig.  5 ) intensity was significantly increased for films with AALs, indicating that the population of non-radiative recombination centres in the perovskite films was reduced. PL mapping confirmed the uniformly enhanced PL intensity as shown in Supplementary Fig.  6 . We hypothesized that a suppressed trap-state density and promoted (100) grain orientation resultant from the use of AALs may influence carrier transport in the perovskite films. We conducted contactless measurements of the photocarrier transport properties of CsMAFA-8 films, in which [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was used to induce the interfacial PL quenching  44, 45  , as shown in Fig.  1b . TRPL decay measurements show that the carrier lifetime without the quencher (τ) increased from 290 ns for the pristine films to 520 ns for the films with AALs. The quench-limited diffusion time (τ q ) was 80 and 50 ns for the pristine films and the films with AALs, respectively. From the equation 45 L D % 2L π ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi 2 τ τq À 1   r 
 I , where L D and L stand for diffusion length and film thickness (~750 nm), respectively, we estimate a diffusion length of ~1 μm and ~2 μm for the pristine film and the film with AALs, respectively. Combining the relation L D ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi D ´τ p I and the Einstein relation D = μ × k B × T/q, where μ, k B , T and q stand for mobility, Boltzmann's constant, temperature and elementary charge, respectively, we extracted a carrier mobility of 1.6 and 3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 for pristine films and films with AALs, respectively. Thus, CsMAFA-8 films containing AALs exhibited noticeably longer diffusion lengths and higher carrier mobilities than pristine films. 
 PV performance of AAL-treated perovskites The improved carrier transport in AAL-treated films motivated us to investigate whether this enhancement in basic properties 17  16   Cut-off region Binding energy (eV) Figure  2b  shows the typical J-V characteristics of CsFAMA devices with AALs of different alkyl-chain lengths. The pristine devices show a typical PCE of 20.5% with a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 24.2 mA cm -2 , an open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.06 V and a fill factor (FF) of 80%. The performance of the CsFAMA devices with short-alkyl-chain AALs (BA or PEA) slightly improved to 20.8% (BA) and 20.9% (PEA), benefiting from ~30 mV V OC enhancement. The PEA-concentrationdependent J-V characteristics of CsFAMA devices with PEA are shown in Supplementary Fig.  7 . The champion device with PEA shows a V OC and PCE of 1.15 V and 21.3%, respectively. By contrast, the devices with long-alkyl-chain AALs (OA or OAm) show a remarkably enhanced PCE, resulting from a strong V OC improvement up to 110 mV. The devices with OAm show an average PCE around 22.0% with a J SC of 24.1 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.17 V and an FF of 78.2%. The champion devices with OAm deliver a PCE of 23% with a J SC of 24.1 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.17 V and an FF of 81.6%, as shown in Fig.  2c . The statistical PCE values from 100 devices (50 pristine devices and 50 devices with AALs; Fig.  2e ) demonstrate the reproducibility of the performance enhancement associated with the use of AALs. The PCEs of the devices with OA are similar to those of the devices containing OAm, confirming the advantage of using long-alkyl-chain AALs over AALs with short chains. This is also in accordance with the trend of film quality as deduced from TRPL. E B, max E F E B, The voltage deficit is defined by (E g /q) -V OC , where E g is the optical bandgap. Since the optical bandgap is 1.56 eV, the voltage deficit is only 0.39 V for devices based on long-alkyl-chain AALs. When fine-tuning the concentration of long-alkyl-chain AALs from 0.05 wt% to 0.2 wt%, we did not observe an appreciable variation in device performance (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). Further increasing the AAL concentration to 0.4 wt% leads to a severe PCE drop. Unencapsulated CsFAMA devices with AALs were certified at an accredited laboratory (Newport Photovoltaic Testing and Calibration Laboratory). The PCE certification protocol uses a quasi-steady-state (QSS) I-V sweep, instead of the normally used forward and reverse I-V scans, to ascertain a device's PV characteristics. Ten voltage points were collected in the QSS measurement, with each bias voltage applied and held until the measured current stabilized (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). The devices show a certified stabilized PCE of 22.34% with a J SC of 23.9 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.14 V and an FF of 82%, representing a record PCE for p-i-n-structured devices. The certified QSS I-V curve and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Supplementary Fig.  10 . To identify the major factors responsible for the efficiency enhancement, we started by comparing the morphology (by top-view and cross-sectional SEM images) of the pristine perovskite films and the films with AALs (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). Both the pristine perovskite films and the films with AALs are compact with similar grain sizes. The full width at half maximum values of the (100) XRD peaks of pristine films and of films with AALs are 0.09° and 0.10°, respectively; that is, they are nearly identical. We can therefore rule out a major influence of perovskite grain size and crystallinity in this study. To investigate the influence of surface passivation while avoiding effects related to perovskite film orientation, we subjected readyformed pristine perovskite films to a post-treatment using AALs with alkyl chains of various lengths (BA, PEA and OAm). XRD patterns (Supplementary Fig.  12a ) show that the films post-treated with AALs of different lengths had similar orientations to the pristine films. We then fabricated the devices based on these films with similar orientations. The devices with post-treatment surface passivation enabled by AALs show higher PCE values than the pristine devices, and the long-chain AALs show better passivation, something we assign to stronger hole blocking at the interfaces between perovskite and C 60 (Supplementary Fig.  12b )  31  . The V OC and PCE of the devices with long-chain AALs increased to 1.12 V and 21.1%, respectively, posttreatment. However, in contrast with the devices fabricated by adding AALs into the precursor (V OC of 1.17 V and PCE of >22%), the V OC and PCE of devices with AAL surface passivation are still lower, indicating that surface passivation alone does not fully explain the performance improvement, and that tuning the orientation of the perovskite films plays a crucial role. We conclude that the combined effect of both surface passivation and orientation tuning leads to the dramatically improved V OC and PCE for the devices with AALs (mixed in the precursor). This result is rationalized by the facet dependence of the surface-defect density, and it highlights the crucial role of controlling the film orientation. To further test the carrier lifetime in fully operating devices, transient photo-voltage decay measurements were conducted. As seen in Fig.  2d , the carrier lifetime (τ) increased from 0.67 μs to 1.5 μs after introducing AALs. Light-intensity-dependent V OC was measured and the diode ideal factor (n) was derived, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 16. When purely radiative recombination is present, n equals 1. The devices with AALs show n closer to 1 compared with the pristine devices, arising from the suppressed nonradiative recombination achieved by AALs. AALs have the potential to suppress trap density directly by filling in A-site vacancies and modifying grains and interfaces. Additionally, they have the potential to provide a similar benefit by promoting the (100) orientation of grains in perovskite films  46  , which may have a different susceptibility to surface-defect formation than other random orientations in the pristine perovskite films  47, 48  . To further investigate this possibility, we studied the dependence of trap density on the surface crystallographic facets using density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on a cubic FAPbI 3 model  49, 50  . The corresponding slabs exposing the (100), (110), (111), (  210 ) and (211) surfaces were considered. From the projected density of states (PDOS) of all the slabs, as shown in Fig.  4  and Supplementary Figs.  17  and 18 , we find that the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) are mainly composed of I-5p, Pb-6s and Pb-6p orbitals. According to these modelling results, some surfaces are less benign than others; the (110) (Fig.  4c ), (111) (Fig.  4d ) and (211) (Fig.  4e, f ) surfaces show trap states that are more likely to adversely affect device performance. However, there are no trap states that appear for the (100) surface in either FAI-rich or PbI 2 -rich termination cases (Fig.  4a, b ). Thus, it can be concluded that the (110), (  111 ) and (211) surfaces would introduce additional trap states, while in the case of the (100) surface, the delocalized electronic distributions of the VBM and the CBM are retained in a similar configuration to that of bulk FAPbI 3 . The electronic structure of films with AALs was investigated by work function (WF) and VBM measurements using UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS; Fig.  3c ). The WF was determined from the secondary electron cut-off, and we observed a change in WF from 4.58 to 4.41 eV after AAL modification. The VBMs were located at 1.1 and 1.3 eV below the Fermi level (E F ) for pristine films and AAL-modified films, respectively. The energy-level diagrams for the films based on the UPS and optical absorption measurement are shown in Fig.  3d . The VBM and CBM of AALmodified films are nearly identical to those of pristine films; however, the WF shifts by about 170 meV towards the vacuum level (E VAC ), and the E F shifts by 200 meV towards the CBM, indicating that the AAL-modified films become more n-type, which is likely attributable to the change of the surface termination after AAL modification  51  . Perovskite films that are more n-type have a larger number of filled electron traps, which are the predominant trap species  13, 52  , and this can lead to a further decrease in trap-assisted recombination events  13  . Moreover, perovskite films that are more n-type enable more efficient charge transfer between the perovskite and the electron transport material (C 60 )  51, 53  . We summarized the likely mechanisms behind the device efficiency enhancement in Fig.  5 . The long-chain AALs assemble on the perovskite grains, restricting the grains' tilt during growth and eventually resulting in a (100)-orientation-dominant film that is of lower defect density than a randomly oriented film (Fig.  5a, b ). As the growth proceeds, the long-chain AALs are finally expelled to the perovskite film surface, as indicated by water-contact-angle measurements. The ligand layer on the perovskite film's surface provides effective surface passivation because a long-chain AAL layer enables strong hole blocking between the perovskite and C 60 interfaces (Fig.  5c, d )  31  . 
 Impact of AALs on device stability Suppressing defects and performing molecular modification on perovskite grains and interfaces may have the additional effect of reducing ion migration, which is an unwanted effect in PSCs that contributes to hysteresis and low stability. We studied ion migration using temperature-dependent transient response measurements  54, 55  . The ions were driven by an external bias to the electrode interface, after which this external bias was abruptly removed. A negative current can be seen due to the quick backward movement of the ion vacancies, forced by the concentration gradient (Supplementary Fig.  19 ). The decay rate (1/τ) of the negative current reflects the ion distribution recovery time, and it was used to deduce the activation energy (E a ) of ion migration according to the following equation: ln T=τ ð Þ ¼ C � E a k B T where T is the temperature, C is a constant and k B is Boltzmann's constant. The typical temperature-dependent transient response measurements for CsFAMA devices with AALs are shown in Supplementary Fig.  20 . By fitting ln(T/τ) versus 1/T, we estimate an E a of 243 meV and 422 meV for pristine films and films with AALs, respectively (Fig.  6a ), indicating that ion migration is more hindered in the films with AALs. Having shown that processing perovskite films with AALs leads to superior transport properties, and inverted PSCs with record PCEs, we sought to ascertain whether this processing strategy might compromise the operational stability of devices. To study the long-term stability of the perovskite photoactive layer, we conducted MPP tracking on encapsulated CsMAFA-8 devices under constant simulated AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm -2 ), as shown in Fig.  6c . Pristine devices rapidly lost 42% of their initial PCE after 350 h of testing, while the devices with AALs exhibited no PCE loss after continuous operation for 1,000 h under AM1.5 illumination. The starting device PCE was 21.2% and the final PCE after the MPP test was 21.6%. We also investigated the thermal stability by collecting J-V curves at various times for devices maintained at a fixed temperature of 85 °C. The pristine devices lost ~39% of their initial PCE while the devices with AALs lost only around 10% of their initial PCE after a thermal stability test of ~1,020 h (Fig.  6b ). A reduction in defect density and ion migration likely benefited device stability  11, 15  . 
 Conclusions In summary, we have demonstrated the role of AALs, particularly long-alkyl-chain AALs, in improving optoelectronic properties by promoting favourable grain orientations and suppressing trap-state density. Our strategy based on long-alkyl-chain AALs enabled us to demonstrate p-i-n-structured devices with >23.0% efficiency (22.3% certified) and good operational stability. The molecular modification of perovskite grains and interfaces is crucial to enhance both the efficiency and stability of PSCs. Our findings also indicated that anisotropic electronic properties of the perovskite facets make management of films' crystal orientations an important path towards high-efficiency PSCs. Further understanding of the nature of the different surface facets in polycrystalline perovskite, including the defect type and concentration, will likely be essential for the future of perovskite devices. 
 Methods Materials. Unless otherwise stated, all materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Alfa Aesar and used as received. Perovskite films and devices were fabricated using PbI 2 (10-mesh beads, ultra dry, 99.999% purity) purchased from Alfa Aesar, organic halide salts purchased from GreatCell Solar and caesium iodide (99.999% purity) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) was purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology. The C 60 was purchase from Nano-C. The bathocuproine (BCP; sublimed grade, 99.99% purity) and all the anhydrous solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Perovskite film preparation and device fabrication. The patterned ITO/glass substrates were sequentially cleaned with soap, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol under ultrasonication. The ITO/glass substrates were then dried with N 2 blowing and treated with UV ozone for 15 min. The perovskite films were fabricated by the anti-solvent crystallization approach in a N 2 glove box. In a typical procedure, a hole transport layer of ∼10 nm thickness made of PTAA with a concentration of 2 mg ml -1 dissolved in toluene was spin coated at a speed of 6,000 r.p.m for 35 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. The perovskite precursor solution (1.4 M) composed of mixed cations (Pb, Cs, FA and MA) and halides (I and Br) was dissolved in mixed solvent (DMF/DMSO = 4/1) according to a formula of Cs 0.05 (FA 0.92 MA 0.08 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.92 Br 0.08 ) 3 . A trace amount (0.1 wt%) of alkylammonium ligands (BA, PEA, OA and OAm) was added into the precursor solution. A two-step spin-coating procedure with 2,000 r.p.m. for 10 s and 4,000 r.p.m. for 50 s was adopted for the preparation of perovskite films. Chlorobenzene (150 µl) was dropped on the spinning substrate during the 45 s of the second spin-coating step. Subsequently, the sample was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. The devices with an area of 10 mm 2 were finished by thermally evaporating C 60 (20 nm), BCP (3 nm) and Cu (80 nm) in sequential order by using a thin-film deposition system from Angstrom Engineering under high vacuum. For the device thermal stability test, a 10-nm layer of SnO 2 and a 120-nm layer of indium zinc oxide were deposited on top of the C 60 in sequential order, by atomic layer deposition and sputtering, respectively, to replace BCP and Cu. 
 Perovskite film characterizations. The SEM images were taken by a Helios G4 UX dual-beam scanning electron microscope. XRD patterns were measured with a Bruker AXS D8 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The absorption spectra were obtained by a Cary 6000i UV-Vis-near-infrared spectrophotometer. The roughness was measured by an atomic force microscope (Bruker Dimension Icon with ScanAsyst). PL measurements were performed using a Horiba Fluorolog Time Correlated Single Photon Counting system with photomultiplier tube detectors. The excitation source was a pulsed laser diode at a wavelength of 504 nm. The water contact angle was measured by Drop Shape Analyzer DSA100 from KRUSS with uniform LED illumination and high-quality optics to ensure high precision when displaying the drop, to accurately measure the contact angle. GIWAXS measurements were carried out at beamline 7.3.3 of the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Samples were measured at a detector distance of 0.249 m using an X-ray wavelength of 1.240 Å, at a 0.24° angle of incidence with respect to the substrate plane. Scattering intensity was detected by a PILATUS 2M detector. Device characterizations. Simulated AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm -2 ) was produced by a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Abet Technologies Sun 3000 Class AAA Solar Simulator) for J-V measurements. The light intensity was calibrated by a calibrated reference cell with a Schott visible-colour glass filter (KG5 colour filter) from Newport. A Keithley 2400 SourceMeter was used for driving the J-V measurement. The devices were measured immediately after fabrication without any preconditioning. They were measured with a metal aperture with an area of 6.69 mm 2 (certified by Newport) to accurately define the active area. A voltage scan was measured from 1.3 V to -0.3 V with a scanning rate of 0.1 V s -1 , and a voltage step of 10 mV was used. The devices were measured in both a nitrogen atmosphere (at KAUST) and ambient air (humidity of 30-60%; at University of Toronto) and no obvious difference was observed. To further confirm the PV parameters, the devices were measured by an independent accredited laboratory (Newport). A QSS I-V sweep protocol was used to remove the influence from the hysteresis. For the QSS I-V sweep conducted by Newport, ten voltage points were collected in the QSS measurement, and each bias voltage was applied and held until the measured current was determined to be unchanging. The J SC and PCE measured by Newport were similar to the results in the lab. The EQE was measured by Newport, and the integrated J SC was carefully checked and matched well with the J SC from the I-V sweep before they would provide the certificate. For the transient photo-voltage measurements, the device was serially connected to a digital oscilloscope for monitoring the charge-density decay for the device in approximately the V OC condition. An attenuated 405-nm laser diode was used as a small perturbation to the background illumination on the device. The laserpulse-induced photo-voltage variation (ΔV) and the V OC were produced by the background illumination. The intensity of the short (50 ns) laser pulse was adjusted to keep the voltage perturbation below 10 mV, typically at 5 mV. A Keithley 2400 sourcemeter and a fibre integrating sphere (FOIS-1) coupled with a QE Pro spectrometer (Ocean Optics) were used for the measurements of the LED devices. Trap density measurements by thermal admittance spectroscopy. A sinusoidal voltage (V peak-to-peak = 30 mV) generated from a function generator (Tektronix AFG 3000) was applied to the device. The current signal of the devices was analysed using a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR830) after being amplified through a low-noise-current preamplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR570). The capacitance of the device was calculated based on the parallel equivalent circuit model with the amplitude and phase of the current signal obtained from the lock-in amplifier. The capacitance spectra of the device were measured by scanning the frequency of the sinusoidal voltage from 0.01 to 100 kHz in logarithmic steps. The temperature of the device was controlled using a closed-cycle cryocooler (Advanced Research Systems, DE202AE). The capacitance-voltage curve was obtained by measuring the capacitance as the applied DC bias voltage was scanned from -0.2 to 1.5 V. Based on the capacitance spectra measured at different temperatures, the trap density distribution in energy (E ω ) was calculated with the following equations: N T E ω ð Þ ¼ � V bi qW dC dω ω k B T ð1Þ E ω ¼ k B Tln ω 0 ω ¼ k B Tln 2πν 0 T 2 ω ð2Þ where V bi is the built-in potential and W is the depletion width (V bi and W are derived from capacitance-voltage measurements); C is the capacitance measured at an angular frequency ω and temperature T; k B is Boltzmann's constant and ω 0 is the attempt-toescape frequency at temperature T; and ν 0 is a temperature-independent constant obtained by fitting the characteristic frequency at different T values with equation (2). Ion migration measurement. To measure the ion migration activation energy, two symmetric Au electrodes were deposited on the perovskite films to form a symmetric Au/perovskite/Au device. The electrode width is 2 mm and the channel length is 50 µm. A bias voltage of 3 V was first applied to the electrodes by a source meter (Keithley 2400) for about 16 s to induce the ion migration. Then a negative current induced by the ion vacancies' redistribution could be measured after the voltage was suddenly removed. The negative current then exponentially recovered to zero. The decay time of the negative current contains the information of the ionic transport dynamics. The measurement was carried out when the temperature of the device was controlled from 280 to 325 K using a DE202AE closed-cycle cryocooler (Advanced Research Systems). Then the negative current curves were fitted with a double-exponential function. The slower decay time constants τ, which represent the ion distribution recovery time, were used to deduce the activation energy of the ion migration. Computational methods. The DFT calculations were performed with the projectoraugmented wave (PAW) method as implemented in the VASP code. The generalized gradient approximation Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional was used. A uniform grid of 6 × 6 × 6 k-mesh in the Brillouin zone was employed to optimize the crystal structures of cubic-phase FAPbI 3 . We considered FAPbI 3 slabs exposing different surfaces; all the slabs were separated by both top and bottom vacuum layers (∼10 Å) to prevent spurious inter-slab interactions. The Brillouin zone was sampled by a 2 × 2 × 1 k-mesh for FAPbI 3 slabs. The plane-wave basis set cut-offs of the wavefunctions were set at 500 eV for bulk crystals and 450 eV for supercells at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)/PBE level. The atomic positions of all supercells with and without defects were fully relaxed until the supercells had Hellman-Feynman forces on each atom of less than 0.01 eV Å -1 . Device stability measurement. The operational stability tests were carried out at the MPP for the encapsulated devices under UV-filtered AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm -2 , with a UV filter with a 420-nm cut-off). The devices were tested in a chamber with a constant nitrogen supply, which also ensured a stable device temperature of ~40 °C (the chamber itself was in ambient air). The voltage at the MPP was calculated and applied automatically; the current output of the device was tracked. The devices were encapsulated in a nitrogen glovebox. UV-curable epoxy was coated around the device area, and a glass cover slide was attached to enclose the area. The encapsulation was then finished off by exposing the construct to UV light for 10 min. The thermal stability assessment of solar cells was carried out by repeating the J-V test over various times for the devices heated at a fixed temperature of 85 °C. Reporting Summary.

Visualizing Macroscopic Inhomogeneities in Perovskite Solar Cells
Despite the incredible progress made, the highest efficiency perovskite solar cells are still restricted to small areas (<1 cm 2 ). In large part, this stems from a poor understanding of the widespread spatial heterogeneity in devices. Conventional techniques to assess heterogeneities can be time consuming, operate only at microscopic length scales, and demand specialized equipment. We overcome these limitations by using luminescence imaging to reveal large, millimeter-scale heterogeneities in the inferred electronic properties. We determine spatially resolved maps of ""charge collection quality"", measured using the ratio of photoluminescence intensity at open and short circuit. We apply these methods to quantify the inhomogeneities introduced by a wide range of transport layers, thereby ranking them by suitability for upscaling. We reveal that top-contacting transport layers are the dominant source of heterogeneity in the multilayer material stack. We suggest that this methodology can be used to accelerate the development of highly efficient, large-area modules, especially through high-throughput experimentation.
P hotovoltaic (PV) deployment at the multi-terawatt scale is of crucial importance in the quest to transition to a zero-carbon economy.  1  Since the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is one of the biggest determinants for the price of electricity per kilowatt-hour and therefore real-world adoption, developing highly efficient module-scale photovoltaics is a crucial avenue of research. While it took 60 years to engineer c-Si PV with a PCE of 26.7%, 2 it took hybrid perovskite PV only a decade to surpass 25.5%.  2  Apart from the inherent high-quality optoelectronic properties of hybrid perovskites, a key factor behind this rapid efficiency increase has been the broad suite of characterization methodologies developed by the semiconductor community, which reduce reliance upon trial and error experimentation. As instrumentation and our understanding of semiconductor processes advance, new characterization methods may emerge, offering powerful new ways to accelerate material discovery and optimization. A fundamental principle, which has only become commonly exploited over the last 10 years, is that a good solar cell is also a good light-emitting diode.  3, 4  This is because the trap states that capture excited charge carriers and reduce the amount of extractable work in a solar cell also facilitate recombination that does not emit photons. Thus, the photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) serves as an excellent proxy for the quality of photovoltaic materials or devices. Indeed, luminescence measurements have emerged as a powerful ""contactless probe"" of loss mechanisms.  5  Since spontaneous emission is linked to physical quantities such as the carrier densities, the density of states, traps, and the quasi Fermi level splitting (QFLS), many internal properties and processes can be deduced from the luminescence.  6  This approach will only become more powerful as luminescence efficiencies improve and cells approach their thermodynamically limiting efficiencies. While incredible advances have been made in PCEs, highly efficient perovskite solar cells are still restricted to small active areas (≤1 cm  2  ). The simple nature of the processing techniques used for some emerging technologies such as metal halide perovskites introduces large local fluctuations at both short (<100 nm) and long length scales (>10 μm).  7, 8  Even well-performing perovskite solar cells are seen to exhibit regions of both high and poor luminescence efficiencies. Understanding the origins of, and overcoming, these heterogeneities is key to translating high-efficiency laboratory technology to wafer and full module scale manufacturing (∼250 to 20000 cm 2 ). A significant barrier to such upscaling is the lack of advanced characterization methods that can perform high-throughput measurements on an appropriate length scale. Maps of spatially resolved voltage loss have been constructed using hyperspectral luminescence imaging,  9  and light-beam-induced current (LBIC) has been used in Si  10  and perovskites  11  to spatially map the short-circuit current. These techniques, however, can be time consuming (on the order of hours) and require access to specialized equipment. Spatially resolved luminescence measurements provide a fast (approximately minutes) and relatively simple method for characterizing performance parameters and have been used in Si cells for a long time to identify series resistance hot spots in wafers.  [12] [13] [14] [15]  In emerging PV materials such as perovskites, imaging of the PL over very small (nanometer to micrometer) length scales has produced maps of parameters such as QFLS.  8, 16  Heterogeneities in luminescence on a device scale (>1 mm) have also been measured, but many images of luminescence are presented in entirely arbitrary units, and comparisons with established mapping techniques or integrated measurements are necessary for a more robust analysis beyond simply identifying regions of low luminescence.  [16] [17] [18] [19]  Indeed, a review of mapping techniques in perovskites  20  found that while luminescence measurements have been used effectively to map voltage losses on microscopic length scales, such maps are not well-established at macroscopic length scales. Spatially resolved maps of parameters such as the ideality factor have been produced,  21  which can be used to understand the recombination mechanisms in a device. In terms of current loss, the optically measured parameter ""current transport efficiency"" (f T ) introduced by Wong and Green  22, 23  is a figure of merit. f T was conceptualized for Si p-n junction cells, defined as the differential ratio of the extracted (δJ) current to the light-induced current (δJ L ), over an infinitesimally small voltage step, capturing losses in transporting the current from the p-n junction to the load at some voltage bias. Spatially resolved maps of f T have been applied in Si  24  and later in perovskites. El-Hajje et al. measured spatially resolved maps of f T in perovskite solar cells, across both a micrometer and millimeter length scale, evaluated near the open circuit.  25  Ren et al. measured similar maps near the maximum power point, for a range of intensities, and suggest that the differences in f T observed in the samples of the study result from a difference in series resistance.  26  These maps of f T provide a good way to probe the effects of factors such as series resistance at different voltage points. However, at short circuit, current loss is unlikely to be dominated by the effect of series resistance (see note 1 in the Supporting Information). Additionally, δJ L as defined in the formulization of f T refers to the current which flows through the p-n junction. In the case of perovskite solar cells, this is likely to correspond to current which is extracted at the transport layers, and therefore losses in current due to charge carriers not reaching these layers, and remaining in the bulk, are not captured by this factor. The anomalous PL observed in many perovskite solar cells,  [27] [28] [29]  which has been linked to a loss in short-circuit current, is likely to have In this work, we introduce a relatively simple methodology by which we use a sensitive optical camera to image the luminescence of operational perovskite solar cells under varying optical irradiances and electrical biases. By applying the principle of detailed balance, we are able to derive spatial maps of many important optoelectronic and device parameters. We experimentally demonstrate that the ratio of short-circuit PLQE to open-circuit PLQE is an excellent measure of the effectiveness with which generated charge is collected in the case of perovskite solar cells and use this parameter to generate spatially resolved maps of current loss across centimeter-scale images. Furthermore, we show how spatially resolved maps of parameters, such as the QFLS and ideality factor, can be effectively used to reveal correlations between parameters by using a large amount of data extracted from measurements on a single sample. We also visualize the inhomogeneities introduced when seven widely employed charge transport layers (tin oxide nanoparticles (SnO 2 NP), C 60 , 2,2′,7,7′tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), nickel oxide (NiO x ), poly[bis(4-phenyl)-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA), poly(N,N′-bis-4-butylphenyl-N,N′-bisphenyl)benzidine (poly-TPD), and [6,6]  phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)) are processed into a partial device stack, and we use quantitative metrics to describe this inhomogeneity. This can serve as a useful metric to rank materials and processing routes by suitability for upscaling. This is an important complement to the macroscopic quantification of the nonradiative recombination introduced by each layera technique already widely used by the community. We combine luminescence measurements with detailed balance calculations to create maps of the following parameters which link directly to PV performance losses: QFLS at open circuit, which is closely linked to V OC loss; charge collection quality, a metric linked to J SC loss; and the ideality factor n, which encodes information about the dominant recombination mechanism in the material. The QFLS and ideality factor maps are produced in this work using adaptations of methods previously reported.  [30] [31] [32] [33]  The luminescence-derived charge collection quality as a metric for short circuit current loss will be justified and experimentally validated in a later section. When charge carriers are optically excited in a solar cell, the chemical potentials of electrons and holes become nonidentical (""quasi Fermi levels""). The difference between these two quasi Fermi levels (""quasi Fermi level splitting"") is equal to eV OC in an ideal device, where e is the elementary charge (Figure  1a ). However, a misalignment of energy levels at the interfaces or lack of selectivity of the charge extraction heterojunctions often causes eV OC to be lower than the internal QFLS.  30, 34  The principle of optoelectronic reciprocity  4, 32, 35  allows us to link the internal QFLS to the photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE): = +kT QFLS QFLS ln PLQE rad (1) where QFLS rad is the QFLS in the radiative limit, which can be calculated from the active material's absorption spectrum,  32, 36  and k is the Boltzmann constant. A more thorough derivation of eq 1 is given in note 2 in the Supporting Information. A schematic of this process is shown in Figure  1a . A spatially resolved map of the PLQE therefore allows us to reconstruct a map of the QFLS. This is a contactless measurement and so can be done for ""half-stacks"" (partially constructed solar cells) as well as full devices. The nature of the dominant charge recombination mechanism in the device can be inferred from the ideality factor (n). The ideality factor is featured in the classical diode equation = - J J e ( 1 ) eV nkT D 0 / D (2) where J D and V D are the diode current density and voltage, respectively, J 0 is the diode saturation current density, and T is the temperature of the cell. The ideality factor, which is unity in an ideal cell, was traditionally understood to tend toward 2 with increasing first-order nonradiative recombination, understood through the Shockley-Read-Hall model.  37, 38  However, recent reports  31, 39  have provided greater clarity by distinguishing between the influence of bulk and interfacial recombination (occurring at the perovskite/transport layer interfaces) on the ideality factor. The ideality factor may be found optically using a method applied by Sarritzu,  32  with the relation + = I C nkT ln ( ) QFLS suns (3) Here, I suns is the illumination irradiance expressed as number of suns (1 sun is AM1.5 100 mW cm -2 equivalent irradiance for that band gap) and C is a constant term. A more thorough derivation of eq 3 is also given in note 2 in the Supporting Information. Thus, the ideality factor for each point on the active area can be calculated using intensity-dependent QFLS maps. The distribution of n vs QFLS therefore gives us information about the dominant type of recombination. For our imaging setup (Figure  1b ) we used a sensitive Si CMOS camera (Andor Zyla 4.2, Oxford Instruments),  40  which is suitable for low-intensity acquisitions. Samples can be imaged under both controlled optical excitation (440 nm LED; 0-1 sun equivalent photon flux) and electrical bias. In the case of full devices, we used the test device itself to calibrate the optical intensity in terms of number of suns by comparing the short-circuit current to the short-circuit current measured on a well-calibrated solar simulator. A long-pass filter is used in the imaging set up to block the 440 nm excitation light from reaching the camera. The number of counts recorded by each camera pixel scales linearly with the number of photons emitted by the associated point on the sample, assuming that the signal is significantly larger than the noise floor. The sample is aligned to be in the focal plane of the lens and coincides with the center of the illumination, where the illumination profile has the flattest intensity profile (see Figure  S3 ). When the PLQE is desired, a high-reflectance BaSO 4 plate is imaged, without filtering, as a reference. A more detailed description, including correction factors used, can be found in note 3 in the Supporting Information. Before undertaking this work, we were not certain what features and inhomogeneities would exist at the 0.01-1 mm length scale that our imaging setup resolves. In order to verify the general validity of our approach, we recorded luminescence images on a selection of different perovskite solar cells. We imaged a well-performing FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 device (18.5% PCE, 1.6 eV band gap; see Figure  S5  and Table  S3  in the Supporting Information) and characterized the currentvoltage response in four different ways (Figure  2a ): two ACS Energy Letters  http://pubs.acs.org/journal/aelccp  Letter electrical measurements under illumination and two optical measurements analogous to the electrical measurements. The two electrical measurements include (1) measuring the current while sweeping the voltage (labeled ""JV"") and (  2 ) measuring the V OC value while sweeping the intensity, which is used to infer the current density (also known as the suns-V OC method  41  ). The corresponding optical measurements include (1) inferring the current density from the PL intensity averaged across the device as the voltage was swept (drawing upon the approach of Stolterfoht et al.,  27  labeled ""PL implied JV"") and (2) inferring voltage from the average PLQE at open circuit while the illumination intensity is changed (using eq 1 and taking the QFLS to be the voltage; labeled ""PL reconstructed""). The curves measured by all four methods vary, as would be expected from macroscopic measurements of the same properties. Furthermore, the electrically measured curves show excellent agreement with the curves derived from averaging the PL images (Figure  2a ). The fill factor appears to be enhanced in the suns-V OC and PL-reconstructed curves, as these measurements were performed at open circuit, where the series resistance has no influence. This validates our setup's ability to measure absolute PL intensities and reconstruct the QFLS across a range of bias conditions. To further validate the setup and assess the types of inhomogeneities present in full devices, we reconstructed QFLS maps at 1 sun illumination for 1.6 eV band gap cells of two different architectures (Figure  2b ): cell 1, NiO x / perovskite/PCBM; cells 2 and 3, poly-TPD/perovskite/ PCBM. In all of the captured PL images, we observe a number of spatial inhomogeneities at the millimeter length scale, with the better-performing poly-TPD cells exhibiting a more homogeneous QFLS distribution in comparison to the NiO x cell. In a later section, we present a fuller analysis of the heterogeneity introduced by all of the widely used transport layers. On comparing the two poly-TPD cells, we can see that, despite identical processing conditions, the variability is still quite different. This is a common feature of devices processed by simple methods such as spin-coating and is likely to be a significant barrier to scale-up. The poorly performing NiO x -based cell also has a larger difference between the mean QFLS and that measured, indicating an energy level misalignment at a heterojunction or a lack of charge selectivity.  30, 34  Notwithstanding this small difference, the average values of the QFLS are still close to the measured V OC value, and they agree very well for both of the poly-TPD-based cells, once again validating our ability to correctly reproduce QFLS maps. Furthermore, though the luminescence is rather inhomogeneous in the NiO x -based cell, there are localized regions on the map that approach the luminescence efficiencies of the wellperforming poly-TPD-based cells. Their existence indicates that an intrinsic limitation of the material is not at work here: with an optimization of the processing conditions, we can expect to fabricate a device with uniformly bright luminescence. We suggest that such luminescence imaging could be combined with deposition equipment so that the performance can continuously be monitored in situ, accelerating device optimization. With an increase of laboratory automation, we can also envision that such luminescence images will be fed to active learning models that can vary processing parameters until the luminescence is maximized. While the protocol for making spatial maps of quasi Fermi level splitting (and hence voltage losses) from luminescence measurements is well-established, a method for estimating the total current loss at short circuit in a spatially resolved fashion has not been successfully applied to perovskites. Here we utilize and experimentally verify an expression that links the current loss to luminescence at short circuit, enabling us to visualize regions of current loss over a cell's active area. An ideal solar cell at short-circuit (SC) collects all the generated carriers and therefore will not emit any photons. In practice, however, perovskite solar cells have been observed to emit significant PL even at short circuit.  27  Furthermore, a transient increase in PL at short circuit has been observed for some cell types, in conjunction with a transient increase in current loss,  28  and it has been suggested that the ratio of PL at SC to open-circuit (OC) may be linked to the charge extraction efficiency.  29  Similar observations in silicon PV cells have been attributed to diffusion-limited carriers generated in the bulk that were unable to reach the p-n junction,  9, 10  and in some instances the ratio of PL at OC and SC has been used to estimate diffusion lengths in silicon samples.  42  In perovskite devices, one possible explanation for the residual PL at SC could be the screening of the internal field due to ion redistribution, leaving the absorber with a zero net field, where the charge can undergo internal recombination before being transported out of the device.  28  Alternatively, perovskite films, due to processing inhomogeneities, may contain regions of isolated material not properly contacted with the electrodes. Rau links this same anomalous ""residual luminescence"" observed at short circuit in Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 solar cells directly to the ratio of the short-circuit current to the current generated in the material.  43  In the case of perovskite solar cells, we verify that a similar expression does in fact correlate with losses in short-circuit current and use it to generate spatially resolved maps of ""current collection"" at short circuit. We can understand the estimation of current loss intuitively from a comparison between the luminescence intensities from the PV cell at short circuit and open circuit. At open circuit, every generated e-h pair has three possible fates: recombine radiatively, recombine nonradiatively, or flow through the shunt resistance from the equivalent circuit model (Figure  1c ). Luminescence can originate only from charge carriers that flow through the diode in the equivalent circuit model. The extracted current density from the cell (J) is linked to the luminescence through the ideality factor, a ""fudge-factor"" introduced into the diode equation to account for the mixture of recombination mechanisms that operate in a cell. On comparison of the radiative recombination current density (J rad ) to the total current density J, the PL intensity at open circuit can be shown to be proportional to the generation current density (J G ) to the power of n, where n is the ideality factor = - = • • J J J e J J V e EQE ( ) nkT kT G 0 QFLS/ rad 0 EL QFLS/ (4) = ⇒ = J J Je at OC: 0 nkT G 0 QFLS / OC (5) ⇒ = • • - J J V J EQE ( ) ( ) n n rad,OC 0 1 EL G (6) since at open circuit, all generated carriers must recombine. At short circuit, the majority of photogenerated chargecarriers are extracted as load current, quenching the PL. Some carriers are not extracted as load current and instead flow through a shunt pathway or recombine in the perovskite bulk. The current density that is not extracted at short circuit, J G -J SC is responsible for the anomalous PL at SC: = ⇒ - = J J J J J e at SC: nkT SC G SC 0 QFLS / SC (7) ⇒ = • • - - J J V J J EQE ( ) ( ) n n rad,SC 0 1 EL G S C (8) Rearranging eqs 6 and 8, we get:  - = • • - J J J V J ( EQE ( ) ) n n G S C 0 1 EL rad,SC 1/ (9) = • • - J J V J ( EQE ( ) ) n n G 0 1 EL rad,OC 1/ (10) Q col value (Q col -J SC /J G ) as a percentage of Q col from simulation. White and yellow lines show boundaries of 10% and 15% error, respectively. The blue line is the point where, for lower shunt resistances, the ratio of current through the shunt V s through the diode exceeded 1000; for R sh under the blue line, the PL is under the sensor detector limit. Assuming that the ideality factor and EQE EL (V) does not change between OC and SC, we can write = = - = - i k j j j j j j y { z z z z z z i k j j j j y { z z z z Q J J J J 1 1 PLQE(SC) PLQE(OC) n n col SC G rad,SC rad,OC 1/ 1/ (11) where Q col is a parameter we dub the ""charge collection quality"". In a device with zero series and infinite shunt resistance, Q col would be identical to the internal quantum efficiency. While Q col is a function of the ideality factor, it remains much faster to measure PLQE(SC) and PLQE(OC) in comparison to the ideality factor, which requires a full intensity-dependent measurement and fitting of the slope of the QFLS as a function of intensity for every pixel in the map. If a fast measurement is required, one can measure only the PLQE(SC) and PLQE(OC) values and assume an ideality factor of unity, or any other value that corresponds to the macroscopically averaged ideality factor of the cell, to get an approximate value of Q col , which still correlates with the current loss (See note 5 in the Supporting Information for a full justification). When the effects of shunt and series resistances are included, Q col can underestimate or overestimate the internal quantum efficiency. Nevertheless, as we shall experimentally demonstrate, it remains a useful metric, as it is found to correlate with current loss. To experimentally verify the validity of the expression for Q col (eq 11), we measured Q col (n=1) for a large number of cells, in both positive-intrinsic-negative (p-i-n) and n-i-p architectures, with band gaps varying from 1.6 to 1.8 eV, with a variety of different hole-transporting layers (HTLs) and electron-transporting layers (ETLs) (see the Supporting Information for details). For these measurements the ideality factor was considered to be unity, as described. By measuring the average PL intensity over the active area at open circuit and short circuit, we can calculate an average Q col (n=1) for the device (eq 11). The relationship between J SC /J G and Q col (n=1) can be calculated for different ""true"" values of ideality factor and accounting for a reasonable loss in current due to reflection losses and parasitic absorption. If the electrically measured J SC is shown to follow this relation with Q col (n=1), the validity of the expression (eq 11) is confirmed. To minimize the impact of shunt and series resistance on Q col , only ""good"" devices were chosen, meaning that the average shunt resistance may be considered to be much greater than the solar cell's output resistance V I OC SC . Measurements were made under an equivalent irradiance of 1 sun for each cell, with a preillumination of 30 s under opencircuit conditions to ensure the device was at a steady state. In Figure  3a , we show a plot of the band-gap-normalized J SC (taken to be the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) current density) versus the spatially averaged charge collection quality Q col | n=1 . The values of Q col | n=1 vs J J SC SQ fall within a range of values predicted by eq 11, for ideality factors ranging from 1 to 2 and assumption of an average 20% loss in the generation current density from the SQ limit (typical for cells produced in our laboratories). This confirms the qualitative validity of our expression for Q col . Apart from the variation in ideality factor, we may attribute some of the spread in data to some additional factors: namely, the variation of series and shunt resistances and limitation of setting the intensity to exactly 1 sun. We now briefly comment on the impact of series and shunt resistances on Q col . Luminescence originates from radiative recombination in the semiconductor bulk, which in the equivalent circuit model is a certain fraction of the current flowing through the diode. If a fraction of the current is able to flow through a different pathway, namely the series or shunt resistor, then the luminescence will be altered. At open circuit, shunt pathways divert charge away from the perovskite bulk (equivalently more current flows through the shunt resistor as opposed to the diode), diminishing luminescence. The series resistance has no influence at open circuit. At short circuit, the presence of a series resistance results in a nonzero potential difference across the parallel shunt and diode components, hence causing some current to flow through the diode, resulting in luminescence at short circuit, with increasing series resistance. However, even at short circuit some current will flow through the shunt pathways, causing the luminescence to diminish, which does not correspond to the collected current. Using the equivalent circuit model, we can calculate how the internal quantum efficiency J J SC G varies with values of R S and R SH , and compare this to the estimated Q col value (assuming the absolute PL is proportional to current flowing through the diode). Through this, we can estimate the error in Q col introduced by R S and R SH . We show that the values for the internal quantum efficiency and Q col agree with each other very closely (<10% error), apart from the conditions when the shunt resistance is very low and where the series resistance is very high (Figure  3d ; see note 4 in the Supporting Information for full details). In this case, we found that Q col tends to overestimate J J SC G , but this only occurs in extreme cases. We now comment on the spatial inhomogeneity in Q col observed in the three cells we present in Figure  3a . Since the presence of traps influence the device performance on many fronts, it is important to answer the following question: does a poor Q col imply a poor QFLS, both being mediated by traps? If so, Q Col maps would be unnecessary, since QFLS maps essentially provide the same information. Looking at the QFLS and Q col maps of cell 2 (Figures  2b  and 3b ), we can see very clearly that this is not the caseregions of poor Q col are not always detectable on QFLS maps. The red circles in Figure  3b  highlight areas where the values of Q col (and hence the current) are particularly low. These features are completely unobservable with the QFLS map (Figure  2b ). Could these low-luminescence regions instead be explained by shunts? The absence of these features in the map taken at OC (Figure  2b ) shows that they are not shunts, for shunting effects are active at both OC and SC. The maps presented (Figures  2b  and 3b ) indicate that the average value and the inhomogeneity in QFLS (a proxy for V OC ) and Q col (a proxy for J SC ) can vary independently in devices, making the characterization of both essential for a full understanding of spatially resolved losses. To illustratewhile cell 2 (poly-TPD-based) has superior QFLS in comparison to cell 1 (NiO x -based), it has a lower average Q col value (Figure  3b ). Furthermore, the two have similar levels of inhomogeneity in Q col , despite cell 2 having a far more homogeneous QFLS map. To reiterate, QFLS and Q col can vary independently, and both are required to fully map loss mechanisms. 
 ACS Energy Letters http://pubs.acs.org/journal/aelccp  Letter Metrics such as Q col acquire special significance in the context of in-line metrology and high-throughput experimentation. A significant advantage of this approach for identifying inhomogeneities in current loss is that each device measurement requires only a few minutes, in comparison to several hours for an equivalent LBIC mapping approach. In addition to maps of QFLS and Q col , we can study directly maps of the ideality factor, which provide information about the recombination processes at work in a solar cell. Plotting the ideality factor vs QFLS for each pixel in the device reveals that more luminescent pixels have higher ideality factors. This trend is evidence that the performance of the cell under measurement is limited by interfacial recombination, not bulk recombination. This validates a recent study  31  which suggests that, in devices dominated by interfacial recombination, the ideality factor will, rather counterintuitively, increase with increasing QFLS. Thus, the natural spatial variation in a solar cell enables us to demonstrate this trend with a large amount of data acquired from only a single device, in a timespan of minutes. The ability to capture such large amounts of data opens up the possibility of exploring previously unknown relationships between various semiconductor and device properties. There is an exciting scope for the application of novel statistical techniques and machine learning methods to analyze such data sets.  
 ACS Energy Letters A priori, the source of this significant inhomogeneity at the 0.1-1 mm scale is unclear. It could be rooted in certain layers or interfaces or be the result of certain processing methods. Such sources of heterogeneity can be characterized by acquiring luminescence maps at each step of solar cell fabrication and quantifying each step's effect on heterogeneity. We reconstructed QFLS maps for a wide variety of partially fabricated cells, quantitatively measuring the heterogeneity introduced at each stage of device fabrication. Our study includes seven widely used transport layers (TL), PCBM, C 60 , spiro-OMeTAD, poly-TPD, NiO x , SnO 2 , and PTAA, coated upon or beneath perovskite thin films as ""half-stacks"". A glass\transparent conductive oxide (TCO)\TL\perovskite stack was used for ""bottom contacting"" transport layers, and a glass\perovskite\TL stack was used for top contacting layers. For details about the perovskite compositions and fabrication procedures used, see Sample fabrication in the Supporting Information. In order to quantify the additional inhomogeneity introduced by a transport layer in contact with these different perovskite films, a reference sample of neat perovskite was deposited on glass in each case. Luminescence maps of different samples cannot be directly compared for heterogeneity, as the mean value of the QFLS will be different for different samples. Therefore, a normalized measure of spread is needed. The statistical distribution of luminescence data obtained could have a spread that is a function of the mean (for example, in a Poisson distribution the standard deviation is proportional to the root of the mean). In order to compare between different samples, we define the center normalized QFLS: = -⟨ ⟩ ⟨ ⟩ center norm QFLS QFLS QFLS QFLS i j i j , , (12) where i and j are indices of points on the QFLS map, and ⟨QFLS⟩ is the mean QFLS of the sample. The centernormalized QFLS will be centered on 0 and is normalized by the mean, making distributions between different samples comparable.   4 . The area of the bubbles is proportional to the inhomogeneity of the transport layer (with respect to a reference of the corresponding perovskite on glass). (b) Fourier transforms of the center-normalized QFLS maps from Figure  4 . The reference shows a strong cross-hair pattern typical of a smooth real profile, while all of the TLs show some higher frequency terms and the superposition of a Gaussian-like profile. (c) Schematic of proposed optimization workflow for identifying and addressing inhomogeneities in a device, using the luminescence measurement setup. Maps of center-normalized QFLS are shown in Figure  4 , along with the corresponding binned distributions with respect to the neat perovskite reference film. We can observe, in general, that each transport layer introduces visibly significant heterogeneity to the neat perovskite on the millimeter length scale. The PCBM sample and to a lesser extent the C 60 sample exhibit a large population of bright emissive spots (high QFLS) across their surfaces. Consequently, the PCBM histogram has a heavy right tail. We interpret these bright speckles to be regions where the fullerene is either not directly electronically contacting or not present (i.e., pinholes) on top of the perovskite film. In line with the superior homogeneity of C 60 that we visualize, it is often used as an interlayer alongside an ETL to improve the contact, in both n-i-p  44  and p-i-n architectures,  45  and there can be improved performance in devices with evaporated C 60 as opposed to solution-processed PCBM.  46  The inhomogeneous region in the spiro-OMeTAD map stretches over 3 mm in length, suggesting that it may be prone to poor electronic contact over large length scales. Half-stacks with the bottom contacting layers look comparatively uniform, with the histograms largely resembling the shape of the reference used in each case. Looking at the images, however, we can see samples such as NiO x appear to have more spatial variation over their surface, despite having similar widths in the binned graphs. We can quantify the inhomogeneity in the images by defining = ⟨ ⟩ ⟨ ⟩ inhomogeneity ratio IQR QFLS IQR QFLS ref ref ( 13 ) where IQR is the inter quartile range of the QFLS distribution in a map. This metric can be used to quantify the additional inhomogeneity in QFLS introduced when a transport layer is processed, while accounting for the varying mean QFLS found in different samples. Comparing the inhomogeneity introduced by different transport layers (Figure  5a ), we see that the bottom-contacting layers are fairly benign (inhomogeneity ratio ∼1), while the top-contacting layers, particularly spiro-OMeTAD, are responsible for significantly more heterogeneity. This contrasting behavior could be a key determinant that confers upon the ni-p and p-i-n structures their distinctive advantages and limitations and merits more detailed investigation. The presented QFLS histograms encode information about the statistical distribution, but they say nothing about the length scales over which the variation occurs. In order to quantify this, we looked at the Fourier transforms (FTs) of the QFLS maps. The FT of a 2D image produces an image of the real image's frequency spectrum, which contains information about the length scale of the changes. Higher intensity farther from the center (high-frequency regions) indicates a smaller length scale of change (i.e., sharper changes in QFLS over the sample area). If the length scale of heterogeneity is large (i.e., a relatively unform device), the FT will have high intensities at the center of the image and two perpendicular lines along the axes forming ""cross hairs"" (see Figure  5b ). The frequency distributions of the TL images all show this same cross-hair feature but have an additional Gaussian-like distribution that extends further into higher frequencies. The poly-TPD FT closely resembles a uniform device, indicating that the QFLS is relatively free of sharp spatial variations. In contrast, the PTAA FT extends farther into the higherfrequency region, revealing sharper spatial variations in QFLS, despite having a histogram width similar to that of poly-TPD. In summary, the FT of the acquired parameter maps encodes information about the length scale of variations and is complementary to the histogram, which encodes the statistical distribution of variations. While these results cannot be generalized to all possible deposition process for these transport layers, the heterogeneity introduced by a certain transport layer and some depositionspecific process can be assessed. On the basis of the capabilities of this technique, we propose an optimization workflow for identifying and addressing inhomogeneities in a device, illustrated in Figure  5c . If a device shows losses, it may be imaged in the setup and spatially resolved maps of QFLS, collection efficiency, ideality factor, and series resistance (the last using existing methods  13  ) may be produced. If a parameter shows significant inhomogeneity over the device, the fabrication parameters can be iteratively modified using a Bayesian optimization. The process may be repeated, with halfstacks being imaged in addition to complete device stacks, to identify the specific problematic layers. If the cells are fully homogeneous and losses still persist, alternative materials or chemistries, such as new surface treatments and alternative transport layers, should be attempted. To summarize, the scale-up of perovskite PV to the module scale (∼2 m 2 ) while high efficiencies (>23%) are retained is the key to commercialization and terawatt-scale deployment. In order to visualize heterogeneities over entire cell areas, we utilize a fast and relatively simple luminescence imaging method to produce maps of device-relevant parameters. Our imaging reveals that perovskite cells exhibit significant spatial heterogeneities in V OC and charge collection at the 0.1-1 mm length scale. We experimentally demonstrate that the ratio of PLQEs at short circuit and open circuit can serve as an excellent indicator of current loss in perovskite solar cells. This enables us to visualize J SC loss over the active area, providing a very useful complement to established V OC mapping methods. While inhomogeneities in the active layer have been imaged before, the effect of processing steps and transport layers has not been greatly investigated. We quantified the heterogeneity introduced when seven widely used transport layers are processed, thereby ranking them by suitability for upscaling. We find that top-contacting transport layers are the dominant source of heterogeneity in the stack. For instance, spiro-OMeTAD causes a 4-fold increase in heterogeneity when it is processed. In contrast, bottom-contacting layers are found to be relatively benign. This contrasting behavior could be a key determinant that confers upon the n-i-p and p-i-n structures their distinctive advantages and limitations and merits further investigation. In comparison to slow (approximately hours) traditional mapping methods such as LBIC, luminescence imaging is fast (approximately minutes) and generates large amounts of data. By using such data gathered on a single device, we were able to validate the relationship between the ideality factor and QFLS. We believe that our relatively simple technique will be easy to implement for many scientists and development engineers, to use in combination with process development and highthroughput experimentation, in order to accelerate both laboratory research and industrial scale-up.

 Perovskite active layer 1.6 eV perovskite layer Methods largely in line with previously reported work  [2] [3] [4]  The FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb(I 0.9 Br 0.1 ) 3 perovskite precursor solution was obtained by stoichiometrically weighing formamidinium iodide (FAI, GreatCell Solar, 99.99%), cesium iodide (CsI, AlfaAesar), lead iodide (TCI) and lead bromide (AlfaAesar) in ambient air before being transferred into an N 2 filled glovebox. For the samples with this bandgap, the precursor solutions were all nominal FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb(I 0.9 Br 0.1 ) 3 perovskite solution dissolved in 4:  
 eV perovskite layer The FAI, CsI, PbI 2 and PbBr 2 precursors were sourced as for the 1.6eV perovskite. A nominally The perovskite layer was made inside the glovebox. The substrate (TCO/Transport layer in device type C,D, and SnO2 halfstack, Glass for spiro-OMeTAD half stack and reference) was first spun at 1,000 rpm (200 rpm/s) for 10 seconds, with the precursor solution dynamically dropped onto the FTO/SnO2 substrate 4 seconds into the spin coating . After 10 seconds, the spinning speed increased to 5,000 rpm and was spun for 45 sec (with a ramp speed of 800 rpm/sec). 330/300 μL (For the devices/transport layer cases) of diethyl ether was dropped at the centre 15 sec before the end of spinning. The perovskite layers were annealed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 30 mins for device type E, and 60 min for the rest. 
 eV perovskite layer 170 μL of a 1.77 eV formamidinium/caesium lead iodide bromide perovskite, similar to that reported by Mahesh et al.  4  was dynamically deposited on the glass substrates spinning at 1000 rpm. After 10s, the spin speed increased to 5000 rpm over 5s, where it remained for 30s. An antisolvent quench was performed by depositing 335 μL of anisole onto the substrate 5s before the end of the spin program. Multicomp PRO MP710086 bench power supply, which was software controlled to vary the power across the LED, thus controlling illumination intensity. The exact photon flux for a given power supplied (integrated over an area greater than the beam size) was calculated by placing a power meter on the focal plane of the camera where the sample would be. 
 MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE In the case of full device stacks, the sample may be electrically contacted via a Keithley source meter, through a multiplexing circuit and sample holder designed in house. The PL was measured with an ANDOR Zyla 4.2 sCMOS sensor  5  , which was cooled to 0°C for all measurements. Where possible, a global shutter is preferable. However, for very low exposure times a rolling shutter had to be used. To keep the data comparable, a rolling shutter was used for all the solar cell measurements. A Kowa LM50XC lens, which is a 50mm lens with up to an F2.0 aperture, was used. The aperture was set to F5.6 to increase the depth of field such that the entire device stack was in focus. The whole setup was enclosed in a light tight box. In all the experiments undertaken, 10 reference images in the dark were taken before and after the experiment. An average background reference was made by averaging the perpixel values for all the references, and for all data, the values per pixel of the background image were subtracted from the data. As a standard, all measurements were taken from the transparent glass side. This was to keep results obtained from full devices consistent with results obtained from half stacks, and had the additional benefit of providing a more graded index mismatch than the interface between perovskite and ait for example, helping reduce some reflection losses. It was found that both heating up over the course of the measurement, and initial transient behaviour in the PL, were significant factors in some of the samples. For the scope of this study we only wanted steady state measurements. Hence, for most measurements where multiple measurements were made in succession, the sample was illuminated for 30s before imaging to bring it to steady state, and then left in darkness with all electrical bias turned off for 30s to give it time to dissipate any heat built up. The only exception to this in the data presented were devices of type A from Fig S1, which were measured before this standard was adopted, but these also showed little transience or degradation in PL. The code used for data acquisition and data analysis are provided free and open source under the lesser GPL liscence as under:  Equipment control:  https://gitlab.com/pod-group/pl-imaging-control   Data analysis:  https://gitlab.com/pod-group/PL_imaging_analysis   The parameter f T is then a further loss due to losses in the equivalent circuit, e.g., series resistance. In fact, f T is explicitly related to series resistance in Wong and Green's paper, and is presented as a supplementary parameter to be used in favour of series resistance. In perovskites, the current losses at short circuit conditions are more likely to be caused by poor carrier collection (poor f C ). This is because at short circuit the series resistance must be incredibly high before any appreciable change in short circuit current is observed. Below we show the expected change in J sc due to series resistance for a simulated equivalent circuit as done in supplementary note 4, with no shunting and a diode ideality factor of 1.5: This is consistent with PL observed at short circuit, which can only occur if the charge carriers recombined in the intrinsic layer of the p-i-n / n-i-p device stack. This could be due to mechanisms such as the screening of the electric field by ions  7  , or isolated pockets of material not properly contacting the electrode. Hence, the parameter Q col captures a loss mechanism different from f T . 
 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE 2: THEORY OF LUMINESCENCE IMAGING, EXTENDED 
 QFLS at open circuit from PLQE When optically excited, the generated population of excited charge carriers in a semiconducting material is accompanied by a splitting of the fermi level for electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valance band into 'Quasi fermi levels' (ϵe,ϵh respectively), with the difference in the two referred to as the 'Quasi fermi level splitting' (QFLS). To calculate the QFLS from the PLQE, we can consider the non equilibrium radiative recombination current can be expressed as 8 : 𝐽 𝑟𝑎𝑑 = ∫ 𝐸𝑄𝐸(𝜔) Ω 4𝜋 3 ℏ 3 𝑐 2 (ℏ𝜔) 2 𝑒 ℏ𝜔 -𝑄𝐹𝐿𝑆 𝑘𝑇 -1 𝑑(ℏ𝜔) where ω is angular frequency of light, Ω is the emission angle, c the speed of light and EQE is the external quantum efficiency of the cell. This may be approximated  [9] [10] [11]  as 𝐽 𝑟𝑎𝑑 ≈ 𝑒 𝑄𝐹𝐿𝑆 𝑘𝑇 ∫ 𝐸𝑄𝐸(𝜔) Ω 4𝜋 3 ℏ 3 𝑐 2 (ℏ𝜔) 2 𝑒 ℏ𝜔 𝑘𝑇 -1 𝑑(ℏ𝜔) = 𝑒 𝑄𝐹𝐿𝑆 𝑘𝑇 ∫ 𝐸𝑄𝐸(𝜔)𝜓 𝐵𝐵 (𝜔)𝑑(ℏ𝜔) where ψ BB is the black body emission spectrum at room temperature. The integral term is the radiative emission current from the cell, at thermal equilibrium in the dark (J 0 ,rad). Hence 𝐽 𝑟𝑎𝑑 = 𝐽 0,𝑟𝑎𝑑 exp ( 𝑄𝐹𝐿𝑆 𝑘𝑇 ) ⇒𝑄𝐹𝐿𝑆 = 𝑘𝑇ln ( 𝐽 𝑟𝑎𝑑 𝐽 0, 𝑟𝑎𝑑 ) ⇒𝑄𝐹𝐿𝑆 = 𝑘𝑇ln ( 𝐽 𝑟𝑎𝑑 𝐽 𝐺 ) + 𝑘𝑇ln ( 𝐽 𝐺 𝐽 0, 𝑟𝑎𝑑 ) The latter term is the radiative limited QFLS (QFLS rad ), where purely radiative recombination takes place, and J rad /J G is the PLQE, giving 𝑄𝐹𝐿𝑆 = 𝑄𝐹𝐿𝑆 𝑟𝑎𝑑 + 𝑘𝑇ln (𝑃𝐿𝑄𝐸) The QFLS can be calculated fully optically, without needing to electrically contact the sample. This metric can hence be mapped for full device stacks as well as half stacks and films (although in the latter case only a measurement under open circuit conditions is possible). The assumption made about 100% absorption only effects this slightly due to the QFLS scaling with the logarithm of the PLQE, meaning the parameter is sensitive to orders of magnitude in variation in PLQE. Transmission and reflection losses are unlikely to be significant to that extent. 
 Ideality factor mapping from intensity dependant PLQE The QFLS may be measured at different optical bias and its intensity dependence can be used to calculate the ideality factor n. The ideality factor captures deviations from ideal diode behaviour. In the classical understanding, n = 1 corresponds to a perfect diode behaviour, where all the recombination is radiative. n = 2 is associated with Shockley-Read-Hall type first order recombination, and any value for n between 2 these two values imply a mixture of the two types of recombination. However recent studies have shown that this simplistic relation does not always hold, and for solar cells limited by interfacial recombination, the ideality factor increases as the non-radiative interfacial recombination is suppressed. Despite this additional layer of complexity, the ideality factor is an interesting metric that may give some insight into the charge carrier dynamics inside the cell. The ideality factor can be determined in an 'all-optical' fashion  10  . Writing the diode equation as: 𝐽 = 𝐽 𝑠𝑐 -𝐽 0 exp ( 𝑒𝑉 𝑛𝑘𝑇 ) we get: ln ( 𝐽 -𝐽 𝑠𝑐 𝐽 0 ) = 1 𝑛𝑘𝑇 ⋅ 𝑒𝑉 Under open circuit conditions, J = 0 and Jsc ∝ JG ∝ I suns , the incident photon flux in terms of number of suns. Replacing eV with QFLS we get ln (𝐼 𝑠𝑢𝑛𝑠 ) + 𝐶 = 𝑄𝐹𝐿𝑆 𝑛𝑘𝑇 where C is a factor that captures all the other terms In this way we can obtain the ideality factor from an intensity dependant measurement of the QFLS, and for QFLS maps measured in different optical bias the above equation can be applied to each pixel, producing an ideality factor map. Since this uses the QFLS, it is equally insensitive to error in the PLQE due to transmission and reflection losses.  𝐶 𝑤𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑙 (𝐸 𝑔 ) = ∫𝑄𝐸 𝑒𝑓𝑓 (𝜆) ⋅ 𝜙 𝐿𝐸𝐷 (𝜆)𝑑𝜆 ⋅ ∫𝜙(𝜆 ,𝐸 𝑔 ) 𝑃𝐿 𝑑𝜆 ∫𝑄𝐸 𝑒𝑓𝑓 (𝜆) ⋅ 𝜙 𝑃𝐿 (𝜆, 𝐸 𝑔 )𝑑𝜆 ⋅ ∫𝜙(𝜆) 𝐿𝐸𝐷 𝑑𝜆 a correction factor accounting for inhomogeneity in the beam. The LED beam was 𝐶 𝑖,𝑗 𝑖𝑛 controlled using a collimated lens. However the optics were not adjusted such that the light was perfectly collimated, as the resulting illumination area was smaller than the area occupied by the cell. A small divergence was given to the light such that at the focal plane of the camera, the shape of the illumination was roughly uniform over an area roughly equal to (Fig.  S6 ). However this is still not entirely uniform over the area, especially approaching the edges of the device. Any local nonuniformity in the reference image due to nonuniformity of the reference surface was removed using a gaussian filter with kernel size of 5. However the nonuniformity in the beam itself was removed using the correction factor defined as 𝐶 𝑖,𝑗 𝑖𝑛 = < 𝑅𝐸𝐹 𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒 > 𝑅𝐸𝐹 𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑖,𝑗 . This essentially flattens the PL image as if the beam was totally uniform over the surface, while preserving the mean PLQE. This assumes good alignment, as the PLQE is a function of intensity, so only small deviations from the central flat profile can be corrected for in this way.   we observe a region of high series resistance and low shunt resistance where the 2 values diverge. We can interpret this to be a region where there is some collection loss due to the high series resistance, but where the majority of the current flows through the shunt at short circuit. The PL observed at short circuit approaches 0, while estimated Q col approaches 1. In regions of such drastic shunt resistances however, the PL at both open and short circuit will be very low. PLQEs of on the order of 1e-6 are difficult for the image sensor to detect. Hence an additional PL quenching of 1000 times is likely to push any full device PLQEs below the noise floor of our setup. These regions will appear incredibly dim in open and short circuit, and should be easily identifiable as poor performing regions. Plotting the error as a percentage error of Q col (Figure  S6c ), we can see that while there is a large region of high error (white boundary contains 10%+ error, yellow contains 15%+), a major part of this falls into the region below our detection limit, marked off by the blue line. For the luminosities we are able to measure, the error is still non trivial if there is a region of both very high series resistance and very low shunt resistances in unison, which should be kept in mind when analysing local variations in Q col . Notably, for all the regions where the R sh is greater than 100 ohms, there is very small error over a very broad range of series resistances, encompassing combination which lead to current collection efficiencies ranging from close to zero to close to 1. 
 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE 5: ERROR IN Q COL DUE TO NON UNITY IDEALITY FACTOR In the main text we suggest that the ideality factor measurement, which takes longer to complete, may be omitted for rapid measurements. Inhomogeneities in should remain 𝑄 𝑐𝑜𝑙 apparent even without the ideality factor correction. Here we present three scenarios for cells 1 to 3 from the main text. The first is the case where is calculated assuming unity ideality. 
 𝑄 𝑐𝑜𝑙 The second is the , taking into account a measured ideality factor map. The third is 𝑄 𝑐𝑜𝑙 𝑄 𝑐𝑜𝑙 calculated using an averaged ideality factor, taken from fitting the terminal voltage measured on the device during the intensity dependant measurement. As can be seen, there is an average trend in redution of the estimated Qcol with increasing idelity factor. However, the spatial variation remains largely unaltered between applying an average n, versus applying the spatially resolved n. Regions of poor largely remain 𝑄 𝑐𝑜𝑙 apparent between all the three scenarios for the three cells. Hence, for rapid screening of samples to compare homogeneity using a unity ideality assumption appears to be effective. If the voltage in the device is able to stabilise relatively fast, then a traditional Sun's V oc type measurement can also be used to obtain an average ideality factor, and use this in the 𝑄 𝑐𝑜𝑙 calculation. If it is possible to do this in a rapid fashion, then this may be a good option to incorporate into the measurement.  like signal to noise behaviour, until around 100 counts, beyond which the read noise acts as a floor for the noise level. All images were taken hence with exposure times such that they were above 100 counts at least. 
 Figure S9: The assumption that all the light is absorbed is can introduce errors in the calculated PLQE. Specifically, the PLQE will be underestimated as the absorbed number of photons will be a lower than the total incident. In terms of QFLS, because it is logarithmically linked to the PLQE, there can be a lot of loss to reflection and transmission before there is a significant change in the QFLS. If only 40% of the light is absorbed, then the error is still on the order of 20 meV. However, the absolute QFLS can be underestimated quite significantly (>80 meV) when the absorption is lower than 0.1. Hence for transparent films, with optical densities on the order of 1, the QFLS is underestimated. Based on this we are able to say the cell was being biased properly, and the current voltage readouts are reliable. Less hysteresis seen in our setup may be due to the 30s wait before and dark wait time after.  Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1. (a) Schematic of QFLS induced by optically excited carriers. Sub-band-gap states can mediate fast nonradiative recombination, which drains the bands of excited carriers. This changes the free-carrier concentration, which is also linked to the PLQE, making the PLQE an effective probe of both QFLS and charge carrier dynamics. (b) Schematic of luminescence imaging setup. Images are taken using an image sensor and lens, with a long-pass filter to block the 440 nm excitation light. The sample can be electrically biased using a source meter. A white diffuse reflector reference is used to calibrate the camera in order to determine the absolute luminescence and hence produce maps of the PLQE. (c) Equivalent circuit diagram for a simple solar cell at open and short circuit. PL occurs when current flows through the diode. PL at open circuit is reduced due to the shunt path, PL at short circuit may be affected by both.

The ""PL reconstructed"" curve (optical version of suns-V OC ) was constructed from the QFLS at open circuit measured at different illumination intensities.

 Supplementary Computational Details First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) are carried out as implemented in the PWSCF Quantum-Espresso package  1  . Geometry optimization, including dispersion correction  2  , was performed using GGA-PBE  3  level of theory and the electrons-ions interactions were described by ultrasoft pseudo-potentials with electrons from I 5s, 5p; N, C 2s, 2p; H 1s; Pb, 6s, 6p, 5d; shells explicitly included in calculations. Plane wave basis set cutoffs for the smooth part of the wave functions and the augmented density were 50 and 400 Ry, respectively. Both ions and volume were relaxed during the optimization of the bulk 2D perovskites. Formation energies (Eformation) of the bulk 2D perovskites were calculated using the following formula: Eformation = Etotal -EPb2+ -EI--Ecationic-molecule, where Etotal, EPb2+, EIand Ecationic-molecule are the total energy of the bulk 2D perovskite, Pb 2+ cation, isolated I -anion and isolated cationic molecule, respectively with the corresponding numbers of ions involves for the bulk 2D perovskites of four formula units. EPb2+ was calculated from the energy of the bulk PbI2 in its P3m1 crystal phase. Cationic molecules were optimized in 30×30×30 Å  3     
 REVIEWER COMMENTS Reviewer #1 (Remarks to the Author): In this manuscript, the authors studied the energy barrier of 2D perovskite formation from ortho-, meta-and para-isomers of (phenylene)di(ethylammonium) iodide (PDEAI2) that were designed for tailored defect passivation. Treatment with the most sterically hindered ortho-isomer not only prevents the formation of surficial 2D perovskite film, even at elevated temperatures, but also maximizes the passivation effect on both shallow-and deep-level defects. The ensuing PSCs achieve an efficiency of 23.9% with long-term operational stability (over 1000 hours). And the authors also demonstrated that a high performance perovskite solar cells module with an active area of 26 cm2. Overall, the idea and results shown in this manuscript is good, while still have some issues should be addressed for further considerations: 1)For the theoretical modelling, the authors should consider the usually used PEAI for comparison. 2)The authors should clearly explain why the passivation effect of the organic salt is better than the 2D perovskite. 3)The authors claimed that the record efficiency (21.4%) for the module with the area of 26 cm2. The efficiency could be overestimated, for the results shown in Figure  5c , the Jsc is 2.71 mA/cm2, considering that a nine sub-cells connected, the overall equivalent short current density is 24.39 mA/cm2 (this is almost same as single cell current density), while the geometric fill factor (GFF) was calculated to be 90.2%, this means that the real current density will be 27 mA/cm2, this is impossible for the current perovskite material. I think the author has deduct the dead area while calculated the current density of the module, this is misleading. If the author insisted on the module efficiency is reliable, the authors should give a certification results from authorized party such as Newport, AIST, NREL or others. Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author): The authors report a study on organic halide salt passivation to reduce defects in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The authors studied ortho-, meta-and para-isomers of (phenylene)di(ethylammonium) iodide (PDEAI2) that were used to passivate perovskite defects. They find that the ortho-isomer could prevent the formation of surficial 2D perovskite film for the most sterically hinder, simultaneously maximizing the passivation effect on both shallow-and deep-level defects. At last, the ortho-isomer-based PSCs obtained an efficiency of 23.9%, with high efficiency of 21.4% for the perovskite module (an active area of 26 cm2). 1. Many reports showed that a thin surficial 2D perovskite layer could improve the efficiency of the device, such as the author's work (Sci China Mater 2020, 63(1): 47-54). However, the authors said that the para-isomer that could form surficial 2D perovskite film decreased the device's performance from the PCE of 20.71% (control) to 20.30% (para-isomer). 2. In the assignment of the different phenyl-diethyl ammonium iodide (PDEAI2) solutions posttreatment on the final PSCs performance, only used the concentration of 2 mg mL-1, where there is no optimized process. 3. For surface energy band measurements, the authors said that the downshift suggests a more ptype surface after o-PDEAI2 treatment, which can improve hole extraction and cause bandbending for higher VOC values. However, from the UPS measurements (Supplementary Fig.  7 ), we could estimate the valence band of perovskite are -5.85 eV for control and ~6.15 eV for o-PDEAI2 treatment. Thus, this valence band of perovskite seems to impair the hole extraction rather than improve hole extraction as ref 40. (Energy Environ. Sci. 13, 1222-1230 (2020).) 4. In the cathodoluminescence (CL) intensity maps, o-PDEAI2-passivated perovskite film showed low luminescence (CL) intensity at 800 nm, while confocal PL microscopy mapping showed enhanced PL intensity. 5. In the assignment of the passivation effect on the hole extraction and carrier dynamics in the devices, the detailed experiment process of voltage-dependent transient PL measurement should be provided. Reviewer #3 (Remarks to the Author): Review ""Tuning the structural isomers of phenylenediammonium cations to afford efficient and stable perovskite solar cells and modules"" The manuscript explores approaches to passivate the surface of perovskite materials with 'large' ammonium cations, while at the same time preventing to form a 2D perovskite phases that introduces a substantial barrier for charge extraction. The authors show very convincingly that the use ortho-phenylenediethylammonium is a viable approach to reach this and characterize the different mutual placements of the ethylammonium groups in detail. The study is very thorough and show the effects on the device performance (both in small cells and in modules) very convincingly and is supported by measurements of carrier lifetimes by (voltage dependent) PL and surface potential by Kelvin probe measurements. I believe is an interesting contribution that should attract considerable attention in the perovskite field and hence should be published in Nature Commun. There are a few things that the authors may address to improve the manuscript: -The structures obtained from the calculations are interesting but it is very hard to make out in the figures provided what they actually look like. For the meta-compound the authors discuss binding of both ammonium groups, does this lead to distortion of the surface, leading to trapping? Does the ortho-compound also bond with both the ammonium groups? -I believe that some discussion on general design principles that can be derived from this study would be useful. Would the same effects be expected for any ammonium compound that does not have a tendency to form a 2D perovskite phase? What is the relevance of the presence of two alkyl ammoniums? Would a single one do the trick as long as it is attached to an organic group that does not allow 2D-phase formation?

According to the reviewer's suggestions, the manuscript has been revised, and its quality has been improved. (1) For the theoretical modelling, the authors should consider the usually used PEAI for comparison. Author reply: We thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. According to your suggestion, we have checked the formation energy of PEA2PbI4, which results in energetically more feasible (-7.71 eV) compared to o-PDEAI2 (-6.41 eV), m-PDEAI2 (-7.22 eV) and p-PDEAI2 (-7.19 eV). Our simulation results nicely match with experiments. We found that PEAI showed a much stronger ability to react with PbI2 to form 2D perovskite than the three isomeric cations, as verified by the XRD and PL results (Figure  1d , e and Supplementary Figure  1 ). We have further checked the passivation effect, following the similar protocol used for ortho-, meta-and para-isomers, of PEA cation by adsorbing on perovskite surface (see Figure  R1 ). The adsorption energy results in -9.28 and -9.90 eV for the ethyl ammonium and phenyl ring adsorption modes, respectively. The adsorption energy values are similar to the o-PDEAI2, which are -10.00 and -9.53 eV for the ethyl ammonium and phenyl ring adsorption modes, respectively. Thus, the adsorption energy suggests that PEAI has a similar passivation effect with o-PDEAI2, consistent with previous reports.1 The corresponding description and figure of the theoretical calculation for PEAI have been added to the revised manuscript and supplementary information. (2) The authors should clearly explain why the passivation effect of the organic salt is better than the 2D perovskite. Author reply: We would like to thank the reviewer for the precious question. The surface layers of 2D perovskite and organic halide salts can provide a chemical passivation effect for solution-processed 3D perovskite films on surficial defects, which contribute to interface carrier recombination and limit device performance well below their Shockley-Queisser efficiency potential.  2  For 2D perovskite passivation, organic spacer cations are used to react with excessive PbI 2 or to be exchanged with formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA) cations to form a 2D perovskite capping layer, where a post-deposition thermal annealing step is usually involved to convert the film to the 2D phase. After covering the 3D perovskite, the 2D perovskite layer with upwardly shifting band edges may facilitate the hole extraction from the bottom 3D perovskite to hole transport layer (HTL) and suppresses the interfacial electron-hole recombination, reducing the energy loss inside 2D/3D perovskite solar cell (PSCs). However, several issues still challenge this strategy. (1) The 2D perovskite exhibits a high optical bandgap (≈ 2.4 eV) leading to a shorter spectral window for light absorption (300-500 nm) and typically has a much higher exciton binding energy (300-500 meV) than 3D perovskite, which hinders charge separation.  3, 4  (2) The stubborn in-plane orientation of 2D perovskite impedes vertical hole transport in devices. Specifically, the organic spacers form thin insulating layers between the more conductive metal halide slabs, adversely affecting the conductivity of 2D perovskite films and impeding charge extraction, as shown in Figure  R2 .  5  This requires ultrathin 2D perovskite layers or incomplete 2D perovskite surface coverage to permit charge tunnelling or extraction via unpassivated regions.  1, [6] [7] [8]  Therefore, optimizing charge transfer in 2D/3D PSCs for further improvement in device performance remains a challenge. We have made some attempts to improve the performance of 2D/3D PSCs. During our exploration, it was found that the efficiencies of PSCs passivated with organic halide salts, such as the widely used phenyl ethyl ammonium iodide (PEAI), without post-treatment thermal annealing are usually higher than that of with thermal annealing (Figure  R3 ). And the difference in device performance derived from whether the 2D perovskite was formed or not. Similar results were also reported by You et.al.  1  Therefore, removing the post-treatment annealing step to enable an organic halide salt capping layer is considered as a more promising passivation strategy, which has been verified by the state-of-the-art PSCs have verified with efficiencies of around 25% published in Nature and Science.  [9] [10] [11]  Organic halide salts reported so far for surface passivation mainly include alkylammonium halides and phenyl ammonium halides. This type of material always has a comprehensive passivation effect on both the cation and anion defects, and enhances the adhesion to the 3D perovskite film through hydrogen bonding or ionic bonding. The ammonium group is thought to form a hydrogen bond with the iodide ion on the 3D perovskite surface;  12  The π-conjugation structure of the aromatic rings can capture electronic defects pertaining to trace amount of neutral iodine;  13  The iodide ions can fill the iodine vacancies and coordinate with the Pb 2+ interstitials.  12  Therefore, organic halide salts can provide an effective passivation effect on the perovskite surface, and avoid the high exciton binding energy and adverse in-plane orientation of 2D perovskite. Even so, PSCs passivated with the commonly used PEAI salt suffer from the efficiency plummet under higher operating temperatures due to the inevitable conversion to 2D perovskite.  1  In fact, we also found that this conversion could happen even under AM 1.5G light illumination, which would weaken the passivation effect of organic halide salt. Therefore, we developed an ortho-(phenylene)di(ethyl ammonium) iodide (o-PDEAI 2 ) that can sustain higher temperatures without undergoing 2D perovskite formation to effectively passivate surface defects via dual -NH 3 I terminals, the phenyl rings, and the iodide ions. Enhancing the formation energy of 2D perovskite by tuning the spatial structure of bulky organic cations is the key factor to prevent them from entering the perovskite lattice and forming 2D perovskite even at elevated temperatures. In comparison, post-treatment with para-(phenylene)di(ethyl ammonium) iodide (p-PDEAI 2 ) easily induced the formation of 2D perovskite due to the lower energy barrier and led to lower device performance than that of o-PDEAI 2 because of the problems mentioned above of 2D/3D structure, such as the higher binding energy and the hindered charge transport by the unfavorable in-plane orientation. Although PEAI and PDEAI 2 passivation exhibits a better passivation effect than their 2D perovskites, the relative lack of studies that directly compare the performance of devices passivated with pristine organic halide salts and their 2D perovskites makes it difficult to assess the generality of the above observations. The type, location, quantity, or other factors of functional groups on organic ammonium cations should influence the passivation properties of organic halide salts and their 2D perovskites, which deserves further systematic studies in the future. We have added a brief description regarding the reason for the improved passivation effect of organic salts to the introduction and photovoltaic performance sections in the revised manuscript.  (3) The authors claimed that the record efficiency (21.4%) for the module with the area of 26 cm 2 . The efficiency could be overestimated, for the results shown in Figure  5c , the Jsc is 2.71 mA/cm 2 , considering that a nine sub-cells connected, the overall equivalent short current density is 24.39 mA/cm 2 (this is almost same as single cell current density), while the geometric fill factor (GFF) was calculated to be 90.2%, this means that the real current density will be 27 mA/cm 2 , this is impossible for the current perovskite material. I think the author has deduct the dead area while calculated the current density of the module, this is misleading. If the author insisted on the module efficiency is reliable, the authors should give a certification results from authorized party such as Newport, AIST, NREL or others. Author reply: Thank you for your precious question. Sorry for the confusion. As we described in the manuscript, 26 cm 2 is the active area, obtained by deducting the dead area from the designated area. And the performance parameters of the modules including J SC of 2.71 mA/cm 2 were calculated based on the active area instead of the designated area. Thus, the real J SC was 24.39 mA/cm 2 , which was slightly lower than that of the small cell (24.75 mA/cm 2 ) and in the reasonable range of J SC values for the FA-based PSCs. Based on the designated area, the J SC and PCE were calculated to be 2.44 mA/cm 2 (overall equivalent J SC of 22.00 mA/cm 2 ) and 19.27%, respectively. The reason why we mainly used the active area to calculate the performance parameters is as follows: The GFF is highly dependent on how advanced the lab-based laser etching technology, and there can be significant differences among different research groups who are mostly focusing on the basic research. Therefore, the module performance parameters based on the active area is also very useful to compare the effectiveness of materials and experimental methods on large-scale application among different research groups, as reported by many recent publications, such as [Science 372, 1327-1332 (  2021  Indeed, we understand that the evaluation of module performance using the designated area is necessary to estimate the real performance in practical application. Therefore, we have added the designated-area performance of perovskite solar modules to the revised manuscript. Also, we removed the text ""26 cm 2 "" from Figure  5a  to avoid possible misunderstanding.

 Reply: We thank the reviewer for the time spent reviewing our work. We appreciated the constructive points raised, which we believed helped in improving the quality of our work. Here below, the specific comments have been considered, and action has been taken to fulfil the reviewer request. (1) Many reports showed that a thin surficial 2D perovskite layer could improve the efficiency of the device, such as the author's work (Sci China Mater 2020, 63(1): 47-54). However, the authors said that the para-isomer that could form surficial 2D perovskite film decreased the device's performance from the PCE of 20.71% (control) to 20.30% (para-isomer). Author reply: We appreciate the reviewer for the careful review and precious question. As the reviewer mentioned, some 2D perovskites have been reported to have a passivation effect and improve the device performance. We also have been focusing on this topic and screened out some suitable 2D perovskite passivators in the past few years.  [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19]  The 2D perovskite capping layer with upwardly shifting band edges could facilitate the hole extraction and block the charge recombination at the perovskite/HTL interface to improve the device performance. However, there are also two intrinsic issues of 2D perovskite adverse to the device performance. (1) 2D perovskite exhibits inferior optoelectrical properties for photovoltaic application. The high optical bandgap (≈ 2.4 eV) shortens the spectral window for light absorption. The high exciton binding energy (300-500 meV) hinders charge separation. The poor electrical conductivity (10 -5 S m -1 ) inhibit the charge transport.  3, 4, 20  (2) The in-plane orientation of surficial 2D perovskite films was commonly observed due to the minimized surface energy, while this hinders the out-of-plane charge transport and leads to a high degree of electrical anisotropy because of the insulating character of the bulky organic cations.  5  Therefore, the influence of 2D perovskite passivation on device performance depends on the comprehensive effect of these above-mentioned factors. It cannot be concluded that all 2D perovskite materials can behave as good passivators. The type, location, quantity, and other factors of functional groups on organic ammonium cations directly influence the 2D perovskite properties and thus their passivation effect. For example, some 2D perovskites showed adverse passivation effect and decreased device performance, such as those based on 1,4-butanediammonium iodide (C4), 2-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]ethan-1-ammonium iodide (EDBE), and p-phenyl diammonium iodide (PDAI) as reported before and also para-(phenylene)di(ethylammonium) iodide (p-PDEAI 2 ) in this work.  13, 21  A general rule to judge which type of 2D perovskites can provide an overall positive passivation effect for enhancing the device performance is worth to be systematically investigated and established in the future. The explanation for the slight decrease in efficiency for p-PDEAI 2 -based devices has been added to the revised manuscript. (2) In the assignment of the different phenyl-diethyl ammonium iodide (PDEAI 2 ) solutions post-treatment on the final PSCs performance, only used the concentration of 2 mg mL -1 , where there is no optimized process. Author reply: We thank the reviewer for the helpful advice. The optimization of the PDEAI 2 concentrations has been conducted as shown in Table  R1 . The highest efficiency was achieved by o-PDEAI 2 passivation with the concentration of 2 mg mL -1 . For p-PDEAI 2 passivation, over 21% efficiencies were achieved by 1 and 2 mg mL -1 , while further increasing the concentration would decrease the efficiency. For m-PDEAI 2 passivation, the efficiencies continuously decreased as the concentration increased. The detailed optimization of concentrations of PDEAI 2 post-treatment has been added to the Supplementary Information as Supplementary Table  4 .   [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27]  In fact, the energy level distribution for the passivated perovskite film and the formation reason are complicated. As shown in Figure  R5 , since the more n-type region has a higher electron concentration than the less n-type region, electrons diffuse from the more n-type side to the less n-type side. When the electrons move away, they leave exposed positive ion cores in a more n-type side because they are fixed in the crystal lattice and cannot move. Similarly, on the less n-type side, negative ion cores are exposed. An electric field forms between the two regions, which is responsible for the drift of electrons from the less to more n-type side and hinders the diffusion of electrons. During this process, the E F along with the energy level of the more n-type region moves down, while E F along with the energy level of the less n-type region moves up until an equilibrium situation of diffusion and drift is reached and the two E F is levelled at the same time. This causes a bending of the energy bands with the upwards band bending moving from more n-type to less n-type region. The same bandgap of perovskite in both regions determines that the E V of the more n-type side is lower than that of the less n-type side after bending, which indicates an effective energy level alignment to promote hole extraction and transport. In fact, taking advantage of the energy band bending to improve the hole transport and extraction has also been reported in 2D/3D PSCs.  28, 29  However, this strategy is not feasible for all cases of 2D/3D structure because the energy band bending is influenced by the E F , E V and bandgap of the 2D perovskite. For example, the 2-thiophenemethylammonium chloride (2-TMACl)-based 2D perovskite showed an improper energy band bending with 3D perovskite because of its excessively high E F and low E V values.  28  This is possibly one of the reasons why different 2D perovskites have different passivation effects.  Author reply: We thank the reviewer for the comment. PL decay kinetics were measured using the Edinburgh Instruments time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) fluorescence spectrometer F900. The picosecond pulsed diode laser EPL-470 emitting 72 ps pulses at 470 nm with the repetition rate of 500 kHz (interval 2 μs) was used for the sample excitation. The time resolution of the setup was about several hundreds of picoseconds by applying apparatus function deconvolution. Voltage-dependent PL decay measurements were performed by varying the reverse bias voltage applied to the cell from 0 to 2.5 V in steps of 0.5 V and simultaneously measuring the PL lifetime at each voltage. The PL decay kinetics were fitted using the intensity-weighted double exponential functions ( ̅ = ∑ / ∑ ) to estimate the average lifetimes. The primary experiment process of voltage-dependent transient PL measurement has been provided in the characterization of the revised manuscript. 
 Response to Reviewer #3: Comments to the Author: The manuscript explores approaches to passivate the surface of perovskite materials with 'large' ammonium cations, while at the same time preventing to form a 2D perovskite phases that introduces a substantial barrier for charge extraction. The authors show very convincingly that the use ortho-phenylenediethylammonium is a viable approach to reach this and characterize the different mutual placements of the ethylammonium groups in detail. The study is very thorough and show the effects on the device performance (both in small cells and in modules) very convincingly and is supported by measurements of carrier lifetimes by (voltage dependent) PL and surface potential by Kelvin probe measurements. I believe is an interesting contribution that should attract considerable attention in the perovskite field and hence should be published in Nature Commun. There are a few things that the authors may address to improve the manuscript: Reply: We thank the reviewer for the time spent reviewing our work. We appreciated the constructive comments and suggestions, which we believed helped improve the quality of our work. According to the reviewer's suggestions, the manuscript has been revised and its quality has been improved. (1) The structures obtained from the calculations are interesting but it is very hard to make out in the figures provided what they actually look like. For the meta-compound the authors discuss binding of both ammonium groups, does this lead to distortion of the surface, leading to trapping? Does the ortho-compound also bond with both the ammonium groups? Author reply: Thank you for your valuable question. To facilitate reading, we have provided the supporting figures with the zoomed view of the different structures focusing on the adsorbed molecule, see Figure  R6 . The adsorption of all the three isomeric cations leads to some surface reconstruction due to its favourable binding tendency. However, in this work, we have not looked into the aspects of the formation possibility of surface defect traps and we feel that it is beyond the scope of this study. Nevertheless, the increased binding affinity of the ortho cation is associated with the reduced defect formation possibility, which is likely the reason for the improved defect passivation in the ortho isomer. In all three isomeric cations, we attempted to check the adsorption behaviours through both the two ammonium groups and phenyl rings. Upon relaxation, all the three isomers bind with both the ammonium groups. On the other hand, while binding through the phenyl ring, the cations orient themselves to some extent in order to get the local minima structures. The supporting zoomed view of the different adsorption modes is shown in Figure  R6 . The corresponding description and zoomed figure have been added to the revised manuscript and supplementary information. (2) I believe that some discussion on general design principles that can be derived from this study would be useful. Would the same effects be expected for any ammonium compound that does not have a tendency to form a 2D perovskite phase? What is the relevance of the presence of two alkyl ammoniums? Would a single one do the trick as long as it is attached to an organic group that does not allow 2D-phase formation? Author reply: We thank the reviewer for the precious suggestion. This work also attempts to explore the design principles for organic halide salt passivation of perovskites. Based on our experience and knowledge, we believe that the influence of organic halide salts on the passivation effect of perovskite is complicated. (1) Not all organic halide salts, which do not form 2D perovskites have a positive passivation effect. For example, besides meta-(phenylene)di(ethyl ammonium) iodide (m-PDEAI 2 ) in this work, we also found that passivation with hexa-2,4-diyne-1,6-diammonium iodide (HDDAI) decreased the device performance probably due to its overhigh electron-withdrawing capability. (2) Two alkyl ammoniums normally endow the organic cation with stronger adsorption on the perovskite surface. For example, the adsorption energies of o-PDEA (-10.00 eV), m-PDEA (-10.50 eV) and p-PDEA (-9.76 eV) cations are higher than that of the PEA cation (-9.28 eV) for the ethyl ammonium adsorption modes (Supplementary Table  2 ). This higher adsorption energy usually enables more organic cations to adhered to the perovskite surface for better defect passivation. However, this is not absolute, because the passivation effect is a result of comprehensive factors. Some diammonium cations decreasing the device efficiency after surface passivation, such as m-PDEAI 2 and p-phenyl diammonium iodide (PDAI).  13  (3) Single ammonium organic halide salts including phenyl ethyl ammonium iodide (PEAI), octyl ammonium iodide (OAI), dodecyl ammonium iodide (DAI), 4-tert-butyl-benzyl ammonium iodide (tBBAI), and 1,4-octane diammonium iodide (C8), have been demonstrated to have superior passivation effect, while this was achieved by removing the post-treatment thermal annealing to suppress the formation of 2D perovskite.  1, 11, 21, 30  For the single ammonium organic cation, which inherently inhibits the formation of 2D perovskite, tert-butylammonium (tBA) was reported to passivate interface defects and improve device performance. Whereas and the reason for the suppression of the 2D phase is that tBA is a small size cation, which can be incorporated into the 3D perovskite lattice by ion exchange and reaction with PbI 2 .  31  Although there is still a lack of reported cases, we believe that bulky single ammonium organic cations, which do not allow 2D perovskite formation by altering organic groups, should provide good passivation effect if the functional groups are also favorable. Overall, we speculate that: (1) The type, structure, location, quantity, or other factors of functional groups on ammonium cations comprehensively impact the passivation properties of organic halide salts. The widely used functional groups in passivating organic cations are alkyl aromatic groups and long alkyl chains. In consideration of the good passivation effects of N, F, S, and O heteroatoms and their related functional groups in additive engineering, they can also be incorporated into organic halide salts to further enhance the passivation effect in the future. (2) Preventing the organic cations from forming 2D perovskites under thermal and light conditions is crucial to ensure their continuous and stable passivation effect. Based on our experience, regulation of the molecule structure to adjust the chemical environment and steric effect of ammoniums may effectively increase the formation energy barrier of 2D perovskites, as revealed by this work. A brief outlook has been added to the conclusion in the revised manuscript.  Organic halide salt passivation is considered to be an essential strategy to reduce defects in state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This strategy, however, suffers from the inevitable formation of in-plane favored two-dimensional (2D) perovskite layers with impaired charge transport, especially under thermal conditions, impeding photovoltaic performance and device scale-up. To overcome this limitation, we studied the energy barrier of 2D perovskite formation from ortho-, metaand para-isomers of (phenylene)di(ethylammonium) iodide (PDEAI 2 ) that were designed for tailored defect passivation. Treatment with the most sterically hindered ortho-isomer not only prevents the formation of surficial 2D perovskite film, even at elevated temperatures, but also maximizes the passivation effect on both shallow-and deep-level defects. The ensuing PSCs achieve an efficiency of 23.9% with longterm operational stability (over 1000 h). Importantly, a record efficiency of 21.4% for the perovskite module with an active area of 26 cm 2 was achieved. A s the front runner among emerging photovoltaic technologies, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 25% show great promise for scale-up and future commercialization due to relatively simple and low-cost solution processes  [1] [2] [3] [4]  . However, the disordered stoichiometric compositions at surfaces, the loss of organic components during thermal annealing, and the heterogeneous polycrystalline nature inevitably generate abundant defects in the solution-processed perovskite films, particularly at surfaces and grain boundaries  [5] [6] [7] [8]  . Such defects incur electronic states in the bandgap of the perovskite and behave as nonradiative recombination centers, which shorten the carrier lifetime and limit the photovoltaic performance  9  . Moreover, these defects are responsible for local charge accumulation, accelerated ion migration, and the initial invasion of moisture or oxygen, ultimately causing device instability issues  3  . The defects also hinder the scale-up of PSCs to modules, thus restricting commercialization  10  . To address this problem, various defect reduction methods have been proposed including (i) composition tuning  [11] [12] [13]  , (ii) crystal growth regulation  [14] [15] [16]  , and (iii) surface passivation  [17] [18] [19] [20]  . To date, surficial post-treatment by alkylammonium halides is commonly exploited to achieve efficient and stable perovskite devices, and many compounds have been evaluated  [21] [22] [23] [24]  . Typically, an additional two-dimensional (2D) perovskite layer is formed on top of the primary perovskite absorber after treatment with alkylammonium halides, improving the stability of the devices  8, 25, 26  . A stubborn in-plane orientation and high exciton binding energy are usually observed for the surficial 2D perovskite layer, which potentially suppresses charge transport and draws back the passivation effect, especially when using bulkier spacer cations  [27] [28] [29]  . For this reason, recently, You et al. removed the annealing process after post-treatment to enable a thin phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) layer instead of a 2D perovskite layer for more effective surface passivation  30  . As a result, they achieved a certified PCE of over 23%, benefiting from a combination of promotion of charge transport by the π-conjugated phenyl rings, reduction of Pb 2+ interstitials through amine coordination, and filling of iodine vacancies by iodide ions  17  . However, these devices still suffered from a plummet in PCE under higher operating temperatures due to the conversion of PEAI to 2D PEA 2 PbI 4 . Therefore, an alkylammonium halide that can sustain higher temperatures without undergoing 2D perovskite formation is highly desirable to effectively passivate surface defects for efficient and stable PSCs and modules. Herein, we describe surface passivation of perovskite films using ortho-(phenylene)di(ethylammonium) iodide (o-PDEAI 2 ) that leads to high-performance PSCs and modules. From an investigation of the ortho-, meta-, and para-isomers for PDEAI 2 , the ortho-isomer effectively increases the energy barrier of the 2D perovskite formation and prevents the bulky organic cations from entering the perovskite lattice even at elevated temperatures. Surficial o-PDEAI 2 exhibits a comprehensive passivation effect on both shallow-and deep-level defects, which suppresses nonradiative recombination and improves interfacial charge extraction, resulting in a PCE of 23.9% in PSCs with enhanced longterm stability at ambient and elevated temperatures, and lightsoaking conditions. Furthermore, a o-PDEAI 2 -based perovskite module, with an active area of 26 cm 2 , presents a record efficiency of 21.4%. 
 Results 
 Isomer construction for suppressing 2D perovskite formation. The ortho-, meta-, and para-isomers of PDEAI 2 (Fig.  1a ) were prepared and further details are provided in the Supplementary Information. To examine their potential to form 2D perovskites, films composed of equimolar quantities of PDEAI 2 and PbI 2 were fabricated. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the para-PDEAI 2 (p-PDEAI 2 )-based film (Fig.  1b ) exhibit a dominant peak at ∼7.15°associated with (002) lattice reflections of the 2D (p-PDEA)PbI 4 perovskite  31, 32  . The meta-PDEAI 2 (m-PDEAI 2 )based film contains the same peak, but with a much lower relative intensity, implying that the 2D perovskite is formed, but to a much lower extent. The non-perovskite amorphous XRD pattern observed in the o-PDEAI 2 -based film suggests that the 2D perovskite cannot be formed. Absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra reveal a similar trend (Fig.  1c ). The p-PDEAI 2 -based film shows an exciton absorption around 516 nm and a PL emission around 532 nm, assigned to the characteristic peaks of 2D perovskite with layer thickness n = 1  33  . These optical characteristics were not observed in the m-PDEAI 2 -based sample due to the negligible 2D component in the film. Similarly, no absorption or emission signal was identified in the region 500-600 nm for o-PDEAI 2 -based film, indicating that the formation of 2D perovskite is disfavored. Next, PDEAI 2 isopropanol solutions were spin-coated onto the perovskite surface and experiments were performed to determine whether the surficial 2D perovskite is formed during the posttreatment process, especially under thermal induction. Widely used PEAI was employed for comparison. Figure  1d  displays the temperature-dependent PL spectra of perovskite films under 450 nm excitation. As the temperature increases, the films deposited with PEAI and p-PDEAI 2 show enhanced emission in the 510-540 nm region, evidencing the growth of 2D perovskite with n = 1 on the film surface (Fig.  1b ). In contrast, posttreatment with m-PDEAI 2 and o-PDEAI 2 did not lead to the formation of surficial 2D perovskite, even at elevated temperatures. This was further confirmed by the temperature-dependent XRD (Fig.  1e  and Supplementary Fig.  2 ), where reinforced (002) reflections of 2D perovskite were observed for the p-PDEAI 2 -and PEAI-treated films whereas no peak was observed for the other two films. The upper 2D (p-PDEA)PbI 4 perovskite shows a lower diffraction intensity than that of the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 , which is commonly observed for other Dion-Jacobson (DJ) perovskites  31, 34  . Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was used to probe the crystal orientation of the annealed films (Fig.  1f ). The surficial (PEA) 2 PbI 4 exhibits a combined feature of diffraction arcs and Bragg spots along the q z direction at 0.39 Å -1 and 0.78 Å -1 , implying a random but predominantly in-plane orientation of the (002) and (004) crystal planes. A similar orientation was observed for (p-PDEA)PbI 4 with the characteristic (002) crystal plane at q z = 0.51 Å -1 . Only diffraction signals corresponding to the three-dimensional (3D) perovskite (q z = 1.00 Å -1 ) and excess PbI 2 (q z = 0.91 Å -1 ) were identified for the m-PDEAI 2 -and o-PDEAI 2 -treated films, which is consistent with the XRD results (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). It is evident that both the monoammonium and the para-diammonium substituents on the phenyl ring enable organic halide salts to react with PbI 2 from the underlying 3D perovskite during the post-treatment process and form an in-planeorientation dominated 2D perovskite on the surface (Fig.  1g ). The arbitrary, especially in-plane, orientation will block the charge transport along with the inorganic framework due to the alternant insulating organic layers  35  . In contrast, m-PDEAI 2 and o-PDEAI 2 form a thin organic halide salt layer instead of 2D perovskite layer on the surface, which may avoid the energy disorder and the efficiency loss at elevated operating temperatures. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to understand the specific behavior of each PDEAI 2 isomer. The formation energies of 2D perovskites formed from p-PDEAI 2 , ) passivation is achieved by the cumulative effect related to the number of cations that can be adsorbed per unit surface area. The optimized structures were processed to estimate the maximum number of cations that may be adsorbed on a 2 × 2 supercell (17.7 Å 2 ) of perovskite surface, as illustrated in the insets of Fig.  2b . For the p-PDEA cation, only 4 cations can be adsorbed, increasing to 4-6 for m-PDEA and 6 for o-PDEA cations. Therefore, it can be qualitatively argued that the o-PDEA cation shows a better surface passivation effect due to the increased binding affinity and higher coverage, which may reduce the possibility of defect formation. q xy (Å -1 ) PEAI p-PDEAI 2 m-PDEAI 2 o-PDEAI 2 p-PDEAI 2 m-PDEAI 2 o-PDEAI 2 (002) To examine the passivation effect, we incorporated the PDEAI 2 isomers onto the perovskite film with a surficial morphology corresponding to that shown in Supplementary Fig.  7 , and the photovoltaic devices were fabricated with a typical configuration consisting of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO 2 /SnO 2 /perovskite/PDEAI 2 /2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)/Au (Fig.  3a ). Current density (J)-voltage (V) characteristics of the devices are compared in Supplementary Fig.  8a  and Supplementary Table  3 . As expected, the devices with p-PDEAI 2 show slightly lower PCEs compared to the control devices, ascribed to the high binding energy and electrical anisotropy of 2D (p-PDEA)PbI 4 layer that hinders the charge separation and out-of-plane charge transport  29  . Interestingly, a comparatively low efficiency was observed for the m-PDEAI 2 -based devices. This may be rationalized by the two -CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 3 + groups of m-PDEA anchoring at adjacent octahedral voids of the perovskite surface (Supplementary Fig.  5 ), which might cause carrier stagnation and resultant charge recombination. Among the three isomers, o-PDEAI 2 has the best passivation effect, improving the average PCE from 20.88% of the control device to 22.41%, mainly reflected by the enhanced fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (V OC ). The effective passivation of o-PDEAI 2 may be attributed to (i) the high adsorption density on the perovskite, (ii) the strong adsorption energy due to the diammonium structure, and (iii) the electrostatic interactions with the defective perovskite surface  17, 36  . As a result, the best-performing PSC passivated with o-PDEAI 2 shows a PCE of 23.92%, with a V OC of 1.157 V, a short-circuit current (J SC ) of 24.75 mA cm -2 , and an FF of 83.50%, in which the concentration of the o-PDEAI 2 was optimized to be 2 mg mL -1 (Supplementary Table  4 ), compared to the best control device with a PCE of 21.94%, V OC of 1.135 V, J SC of 24.49 mA cm -2 and FF of 79.00%. The integrated J SC values from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra in Supplementary Fig.  8b  matches well with those measured from the J-V curves (< 1% discrepancy). A stabilized power output of 23.50% and negligible hysteresis are demonstrated for the o-PDEAI 2 -based device as shown in Fig.  3b . Also, the statistic histogram reveals good reproductivity with 75% of the devices having PCEs exceeding 22% (Fig.  3c ), confirming the effectiveness of o-PDEAI 2 passivation. To elucidate the passivation effect on the hole extraction and carrier dynamics in the devices, voltage-dependent transient PL and transient photocurrent studies were performed. Supplementary Fig.  9a-e   treated with PDEAI 2 and nontreated perovskite films covered with spiro-OMeTAD deposited on glass substrates (see Supplementary Fig.  9f  for kinetics and Supplementary Table  5  for biexponential fitting parameters). For comparison, we have also investigated a pure nontreated perovskite film, which showed a long lifetime of 284 ns indicating a high material quality  38  . The spiro-OMeTAD layer significantly shortens the PL decay due to efficient hole extraction. Passivation with the different PDEAI 2 isomers shows qualitatively similar results as for the complete devices confirming their influence on the hole extraction rate. The carrier extraction dynamics were revealed by transient photocurrent measurements. Due to the high capacitance of the devices restricting the time resolution of photocurrent measurements, the carrier extraction investigations were performed in integral mode measuring discharging of the device capacitance by photocurrents, when voltage was applied through a high (1 kΩ) resistor. The signal growth, in this case, corresponds to the cumulated extracted charge. Figure  3e   We further addressed the role of PDEAI 2 passivation by investigating transient photocurrent kinetics in lateral sample geometry. The perovskite films were formed on an interdigitated comb of Pt electrodes (IDE) with 5 μm interelectrode distances and a spiro-MeOTAD layer was deposited on top of perovskite films. Due to the large, 5 μm interelectrode distance, the carrier extraction was slow. We also used low excitation intensity, when carrier recombination could be ignored. In these conditions, the photocurrent kinetics on a sub-microsecond time scale was mainly determined by the carrier trapping and by the hole extraction to hole transport layer (HTL)  39  . The control device with HTL shows faster photocurrent decay than that without HTL during initial ~50 ns due to the hole extraction (Fig.  3f ). The influence of PDEAI 2 treatment is expected to be bilateral: passivation of surface traps shall cause slower photocurrent decay, and modification of the hole extraction rate may cause additional photocurrent changes. Indeed, all passivated samples show slower photocurrent decay indicating reduced carrier trapping. The m-PDEAI 2 -treated sample shows particularly slow decay, apparently because of reduced carrier trapping and the prevented hole extraction. While the o-PDEAI 2 -treated sample shows similar slow carrier decay during initial ~20 ns, due to reduced carrier trapping, but at longer times the photocurrent decays faster attributed to the improved hole extraction. The overall transient PL and photocurrent results provide indications of interfacial trap passivation by the PDEAI 2 isomers and also demonstrate that o-PDEAI 2 treatment reduces the carrier transfer barrier at the perovskite/HTL junction and effectively increases the hole extraction rate contributing to the FF enhancement of PSCs. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to understand the surface energy band structure with and without o-PDEAI 2 . The work function is determined to be -4.45 eV and -4.91 eV for the pristine perovskite surface and the o-PDEAI 2 passivated surface, respectively (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). This shift is in accordance with the change in surface potential probed by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) as reflected in Fig.  4a . The o-PDEAI 2 -passivated surface exhibits a lower average electronic chemical potential (0.16 mV) than that of the control (0.33 mV). The downshifted energy level suggests a less n-type surface after o-PDEAI 2 treatment, which causes upwards band bending and improves hole transport and extraction for higher V OC values  40, 41  . Confocal PL microscopy mapping was applied to probe the homogeneity of perovskite films. The film with o-PDEAI 2 presents more uniform PL emission compared to the control film, indicating less surface defect densities (Fig.  4b ). This is also revealed by the cathodoluminescence (CL) intensity maps, where a more homogeneous distribution was demonstrated for the film with o-PDEAI 2 passivation (Fig.  4c ). To complement these data the corresponding CL spectra (Supplementary Fig.  11 ) confirm that o-PDEAI 2 treatment does not induce 2D perovskite formation on the surface and the CL peaks at around 508 nm may be assigned to the presence of excess PbI 2 in both films. To confirm the presence of o-PDEAI 2 on the perovskite surface, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed. The high-resolution XPS patterns of C 1s (Supplementary Fig.  12 ) show an emerging peak at ~291.0 eV, corresponding to the conjugated π-π bonding of the phenyl group in o-PDEAI 2  30  . The XPS pattern of Pb 4f for the control film displays two dominant peaks located at 138. 8 and 143.7 eV, assigned to the Pb 4f 7/2 and Pb 4f 5/2 , respectively (Fig.  4d ), which shift to 139.1 and 144.0 eV for the film with o-PDEAI 2 . This shift to higher binding energies reflects the modified electronic states of the perovskite atoms due to interactions between o-PDEAI 2 and the perovskite surface  41  . In addition, another two peaks located at 137.0 and 141.9 eV arising from the metallic Pb were observed in the control film, which were not observed in the passivated film. This implies that o-PDEAI 2 can combine with under-coordinated Pb 2+ ions and thereby avoid the formation of metallic Pb, thus restraining the ionic defects and improving the operational stability of the PSCs 42 . To quantify the passivation effect of o-PDEAI 2 , a Mott-Schottky analysis and trap density of states (tDOS) measurements were conducted on the complete devices. As indicated in Fig.  4e , the higher built-in potential (1.146 vs 1.121 V) and lower interfacial charge density (2.73 × 10 15 vs 3.50 × 10 15 cm -3 ) for the o-PDEAI 2 -passivated device demonstrates that the o-PDEAI 2 layer can enhance the driving force of carrier injection and reduce the recombination losses at the interface  10  . The tDOS distribution under each energy demarcation was characterized as shown in Fig.  4f . The charging and discharging of trap states within the bandgap contributes to a larger variation in capacitance with the change of frequencies. Thus, the frequency differential capacitance can disclose the defects at certain energy demarcations  43  . It was found that the control device has higher trap densities of 10 19 -10 21 m -3 eV -1 over three trap bands. After o-PDEAI 2 treatment, the tDOS was reduced over the entire energy region, to 10 18 -10 20 m -3 eV -1 , confirming that the o-PDEAI 2 effectively passivate the defects with both shallow and deep energy levels on the surface of perovskite film. We further evaluated the scalability of surface passivation by o-PDEAI 2 by fabricating a perovskite solar module with a total active area of 26.00 cm 2 (Fig.  5a ). The module was completed by laser etching with 9 subcells in series and the interconnection is schematically illustrated in Fig.  5b . Encouragingly, the perovskite solar module based on o-PDEAI 2 passivation exhibits a V OC of 10.30 V, a J SC of 2.71 mA cm -2 , an FF of 76.40%, and a PCE of 21.36% (Fig.  5c  and Supplementary Fig.  13 ), which corresponds to a designated-area efficiency of 19.27%. This is one of the highest efficiencies reported so far for perovskite solar modules (Supplementary Table  6 )  44  . The high module performance Shelf life and operational stability. Long-term stability tests were carried out to study the influence of o-PDEAI 2 layer on device stability. The PCEs of the unencapsulated devices under a RH of 40-50% were first tracked over time (Fig.  5d ). The control device maintains 58% of the initial PCE (20.82%) after 1008 h, compared to that of 85% for the o-PDEAI 2 passivated device with an initial efficiency of 22.65%. The thermal stability was also evaluated by heating the perovskite films and corresponding devices at 85 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. As shown in Fig.  5e , the o-PDEAI 2 passivated device (initial PCE 22.38%) degrades by 25% over 1000 h, compared to a 49% decrease for the control device (initial PCE 20.32%). Interestingly, an efficiency plummet is not observed at the start of the annealing process. That is, the suppression of converting o-PDEAI 2 into 2D perovskite effectively retains the passivation effect under constant heating, and avoids the PCE drop at the initial stage, which was normally observed in the widely used PEAI passivation  30  . XRD tracking shows that the thermal degradation of these perovskite films results from the decomposition of the perovskite material (Fig.  5f ). The control film shows an increase in the intensity of the peaks that correspond to PbI 2 , whereas decomposition is retarded after o-PDEAI 2 passivation, indicating the o-PDEAI 2 passivation layer reduces the release of volatile organic components and enhances the resistance to heat of the perovskite material  45  . The continuous performance of the unencapsulated PSCs was also examined by MPPT under 1 sun illumination in an inert atmosphere (Fig.  5g ). The device passivated with o-PDEAI 2 exhibits enhanced light stability, maintaining >90% of its original PCE after 1100 h, outperforming the control device, which degrades to >60% of the initial PCE. The robust ambient and operational stability of the o-PDEAI 2 -based device may be attributed to the hydrophobicity of the phenyl group, the mitigated interfacial charge accumulation, and the suppressed ion migration benefiting from the passivation of defects  46, 47  . 
 Discussion We demonstrate that o-PDEAI 2 is an effective passivation agent which affords highly efficient and stable PSCs. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that locating the two ammonium cations in the most sterically hindered ortho position endows o-PDEAI 2 with an energy barrier for the formation of the in-plane favored 2D perovskite together with stronger defect passivation effects compared to the other structural isomers, to significantly reduce interfacial charge recombination. Passivation with o-PDEAI 2 boosts the efficiency of PSCs and modules (active area of 26 cm 2 ) to 23.9% and 21.4%, respectively, while ensuring longterm stabilities over 1000 h. This study demonstrates that altering functional groups and chemical structures should be an effective strategy to develop novel organic cation passivators with continuous and stable passivation effect, which may pave the way for scaling up perovskite photovoltaics to sizes of commercial relevance. 
 Methods Device fabrication. The TiO 2 compact (c-TiO 2 ) layer was deposited onto the cleaned FTO (Nippon Sheet Glass, TEC8) substrates by spray pyrolysis of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt.% in isopropanol, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in anhydrous isopropanol (99.8%, Acros Organics) with 1:20 volume ratio at 450 °C and then annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. TiO 2 paste (30NR-D, GreatCell Solar) was diluted in anhydrous ethanol (99.8%, Acros Organics) with a weight ratio of 1:10 and spin-coated onto substrates at 3000 rpm for 20 s. The films were then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min in air. After cooling, 0.1 M SnCl 4 (99%, Acros Organics) aqueous solution was deposited on the substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The films were then dried at 190 °C for 1 h and transferred into a nitrogen glovebox. 1.45 M perovskite precursors (PbI 2 :PbBr 2 :FAI:MAI:CsI:MACl = 0.98:0.02:0.81:0.04:0.05:0.20) were dissolved in the mixed DMF (99.8%, Acros Organics): DMSO (99.7%, Acros Organics) = 4:1 (volume ratio) solvent. The perovskite solution was spin-coated on substrates at 1000 rpm for 12 s and 5000 rpm for 28 s, respectively. 200 µL of chlorobenzene (99.8%, Acros Organics) was dropped onto the spinning films at 15 s before the end of the second step, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min and 150 °C for 10 min. For the post treatment, phenyldiethylammonium iodide (PDEAI 2 ) solutions in anhydrous isopropanol (99.8%, Acros Organics) were deposited on the perovskite films at 4000 rpm for 20 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. 0.06 M spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in chlorobenzene (99.8%, Acros Organics), adding 0.2 M 4-tert-Butylpyridine (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.03 M bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide lithium salt (LiTFSI, 99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile (99.9%, Acros Organics) and 0.0035 M FK209 Co(III) TFSI salt (GreatCell Solar) in acetonitrile (99.9%, Acros Organics). The spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 20 s, followed by thermal evaporation of a 70 nm gold electrode under a high vacuum. For module fabrication, 6.5 cm × 7 cm FTO substrates were patterned by laser with nine subcells connected in series. The film deposition processes were the same as the normal solar cells as described above. The geometric fill factor (GFF) was calculated to be 90.2%, which was defined as the active area divided by the designated area. Characterization. The GIWAXS was measured with a photon energy of 8.03 keV (1.55 Å) at an incident angle of 0.3°. PL decay kinetics were measured using the Edinburgh Instruments time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) fluorescence spectrometer F900. Voltage-dependent PL decay measurements were performed by varying the reverse bias voltage applied to the cell from 0 to 2.5 V in steps of 0.5 V and simultaneously measuring the PL lifetime at each voltage. The PL decay kinetics were fitted using the intensity-weighted double exponential functions ( τ ¼ ∑ 2 i¼1 A i τ i 2 =∑ 2 i¼1 A i τ i ) to estimate the average lifetimes. The KPFM images were acquired using an MFP-3D Infinity with AC bias modulation at 7.5KHz and 4 V amplitude in ambient. The UPS was measured by an AXIS Nova spectrometer (Kratos Analytical Ltd, UK) with a He-I source (21.22 eV). The XPS was examined by VersaProbe II (Physical Electronics Inc.) with an Al-Ka source of 1486.6 eV. The micro-PL maps were obtained with an Acton Standard Series SP-2558 laser confocal Raman spectrometer (Princeton Instruments), a digital CCD (PIXIS:100B_eXcelon), and a 485 nm laser (PicoQuant LDH-P-C-485). CL measurements were performed on the Attolight ROSA 4634 CL SEM at 1 kV and 50 nm per pixel for the image of 128 × 128 pixels. J-V characteristics of the devices were characterized by a commercial solar simulator (Oriel, 450 W xenon, AAA class) combined with a Keithley 2400 source meter at room temperature in air. The light intensity was calibrated before each measurement with a Si reference cell (KG5, Newport) to match with the AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm -2 ) standard. The voltage scan rate and scan steps were 125 mV s -1 and 10 mV, respectively. No light soaking or voltage bias was applied before the measurement and the active area of the cells was defined by a black metal mask with a square aperture of the area of 0.09 cm 2 . For solar modules, the voltage scan rate was 5 V s -1 and scan steps were 50 mV, and the active area is 26 cm 2 . The statistics of PCEs for devices were obtained from 20 samples for each condition. The EQE spectra were recorded with an IQE200B (Oriel). The stability test was conducted under 100 mW cm -2 LED illumination at 25 °C and the devices were sealed in a cell holder flushed with a N 2 flow of ~30 mL min -1 . For the humidity test, the unsealed solar cells were kept in the ambient of 40-50% RH monitored by a hygrometer at room temperature in the dark. For the thermal stability test, the solar cells were kept at 85 °C in nitrogen under dark conditions. Transient photocurrent measurements were performed with an Agilent Technologies DS05054A oscilloscope using a 1 kΩ input resistor and a Tektronix AFG 3101 function generator. The Mott-Schottky curve was recorded with an SP-200 potentiostat (BioLogic). 69. Anal. calcd for C10H18I2N2: C 28.59; H 4.32; N 6.67; I 60.42; found: C 30,25; H 4,26; N 6,2.

 isolated box with Gamma kpoint sampling. Perovskite surface was modeled by cutting 2 × 2 slabs from the bulk tetragonal MAPbI3 crystal structure, which exposes MAI-terminated (001) surface. The 2 × 2 slabs (a = b = 17.7 Å) were optimized with Gamma point sampling. The experimental MAPbI3 cell parameters were employed to build a periodic supercell in the x and y directions, whereas a vacuum of more than 10 Å is introduced along the surface truncation direction. The reaction thermodynamics of the cation replacement process were calculated by considering the following equilibrium: MAI-terminated slab + cationic molecule = cation inserted MAI-terminated slab + 2 MA molecules. Adsorption energy (Eads) is calculated using the following formula: Eads = Eslab+cationic molecule adsorbed -Eslab -Ecationic molecule, where Eslab+cationic molecule adsorbed represents the total energy of the adsorbed cationic molecules with the slab, Eslab is the total energy of the bare slab, and Ecationic molecule is the energy of the isolated cationic molecule in a large supercell. The absolute values of the adsorption energies are large because of the adsorption of a gas-phase cationic molecule.

 shows the normalized charge extraction kinetics under an applied voltage of 1 V. The o-PDEAI 2 -passivated device shows the fastest carrier extraction of <0.2 μs. (The partial signal drop during about 0.4-2.0 μs is caused by the sample recharging by the capacitance from the external circuit.) The control device shows similarly fast initial extraction, however, an additional slow extraction component is also observed. Significantly slower charge extraction from the m-PDEAI 2 -treated device is in good agreement with the PL decay data.

 For surface energy band measurements, the authors said that the downshift suggests a more p-type surface after o-PDEAI 2 treatment, which can improve hole extraction and cause band-bending for higher V OC values. However, from the UPS measurements (Supplementary Fig. 7), we could estimate the valence band of perovskite are -5.85 eV for control and ~6.15 eV for o-PDEAI 2 treatment. Thus, this valence band of perovskite seems to impair the hole extraction rather than improve hole extraction as ref 40. (Energy Environ. Sci. 13, 1222-1230 (2020).) compound. Author reply: Thank you for your valuable question. Instead of 2D perovskite passivation, which introduced a new large-bandgap perovskite material between the 3D perovskite and the hole transport material (HTM), in this work, o-PDEAI 2 passivation adjusted the electronic band structures while maintained the bandgap of the perovskite film (Figure R4). The UPS results revealed downshifted Fermi level (E F ) and valence band (E choline iodine, azetidinium, perhydropoly(silazane), 1-(4-bromophenyl)-6,7-diphenylimidazo[5,1,2-cd]indolizine, benzopentafulvalenes V ), indicating a less n-type surface after o-PDEAI 2 passivation. The downshifted E F and E V of passivated perovskite have been demonstrated to promote hole extraction by many passivators, such as theophylline,

Metastable Dion-Jacobson 2D structure enables efficient and stable perovskite solar cells
The performance of three-dimensional (3D) organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can be enhanced through surface treatment with 2D layered perovskites that have efficient charge transport. We maximized hole transport across the layers of a metastable Dion-Jacobson (DJ) 2D perovskite that tuned the orientational arrangements of asymmetric bulky organic molecules. The reduced energy barrier for hole transport increased out-of-plane transport rates by a factor of 4 to 5, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for the 2D PSC was 4.9%. With the metastable DJ 2D surface layer, the PCE of three common 3D PSCs was enhanced by approximately 12 to 16% and could reach approximately 24.7%. For a triple-cation-mixed-halide PSC, 90% of the initial PCE was retained after 1000 hours of 1-sun operation at ~40°C in nitrogen. 
 RESEARCH
P erovskite solar cells (PSCs) are a promising photovoltaic (PV) technology, and certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as high as 25.5% have been reported  (1) . Despite this high performance, device stability hinders their commercialization. Efforts to improve device stability include defect passivation, contact layer modification, and encapsulation  (2) (3) (4) (5) . The use of two-dimensional (2D) perovskite as the interfacial modification layer has great potential for addressing surface defects, in particular to improve the stability and efficiency of PSCs  (6) (7) (8) . The Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) 2D layered perovskites that are based on bulky cations, such as phenethylammonium (PEA + ) or butylammonium (BA + ), have been widely applied to the surface of 3D perovskite thin films to decrease defect densities and enhance device stability  (8) (9) (10) (11) . Such bulky organic cations often self-assemble into a barrier layer that protects against surface water adsorption or ingress. However, bulky-cation-based 2D structures often exhibit anisotropic and poor charge transport across the organic layer and are susceptible to charge-extraction barrier formation that inhibits efficient device operation  (12) (13) (14) . We show a rational design strategy to maximize the out-of-plane hole transport based on a metastable Dion-Jacobson (DJ) 2D perovskite surface layer with a reduced transport energy barrier by using asymmetric bulky organic molecules, leading to highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. Our general design strategy to maximize the out-of-plane charge transport in 2D perovskites is illustrated in Fig.  1 . Because the free electrons and holes are localized in the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) of the [PbI 6 ] planes, respectively, and because of the long distance between two adjacent [PbI 6 ] planes, the out-of-plane charge transport must traverse the bulky cationic organic layers. Thus, it is mainly limited by two factors: (i) the low carrier mobility within the organic layer and (ii) the energy barrier between the [PbI 6 ] planes and the bulky organic cations. To mitigate the first limit, DJ 2D structures based on a short and single layer of divalent organoammonium cations  (15) (16) (17) (18)  are generally more preferable than the RP 2D structures based on double layers of monovalent organoammonium cations  (19) . To mitigate the second limiting factor, the band offsets between the [PbI 6 ] planes and the bulky cationic organic layers need to be optimized. The coupling (interaction) between [PbI 6 ] planes and the organic cations is through hydrogen bonding, and the change in the bonding strength can affect the band offsets  (20) . For a weaker hydrogen bonding configuration, the bonding states of the bulky organic layers are normally at a higher energy position, which brings them nearer the VBM of the [PbI 6 ] planes (Fig.  1A ). This effect leads to a smaller band offset or barrier for hole transport between the [PbI 6 ] inorganic planes and organic cations. Because of the spinorbital coupling of Pb 6p orbitals, the antibonding states of the organic layers are much higher than the CBM of the [PbI 6 ] planes. Thus, a DJ structure with weaker hydrogen bonding should improve hole transport. Yet, a weaker hydrogen bonding (or H-bonding) configuration generally means a less stable structure. Thus, a metastable DJ 2D structure with short cationic organic layers could in principle facilitate out-of-plane hole transport. A rational strategy to induce the desired metastable H-bonding motifs in DJ 2D structures is to use asymmetric diammonium cations in lieu of symmetric straight chain divalent  cations. For example, both N,N-dimethyl-1,3propane diammonium (DMePDA 2+ ) and 1,4butane diammonium (BDA 2+ ) form DJ 2D structures with short interlayer distances  (19) . Whereas BDA 2+ is symmetric and features two terminal primary ammonium ions on the butyl (C4) chain, DMePDA 2+ is asymmetric, with a primary ammonium on one end and a dimethyl-substituted tertiary ammonium on the other end of the propyl (C3) chain. The ""head or tail"" H-bonding options for the DMePDA 2+ molecules are asymmetric, giving rise to different possible relative orientations of the adjacent molecules, and the different H-bonding interactions possible within the [PbI 6 ] planes could lead to both stable and metastable energy polymorphs of the 2D structure (Fig.  1B ). The alternating relative head-to-tail alignment of adjacent DMePDA 2+ cations (most stable orientation configuration) provides a larger compensation for overall structural relaxation than those of other orientation arrangements. By contrast, the symmetric BDA 2+ molecule has only one possible orientation configuration (Fig.  1B ) and cannot form metastable polymorphs. We further examined single-crystal 2D DJ structures from BDAI 2 and DMePDAI 2 and conducted first-principle calculations to verify our design strategy. We found that 1,3-propane diammonium diiodine (PDAI 2 )-which is often assumed the shortest diamine  (15, 21)  to form DJ 2D perovskites-templated Pb-I to a non-perovskite structure (empirical formula:  S1  and table  S1 ). Thus, BDA 2+ represents the shortest linearalkyl-chain diamine that forms an iodide-based 2D DJ structure (BDAPbI 4 ) (fig.  S2A  and table  S2 ). C3-based DMePDAI 2 with two methyl groups attached to one side of PDA can form 2D DJ structures with two polymorphs, which we refer to as DMePDAPbI 4 -1 (fig.  S2B  and table  S3 ) and DMePDAPbI 4 -2, respectively (fig.  S2C )  (22) . [PDAPbI 4 ] 15 •[PDAI 2 ]) (fig. We grew the DMePDAPbI 4 -1 single crystal, which was based on the most stable DMePDA 2+ orientation alignment, from a concentrated hydroiodic acid solution using a slow-crystallization process, as adapted from our previous report  (23)  and consistent with a previous theoretical predication  (24) . By contrast, the DMePDAPbI 4 -2 single crystal, which was based on a metastable orientational alignment, was formed from either a fast cooling  (22)  or antisolvent quenching during singlecrystal growth  (25) , both of which represent a fast-crystallization process. In comparison with DMePDAPbI 4 -1, DMePDAPbI 4 -2 had an emission wavelength that was red-shifted ~25 nm, which is consistent with the corresponding absorption data (fig.  S3 ). The average interlayer distances were comparable among these 2D structures (~10.10 to 10.39 Å), with that of BDAPbI 4 being the shortest. The corresponding hydrogen-bonding configurations for these three single-crystal structures (figs. S4, S5, and S6) were consistent with the analysis in Fig.  1B . We confirmed our design strategy by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculation.   We calculated the effect of organic molecules using the screened hybrid functional and van der Waals (vdW) interaction (HSE+vdW)  (26, 27) . The DMePDAPbI 4 -2 structure was indeed less stable than the DMePDAPbI 4 -1 structure. The energy level differences of the organic cations in BDAPbI 4 , DMePDAPbI 4 -1, and DMePDAPbI 4 -2 could be seen in the total density of states (DOSs) of the organic cations (the sum of states of C, N, and H atoms) (Fig.  1C ). The total DOS of BDA 2+ cations in BDAPbI 4 was lower in energy (farther from VBM) than that of DMePDA 2+ cations in DMePDAPbI 4 -1, which in turn was lower in energy compared with the total DOS of DMePDA 2+ cations in DMePDAPbI 4 -2. Thus, we expected the outof-plane hole transport to improve from BDAPbI 4 to DMePDAPbI 4 -2. Rapid perovskite film growth conditions from standard solution deposition also led to the formation of the metastable DMeP-DAPbI 4 -2 structure. The XRD patterns of the DMePDAPbI 4 thin film prepared by means of spin coating are shown in Fig.  2A . The powder XRD pattern measured from DMePDAPbI 4 -1 and DMePDAPbI 4 -2 single-crystal samples, along with the calculated powder XRD patterns shown in Fig.  2A  for comparison, revealed the differences of XRD patterns between these two single crystals. The XRD pattern of the thin-film sample matched that of the DMePDAPbI 4 -2 structure. A metastable polymorph does not mean it is unstable under synthetic or ambient conditions. The phase transformation between polymorphs requires 180°rotation of the alkyl chain, which is highly energetically unfavorable (Fig.  2B ) (figs. S7 and S8). A wide range of thin-film growth conditions from solution all formed DMePDAPbI 4 -2 thin films (fig.  S9 ). To test our hypothesis that the reduced energy barrier from the asymmetric bulky organic cation layer could facilitate charge transport between inorganic [PbI 6 ] sheets, we conducted time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements along the out-of-plane direction  (28) . In Fig.  2C , we compare the normalized TRMC results between several n = 1 2D perovskite thin films calibrated by their corresponding internal quantum yield of charges measured in devices. The out-of-plane transport for DMePDAPbI 4 (or more specifically, DMePDAPbI 4 -2) is about a factor of 4 to 5 faster than that of BDAPbI 4 , despite the slightly longer interlayer distance. Space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements further verified that the DMeP-DAPbI 4 -2 structure had faster out-of-plane hole transport than that of the DMePDAPbI 4 -1 structure (fig.  S10 ). These results confirmed the role of reducing the energy barrier for improving out-of-plane charge transport. The out-of-plane transport for the two 2D DJ structures (DMePDAPbI 4 and BDAPbI 4 ) was faster than those of the two 2D RP structures (BA 2 PbI 4 and PEA 2 PbI 4 ). These TRMC results were consistent with the current density-voltage (J-V) results of PSCs on the basis of the corresponding n = 1 2D structures (Fig.  2D  and table  S4 ). The DMePDAPbI 4 -based PSC reached a PCE of 4.90% (forward scan) and 4.33% (reverse scan), which is among the highest obtained thus far for any n = 1 2D lead iodide-based PSCs (6); the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum is shown in fig.  S11 . The use of 2D systems to passivate defects and enhance performance has recently been used in many polycrystalline PV technologies  (29) . We validated the impact of this metastable design motif with the use of DMePDAPbI 4 as a surface layer to improve the quality of 3D perovskite absorbers. We spin-coated the corresponding bulky organic halide salt in isopropanol (IPA) solution on top of a 3D perovskite absorber layer  (6) . Specifically, the DMePDAI 2 /IPA solution was coated atop (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbI 2 Br) 0.1 (CsPbI 3 ) 0.05 (or FA 0.85 MA 0.1 Cs 0.05 PbI 2.9 Br 0.1 ) followed by annealing, where FA is formamidinium and MA is methylammonium. The thin-film XRD  results suggested that the DMePDAPbI 4 -2 structure formed, as evidenced by the characteristic low-angle diffraction peak, at ~8.5°f or DMePDAPbI 4 -2, rather than ~8.7°for DMePDAPbI 4 -1 (Fig.  3A ). We also checked the 2D structures on top of three other common perovskite compositions of Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 PbI 3 , (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 , and FAPbI 3 (fig.  S12 ). For these compositions, the characteristics peaks at (002), (004), and (006) matched well to DMePDAPbI 4 -2, which were absent in the DMePDAPbI 4 -1 spectrum. Last, the low-angle diffraction peak associated with the 2D structure from the thin-film XRD results were further confirmed with grazingincidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements (fig.  S13 ). In terms of 2D surfacelayer topology and coverage, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements indicated that the treatment induced formation of a thin surface layer with small apparent grain sizes (figs. S14 and S15). The conductive-atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) measurements show that the current of the treated film is much more uniform and lower than that of the control film, which is consistent with the formation of a capping layer over the 3D perovskite layer (fig.  S16 ). To gain more insight into how the DMeP-DAI 2 modification affects the optoelectronic properties in perovskite films, we conducted steady-state photoluminescence (PL), timeresolved photoluminescence (TRPL), and TRMC studies on these samples. The DMePDAI 2 treatment led to enhanced PL intensity (fig.  S17 ), longer TRPL lifetime (fig.  S18  and table  S5 ), and improved TRMC mobility and lifetime (fig.  S19 ) that were consistent with the improved surface properties  (8, 30) . In addition, the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements showed that the 2D surface treatment improved the energetics for hole transport from the 3D perovskite to the 2D surface layer (fig.  S20 ). The impact of the DMePDAI 2 treatment on the perovskite surface chemistry was investigated with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Normalized core levels from key elements identified on the sample surface are included in figs. S21 and S22. The spectral shapes of most core levels showed minimal change between the two samples, indicating similar bonding environments, but surface treatment caused change in the C 1s and N 1s core levels. We fit the core levels (Fig.  3 , B to E) using constrained fitting procedures (summarized in tables S6 and S7). The control sample had a N 1s region whose relative peak areas were dominated by a C=NH 2 + (FA) peak (~401 eV) with a small shoulder to higher binding energy (~403 eV) that corresponded to C-NH 3 (MA). The DMePDAI 2 treatment increased the area of the C-NH 3 peak and also led to two additional peaks at a lower binding energy consistent with that of C-NH 2 (~400 eV) and the tertiary amine in DMePDAI 2 (~398 eV). Concomitant with these changes, redistribution occurred in the features in the C 1s spectra comprising four main peaks that are consistent with primarily C-C or C-H (~285 eV), N-CH 3 (~287 eV), HC(NH 2 ) 2 (~289 eV), and C-O or C=O bonds (~290 eV). The surface treatment decreased the concentration of HC(NH 2 ) 2 bonds from FA on the surface while simultaneously increasing the amount of N-CH 3 and C-C or C-H bonds. In addition, XPS revealed that surface treatment increased the amount of halide on the surface, from about 2.6 halide-to-lead ratio for the control to 3.1 for the DMePDAI 2 -treated film. Collectively, these results suggest that both organic and halide components of the additive incorporated into the top surface of the treated films. Undercoordinated lead can cause donor defects on the surface, resulting in downward band bending and increased recombination centers  (31) , so the increase in the halideto-lead ratio associated with the formation of 2D interfacial component upon surface treatment was consistent with a less defective surface. We investigated the impact of DMePDAI 2 surface treatment on the PV performance by fabricating PSCs using the standard n-i-p device architecture, glass/FTO/electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL)/ Au, where ETL is TiO 2 or SnO 2 and HTL is spiro-OMeTAD, with more details in the supplementary materials  (23) . Typical cross-section SEM images of devices are shown in fig.  S23 . In Fig.  4A , we compare the J-V curves of the PSCs on the basis of triple-cation-mixedhalide FA 0.85 MA 0.1 Cs 0.05 PbI 2.9 Br 0.1 without and with DMePDAI 2 treatment under simulated 100-mW/cm 2 air mass coefficient (AM) 1.5 G 4 of 6 illumination (Table  1 ). With the surface treatment, the device PCE increased from about 20.9 to 24.0% from forward scan and from 20.4 to 23.7% from reverse scan. The PCE improvement is also consistent with a better perovskite-HTL junction on the basis of the cross-sectional Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements (fig.  S24 )  (32) . The optimum concentration for DMePDAI 2 -surface treatment was found at 0.5 mg/mL (fig.  S25 ). In addition to the FA 0.85 MA 0.1 Cs 0.05 PbI 2.9 Br 0.1 perovskite composition, we also examined the impact of DMePDAI 2 surface treatment on PSCs on the basis of double-cation-mixedhalide (FA 0.97 MA 0.03 PbI 2.91 Br 0.09 ) and singlecation-single-halide (MAPbI 3 ) using ETL of SnO 2 and TiO 2 , respectively, and found PCE improvements for both compositions (Fig.  4,  B  and C ). Noteworthy for PSCs based on FA 0.97 MA 0.03 PbI 2.91 Br 0.09 , the PCE was improved from 22.0 to 24.7% from forward scan and from 21.8 to 24.5% from reverse scan, with shortcircuit current density (J sc ) > 25 mA/cm 2 , which is in agreement with the EQE spectrum (fig.  S26 ). For all three perovskite compositions, the stabilized power outputs (SPOs) for PSCs based on the control and DMePDAI 2 -modified perovskite thin films matched well with the J-V mea-surements (Fig.  4 , A to C, insets, and Table  1 ). The PCE improvement for all three perovskite compositions was reproducible on the basis of the statistical comparison (fig.  S27 ). The devices with this treatment also exhibited higher PCE than that of devices based on other surface treatments with similar length of bulky organic salts for either RP or DJ 2D perovskites (fig.  S28 ). Last, we checked the operation stability of unencapsulated FA 0.85 MA 0.1 Cs 0.05 PbI 2.9 Br 0.1 -based PSCs using maximum power point (MPP) tracking at ~40°C in N 2 , following the ISOS-L-1 stability protocol  (33) . The DMePDAI 2 -modified PSC (Fig.  4D ) showed only 10% relative efficiency drop after 1000 hours of continuous operation, whereas the PCE of the control device decreased by ~43%. The stability improvement with DMePDAI 2 surface treatment was also observed when the devices were tested at high-moisture (>85% relative humidity) or high-temperature (85°C) conditions (figs. S29 and S30). These results suggest that the DMePDAI 2 -modification to form a 2D DJ phase surface layer is a general way to improve PSC performance. Our use of the metastable 2D DJ structure through hydrogen bonding tuning based on asymmetric bulky organic molecules represents a promising chemical design element for perovskite interfacial engineering to enhance PSC efficiency and stability.

Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) characterization GIWAXS data were collected at beamline 11-3 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Source (SSRL) at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The X-ray photon energy used at this beamline is 12.7 keV. Samples were exposed to the beam for 60 s in a sealed chamber under helium flow in grazing incidence geometry at an incident angle in the range of 0.12-3.12. A Rayonix MX225 CCD area detector was placed at a sample-to-detector distance of 200 mm. Collected data was calibrated against a reference sample (LaB6) using a software package pyFAI  (35) . The same python package was used for the data processing to obtain 2D and integrated 1D diffraction patterns as a function of a scattering vector q = 4π λ sin( 2θ 2 ). The integration was performed between 0 < χ < 90, where χ is the azimuthal angle. 
 Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) characterizations The measurements were performed inside an Ar-filled glovebox with water and oxygen level lower than 0.01 ppm. All the scans were collected via Nanosensor PPP-EFM tips. The KPFM mappings have a spatial resolution of 30 nm and an electrical resolution of 10 mV. We directly cleaved the cells inside the glovebox with no exposure to air or polishing/ion-milling treatments to flatten the surface. Then, KPFM cross-section images were used for alignment to topography and to mark the locations of interfaces. C-AFM scans were all acquired using a single tip and the same scan conditions, at least two areas were examined to ensure the reliability of results. The FTO substrate was connected to the AFM stage and the applied bias voltage was 0.8 V. 
 X-ray and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (XPS and UPS) characterizations XPS measurements were performed on a Physical Electronics 5600 photoelectron spectrometer, which has been discussed in detail previously  (36) . Briefly, radiation was produced by a monochromatic 350 W Al Kα excitation centered at 1486.7 eV. XPS core-level spectra were collected using a step size of 0.1 eV and pass energy of 11.75 eV. The electron binding energy scale was calibrated using the Fermi edge of a copper substrate, cleaned with Argon ion bombardment. Peak areas were fit using a Gaussian-Lorentzian peak fitting algorithm with a Shirley background. Spectra taken with the Al source are typically assigned an uncertainty of 0.05 eV. Compositional analyses and deconvolutions are typically assigned an uncertainty of 5%. UPS measurements were performed on a Kratos Axis Ultra spectrometer using a He I excitation at 21.22 eV at a 5 eV pass energy and 0° take-off angle. Samples were biased at -10.00 V to accelerate low kinetic energy electrons and secondary electrons from the local environment. The Fermi level was calibrated using an Ar sputter-etched, atomically clean gold sample measured prior to characterization of the samples. 
 Computation The electronic properties were calculated using screened hybrid functional and van der Waals (vdW) interaction (HSE+vdW) to account the effects of organic molecules  (26) . We also employed the Grimme-D3 method to account for the van der Waals (vdW) effect  (27) . The spinorbit coupling is not included in all calculations due to the small effects on the valence band  (37, 38) . The calculations were performed with auxiliary density matrix method (ADMM) implemented in CP2K  (39, 40) . 
 Space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) characterization Vertical hole-only devices (Au/perovskite/Au) were fabricated to extract the out-of-plane hole mobility of 2D perovskite single crystals  (41, 42) . The dark J-V characteristics of hole-only devices were measured by a Keithley 2400 source. Mobilities were calculated at the SCLC region using Child's law, J = 9ɛ0ɛTμhV 2 /8L 3 , where J is the current density, L is the active thickness of the 2D perovskite single crystals, μh is the hole mobility, ɛT is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, ɛ0 is the permittivity of free space, V is the applied voltage to the device. Average values and standard deviations were obtained on 10 devices fabricated and tested under the same conditions.        002 ) planes of the PbI2 crystal. These results suggest that the metastable DMePDAPbI4-2 structure is stable up to ~150C, which is significantly higher than normal device operational temperatures. It is also clear from these results that DMePDAPbI4-2 does not transition to DMePDAPbI4-1 under these conditions, but rather decomposes to the lowest energy primary salts. The results are consistent with the calculated high transition energy barrier between the metastable and stable DMePDAPbI4 structures.            The control perovskite has a biexponential fitted average lifetime of 0.91 microseconds, while the DMePDAI2-treated films lifetime had improved lifetimes of 1.32 microseconds, respectively. The fit-extracted t=0 yield-mobility product () value was found to be 36.9 cm 2 /Vs, and 39.7 cm 2 /Vs for the control, and DMePDAI2 treated films, respectively. Since the yield is normally close to unity in high-performance PSCs, the yield-mobility product can be viewed as a measurement of the charge mobility.     Because the electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite interface should be identical for these devices, we normalized the ETL/perovskite peak to compare the ""back-contact"" quality at the perovskite/HTL interfaces between the surface-modified devices. It is evident that the DMePDAI2-modified device showed a significantly smaller perovskite/HTL electric field difference peak than that of the control perovskite devices. If consider the main junction at ETL/perovskite interface, the smaller perovskite/HTL peak indicates that the DMePDAI2-modified device has a less leaky interface  (44) , suggesting that a better back contact quality can decrease the energy loss associated with carrier transport over the interface, enabling higher FF and Voc in devices.

Top: potential profile under 0 V, -1 V, and -1.5 V bias voltages. Middle: potential difference between the various applied bias voltages and 0 V. Bottom: change in electric field calculated by taking the first derivatives of the potential difference. The hole transport layer (HTL) is spiro-OMeTAD. The local voltage drop across the device is determined by the competition of equivalent resistance of different layers and interfaces, which can be related to the interface quality. Because the electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite interface should be identical for these devices, we normalized the ETL/perovskite peak to compare the ""back-contact"" quality at the perovskite/HTL interfaces between the surface-modified devices. It is evident that the DMePDAI2-modified device showed a significantly smaller perovskite/HTL electric field difference peak than that of the control perovskite devices. If consider the main junction at ETL/perovskite interface, the smaller perovskite/HTL peak indicates that the DMePDAI2-modified device has a less leaky interface (44) , suggesting that a better back contact quality can decrease the energy loss associated with carrier transport over the interface, enabling higher FF and Voc in devices.

Ltd). The MAI, MABr, MAI, FACl, FABr, FAI were synthesized according to the reported method which can be seen everywhere  (52) . The TiO2 was synthesized by using same method in previous report  (3) . 
 Synthesis of Eu(acac)3, Y(acac)3 Eu2O3 (99.99%) and Y2O3 (99.99%) were dissolved in excess hydrochloric acid with stirring and heating. The pH of solution was adjusted to 9-10 by adding NH3•H2O. Excess acetylacetone was added into the solution, and white precipitation formed immediately. The precipitation was washed with deionized water for 3 times. Finally, the product was dried for 20 h in vacuum oven at 70 ○ C. 
 Solar Cells preparation PSCs with typical planar structure ITO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au for primary test were prepared as follows: ITO (10 Ω/□) coated glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in deionized water, acetone and isopropanol. Before TiO2 deposition, the substrate was cleaned by UV-ozone cleaner for 10 min. Then TiO2 layer was deposited by spin coating (3000 r/m) the above TiO2 nanoparticles ethanol solution mixing with titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (1 μL/mg), then followed an annealing process at 150 °C for 40 min in air. Perovskite layer was prepared by a typical two-step method. The metal ions incorporated PbI2 precursor solution (1.0 mmol/mL in DMF) was prepared by adding M(acac)3 (dissolved in DMF, 50 μmol/mL) solution, then spincoated on the TiO2 substrate at 2,600 r/min for 30 s, followed annealing process at 70 °C for 1 min. The cation solution in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) containing MAI, MACl (50 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL) was spin-coated at 2,100 r/min for 30 s, and annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. The hole-transport layer was prepared by spin-coating spiro-MeOTAD (80 mg/mL in chlorobenzene) solution containing tertbutylpyridine (35 μL/mL) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (20 mM) additives. 100 nm gold electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation under high vacuum. Changes have been made to the devices for light stability test under 1 sun illumination, and thermal stability test, as well as the champion PCE. Firstly, the electron transport layer (ETL) was changed to SnO2 for its better stability than TiO2, then hole transport layer (HTL) was replaced by polymer modified spiro-MeOTAD to achieve better performance and stability. The composition of perovskite layer was changed to mixed A-site cations and halides system. In devices for champion PCE, the detail composition was as follows: PbX2 layer (CsI 20 mg, PbI2 530 mg, PbBr2 20 mg, PbCl2 20 mg, MAI 5 mg dissolved in 900 μL DMF and 100 μL DMSO mixed solvent); organic cation layer (MAI 20 mg, FAI 40 mg, MABr 3 mg, MACl 5 mg dissolved in 1 mL IPA). For light and thermal stability test, the MAI in organic cation solution was been entirely replaced by FAI due to the more volatile characteristics of MA + than FA + . 
 Characterization The J-V curves were measured with a source meter (Keithley 2400) with a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) under 1000 W/m 2 illumination (AM 1.5 G) which was calibrated by a silicon reference cell certificated by NREL. The J-V curves were measured in reverse (1.2 V to 0.2 V) or forward (0.2 V to 1.2 V) scanning modes with step 0.01 V and 0.5 s time delay (scanning speed, 20 mV/s). The J-V curve of each device was measured by masking the active area with a metal mask (certified area is 0.09408 cm 2 ). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained by Axis Ultra XPS spectrometer (Kratos, U.K.) with Kα radiation of Al, and operated at 225 W. The binding energy (BE) was calibrated by the peak at 284.8 eV of C 1s spectra. SEM images were obtained with field emission scanning electron microscope (3 keV, MERLIN Compact, ZEISS Germany).

 DFT Calculation method Through CASTEP package codes  (53) , the density-functional theory (DFT) was applied for the calculations of potential energy and interface properties. The generalized-gradient approximation (GGA)  (54)  and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) (55) functionals will be chosen with 480 eV cutoff energy. To describe the ex-change correlation energy and potential, Ultrasoft pseudopotential with Rappe-Rabe-Kaxiras-Joannopoulos (RRKJ) method optimization was used  (56) . For the redox reaction, different net charge states (1, 0, +2, and +3) have been calculated individually. For all the energy calculations, the convergence settings are as follows, total energy is less than 5.0 × 10 5 eV/atom, maximum ionic force and maximum ionic displacement will not exceed 0.1 eV/Å and 5.0 × 10 3 Å, respectively. 
 Supplementary Text The proposed ""redox shuttle"" In a complete device, it is difficult/impractical to solve the inner degradation via additional aftertreatments, which may need reconstruction of devices. Sustainable ""redox shuttle"" in the active layer might potentially address the intrinsic degradation. An ideal ""redox shuttle"" for both perovskite and other similar soft semiconductor materials requires: 1) to selectively oxidize or reduce the generated elementary defects, 2) not to introduce additional deep level defects. Many factors are expected to be taken into consideration for these requirements: such as suitable redox potential, valence state, ionic radius, electronic structure, coordination environment etc. Defect concentration of Pb 0 and I 0 in generation and elimination process In a typical closed redox reaction, the ""redox shuttle"" can transfer electrons from Pb 0 to I 0 defects in a cyclical manner, wherein the Eu 3+ oxidizes Pb 0 to Pb 2+ to form Eu 2+ that simultaneously reduces I 0 to I -(Fig.  1F ). As a result, Pb 0 and I 0 defects in PSCs are eliminated simultaneously in a sustainable manner. Some detailed discussions are as follows: In previous report  (33) , the typical proposed degradation process of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite under light can be expressed as follows: CH3NH3PbI3 → CH3NH2 + HI + PbI2 eqn S1 PbI2 → Pb 0 + 2I 0 eqn S2 It shows that the generated amount of I 0 is twice as high as Pb 0 . In lead iodine perovskite materials, the I and Pb elements are much more variable in chemical valence than other elements or group such as Cs + , MA + or FA + , which are redox-inert. The charge transfer in the redox reaction should obey charge conservation rule. We could reasonably deduce that the amount of I 0 should be twice as that of Pb 0 involved. Similarly, the elimination process of Pb 0 and I 0 could also obey the charge conservation rule. Regardless of the involvement of Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ ion pair, the Pb 0 and twice amount of I 0 would be eliminated at same time. The results of XPS measurement provide further evidence. As shown in the above proposed perovskite decomposition mechanism (eqn S1 and S2), the iodine species (HI and I 0 ) are all volatile, which follows the 1:2 molar ratio. We checked the total change of iodine (ΔI) and lead (ΔPb 0 ) in the film when Eu was added. It follows the equation as follows: ΔI = I/Pb (in Eu 3+ based film) -I/Pb (in reference film) ΔPb 0 = Pb 0 /(Pb 0 + Pb 2+ ) (in reference film) -Pb 0 /(Pb 0 + Pb 2+ ) (in Eu 3+ based film) In reference perovskite film, it is very likely that I 0 will be evaporated during the annealing process, further reducing the I 0 concentration in the resultant film, and the defect concentration of metallic Pb is much higher than I 0 in the typical CH3NH3PbI3 film, due to the fact that the nonvolatile Pb 0 would accumulate in the perovskite film, and the volatile I 0 would evaporate into the surrounding environment. The situation may be different in the Eu 3+ introduced film. The corresponding XPS results (Fig.  2  and table S1 ) show the Pb 0 /(Pb 0 + Pb 2+ ) is 1.4% and I/Pb ratio is 2.93 upon Eu addition, as compared to the reference film of the value of 5.4% and 2.79, respectively. We could calculate the ΔI/ΔPb 0 = 3.5. It shows the change of iodine (ΔI) is three times the change of lead (ΔPb 0 ) during degradation process, clearly indicating the I 0 species preserved is twice of Pb 0 species that is consumed upon redox shuttle addition. After both light and thermal aging test for more than 1000 hours, the Pb 0 /(Pb 0 + Pb 2+ ) ratio is still much lower and the I/Pb ratio is much higher compared with reference film, as shown in Table  S3 . The preserved iodine component in the Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ based film suggests a close redox shuttle formed cyclically. We still noticed that after intensive aging test, I/Pb ratio in the Eu 3+ based film decreased to some extent, and one possible escaping species could be the ""HI"" that is not involved in the redox reaction. -Furthermore, it may be more reasonable to use ""→"" instead of ""="" in the proposed redox equation. This is mainly because the species of I 0 could be in the form of I2, single atom I 0 or I3 , and a chemical balance exists between these different species according to our knowledge and previous reports  (31) . The state of Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ redox shuttle in the film With respect to the possibility for a replacement between Eu 2+ and Pb 2+ , as claimed in the main text ""Given their similar radius of Eu 2+ (117 pm) and Pb 2+ (119 pm) however, we cannot confidently rule out the possibility that Eu 2+ replaces Pb 2+ at B site, wherein direct evidence is expecting."" Due to the small content of Eu 2+ in the film, and detection limitation of the XRD and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), it is still difficult for us to provide clear experimental evidence. Here, we discussed this issue in detail as follows. Firstly, we consider that the possibility for Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ substitution at Pb 2+ site in the bulk perovskite crystal can be ruled out. This was because that when the Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ was introduced in the CH3NH3PbI3 materials system, neither extra diffraction peaks of other species or phases, nor obvious shift of diffraction peak from CH3NH3PbI3 materials could be observed from the XRD results (figs.  S2-4 ). This phenomenon is consistent when Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ content increased from 0.15% to 4.8% (figs. S4). This result represents that the introduction of Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ would not bring new phases/species, as well as detectable ion substitution, e.g. Eu 3+ /Pb 2+ or Eu 2+ /Pb 2+ in the bulk perovskite. The XRD result is also consistent with the XPS result (table  S1 , Fig.  2A-E ), wherein the Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ ions were found to be concentrated near the film surface, as the detected Eu/Pb ratio was much higher than the precursor ratio. It should be noted that the percentage of reduced species Eu 2+ over the total europium content is 36%, which means Eu 2+ was also accumulated on the film surface. This result suggests that the possibility for Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ substitution in the bulk perovskite crystal is very low. Secondly, we cannot theoretically rule out the possibility that Eu 2+ replaces Pb 2+ at B site from the viewpoint of microscopic structure. This was supported by some visible variation of the XRD peak of perovskite film induced by Eu 3+ /Eu 2+ introduction. Especially, as shown in fig.  S2 , the relative intensity of diffraction peak located at 28.11° which are attributed to (004) of tetragonal phase decreased obviously when the 1% Eu 3+ was introduced into perovskite film. This is consistent with 1% Fe 3+ based perovskite film, as the intensity of (004) crystallographic plane was decreased similarly. However, this phenomenon was not observed in Y 3+ and acetylacetone species introduced perovskite film. This difference might be attributed to the reducing species, divalent Eu 2+ , Fe 2+ , with the same valence as Pb 2+ , which could probably affect the microstructure of perovskite materials. Yet we don't know whether the divalent ions could partially substitute Pb 2+ or not on the grain surface. Given the different coordination environment on the grain surface compared to the crystal bulk, and the similar radius of Eu 2+ (117 pm) and Pb 2+ (119 pm), we could not exclude the possibility that Eu 2+ partially substitute Pb 2+ on the grain surface. In addition, europium iodine based organic-inorganic perovskite such as (C4H9NH3)2EuI4  (47)  and lanthanide ions doped CsPbX3 perovskite nanocrystals (48) could be found in previous reports. This also suggests there is a possibility for a replacement for Pb 2+ by Eu 2+ , wherein the direct evidence is expecting.              Total IV measurement time under these conditions was approximately 60 min  (49) .    The components with soft nature in the metal halide perovskite absorber usually generate lead (Pb) 0 and iodine (I) 0 defects during device fabrication and operation. These defects serve as not only recombination centers to deteriorate device efficiency but also degradation initiators to hamper device lifetimes. We show that the europium ion pair Eu 3+ -Eu 2+ acts as the ""redox shuttle"" that selectively oxidized Pb 0 and reduced I 0 defects simultaneously in a cyclical transition. The resultant device achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.52% (certified 20.52%) with substantially improved long-term durability. The devices retained 92% and 89% of the peak PCE under 1-sun continuous illumination or heating at 85°C for 1500 hours and 91% of the original stable PCE after maximum power point tracking for 500 hours, respectively. 
 D evice lifetime and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are the key factors determining the final cost of the electricity that solar cells generate. The certified PCE of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has rapidly reached 23.7% over the past few years (1-9), which is on par with that of polycrystalline silicon and Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 solar cells, but poor device stability (10-12) under operating conditions prevents the perovskite photovoltaics from occupying even a tiny market share  (13, 14) . Generally, commercial solar cells come with a warranty of a 20-to 25-year lifetime with a less than 10% drop of PCE, which corresponds to an average degradation rate of ~0.5% per year  (15) . Compared with those inorganic photovoltaic materials-e.g., silicon (IV group) and CIGS (I-III-VI group) (16)-the elements or components are mostly large and more polarized in organic-inorganic halide perovskite materials, such as I -, methylammonium (MA + ), and Pb 2+ . They construct a soft crystal lattice prone to deform  (17)  and vulnerable to various aging stresses such as oxygen, moisture  (18, 19) , and ultraviolet (UV) exposure  (20, 21) . By encapsulation  (22) (23) (24) , interface modification  (13, (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) , and UV filtration, the device lifetime can be prolonged by the temporary exclusion of these external environmental factors. However, some aging stresses cannot be avoided during device operation, including light illumination, electric field, and thermal stress, upon which both I -and Pb 2+ in perovskites become chemically reactive to initiate the decomposition even if they are well encapsulated  (30) . Because of the soft nature of I -, Pb 2+ ions, and Pb-I bonding, intrinsic degradation would occur in perovskite materials upon various excitation stresses, which finally induce PCE deterioration. On one hand, I -is easily oxidized to I 0 , which not only serve as carrier recombination centers but also initiate chemical chain reactions to accelerate the degradation in perovskite layers  (31) . On the other hand, Pb 2+ is prone to be reduced to metallic Pb 0 upon heating or illumination, which has been observed in Pb halide perovskite films  (32, 33) . Pb 0 is a primary deep defect state that severely degrades the performance of perovskite optoelectronic devices  (34, 35) , as well as their longterm durability  (36) . Furthermore, most soft inorganic semiconductors are suffering similar instability, such as PbS (37), PbI 2  (38, 39) , and AgBr (40), among others. Several attempts have been reported to eliminate either Pb 0 or I 0 defects, like optimizing film processing  (41)  and additive engineering  (42) (43) (44) . To date, these additives are mostly sacrificial agents specific for one kind of defects, which diminish soon after they take effects. Long-term operational durability requires the simultaneous elimination of both Pb 0 and I 0 defects in perovskite materials in a sustainable manner. We demonstrated constant elimination of Pb 0 and I 0 simultaneously in PSCs over their life span, which leads to exceptional stability improvement and high PCE through incorporation of the ion pair of Eu 3+ (f 6 ) ↔ Eu 2+ (f 7 ) as the redox shuttle. In this cyclic redox transition, Pb 0 defects could be oxidized by Eu 3+ , while I 0 defects could be reduced by Eu 2+ at same time. The Eu 3+ -Eu 2+ pair is not consumed during device operation, probably because of its nonvolatility and the suitable redox potential in this cyclic transition. Thus, the champion PCE of the corresponding device was promoted to 21.52% (certified, 20.52%) with negligible current density-voltage (J-V) hysteresis. Devices with the Eu 3+ -Eu 2+ ion pair exhibited excellent shelf lifetime and thermal and light stability, which suggests that this approach may provide a universal solution to the inevitable degradation issue during device operation. The reaction between Pb 0 and I 0 is thermodynamically favored and has a standard molar Gibbs formation energy for PbI 2 (s) of -173.6 kJ/mol  (45) , which provides the driving force for eliminating both defects. However, simply mixing metallic Pb and I 2 powder only led to limited formation of PbI 2 , which suggests the presence of kinetic barriers at room temperature. To enable elimination of Pb 0 and I 0 defects in PSCs simultaneously across device life span, we propose the ""redox shuttle"" to oxidize Pb 0 and reduce I 0 independently, wherein they can be regenerated during the complete circle. It requires selectively oxidizing Pb 0 and reducing I 0 defects without introducing additional deep-level defects. After finely screening many possible redox shuttle additives, the rare earth ion pair of Eu 3+ -Eu 2+ was identified as the best candidate, mostly owing to their appropriate redox potentials. Eu 3+ could easily be reduced to Eu 2+ with the stable half-full f 7 electron configuration to form the naturally associated ion pair. The redox shuttle can transfer electrons from Pb 0 to I 0 defects in a cyclical manner, wherein the Eu 3+ oxidizes Pb 0 to Pb 2+ and the formed Eu 2+ simultaneously reduces I 0 to I -(Fig.  1F ). Thus, each ion in this pair is mutually replenished during defects elimination. The proposed redox shuttle eliminates corresponding defects on the basis of the following two chemical reactions: 2Eu 3+ + Pb 0 → 2Eu 2+ + Pb 2+ (1) Eu 2+ + I 0 → Eu 3+ + I - (2) We first explored the feasibility of the Eu 3+ -Eu 2+ ion pair to promote electron transfer from Pb 0 to I 0 in solution (Fig.  1A ) by dispersing I 2 (25 mg) powder and metallic Pb powder (25 mg) in 2 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and isopropanol (IPA) that had a volume ratio of 1:10 as a reference solution. The Eu 3+ -Eu 2+ ion pair was incorporated by further adding europium acetylacetonate [Eu(acac) 3 ] (11 mg) into the 2-ml solution. Under continuous stirring at 100°C, the sample solution gradually turned from black to colorless with a large amount of yellow precipitates after 60 min, whereas the reference solution remained dark brown with little evidence of yellow precipitates. UV-visible (UV-vis) spectra of the reference solution exhibited an absorption peak at ~370 nm (Fig.  1B ), which we attributed to the presence of an I 0 species (36) that was absent in the sample solution, which had an absorption peak at ~290 nm that we attributed to a PbI x species. Both the I 0 and Pb 0 species were effectively converted to I -and Pb 2+ upon Eu 3+ addition. An x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement on the precipitates revealed both PbI 2 (12.7°, 25.9°, 39.5°) and metallic Pb (31.3°, 36.2°, 52.2°) species in both cases (Fig.  1C ). In the sample, the characteristic peak intensity ratio of PbI 2 to metallic Pb was larger than that of the reference. This result further confirmed that Eu 3+ could accelerate the conversion of Pb 0 and I 0 to Pb 2+ and I -, respectively. When we added Eu(acac) 3 to the CH 3 NH 3 I solution of water/chloroform, we observed no I 0 species absorption peak in the corresponding UV-vis spectrum (Fig.  1D ), showing that Eu 3+ selectively oxidizes Pb 0 rather than I -. The stronger oxidizing agent of Fe 3+ oxidized I -species, and the absorption peak of I 0 was present. We verified that Eu 3+ was reduced to paramagnetic Eu 2+ in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 (MAPbI 3 ) perovskite films with 1% (Eu/Pb, molar ratio) Eu 3+ incorporated, which showed a strong signal in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements (Fig.  1E ) that was absent in Eu 2 O 3 and in the reference MAPbI 3 film. We compared the effect of Eu 3+ by studying other ions, including redox-inert Y 3+ and strong oxidizing Fe 3+ , by preparing film samples incorporated with 1% metal ions (M/Pb, molar ratio) and performed high-resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis to elucidate the potential effects on both Pb 0 and I 0 defects. As shown in Fig.  2A , the binding energy (BE) at 142.8 and 137.9 eV were assigned to 4f 5/2 , 4f 7/2 of divalent Pb 2+ , respectively, and the two shoulder peaks at 141.3 and 136.4 eV around lower BE were associated with metallic Pb 0 . We calculated the intensity ratio of Pb 0 /(Pb 0 + Pb 2+ ) for three metal-incorporated samples and the reference to observe a notable tendency (Fig.  2, A  and D , and table  S1 ). The Pb 0 intensity ratio in reference reached 5.4%, which is comparable to that of Y 3+ -incorporated film. This ratio in the perovskite film with oxidative Eu 3+ and Fe 3+ additives was reduced to nearly 1.0%, indicating that metallic Pb 0 was successfully oxidized. With respect to I 0 species, it is difficult to obtain I 0 /(I 0 + I -) ratio by peak fitting accurately 2 of 6 because I 0 species are volatile during the annealing process of perovskite film preparation. Thus, we examined the ratio of I/Pb and BE shift to monitor the iodine evolution indirectly. As shown in Fig.  2, B  and E , and table S1, we observed the similar I/Pb ratio in the reference and the Y 3+incorporated sample but a much lower ratio in the Fe 3+ sample. Incorporation of Fe 3+ likely generated I 0 species that were released. A higher I/Pb ratio was observed in the Eu 3+ sample compared with the reference, possibly indicating less volatile I 0 species produced in the corresponding film. Furthermore, the BE of I 3d 3/2 further confirmed the argument, wherein it shifted toward a higher value of 0.3 eV in Fe 3+ sample but lower 0.2 eV in Eu 3+ sample as compared with the reference. Given the lower BE of I -, it clearly showed that I -was well preserved in the Eu 3+ sample. In addition, Eu 2+ was 36% of the total Eu content, which further confirmed the Eu 3+ -Eu 2+ ion pair working as a redox shuttle (Fig.  2C ). According to the charge conservation rule, the amount of I 0 should be twice that of Pb 0 involved in the entire redox reaction. Iodine species (HI and I 2 ) are all volatile, which follows the 1:2 molar ratio  (33) . We checked the total change in the amount of iodine (DI) and lead (DPb 0 ) in the film upon the addition of Eu(acac) 3 , wherein DI/DPb 0 was calculated to be 3.5 (see table  S1  and supplementary text). The change in the amount of iodine (DI) was about three times that of lead (DPb 0 ) during the degradation process, indicating that the amount of I 0 species preserved was twice that of Pb 0 species consumed upon redox shuttle addition. In the context of a redox reaction, the standard electrode potential (E q ) is often used as a reference point to rationally predict the occurrence of the reaction. According to the E q of each half reaction involved (which may deviate in solid materials) (table  S2 ), Fe 3+ is too oxidative and oxidizes Pb 0 and I -simultaneously. On the contrary, Eu 3+ exhibited the suitable E q to selectively oxidize Pb 0 without I -oxidation, while the reduction product of Eu 2+ reduced I 0 to I - at same time. Thus, the constant elimination of Pb 0 and I 0 defects still preserved the Eu 3+ -Eu 2+ ion pair. We examined the effectiveness of Eu 3+ -Eu 2+ redox shuttle in the film. Metallic Pb 0 is the major accumulated defect in aged perovskite films because of its nonvolatility  (33) . The content of Pb 0 is a measure of the extent of decomposition in the perovskite film. When the sample was subjected to 1 sun illumination or 85 ○ C aging condition for more than 1000 hours, the Pb 0 /(Pb 0 + Pb 2+ ) ratio in films with redox shuttle were 2.5% or 2.7%, compared with 7.4% or 11.3% in the reference film, respectively, as shown in fig.  S1  and table  S3 . The redox shuttle can preserve the I/Pb ratio in the aged film. Meanwhile, the corresponding I/Pb ratio in Eu 3+ -incorporated film was 2.68 or 2.57 as compared with that of reference 2.30 or 2.13, indicating the perovskite film was well preserved. We also examined the crystallographic and optoelectronic properties perovskite films with the redox shuttle. According to XRD results, the phase structure was retained in the perovskite films with improved crystallinity upon Eu 3+ addition (figs. S2 to S4). No residual acetylacetonate anion was detected by XPS and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurement (figs. S5 and S6). The Eu 3+ -Eu 2+ ions were concentrated near the film surface, wherein the detected Eu/Pb ratio was much higher than the precursor ratio (table  S1 ). When the Eu(acac) 3 was introduced from 0.15 to 4.8%, we observed neither extra diffraction peaks nor an obvious shift of diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns (figs. S2 to S4), which indicates that Eu 3+ -Eu 2+ ions may not necessarily accommodate in the crystal lattice. Given the similar radius of Eu 2+ [117 pm  (46) ] and Pb 2+ (119 pm), however, we cannot confidently rule out the possibility that Eu 2+ replaces Pb 2+ at B site, wherein direct evidence is expected. In addition, europium-iodine-based organic-inorganic perovskite  (47)  and lanthanide ions doped CsPbX 3 perovskite nanocrystals were found in previous reports  (48) . The morphology and grain size of the perovskite film with the tiny amount redox shuttle remained similar to the reference (Fig.  3A  and fig.  S7 ). Also, we did not 3 of 6 observe obvious orientation variation by synchrotron grazing-incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) analysis (Fig.  3B  and fig.  S8 ). In addition, the optical bandgap of the perovskite film upon Eu 3+ addition was calculated to be 1.55 eV, similar to that of the reference (fig.  S9 ). The photoluminescence (PL) intensity (fig.  S10 ) and carrier lifetime (Fig.  3C ) increased in the perovskite film with the incorporation of Eu 3+ , indicating the decrease of nonradiative recombination centers from defects elimination. The improvement of the morphology and grain size could also lead to the increased PL lifetime, so the defects reduction should be further confirmed by other methods. We used the space charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement to quantify the defect density N defects of 5.1 × 10 15 and 1.5 × 10 16 cm -3 for Eu 3+ -incorporated samples and the reference, respectively (Fig.  3D ). We studied the influence of the Eu 3+ -Eu 2+ ion pair on the formation energies of redox reaction, lattice stability, and energy band structure by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. To construct the model, a small fraction of metal ions (Eu 3+ ) was intercalated into two adjacent lattices (Fig.  3E ), given the observation Eu was concentrated at surfaces and grain boundaries. The formation energies for defects elimination (Eqs. 1 and 2) were calculated (Fig.  3F ). For both reference and Eu 3+ -incorporated systems, the half reactions related to Pb 0 elimination required a substantially high potential energy as the main barrier, whereas the I 0 elimination half reactions were comparably favorable. However, after introducing Eu species at the interface, the barrier in Pb 0 elimination half reactions was greatly decreased, but the barrier for I 0 elimination half reactions decreased only slightly. With the assistance of Eu species at the interface, the overall redox potential energy has been much lowered, representing an energetical stabilization trend for the charge-transfer reaction (Fig.  3F ). We also compared the thermodynamic properties for reference and Eu-incorporated systems. Figure  3G  shows that the MAPbI 3 with Eu incorporation has a steeper slope in change of free energy DG than in that of reference, meaning that Eu-incorporated MAPbI 3 shows a more energetically favorable physicochemical trend than pure MAPbI 3 does. Additionally, it reveals Eu incorporation in MAPbI 3 materials did not bring in obvious electronic disorders as extra traps (fig.  S11 ). We incorporated the perovskite absorber equipped with the redox shuttle in two device configurations. One is based on ITO/TiO 2 / perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, wherein spiro-OMeTAD refers to 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-pmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene, with MAPbI 3 (Cl). The other is based on ITO/SnO 2 / perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD (modified)/Au for higher PCE and stability, with (FA,MA,Cs)Pb(I,Br) 3 (Cl), in which FA is formamidinium. Both perovskites were deposited by means of a traditional two-step method, during which Eu(acac) 3 or other additives were added in PbI 2 /DMF precursor solution. The two devices showed similar trends (Fig.  4A  and fig.  S12 ). The Eu 3+ -incorporated devices exhibited the best PCE, whereas the Fe 3+ -incorporated devices suffered from the markedly decreased PCE. The average PCE increased from 18.5 to 20.7% in the mixed perovskite upon Eu 3+ addition (Fig.  4A ), which is attributed to the effective defects elimination. We attributed the decreased PCE in Fe 3+ -incorporated devices to the additional I 0 defects introduced by oxidation. One of the optimized devices achieved the PCE of 21.52% (reverse 21.89%, forward 21.15%) (Fig.  4B ) with negligible hysteresis (certified reverse 20.73%, forward 20.30%, average 20.52%, certificate attached in fig.  S13 ). The measured stable output at maximum point (0.97 V) was 20.9%. Integrating the overlap of the incident-photon-to-currentefficiency spectrum of Eu 3+ -incorporated PSCs under the AM 1.5-G solar photon flux generated the current density of 23.2 mA•cm -2 (fig.  S14 ). The stabilized J-V performance of PSCs was evaluated as follows  (49) : parameters are measured under a 13-point IV sweep configuration wherein the bias voltage (current for open circuit voltage V OC determination) is held constant until the measured current (voltage for V OC ) was determined to be unchanging at the 0.05% level. The original, stabilized, and poststabilized efficiency of Eu 3+ -incorporated PSCs tested by third-party certification institution were similar, which indicates the stable characteristics of the devices (fig.  S15 ). The shelf lifetime of the corresponding devices was investigated, wherein the PCE evolution was descripted for solar cells stored in an inert environment (Fig.  4C ). With the Eu 3+ -Eu 2+ redox shuttle incorporated, the devices maintained 90% of the original PCE even after 8000 hours storage because of improved long-term V OC , short-circuit current density (J SC ) and fill factor (FF) stability (fig.  S16 ). Although the stability of Y 3+ -incorporated PSCs was comparable to the reference, Fe 3+ -incorporated PSC showed severely deteriorated stability, which lost the photoelectric conversion capability completely after merely 2000 hours of storage. To estimate the stability of Eu 3+ -incorporated PSCs under operational conditions, half solar cells were subjected to either continuous 1 sun illumination or 85°C aging condition, respectively (Fig.  4D ), in which the top charge-transfer materials and electrode were deposited after aging test. Improved long-term V OC and FF stability (fig.  S17 ) allowed the devices, after 1000 hours, to retain 93% of the original PCE continuous 1 sun illumination or 91% after heating at 85°C. Several previous studies showed that smallmolecule spiro-OMeTAD would crystallize under thermal stress and create pathways that allow for an interaction of the perovskite and the metal electrode  (50, 51) . By modifying the holetransport materials (spiro-OMeTAD) with conductive polymer poly(triarylamine), the full devices incorporated with the Eu 3+ -Eu 2+ ion pair maintained 92% and 89% of the original PCE because of obvious long-term V OC and FF stability improvement (fig.  S18 ) under the same light or thermal stress for 1500 hours, respectively (Fig.  4E ).

Working principle of carrier selective poly-Si/c-Si junctions: Is tunnelling the whole story?
We present arguments that additional effects besides laterally homogenous tunnelling might occur in carrier-selective poly-Si/c-Si junctions: (i) the symmetrical electrical behaviour of n þ and p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions, (ii) direct observation of structural modifications of the interfacial oxide upon thermal treatment by transmission electron microscopy, even for poly-Si/c-Si junctions with good passivation quality, and (iii) the achievement of low junction resistances even for interfacial oxide thicknesses 42 nm after thermal treatment. We present an alternative picture, essentially based on a localized current flow through the interfacial oxide, mediated either by local reduction of the oxide layer thickness or by pinholes. In consequence, the local current flow implies transport limitations for both minority and majority carriers in the c-Si absorber, and thus a correlation between recombination current and series resistance. Thus, a poly-Si/c-Si junction can also be explained within the framework of a classical pn junction picture for a passivated, locally contacted emitter, e.g. by the model of Fischer. Both electron selective contacts (n þ poly-Si) and hole selective contacts (p þ poly-Si) can be described consistently when using reasonable input parameters. Especially for p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions, our model could guideline further improvement.
Introduction Carrier selective junctions based on silicon rich, mostly polycrystalline (poly-) layers deposited on an interfacial oxide grown on a crystalline (c-) silicon absorber are currently attracting significant research interest. Excellent junction quality with recombination current densities J 0 down to 0.7 fA/cm 2  [1] , as well as efficiencies up to 25.1%  [2]  have been demonstrated with this approach. Regarding the physical working principle of poly-Si/c-Si junctions, different pictures exist  [3, 4] . For interfacial oxide thicknesses of $2 nm or less, it is safe to assume that tunnelling through the oxide takes place. Nevertheless, we present in this work strong support that, at least for our samples with initial interfacial oxide thicknesses 42 nm, additional effects are relevant, which could in particular explain the excellent performance of our p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions. 
 Arguments for additional relevant effects Our first argument for additional current transport mechanisms besides lateral homogeneous tunnelling is the experimental observation of low junction resistances ρ c and low recombination current densities J 0 for both n þ poly-Si/c-Si and p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions. This might not be consistent with the tunnelling model, as explained in the following: As indicated in Fig.  1 , the poly-Si is inherently highly defective, i.e., a high density of energy states within the band gap of the poly-Si could mediate strongly pronounced Shockley-Read-Hall recombination with minority carrier lifetimes in the range of picoto nanoseconds  [1, 5] . Thus, for low recombination current densities, it's essential to prevent minority carriers from reaching the poly-Si. ""Minority (majority)"" refers in the following to the doping type of the poly-Si, i.e., to holes (electrons) for n þ poly-Si and electrons (holes) for p þ poly-Si. Typically, the poly-Si is highly doped and thus induces a band bending in the lower doped c-Si absorber, reducing the minority carrier concentration at the SiO x / c-Si interface. This ""field effect passivation"" is already beneficial for reducing recombination in the poly-Si. However, it's not sufficient to explain the low recombination current densities down to o 1 (o 5) fA/cm 2 measured on n þ (p þ ) poly-Si/c-Si junctions: On samples on which the interfacial oxide has been removed prior to the poly-Si deposition, high recombination current densities 4500 fA/cm 2 are observed despite the fact that the ""field effect passivation"" is also present here. Thus, the interfacial oxide somehow prevents the minority carriers from reaching the poly-Si. On the other hand, as obvious due to the low junction resistances, majority carriers can efficiently surpass the interfacial oxide. Assuming tunnelling to be the dominant current transport mechanism, the question arises why majority carriers are able to tunnel through the interfacial oxide while minority carrier tunnelling should be much less efficient. An essential aspect of the answer to this question given by the tunnelling model for n þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions is a difference in the tunnelling barrier heights. As known from internal photoemission spectroscopy  [6] , the different band offsets between Si and SiO 2 (4.7 eV for valence band, 3.2 eV for the conduction band) imply a larger barrier for holes than for electrons. As indicated in Fig.  1 (a), this difference can explain the excellent performance of n þ poly-Si/c-Si junctionslow recombination current densities (limited by the transport of holes through the oxide) and simultaneously low junction resistances (limited by the transport of electrons through the oxide). Fig.  2  shows experimental J 0 , ρ c data reported by various groups for n þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions (red symbols), as well as a very rough fit by a power law (red dashed line). While Gan and Fig.  1 . One-dime Á nsional energy band diagrams assuming a laterally homogeneous interfacial oxide for (a) our n þ poly-Si/c-Si junction with J 0 ¼ 1 fA/cm 2 , and (b) for our p þ poly-Si/c-Si junction with J 0 ¼ 4.4 Á fA/cm 2  [7] . The band diagrams are calculated with DESSIS for experimentally determined doping concentrations in the poly-Si and in the c-Si (i.e., in-diffusion of dopants from the poly-Si into the c-Si upon thermal annealing is taken into account). Defects in the poly-Si, as well as possible current paths according to the tunnelling model are illustrated. Fig.  2 . Experimental J 0 , ρ c data reported for n þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions (red symbols, taken from Refs.  [1, 7, 8, [12] [13] [14] [15] ) and for p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions (green symbols, taken from Refs.  [7, 8, 14, [16] [17] [18] ). The dashed red line represents a power law fit of the n þ poly-Si/c-Si junction values. The experimental data shown represent, to our knowledge, the currently available J 0 and ρ c pairs for poly-Si/c-Si junctions. One should note that also other groups have reported on excellent J 0 values, but without a quantitative evaluation of the poly-Si/c-Si junction resistance. The dashed and dotted green line indicates the expected shift of the fit of n þ poly-Si/c-Si data fit for p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions with an interfacial oxide thickness of 1.5 nm and 2.4 nm, respectively. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Swanson  [8]  reported very low junction resistances down to 3 Á 10 À 6 mΩ cm in combination with decent recombination current densities of 49 fA/cm 2 , more recent results typically show higher ρ c and lower J 0 values. Interestingly, Gan and Swanson used presumably thicker thermal grown interfacial oxides (specification o2 nm  [8] ) than the more recently used wet-chemically grown interfacial oxides of $ 1.5 nm thickness  [9] . In the state-of-the art device simulation software Sentaurus Device, Si/SiO 2 band offsets of 4.73 eV (valence band) and 3.15 eV (conduction band) are implemented as standard parameters  [10] . Recent numerical simulations of solar cells with n þ TopCon junctions on the rear side performed with this software are in good agreement with the measured cell data  [3] . Also, bipolar junction transistors (BJT) with n þ poly-Si emitters can be well described by the tunnelling model  [11] . Here, the barrier heights are commonly used as fitting parameters for the transistor characteristics. For BJT with n þ poly-Si emitters, the best agreement is achieved for an electron tunnelling barrier height of 0.3 eV and a hole tunnelling barrier height of 1 eV  [11] . The fact that these values are, in absolute numbers, much lower than the values determined by internal photoemission  [6] , may indicate the presence of an additional current transport mechanism. For hole-collecting p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions, higher recombination current densities and higher junction resistances (as compared as the respective values for electron-collecting n þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions with the same interfacial oxide thickness) would be expected for the barrier heights mentioned above (Fig.  1(b) ). Within a first-order approximation (further comments on this approximation are given in the appendix), the increase in the junction resistance ρ c (determined by the majority carrier flow) as well as the increase in the recombination current density J 0 (determined by the minority carrier flow) should be proportional to the ratio of the barrier transmission probabilities for electrons T e and holes T h . Disregarding the trapezoidal shape of the barrier and image charge effects and restricting to energy levels near the band edges, this ratio is given by: Here, d ox denotes the interfacial oxide thickness, m t,e (Φ e ) and m t,h (Φ h ) the tunnelling mass (the barrier height) for electrons and holes, respectively, q denotes the elementary charge, and ℏ denotes the Planck constant divided by 2 π. As summarized in Ref.  [3] , various values for the electron tunnelling mass in SiO 2 have been reported, ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 times the electron rest mass m 0 . For our rough estimation, we chose a value of m t,e ¼ m t,h ¼0.4 m 0 . One should note that the following arguments are relaxed for lower tunnelling masses, and strengthened for larger tunnelling masses. Furthermore, asymmetric tunnelling masses (m t,h o0.65 m t,e ) could completely compensate the effect of the asymmetric tunnelling barriers described below. ∝ - Φ - Φ ( ) ℏ ℏ ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ T T d d We chose two interfacial oxide thickness À 1.5 nm and 2.4 nmcorresponding to typical values reported for wet chemically grown interfacial oxides  [9] , and to thermally grown interfacial oxides as reported previously by our group  [7] . For 1.5 nm oxide thickness, Eq. (1) yields a transmission probability ratio electron/holes of 6.31, while for 2.4 nm, a respective value of 19.04 is obtained. In Fig.  2 , the dashed and dotted green lines indicate the respective shift of the fit of n þ poly-Si/c-Si data fit towards higher J 0 and higher ρ c values when transferring it to p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions. The experimental results of Feldmann et al.  [16]  and Yan et al.  [17]  (open green symbols in Fig.  2 ) for p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions seem to be consistent with our rough estimation. However, the results of Gan et al.  [8] , as well as our own results  [7, 14, 18]  (full green symbols in Fig.  2 ) are clearly not consistent with this prediction of the tunnelling model. Gan et al.  [8]  obtained equal J 0 and ρ c values for both doping types of the poly-Si. Our best J 0 value of 4.4 fA/cm 2 for p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions is only four times larger than that for n þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions  [7] , while a much larger difference is expected for this interfacial oxide thickness according to the rough estimation described above. So far, within the framework of the tunnelling model, no consistent description of n þ and p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions with identical parameters has been reported. It is not a new finding. In the bipolar transistor community, it is known since a long time that BJT with n þ and with p þ poly-Si emitters can hardly be described within the framework of the tunnelling model when assuming identical barrier heights in both cases  [11] . While for BJTs with n þ poly-Si emitters, barrier heights of qΦ e ¼ 0.3 eV (electrons) and qΦ h ¼ 1 eV (holes) have been extracted, the respective values for BJTs with p þ poly-Si emitters are qΦ e ¼ 1 eV (electrons) and qΦ h ¼0.3 eV (holes)  [11] . For this reason, we proposed previously an alternative model based on localized current flow through pinholes formed upon thermal annealing of the poly-Si/c-Si junctions  [4] . This model was also inspired from knowledge from the poly-Si emitter BJT community, where this local oxide breakup was observed in TEM  [19] , described by thermodynamically models  [20]  and utilized to model the majority carrier flow in BJTs  [21] . Our previous model for the current transport mechanism in poly-Si/c-Si junctions is extended as described below. Here, we would like to remark that there is recent experimental support for the picture of localized current flow. The most striking one is the direct observation of structural modifications of the interfacial oxide upon thermal treatment in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. There is agreement in the community that for exaggerated long annealing durations or high annealing temperatures, the interfacial oxide breaks up at many locations, yielding direct contact between the c-Si and the defect rich poly-Si on large area and therefore high recombination currents  [9, 24] . For optimized annealing conditions, pinholes are hardly observed in TEM. This might be a consequence of the low pinhole area density ( $10 7 cm À 2 according to Ref.  [4] ) in combination with the small area probed by TEM. For thermally grown interfacial oxides, we at least observe a local modification of the oxide thickness upon annealing at 1050 °C from initially $ 2.4 nm down to $1 nm in some regions near the centre of the grains in the poly-Si, and up to $ 4 nm near the grain boundaries (Fig.  3(a) ). When reducing the initial oxide thickness down to $ 1.7 nm, we also find locations in which the lattice of the c-Si is in direct contact with the lattice of the poly-Si, indicating the formation of very small oxide pinholes with a low areal density (Fig.  3(b) ). Please note that also for the latter sample, the J 0 value is still quite low (20 fA/cm 2 ). Further details on our TEM investigations, in particular on the underlying statistics, will be presented elsewhere  [22] . The limitations of TEM regarding the observation of pinholes with a low areal density can be overcome with scanning methods like conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM). Recent (c-AFM) results presented at the SiliconPV2016  [23]  indicate the presence of local spots with strongly enhanced conductivity in n þ TopCon junctions. Their area density increases from 2.5 Á 10 10 cm À 2 after thermal annealing at 800 °C to 7.5 Á 10 10 cm À 2 after thermal annealing at 950 °C. A further experimental finding that supports our picture that a major part of the current flow through the interfacial oxide might be localized in regions in which the oxide thickness is reduced or in which even pinholes have formed is the behaviour of the junction resistance upon thermal treatment. It is necessary to apply a sufficient temperature budget in order to reduce the junction resistance down to an acceptable value  [13, 17, 24] . This observation can hardly be explained with a homogeneous current flow through an interfacial oxide which remains unaltered in thickness upon thermal annealing. Also, the low junction resistances of 2.5 m Ωcm 2 achieved for initial interfacial oxides thicknesses of 2.1 nm  [14] , or low ρ c values obtained even for an initial oxide thickness of 3.6 nm  [24]  can hardly be explained with tunnelling through an unaltered oxide  [2, 17, 25] . Please note that also for the latter samples, the recombination current density was very low -2.5 fA/cm 2 [14] and 5 fA/cm 2  [24] , respectively. 
 Alternative picture The alternative picture presented in the following is a generalized version of our previous model according to Ref.  [4] . A comparison of both approaches, as well as a summary of differences and similarities is given in the appendix. As known from secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and electrochemical capacitance voltage (ECV) measurements  [7, 16] , dopants diffuse from the poly-Si into the c-Si during the junction formation process, especially for boron doped poly-Si layers (Fig.  4  (a)). Fig.  4 (b) shows a schematic sketch of our corresponding model for a localized current flow through an interfacial oxide into a doped poly-Si layer. In contrast to previous work  [4] , we do not exclude that charge carriers surpass the oxide by tunnelling, although pinhole formation might make the necessity for tunnelling superfluous. The major aspect of the model is that the oxide is surpassed locally, e.g. due to significant local reduction of the interfacial oxide thickness or due to pinhole formation. This local current flow implies transport limitations for majority and minority charge carriers due to current crowding in the highly doped region of the c-Si absorber. We assume that these crowding effects in the c-Si are limiting both the majority and minority carrier flow, rather than the final local transport through the oxide or through the pinhole. The latter is therefore disregarded. The current flow in the c-Si, i.e., the recombination current densities (minority carriers) and junction resistance (majority carriers), can be calculated analytically  [4] . An equivalent description is provided by the Fischer model  [26] , which can be applied to the highly doped region the c-Si underneath the interfacial oxide. The Fischer model also takes into account recombination in regions where the interfacial oxide is still intact. For the recombination current density, we use Eq.  (20)  in Ref.  [27]  (the assumption of a minority carrier diffusion length much larger than the thickness of the doped region in the c-Si is valid for our samples), while for the resistance implied by the crowding of majority carriers, Eqs.  (22, 23)  in Ref.  [27]  are used. We assume the recombination velocity S 0,pinhole in the interface regions where pinholes have formed or where the interfacial oxide thickness is strongly reduced to be thermally limited (S 0, pinhole ¼10 7 cm/s). According to the TEM results, we assume a radius r pinhole of these regions of 2 nm and vary their areal density from 10 5 cm À 2 to 10 10 cm À 2 . The role of the base in the original formulation of the Fischer model for the description of local rear contacts  [26, 27]  is represented in our picture of poly-Si/c-Si junctions by the highly doped region in the c-Si, which has formed underneath the interfacial oxide due to in-diffusion of dopants from the poly-Si. For the doping concentration N A (for p þ poly-Si/ c-Si junctions) or N D (for n þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions) as well as for the width W of this region, we use the box profile approximation of our measured profiles as shown in Fig.  4(a) . The resulting values are N A ¼ 10 18 cm À 3 , W ¼350 nm for p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions and N D ¼5 Á 10 17 cm À 3 , W¼50 nm for n þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions. The recombination velocity S 0, pass in regions where the interfacial oxide is still intact (or unaltered in thickness) is used as the only fitting parameter. As shown in Fig.  5 (a), we achieve agreement between modelled and measured J 0 (ρ c ) data for our p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions and for the data of Gan et al.  [8]  when assuming a S 0,pass value of 400 cm/s. Remarkably, this value agrees well to literature data for surface recombination velocities at the SiO 2 /p þ c-Si surface for a boron surface doping concentration of N A ¼10 18 cm À 3  [28] . Obviously, recombination in the passivated regions dominates for our p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions, while the data of Gan et al.  [8]  indicates a strong contribution of recombination at the pinholes (which are, according to the very low junction resistances, present with a much higher areal density in these samples). Auger recombination in the highly doped p þ region in the c-Si plays a minor role: its contribution to the total J 0 value of 4.4 fA/cm 2 is calculated to 0.6 fA/cm 2 by the program EDNA 2 for our ECV doping profile. As already pointed out in Ref.  [4] , the most sensitive input parameter of our model in the regime of low junction resistance and ""pinhole-dominated"" recombination is the doping level in the c-Si. Thus, a large uncertainty is implied in the simulation of experimental data from other groups when using the doping profile measured on our samples. However, for the data of Gan et al.  [8] , we achieve nice agreement when using the box approximation of our ECV profile. For the description of the J 0 (ρ c ) data for p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions reported by Feldmann et al.  [16]  and Yan et al.  [17]  with our model, the doping profile in the c-Si is less important since the total recombination seems to be dominated by the recombination in regions where the interfacial oxide is still intact (or unaltered in thickness). However, a higher S 0,pass value of 2000 cm/s has to be assumed. Our hypothesis for this difference in the S 0,pass values for samples from different groups is a difference in the interfacial oxide: While Gan et al.  [8]  and ourselves use thicker, mainly thermally grown interfacial oxides, Feldmann et al.  [16]  and Yan et al.  [17]  use wet chemically grown oxides with a thickness of only 1.5 nm. The smaller interfacial oxide thickness might compromise the passivation quality threefold: First, too thin interfacial oxides might not efficiently prevent the tunnelling of minority carriers (electrons in the case of p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions) from the c-Si into the poly-Si, implying a larger recombination current density. Second, boron can diffuse more efficiently through thinner interfacial oxides, implying a higher boron doping concentration at the SiO x /c-Si interface and thus a higher S 0,pass value  [28] . Third, thinner oxides break up more easily, which implies high recombination current densities for too large pinhole area fractions. Thus, the annealing temperature has to be restricted to lower values than possible for samples with thicker interfacial oxides. However, a high annealing temperature might be beneficial for a re-organisation of the SiO x /c-Si interface, which possibly exhibits a high density of interface defects directly after the wet chemical oxide growth (or the thermal oxide growth at low temperatures $600 °C). Nevertheless, it is possible to achieve excellent junction quality for p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions with wet chemically grown interfacial oxides. Our lowest J 0 value achieved on such a junction with 1.7 nm thick wet chemically grown interfacial oxide thickness is 8 fA/cm 2  [18] . As shown in Fig.  5 (b), our model can also describe experimental J 0 (ρ c ) data for our n þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions and for the data of Gan et al.  [8]  when assuming a S 0,pass value of 40 cm/s. Again, this value in in good agreement with literature data for the SiO 2 /n þ c-Si interface for a Phosphorus doping concentration of 5 Á 10 17 cm À 3  [29] . Auger recombination in the highly doped n þ region in the c-Si is calculated to 0.2 fA/cm 2 by the program EDNA 2 for our doping profiles. Again, the experimental J 0 (ρ c ) data of Feldmann et al.  [12]  and Yan et al.  [13]  can be described by a higher S 0,pass value (300 cm/s in this case), perhaps due to the same reasons as discussed above for p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions. Also for n þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions, it is possible to achieve excellent passivation quality with wet chemically grown interfacial   [7, 14, 18]  as well as for the data of Gan et al.  [8] , a nice agreement is obtained for S 0,pass values of 400 cm/s, while for the data of Feldmann et al.  [16]  and Yan et al.  [17] , best agreement is obtained for S 0,pass ¼ 2000 cm/s. (b) Comparison of experimental and modelled ρ c , J 0 values for n þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions. Here, the best agreement between model and our data  [1, 7, 14, 15]  and the of Gan et al.  [8]  is obtained for S 0,pass ¼ 40 cm/s. oxides. Our lowest J 0 value achieved on such a junction with 1.7 nm thick wet chemically grown interfacial oxide thickness is 1.5 fA/cm 2  [15] . 
 Conclusions We present arguments that laterally homogeneous tunnelling through an unaltered interfacial oxide is possibly not the only current mechanism present in poly-Si/c-Si junctions. First, excellent p þ poly-Si/c-Si junction properties (low recombination current, low junction resistance) have been achieved despite a ""wrong tunnelling barrier height ratio"" for electrons and holes, which seems inconsistent to the expectations of the tunnelling mode. Second, structural modifications of the interfacial oxide (local thickness reduction, pinhole formation) have been directly observed in TEM even for samples with low recombination current densities. This might be consistent to recent results from (c-AFM) measurements showing a large areal density of local spots with strongly increased conductivity  [23] . Third, we obtain low junction resistance down to 2.4 mΩcm 2 after sufficient thermal annealing of poly-Si/c-Si junctions with initial interfacial oxide thicknesses of 2.1 nm  [14]  (or even of 3.6 nm), which, if unaltered upon annealing, should be prevent direct tunnelling. We therefore propose an alternative picture, which considers the poly-Si/c-Si junction as a ""classical, locally contacted emitter"", assuming local current flow through the interfacial oxide at locations where the oxide thickness is reduced or even pinholes have formed. Therefore, the current flow of majority and minority carriers in the doped region formed underneath the interfacial oxide by in-diffusion of dopants from the poly-Si can be described by the Fischer model. We demonstrate nice agreement between our experimental J 0 , ρ c data and our model for n þ and p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions for realistic input data (in particular measured doping profiles in the c-Si). The recombination in our junctions seems to be dominated by recombination in regions where the interfacial oxide is still intact. The respective interface recombination velocities agrees well with literature data for SiO 2 on boron or phosphorus doped c-Si surfaces. According to our picture, the main reasons for the carrierselectivity of both n þ and p þ poly-Si junctions is a reduction of the minority carrier concentration in the vicinity of the recombination-active pinholes (or locations with very thin interfacial oxide, assumed to be equally transparent for electrons and holes). This description is in agreement with the general picture of carrierselectivity according to Würfel et al.  [30] . In real junctions, both mechanismlocal current flow and laterally homogeneous tunnellingpossibly superpose. Since the latter is not symmetric with respect of the doping type of the poly-Si and more favourable for n þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions, it is beneficial for the optimization of p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions if the first mechanism is dominating. This can be achieved by a sufficiently large interfacial oxide thickness. For example, a J 0 value of 8 fA/cm 2 is achieved on a p þ poly-Si/c-Si junction with a 1.7 nm thick wet chemically grown interfacial oxide. Since we think that these arguments for an existing or even dominating current flow through pinholes (or regions with locally reduced interfacial oxide thickness) for samples with pure poly-Si on top of an interfacial oxide with sufficient thickness (i.e., larger than 1.5 nm) annealed at sufficiently high temperatures (i.e., around 900 °C or above) are plausible, we prefer to denote these junctions as Polysilicon on Oxide (POLO) junctions. This denotation, which was suggested already in 2013  [31] , is independent from the current transport mechanism. 
 APPENDIX A. Tunnelling current The approximation of the ratio of tunnelling currents in p þ and n þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions exclusively by considering the transmission probabilities for the respective tunnelling barrier heights requires further discussion. The tunnelling current through a barrier equals the transmission probability, multiplied by the density of occupied initial states, the density of unoccupied final sates, and by the attempt frequency. Furthermore, a net current flux from the c-Si into the poly-Si should be considered, including the current flow from the c-Si into the poly-Si and vice versa. At least for the minority carriers, the latter is negligible. It appears furthermore justified to consider the density of occupied initial states and the attempt frequency for electrons and holes in the c-Si to be in the same order of magnitude, thus cancelling out in Eq.  (1) . Indeed, when calculating the minority and majority carrier concentration at the Si/SiO 2 interface based on the band diagram shown in Fig.  6 , one obtains very similar values for bothn þ poly-Si/c-Si and p þ poly-Si c-Si junctions. In particular the density of unoccupied final states in the poly-Si could limit the tunnelling current for electrons or holes when considering the poly-Si as a semiconductor with a band gap comparable to that of c-Si. The fraction of the work function difference between the poly-Si and the c-Si which drops across the interfacial oxide shifts the edge of the minority carrier band edge at the SiO 2 /c-Si interface towards an energetic position within the band gap of the poly-Si. However, the band gap narrowing within the heavily doped poly-Si, the in-diffusion of dopants from the poly-Si into the c-Si, as well as the (weakly pronounced) band bending within the poly-Si (over-) compensates this effect. Due to the latter two effects, the valence band edge of the c-Si at the SiO 2 / c-Si interface is energetically located 1 meV below the valence band edge of the poly-Si at the poly-Si/SiO 2 interface according to our DESSIS calculations of an n þ poly-Si/c-Si junction (Fig.  6(a) ). Minority carrier tunnelling could thus occur from valence band to valence band in these junctions, i.e., recombination should not be limited by the density of final states. According to our band diagram for p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions, the conduction band edge in the c-Si at the SiO 2 /c-Si interface is 38 meV below the conduction band edge in the poly-Si at the poly-Si/SiO 2 interface (Fig.  6(b) ). Thus, electrons (minority carriers in this case) would have to be thermally excited in order to tunnel from the c-Si into the poly-Si. However, since only a thermal excitation of 1.4 times the thermal energy k B T at 300 K would be necessary, it seems not plausible to assume that this effect is limiting the electron current (i.e., the recombination) in p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions. Furthermore, in particular near the band edges, the defects in the poly-Si and at the poly-Si/SiO 2 interface possibly pose accessible final states with a high density in the band gap of the poly-Si. Under illumination, the band bending will also be relaxed, i.e., the voltage drop across the interfacial oxide will be reduced. Thus, the edge of the minority carrier band at the SiO 2 /c-Si interface will shift out of the band gap of the poly-Si. We therefore tentatively conclude that, within the framework of the tunnelling model, a low density of accessible final states is not likely to limit the tunnelling of minority carriers into (the recombination within) the poly-Si. Of course, the accuracy of the calculation of the band diagram has its limitations, even when using state-of-the art software like DESSIS including recent models for many import physical effects. For example, the effect of the defect states in the poly-Si, at the poly-Si/SiO 2 and at the SiO 2 /c-Si interface is difficult to describe without further experimental input. It might therefore be worth to investigate the band alignment of poly-Si/c-Si junctions experimentally, e.g. by photoelectron spectroscopy of junctions with very thin poly-Si layers. 
 APPENDIX B. Comparison to previous work In the following, our more generalized model presented in this work is compared to our previous model according to Ref.  [4] . The underlying physics of both approaches is identical. We consider the current flow through the interfacial oxide to be localized, and calculate the resulting junction resistance and recombination current density based on the majority and minority carrier flow within a highly doped c-Si region in the vicinity of the pinhole (i.e., in the c-Si underneath the interfacial oxide). In Ref.  [4] , the spatial distribution of minority carriers and the resulting diffusion current is calculated straight-forward by solving the equation for minority carrier diffusion. In order to enable an analytical solution, the problem was simplified in Ref.  [4]  to one dimension (spherical coordinates, only radius dependence, and no angle-dependence) by utilizing radial symmetry. This is the reason why we had to neglect the recombination at the c-Si/SiO x interface in Ref.  [4] , since otherwise the radial symmetry would have been broken. In this work, we applied the concept of Fischer  [26, 27]  to our problem. The Fischer model does not attempt to calculate the spatial distribution of minority and majority carriers. Rather, a relation between resistance (majority carrier flow) and recombination current density (minority carrier flow) is deduced by utilizing the similarity of transport equations (Laplace equation in both cases) and boundary conditions for minority and majority carriers. The physical principal behindthat both carrier types are facing the same transport problemalso holds for our more straight-forward previous approach. The main advantage of the concept of Fischer  [26, 27]  is that no restrictions on the symmetry are implied a-priori. Therefore, it is possible to deduce a relation between resistance and recombination (Eq. (  20 ) in Ref.  [27] ) for a structure which includes bothrecombination in the pinhole region, as well in the surrounding regions where the interfacial oxide is still intact. When furthermore applying appropriate models for the resistance of such a structure (Eqs.  (22, 23)  in Ref.  [27] ), the Fischer concept enables a calculation of J 0 and ρ c including the recombination at the SiO x /c-Si interface. This comes to the price of a loss of information on the spatial carrier distribution, and to the price of a more indirect approach (as compared to our more straight-forward calculation in Ref.  [4] ). However, also the latter might not be critical since the Fischer model is well known to and widely accepted in the PV community. As a further generalization, our current picture does not exclude that the actual transport through the interfacial oxide is mediated by tunnelling in a region in which the oxide thickness is locally reduced (i.e., the formation of a pinhole is not a necessary assumption any more). However, this is only an aspect of interpretation, since the actual transport through the interfacial oxide (or through a pinhole) is not taken into account in the calculationsneither in this work nor in Ref.  [4] . Fig.  7  compares for a p þ poly-Si/c-Si junction the experimental data for ρ c , J 0 with both modelsthe current one based on the Fischer concept, and the previous one according to Ref.  [4] . The input parameters for the doping concentration in the c-Si region underneath the interfacial oxide (N A ¼10 18 cm À 3 ), the depth of the in-diffused region (W (or R in model  [4] )¼ 350 nm), the radius of the pinhole (r pinhole ¼ 2 nm) and the recombination velocity within the pinhole (S 0,pinhole ¼10 7 cm/s) are chosen identical. In the regime with high pinhole area density and low junction resistivity, recombination in the pinholes dominates the total recombination, and both models are in good agreement. However, all experimental data points except the values from Gan and Swanson  [8]  seem to be located within a regime with low pinhole areal density, in which recombination at the c-Si/SiO x interface dominates. These data points can only be described correctly by our recent generalized model which takes into account a S 0,pass value different from zero. This furthermore points out the importance of the interfacial oxide properties. Both, the c-Si/SiO x interface state density and transparency for minority carriers have to be minimized.

 Fig. 6 . 6 Fig. 6. Enlarged details of the band diagram for (a) nþ poly-Si/c-Si junctions, and (b) p þ poly-Si/c-Si junctions as shown in Fig. 1. In (b), an offset of 38 meV between the energetic position of the conduction band edge in the c-Si (SiO 2 /c-Si interface) and in the poly-Si (poly-Si/SiO 2 interface) is visible. One should note the limited accuracy of these DESSIS calculations. For example, the poly-Si is described by the models of c-Si, and defect levels are neither assumed to change the band structure (in particular near the band edges) nor to trap charges.

All the reagents were used as received. The δ-phase FAPbI3 powder was synthesized through the method developed in our group which will be published soon. 
 Experimental methods The Solution Preparation. The perovskite precursor solution of MACl-stabilized FAPbI3 was obtained by dissolving 1.8 M δ-phase FAPbI3 powder and 0.63 M MACl into the mixed solvent of DMSO:DMF (v:v = 15:85). Then 40 uL extra PbI2 solution (1.8 M in the identical mixed solvent) was added into 1 mL precursor solution abovementioned to get
the corresponding perovskite precursor with excess PbI2. The precursor solution was filtered before use. The perovskite precursor solution of FA0.8075MA0.10Cs0.05Pb(I0.854Br0.186)3 was obtained by dissolving PbI2 (1.15 M), FAI (1.09 M), PbBr2 (0.20 M), MABr (0.135 M) and CsI (0.0675 M) into the mixed solvent of NMP:DMSO:DMF (v:v:v = 1:4:15). The perovskite precursor solution of FA0.90MA0.10PbI3•(CsPbI3)0.05 with excess PbI2 was obtained by dissolving MAPbI3 (0.15 M), FAPbI3 (1.35 M), CsPbI3 (0.075 M), and PbI2 (0.06 M) into the mixed solvent of DMSO:DMF (v:v = 1:4). These two kinds of perovskite precursor solutions were stirred at 70 °C for 20 min to achieve complete dissolution before use. The polishing agent was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD (Organic matrix), 28.8 μL tBP (Chemical 1), 17.5 μL LiTFSI (Chemical 2, 520 mg mL -1 in ACN) and 20 μL or 40 uL BAHI (Chemical 3, 75 mg mL -1 in IPA) into 1 mL CB. The precursor solution for compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) is prepared with titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (0.6 mL) and bis(acetylacetonate) (0.4 mL) diluted in the anhydrous EtOH (9 mL). The TiO2 paste (30 NR-D) was dispersed in EtOH at a weight ratio of 1:6 to make mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2). The solution of hole transporting layer (HTL) was prepared by dissolving 48.2 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 20.0 μL tBP, 12.0 μL Li-TFSI/ACN (520 mg mL -1 ) and 3.3 mg PTAA into 1 mL CB. The Electron Transporting Layer Deposition. FTO glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in cleaning liquid, acetone, IPA for 15 min, respectively, and then dried in an air oven (60 °C). For the mesoscopic PSCs, the c-TiO2 precursor solution was deposited onto the clean FTO substrates through spray pyrolysis at 450 °C with oxygen as a carrier gas. Then an m-TiO2 layer was deposited onto the c-TiO2 layer by spin coating a diluted TiO2 paste to be sintered at 450 °C for 30 min in air later. After cooling to 150 °C, the substrates of FTO glass/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 were transferred into a N2-filled glovebox after UV-Ozone for 6 min. The Perovskite Film Deposition. The perovskite precursor solution was deposited onto the c-TiO2/m-TiO2-coated FTO substrates by a consecutive two-step program at 2000 rpm for 10 s with a ramping rate of 200 rpm s -1 , and 5000 rpm for 20 s with a ramping rate of 2000 rpm s -1 . During the second step (5000 rpm), 100 μL CB was poured onto the substrate before 5 s to the end. For the MACl-stabilized FAPbI3, the samples were transferred onto a hotplate of 150 °C outside glovebox as soon as possible for 15-min annealing in the air with a relative humidity of ~40%. For the composition of FA0.90MA0.10PbI3•(CsPbI3)0.05 with excess PbI2 and FA0.8075MA0.10Cs0.05Pb(I0.854Br0.186)3 perovskites, the samples were transferred onto a hotplate of 105 °C inside glovebox as soon as possible for 45 min. Chemical Polishing of Perovskite Film Surface. The polishing agent was firstly spincoated onto the perovskite film surface at 5000 rpm for 30 s with a ramp rate of 2000 rpm s -1 , and then 100 uL CB was put onto the film surface followed by the immediate spincoating at 5000 rpm for 30 s with a ramp rate of 2000 rpm s -1 , and another 100 uL CB was then drop-cast onto the film during spin-coating to completely wash away the polishing agent. The Hole Transporting Layer Deposition. After cooling down to room temperature, the HTL was made by drop-casting HTL solution onto the perovskite absorbers at 4000 rpm for 20 s. Metal Electrode Deposition. Finally, Au electrode of 80 nm with an active area of ~0.103 cm 2 and an antireflection layer were deposited by a thermal evaporation at a rate of 0.1-1.0 Å s -1 under the vacuum (< 4×10 -4 Pa) to complete device fabrication process. Solar Cell Characterization. We recorded the current density-voltage (J-V) curves and stabilized power outputs (SPOs) of the PSCs with a 2400 Series Source Meter (Keithley Instruments, USA). To reduce the mismatch between the simulated and actual solar spectrum to less than 2%, a 150 W Class AAA solar simulator (XES-40S1, SAN-EI) was used as the simulated AM 1.5G standard light source for photovoltaic (PV) measurements. The light intensity was calibrated by a standard monocrystalline silicon diode with a KG-5 filter before test. During the measurement, a black-coloured metal mask was used to define the photo-active area of 0.09 cm 2 to ensure the accuracy of the JSC obtained from J-V curves. The sweeping conditions are: reverse scan (1.22 V → -0.02 V, scan rate 10 mV s -1 , and no delay time) and forward scan (-0.02 V → 1.22 V, scan rate 10 mV s -1 , and no delay time). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were carried out using a 300 W xenon light source (ILC Technology). All the above measurements were performed in air at room temperature with non-encapsulated PSCs. Film Characterization. The perovskite films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Mini Flex 600, Rigaku, Japan), grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXD, beamline 7.3.3 at Advanced Light Source (ALS), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL, USA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Nova_Nano SEM 430, FEI, USA), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis, UH4150, Hitachi, Japan) absorption spectroscopy, Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5000 VersaProbe System, ULVAC-PHI, Japan), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, PHI 5000 VersaProbe System, ULVAC-PHI, Japan), time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS, PHI TRIFT V nanoTOF, ULVAC-PHI, Japan), confocal fluorescence microscope (ISS Q2 FLIM/FFS, ISS Inc., USA), steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL and TRPL, FLS1000, Edinburgh Instruments, UK), space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurements and electrochemical workstation for temperature-dependent conductivity (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm, Switzerland). All the perovskite films were deposited on FTO glass/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 substrates. The wavelength of X-ray used in GIWAXD was 1.240 Å, and the scattering intensity was detected by a PILATUS 2M detector. For the XPS analysis, a focused monochromatic Al Kα X-ray was used as the X-ray source to generate the photoelectrons of the investigated elements. During the XPS measurements, electron and Ar + flooding with kinetic energy of 1 eV and 10 eV, respectively, were simultaneously applied to compensate the surface charge. For the UPS analysis, the He-I photon with a photon energy of 21.2 eV was generated by a discharge lamp and used as the ultraviolet radiation source. All the UPS spectra were measured under a sample bias of -10 V. A thermally evaporated Au film deposited on the Si wafer was used as the reference sample to calibrate the Fermi level position. All the ToF-SIMS results were obtained through the slice-and-view analysis scheme. During the ToF-SIMS measurements, a pulsed 20 keV C60 + ion beam (~8200 Hz pulse frequency and ~15 ns pulse length) and a 15 keV Ar1000 + cluster ion beam were utilized as the primary ion and sputter ion source, respectively. The Ar1000 + sputter-ion beam current was 10 nA, rastering over a 2000 μm × 2000 μm area. The excitation wavelength of confocal PL was 405 or 488 nm. Temperature-dependent conductivity measurement was carried out on the FTO glass/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/Au samples.                    Table  S2 .

 ■ INTRODUCTION Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved certified power conversion efficiencies (PCE) exceeding 25% within an extremely short period of time.  1  PSCs hold promise to further reduce the power-to-weight ratio, showing great potential for portable electronics and space photovoltaics.  2, 3  Lead iodide (PbI 2 )-containing perovskite films, independent of processing methods or device architectures, are used as absorbers in the large majority of state-of-the-art PSCs.  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]  Excess PbI 2 has been shown to be conducive to enlarged grain sizes, reduced halide vacancies, and promoting more oriented α-phase perovskite crystals.  [11] [12] [13]  Moderate reaction-residual or heating-induced PbI 2 in polycrytalline perovskites can passivate defects at grain boundaries.  [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]  All these benefits contribute to improved single-scan PCEs. However, it is noted that a rapid drop in PCE can often be observed after multiple instantaneous current-voltage scans for PSCs with excess PbI 2 . Pronounced current-voltage hysteresis is also associated with residual PbI 2 .  12, 14, [19] [20] [21] [22]  Moreover, unreacted crystalline PbI 2 at the charge carrier transport interfaces are essentially catalytic sites triggering perovskite decomposition during long-term operating conditions.  19, [23] [24] [25]  PbI 2 is prone to decompose into metallic lead Pb 0 and gaseous I 2 by exposure to continuous light and heat. The products Pb 0 are recombination centers and can promote ion migration.  24, 26  An excess of PbI 2 would lead to the formation of more Pb 0 -rich voids and more nonradiative recombination, consequently sacrificing the open-circuit voltage (V OC ).  24, 27  Overall, the photoinstability of PbI 2containing perovskite negates the beneficial effects on the PCE enhancement. Post-treatments on perovskite films are geared toward chemically reacting with residual PbI 2 .  5, 6, 8, [28] [29] [30]  Organic ammonium salts are usually postdeposited to interact with residual PbI 2 in situ to passivate the defects, but often introduce additional thermal, hygro-or phase instabilities.  6, [31] [32] [33]  Modulating the morphology or the spatial distribution of PbI 2 in perovskite film is an alternative to realize PSCs with enhanced performance, but PbI 2 is still present at the film surface.  34, 35  Therefore, thoroughly ripping the excess PbI 2 off the polycrystalline perovskite film surface is desired, which has not been targeted so far. Inspired by this, we sought to develop a chemical polishing strategy to decouple the double-edged effect of excess PbI 2 . We first maximized the benefits of excess PbI 2 on perovskite crystal nucleation and growth, and then minimized the potential photoinstability of residual PbI 2 by ripping it out from the resultant polycrystalline perovskite film surface. Unlike the commonly investigated post-treatments where there is an extra layer formed by the in situ reaction of ammounium salts with PbI 2 , we removed the interfacial PbI 2 by taking advantage of the reaction with ammounium salts in a chemical polishing agent. The resultant polished perovskite film surface showed higher photoluminescence, prolonged carrier lifetimes, and favorable energy level alignment that led to a remarkable photovoltaic performance enhancement from 23.07% to (i) The evolution of diffraction peak area ratio between hydrate δ-phase perovskite, PbI 2 and α-phase perovskite along with incidence angles ranging from 0.2°to 0.6°. All the perovskite films were deposited on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass/compact TiO 2 (c-TiO 2 )/ mesoporous TiO 2 (m-TiO 2 ) substrates. 24.50% with increased V OC and fill factor (FF). Interfacial ion migration paths and photodegradation triggers, dominated by PbI 2 crystals, were eliminated, thus the hysteresis of the PSCs was suppressed and the device stability was significantly improved. 
 ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We added excess PbI 2 into the precursor of methylammonium chloride (MACl)-stabilized formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) perovskite. We then fabricated the perovskite film using this precursor and treated the PbI 2 -rich surface with a chemical polishing agent containing chlorobenzene (CB) as solvent, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as organic matrix, lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide salt (LiTFSI), benzylamine hydroiodide (BAHI), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) as described in the Supporting Information and Figure  1a . The untreated perovskite film is denoted as ""Unpolished"", and the treated film is denoted as ""Polished"" in the following discussion. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the changes in the surface morphology induced by chemical polishing. We first verified that CB cleaning has no influence on the film morphology (Figure  S1 ). As shown in Figure  1b , the Unpolished film showed a large amount of bright crystals (indexed as PbI 2 ),  5  hundreds of nanometers in size, located at grain boundaries (pointed by red arrows). The PbI 2 crystals were removed after the polishing process, leaving behind some pits (pointed by blue arrows, Figure  1c ) on the film surface, while the surface texture of perovskite crystals still exists, which is quite different from the PbI 2 -free surface processed from the precursor without excess PbI 2 (Figure  S2 ). The topography changes were again confirmed by the atom force microscopy (AFM), and the slightly reduced surface roughness indicates the surface flattening after chemical polishing (Figure  S3 ). This suggests that PbI 2 crystals were essentially ripped out, indicating an effective and gentle chemical polishing. The morphology differences between the Unpolished and Polished films encouraged us to probe the refined crystallographic structure in the Polished perovskite films using grazingincidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXD) at different incidence angles (Figure  S4 ). As confirmed by the twodimensional (2D) GIWAXD patterns (Figure  1d ,e), when the X-ray incidence angle is 0.3°, both Unpolished and Polished perovskite films show an intense reflection at q ≈ 10.0 nm -1 that belongs to the (100) plane of α-phase FAPbI 3 . The (001) reflection of PbI 2 is observed at q ≈ 9.0 nm -1 for the Unpolished sample but is absent in that of Polished sample. The integrated line files of the 2D GIWAXD patterns were obtained at incidence angles from 0.1°to 0.6°for Unpolished and Polished perovskite films (Figure  1f, g ). The (001) reflection of PbI 2 is seen in all the profiles of the Unpolished sample, and not for the Polished sample for incidence angle <0.4°, but emerges at higher angles of incidence. The thorough removal of excess PbI 2 near the perovskite surface is confirmed by the GIWAXD analysis. GIWAXD measurements of the Polished and Unpolished samples are compared at an incidence angle of 0.3°in Figure  1h . These results also show that polishing did not lead to the formation of a new crystalline phase. It is noted that there are two peaks at q ≈ 8.4 nm -1 and q ≈ 8.2 nm -1 derived from the δ-phase and hydrate δ-phase perovskites, respectively,  36  where the latter possibly arises due to the ambient annealing in air with a relative humidity of ∼40%. When the area ratio and intensity of GIWAXD peaks are presented as a function of the incidence angle (Figure  1i  and Figure  S5 ), a gradual increase in the α-phase perovskite (100) signal with the increasing incidence angle is observed for both the Unpolished and Polished samples. The peak area ratio between PbI 2 (001) or hydrate δ-phase and α-phase perovskite (100) for Unpolished sample decreases with increasing penetration depth, indicating a surface-concentrated distribution of PbI 2 and hydrate δ-phase perovskite. The hydrate δphase perovskite is significantly suppressed near the surface of the Polished sample, implying that the polishing process removed the hydrate δ-phase perovskites near the surface. Consequently, improved humidity and light stability of the Polished perovskite film is expected, since the hydrate δ-phase perovskites and photosensitive PbI 2 are expelled. To distinguish the role BAHI plays in the chemical polishing from post-treatment, we post-treated an Unpolished perovskite film using a single-solute BAHI solution having the same concentration as the polishing agent. The top-view SEM image shows that a direct BAHI treatment leads to a textured surface morphology which is distinctly different from the Unpolished and Polished films (Figure  S6 ). This suggests that the BAHI post-treatment has induced the formation of an extra layer, probably due to the in situ reaction of excess PbI 2 or the perovskite crystals and a mass of BAHI molecules, indicating that BA residues introduced during surface polishing is at a low level. To properly remove the excess PbI 2 and hydrate δ-phase FAPbI 3 by chemical polishing, it is important to blend the BAHI molecules with the organic matrix such as spiro-OMeTAD, which is further confirmed by similar results obtained while replacing Spiro-OMeTAD with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, Figures  S7  and S8 ). To identify residues remaining after the chemical polishing process, we performed time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on Polished and Unpolished films. From the ToF-SIMS depth profiles (Figure  2a, b ), all the chemicals in the polishing agent are removed except for BA that absorbs to the surface. Three-dimensional (3D) ToF-SIMS images of the ammonium cations are shown in Figure  S9 . The uniform FA and MA distributions are preserved after polishing while BA, a Lewis base passivator,  37  segregates to the surface of the Polished perovskite. From the XPS spectra in Figure  2c , the intensity of the peak attributed to adventitious carbon (C adv , 284.8 eV) is elevated after chemical polishing, implying that the benzyl functional group, i.e. BA, is partially left onto the Polished perovskite surface according to SEM and ToF-SIMS results. The intensities of MA (C MA , 286.6 eV) and FA (C FA , 288.7 eV) carbon signals remain at their initial levels, suggesting that the MA and FA cations remain intact during polishing. Additionally, the concentration ratio of I to Pb (I/ Pb) is found to increase from 2.62 to 2.84 (Figure  S10 ), indicating an improved perovskite stoichiometry due to the removal of excess PbI 2 . We then conducted a systematic ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) study to demonstrate the effects of surface polishing on the energy-level alignment at the perovskite/HTL interface. All the metrics essential for drawing the energy-level diagram are summarized in Table  S1 . The band gap of the bulk perovskite is determined as 1.54 eV by UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy and the Tauc plot (Figure  S11 ). According to the valence-band maximum (VB M ) and Fermi level (E F ) positions determined by the UPS spectra (Figure  2d ), the influence of the surface treatment on the energy-level alignment is shown in Figure  2e . The n-type semiconducting Unpolished perovskite film is identified as predicted.  38  By treating the Unpolished perovskite film with BAHI solution, a decreased work function is observed, suggesting a further ndoping induced by the BAHI treatment. In contrast to the BAHI treatment, chemical polishing is found to induce pdoping on the Polished perovskite surface. In addition to the UPS analysis, the polishing-induced p-doping is also supported by the lowered binding energies of the XPS characteristic peaks (Figure  2c ), suggesting an increment in the work function value. The p-doping can arise from the applied LiTFSI, which is an electron acceptor commonly used to modulate the energy level and/or conductivity of the HTL. The band structure of Polished perovskite film was effectively engineered by the BAHI concentration in the chemical polishing agent. As shown in Figure  2d ,e, increasing work functions of the Polished perovskite films are observed as the BAHI concentration decreases. The increased work function implies an up-shifted band structure near the Polished perovskite surface, which produces an electric field facilitating the hole carrier collection. However, as illustrated in the energy-level diagram of the BAHI (0 mg mL -1 )-polished perovskite film, an overly pdoped perovskite surface can result in a hole extraction energy barrier at the perovskite/HTL interface. On the other hand, the significant n-type semiconducting nature of the BAHItreated and the BAHI (3.0 mg mL -1 )-polished perovskite film will lead to a significant bimolecular charge carrier recombination at the perovskite/HTL interface.  39  Using an optimized polishing agent concentration is, therefore, important to realize the full potential of the chemical polishing. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was also used to access the distribution of surface potential of the Unpolished and Polished perovskite films. It can be seen from Figure  3a ,b that the surface potential of Polished perovskite film is lower than that of the Unpolished one, indicating a Fermi level is located closer to the valence-band edge.  40, 41  The p-doping effect revealed by the KPFM images is consistent with the XPS and UPS results. The statistical distribution of surface potential extracted from KPFM images (Figure  3c ) shows a 0.13-0.14 V decrease in surface potential after the Polishing treatment, indicating a 0.13-0.14 eV higher work function of the Polished film. This result agrees well with the 0.12 eV work function difference determined by UPS (Table  S1 ). Laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to explore the surficial defect distribution variations enabled by chemical polishing. We can observe that there is no obvious emission from PbI 2 crystals on the Polished perovskite film in contrast to the Unpolished, where the enhanced homogeneity on the microscale is attributed to the surface polishing (Figure  3d, e ). In addition, an overall improvement in the luminescent intensity is observed in the Polished film (Figure  3f ), indicating a reduced defect density, which is validated by the decrease in the trap-filled limit voltage (V TFL ) extracted from the current versus bias voltage curves of the hole-only devices (Figure  S12 ), promoting V OC s and FFs by lowering the nonradiative recombination loss. Figure  3g  shows the time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of Unpolished and Polished perovskite films. The corresponding carrier lifetimes of each film can be determined from biexponential fitting methods,  42  and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table  S2 . The average carrier lifetimes were calculated as 406 and 760 ns for Unpolished and Polished films, respectively. Typically, the short lifetime component arises from the quenching of charge carriers at the surface, which will result in a reduced carrier collection. Accordingly, the prolonged lifetimes in Polished perovskite film also manifest reduced surface nonradiative recombination at the interface, which benefits device performance. By combining these results, the significant removal of excess PbI 2 and in situ surface anchoring of the BA polishing agent are verified on the Polished perovskite surface, as illustrated in Figure  1a . A PbI 2 -less perovskite surface with BA anchoring is expected to suffer less from ion migration. To address this, we measured the activation energy (E a ) of the ion migration on Unpolished and Polished perovskite surfaces using a lateral device structure to highlight in-plane ion migration. The E a was extracted from the plots of the logarithmic conductivity of the perovskite films as a function of 1000/T.  43  As shown in Figure  3h , the Unpolished perovskite film has an E a of 0.254 eV for ion migration, while the Polished film shows a much higher E a of 0.472 eV. The significantly increased E a indicates that the polishing treatment effectively suppresses ion migration on the surface, contributing to the improved stability of PSCs. We first validated the superiority of excess PbI 2 on the device efficiency enhancement by comparison of the current density-voltage (J-V) curves in the reverse scanning direction (Figure  S13a, b ). We then examined the photovoltaic metrics of Journal of the American Chemical Society the mesostructured PSCs with the same configuration fabricated using Unpolished and Polished perovskites. Figure  4a  compares the four photovoltaic parameters of the devices. The polishing process slightly improves the device reproducibility, as evidenced by the reduced deviations shown in the statistics. Moreover, the PSCs based on Polished perovskite films achieved higher PCEs with increasing V OC s and FFs, and similar short-circuit current densities (J SC s) in comparison to the Unpolished ones. The comparable integrating J SC values were further confirmed by the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) results (Figure  S13c ), coinciding well with the unchanged UV-vis absorption spectra and similar film thickness of ∼800 nm (Figure  S14 ). After optimization, a champion device efficiency of 24.50% (reverse scan) with negligible hysteresis was obtained for the Polished perovskite film. The stable power output is ∼24.30% under 1 sun, AM 1.5G irradiance (Figure  4b ,c and Table  S3 ), which is in line with the J-V results. Compared to the Unpolished device with efficiency of 23.07%, the V OC increases from 1.121 to 1.150 V, and FF increases from 79.51% to 82.37%, confirming that the surface polishing improves the performance of the PSCs. The plots of V OC versus logarithmic light intensity in Figure  S15  exhibit slopes of 1.89k B T/q and 1.47k B T/q for the Unpolished and the Polished PSCs, respectively, demonstrating the chemical polishing strategy can effectively passivate the defects at the perovskite film surface. We show the stability performances of the unencapsulated devices under different conditions using normalized PCEs (Figure  4d ,e and Figure  S16 ). The PCEs for Unpolished and Polished PSCs maintained 9.65 ± 1.90% and 47.96 ± 3.21% of their initial values, respectively, after being exposed to ambient conditions at 80 ± 20% relative humidity for more than 500 h. The improvement of the stability under humid conditions was further validated by the color evolution of the corresponding PSCs (Figure  S17 ) and continuous changes in XRD patterns of perovskite films (Figure  S18 ). Additionally, the PCEs of the Polished PSCs were stable after the burn-in stage during continuous illumination at an operational temperature of ∼60 °C for more than 500 h, and then recovered to 92.83 ± 2.32% of their initial values after storage in the dark for 24 h due to the selfhealing of perovskites,  44  while the Unpolished one showed a sustained irreversible decline to less than 50% of the initial PCEs attributed to the irreversible perovskite decomposition arising from excess PbI 2 .  45  These results indicate that the surface polishing treatment considerably improves the moisture and light stability of the PSCs. Furthermore, the general applicability of chemical polishing was verified by the modified surface morphologies and enhanced photovoltaic performances with Polished perovskite films having different compositions, further confirming that the chemical polishing is beneficial for the development of the state-of-the-art PSCs (Figures  S19  and S20 ). 
 ■ CONCLUSION In summary, we developed a chemical polishing strategy, which is compatible with the existing techniques, that dramatically improved the surface of the polycrystalline perovskite film for high-efficiency PSCs. A refined crystallographic structure of the Polished perovskite film was obtained by the gentle removal of excess PbI 2 and hydrate δ-phase perovskite, which is beneficial for the device performance. In addition, the polishing agent was found to provide an in situ chemical modification by anchoring BA, resulting in a tunable energy-level structure of the Polished perovskite film. These features afford enhanced luminescence, prolonged carrier lifetimes, favorable energylevel alignment, and increased ion-migration activation energy, enabling highly efficient hysteresis-free PSCs with improved PCEs of 24.50% and extended device lifetimes. The chemical polishing strategy was shown to lead to significant performance improvements of PSCs with other typical perovskite compositions, suggesting its potential of being broadly utilized in the state-of-the-art thin-film perovskite electronic devices.

Damp heat-stable perovskite solar cells with tailored-dimensionality 2D/3D heterojunctions

If perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are to be commercialized, they must achieve long-term stability, which is usually assessed with accelerated degradation tests. One of the persistent obstacles for PSCs has been successfully passing the damp-heat test (85°C and 85% relative humidity), which is the standard for verifying the stability of commercial photovoltaic (PV) modules. We fabricated damp heat-stable PSCs by tailoring the dimensional fragments of two-dimensional perovskite layers formed at room temperature with oleylammonium iodide molecules; these layers passivate the perovskite surface at the electron-selective contact. The resulting inverted PSCs deliver a 24.3% PCE and retain >95% of their initial value after >1000 hours at damp-heat test conditions, thereby meeting one of the critical industrial stability standards for PV modules. 
 C ommercialization of any photovoltaic (PV) technology requires a guaranteed product lifetime of at least 25 to 30 years, as is common for conventional crystalline silicon (c-Si) PV modules. Lifetime predictions of PV technologies are usually accomplished through standardized accelerated degradation tests. After the demonstration of excellent power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the main challenge toward market entry of PSCs is successfully passing standard industrial lifetime assessment tests of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC 61215:2016)-in particular, damp-heat testing at 85°C and 85% relative humidity  (1, 2) . A stabilized PCE performing like a commercial c-Si solar cell (PCE ~20%) would need to pass a damp-heat test for >1000 hours with <5% relative loss in PCE  (3, 4) . Degradation of encapsulated PSCs is usually caused by leakage in the packaging (allowing atmospheric agents to interact with the perovskite) and device-related material instabilities. To address this, we developed leakage-free device packaging that seals the PSC within two glass sheets, using a vacuum-laminated encapsulant and edge sealing via butyl rubber. Despite this, damp-heat testing of our encapsulated control devices resulted in fast degradation (see below), implying an intrinsic thermal instability of the perovskite absorber layer itself. The instability of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite films, when used as the photoactive absorber layer in PSCs, is mainly attributed to high defect densities as well as ion migration at grain boundaries and interfaces, which is exacerbated at higher operational temperatures  (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Several approaches have been reported to passivate these defects  (7, (10) (11) (12) (13) . Specifically, growing 2D perovskite layers on the top surface of 3D perovskites creates a 2D/ 3D perovskite heterojunction that can effectively passivate surface defects and suppress ion migration  (3, 6, (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . At the device level, integrating such 2D perovskite passivation layers in PSCs can enhance their PCE and lifetime  (3, 4, (14) (15) (16) (17) . So far, this strategy has been most successful for ""regular structured"" PSCs in which phase-pure 2D perovskites (n = 1, where n represents the dimensionality of the 2D perovskite by counting the number of its octahedral inorganic sheets) were inserted between the 3D perovskite surface and the (opaque) hole-selective top-contact stack  (3, (14) (15) (16) (17) . For ""inverted"" devices, this top-contact passivation approach (now at the electron-selective side) has consistently failed in PCE and lifetime; this represents a persistent challenge in the perovskite community  (19, 20) , as inverted PSCs are arguably easier to fabricate and scale up  (11) . We found that tailoring the dimensionality (n) of the 2D perovskite fragments at the electron-selective interface of inverted PSCs is essential to enable efficient top-contact passivation through 2D perovskite passivation layers. This interface has frequently been ignored because it is assumed that the conventional electron-selective layer, C 60 (or its derivatives), provides sufficient passivation of 3D perovskites  (21) ; instead, attention has predominantly focused on the hole-selective interface of inverted PSCs, situated at the (transparent) bottom contact of the device  (22) (23) (24) (25) . However, recent reports have revealed that C 60 is only weakly bonded to perovskite layers, which induces a high energetic disorder between perovskite and C 60 layers that limits device performance at elevated operating temperatures  (5, 6, 26) . Moreover, a thin layer of C 60 is insufficient to effectively protect the 3D perovskite film underneath from moisture or oxygen ingress. Implementing 2D perovskite passivation layers is a promising approach to solve all of the issues mentioned above. We post-treated the surface defects of the 3D perovskites by applying oleylammonium iodide (OLAI) molecules to form Ruddlesden-Popper-phase 2D perovskite layers, which resulted in higher PCEs and prolonged stabilities of inverted PSCs. We tailored the dimensionality, n, of the 2D-perovskite fragments (which also dictates their optical and electronic properties) by tuning the annealing conditions from lower to higher temperatures, in that higher-n layers have a lower formation energy  (27) . Indeed, all 2D perovskite passivation layers prepared through thermal annealing (2D-TA) showed a dominant emission peak at ~510 nm (as evidenced in fig.  S1 ), which belongs to n = 1, in accordance with previous studies  (4, 6, 19, 28) . However, the formation of higher-dimensionality 2D perovskite layers (n ≥ 2) became more pronounced when the post-treatment was performed at room temperature (2D-RT) with the OLAI molecule (Fig.  1A ). We investigated the formation of 2D perovskite passivation films on 3D perovskites with grazing-incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS; Fig.  1, B  and C ). The 2D perovskite passivation films exhibited diffraction q z peaks at ~0.2 to ~0.5 A -1 , corresponding to the (001) and (002) planes of 2D perovskite crystals  (28) . As expected, the 2D-TA films were dominated by n = 1 layers (with a prominent peak at q z ≈ 0.35 A -1 ). In contrast, 2D-RT films exhibited the diffraction peaks of n = 1 and n = 2, with a more substantial n = 2 peak at lower q z (16). The strong intensity in the z-direction for 2D perovskite films was indicative of a highly oriented lateral direction of the top 3D perovskite layers. Cross-sectional high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) images also showed n = 1 and n = 2 layers in 2D-RT samples (Fig.  1D  and fig.  S2A ) but only n = 1 in 2D-TA (fig.  S2C ), which is consistent with the GIWAXS results. To differentiate between n = 1 and n = 2 layers, we performed elemental mapping images and profiling positions of 2D perovskite layers; Fig.  1E  and   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) topview images revealed that the surface morphology of the perovskite films after 2D perovskite passivation did not change substantially (fig.  S3, A  and B ). Further, the 2D perovskite passivation films exhibited stronger photoluminescence (PL) emission with a longer PL decay lifetime than control 3D perovskite films because of the suppression of nonradiative recombination associated with trap states at the surface (figs. S4 and S5). Interestingly, the 2D perovskite (n = 2) capping layer formed uniformly on top of 3D perovskite surfaces for 2D-RT, as shown in the PL images in Fig.  2A . In addition, PL spectra in 2D-TA samples showed a dominant emission peak corresponding to n = 1, whereas a PL emission associated with a higher dimensionality of n = 2 is more pronounced in 2D-RT samples (see Fig.  2B ), in accordance with GIWAXS and TEM results. The energy-level diagrams of [2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (2PACz) anchored on indium tin oxide (ITO) [which we used as the hole-selective contact  (22) ], perovskites, and C 60 are shown in Fig.  2C . With the OLAI post-treatment, the secondary electron cutoff (E cutoff ) shifted to a higher binding energy, indicating that the ion exchange-induced 3Dto-2D perovskite phase transition could lower the Fermi level (E F ) of post-treated perovskite films (fig.  S6 ). Notably, the energetic gap be-tween E F and the valence band maximum (VBM) of the 2D-RT sample was wider, indicating the enhanced n-type character of post-treated 3D perovskite films, which we attribute to a successful 2D perovskite passivation strategy  (19) . The conduction band minimum (CBM) of 2D-RT films was also closer to the CBM of C 60 at the n-type contact, which resulted in more efficient charge transfer at the 2D/3D perovskite interface and the C 60 electronselective layer. In contrast, the CBM of 2D-TA films was much higher than the CBM of C 60 with less n-type character and resulted in less efficient charge transfer of this 2D/3D perovskite interface at the electron-selective contact. In addition, the effects of 2D perovskite capping layers also enhanced the resilience against moisture of 3D perovskite films, as shown by contact angle measurement in fig.  S7 . Next, we fabricated inverted PSCs with a structure of glass/ITO/2PACz/3D perovskite/ 2D perovskite/C 60 /bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag (Fig.  3A ); Fig.  3B  shows the false-colored cross-sectional SEM view of these devices. As shown in the current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of the devices in Fig.  3C , the 2D-RT devices demonstrated substantially improved PCEs, with a maximum PCE of 24.3% and stabilized PCE of ~24% (open-circuit voltage, V OC , of ~1.20 V and fill factor, FF, of ~82%; fig.  S8, A  and C ). These results represent an absolute ~2% PCE gain upon 2D-RT passivation and can be compared with PCEs for other inverted PSCs (see fig.  S9A ). Also, 2D-RT passivation enables minimization of the device energy loss (E loss = E g -qV OC , where q is electron charge and E g is the optical bandgap) up to 0.34 eV, which represents ~96% of the thermodynamic limit of the V OC (1.262 V) for E g of 1.55 eV (fig.  S8, D  and E ). The reduced nonradiative loss in 2D-RT-based devices is comparable with state-of-the-art GaAs solar cells (V OC of 1.127 V, yielding ~98% of the thermodynamic limit of the V OC )  (29) . The 2D-TA passivated devices suffered from lower FF values (<79%; figs. S8B and S10), indicative of an energy level mismatch at the electron-selective contact, as derived from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) results  (20) . The narrow statistical distribution of the PCE, V OC , FF, and short-circuit current density (J SC ) values of the devices (figs. S8B and S11) confirmed the high reproducibility of our approach. We also confirmed the effectiveness of our approaches by showing less than 0.5% deviation for personto-person variations of seven different researchers (fig.  S12A ). Further, our proposed passivation approach was universal for various perovskite compositions (various bandgaps) and deposition techniques (such as one-step, two-step, and blade-coating), as demonstrated by the systematic absolute PCE enhancement of 1.5 to 2.0% of device performance in fig.  S12B . The reduced trap-assisted recombination of 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction devices was also investigated with transient photovoltage decay and light intensity dependent under open-circuit conditions (fig.  S13 ). The 2Dpassivated devices exhibited a longer charge recombination lifetime and lower ideality factor than control devices, confirming the reduced trap-assisted recombination at 3D/C 60 interfaces by the 2D perovskite passivation. Finally, we subjected our 2D perovskite passivation-treated PSCs to a set of rigorous stability tests. First, we evaluated the stability of our encapsulated devices when subjected to industry-relevant damp-heat tests (fig.  S14 ). Here, our 2D-perovskite passivation simultaneously served as ion migration-blocking moisture/oxygen ingress barriers and as defect passivation layers, particularly at elevated operating temperatures (see fig.  S15 )  (3, (14) (15) (16) (17) . Indeed, the 2D-RT-based device retained >95% of the initial PCE (T 95 ) after >1200 hours for champion stability cells (Fig.  3D ). Remarkably, after the damp-heat test, three devices showed an average PCE of 19.3 ± 0.69%. Our results represent the successful encapsulation of PSCs passing the industry-relevant damp-heat test according to the IEC 61215:2016 protocols (1, 2). Also, our final PCE of >19% after >1000 hours of damp-heat test represents a very high retained PCE (fig.  S9B  and table  S1 ). There was no substantial change in the structural and optical properties of the 2D perovskite passivation films (both 3D and 2D perovskites) after >500 hours of thermal annealing at 85°C under dark condition, confirming the robustness of our 2D perovskite passivation approach (fig.  S16 ). Note that our encapsulated devices used for stability tests exhibited slightly lower initial PCEs than the unencapsulated devices because of J SC losses originating from the en-capsulant and glass sheets (fig.  S17 ). We also tested unencapsulated devices in our dampheat chamber, applying thermal tests in ambient air with relative humidity of >50% (figs. S18 and S19), representative of extreme outdoor conditions. Our 2D capping layer introduced a substantially enhanced resistance of the devices against high moisture and thermal stress. Finally, we performed maximum power point tracking (MPPT) measurements for encapsulated cells under simulated 1-sun illumination in ambient air for >500 hours (Fig.  3E ). Here, the 2D-RT-based devices retained up to ~95% of their initial PCE after an MPPT test of >500 hours, whereas the control devices retained their PCE of <90% for only ~100 hours.

Butyl rubber edge sealant (HelioSeal PVS 101) was purchased from Kӧmerling Chemische Fabrik GMBH. All materials were directly used without purification. Device fabrication ITO glass was sequentially cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 15 min, respectively. Before use, the ITO/glass substrates were cleaned with ultraviolet ozone for 15 min. Then, the ITO/glass substrates were spin-coated with a thin layer of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) 2PACz ([2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid) at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min (0.5-1.0 mg/mL in ethanol). After cooling down, the 2PACz films were then washed by ethanol by dynamic coating at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s to remove unbounded molecules, followed by additional annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. Perovskite Cs0.03(FA0.90MA0.10)0.97PbI3 layers A mixture of perovskite solution (1.5 M) composed of mixed cations (PbI2: 691.5 mg, CsI: 11.7 mg, FAI: 225.1 mg, and MAI: 15.4 mg with 30 mol% of MACl) was dissolved in a mixed solvent (DMF/DMSO with 4/1 vol. ratio) according to a formula of Cs0.03(FA0.90MA0.10)0.97PbI3. A twostep spin-coating procedure with 2,000 r.p.m. for 40 s and 6,000 r.p.m. for 10 s was adopted to prepare perovskite films. Anisole (300 µl) was dropped on the spinning substrate during the last 10 s of the second spin-coating step. Subsequently, the sample was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. After cooling down, the 2D passivation by solution post-treatment was carried. Typically, OLAI molecules were dissolved in chloroform with concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 mg/mL. Then, 2D ligand solution (100 µL) was spin-coated onto the as-prepared perovskite films at 5,000 r.p.m. for 25 s. It should be noted, the temperature of N2 glove box was recorded around 25 °C during 2D passivation (the digital thermometer was placed near by spin-coater). Then the treated perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min for 2D-TA-based samples; and stored overnight at room-temperature (under dark and inside N2 glovebox with O2 level was <10 ppm and H2O level was <0.1 ppm) for 2D-RT-based samples. After Annealed or stored overnight, the treated films with 2D perovskite passivation were then washed one time with chloroform at 5,000 r.p.m. for 20 s to remove unbounded 2D ligands. All procedures were done in an N2 glove box. Perovskite Cs0.05FA0.80MA0.15PbI2.25Br0.75 layers For wide-bandgap perovskite, a mixture of perovskite solution (1.4 M) composed of mixed cations (PbI2: 568.2 mg, PbBr2: 61.3, CsI: 18.2 mg, FAI: 192.6 mg, and MABr: 23.5 mg with 15 mol% of MACl) was dissolved in a mixed solvent (DMF/DMSO with 4/1 ratio) according to a formula of Cs0.05FA0.80MA0.15PbI2.25Br0.75.(30) A two-step spin-coating procedure with 2,000 r.p.m. for 40 s and 6,000 r.p.m. for 10 s was adopted to prepare perovskite film. Anisole (300 µL) was dropped on the spinning substrate during the last 10 s of the second spin-coating step. Subsequently, the sample was annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. For fabricating blade-coated devices, PTAA (2 mg/mL in chlorobenzene) solution is spin-coated (5,000 r.p.m. for 30s) and annealed at 100 o C for 10 mins. The perovskite absorber layer is deposited on top of the HTL, by employing a 1.5 M solution of Cs0.15(FA0.85MA0.15)0.85PbI0.7Br0.3 in DMF solution. 25 µL of DMPU and 18 mg of MACl were introduced as additives for 1 ml of precursor solution. The substrates were blade-coated using 10 µL of the precursor solution at room-temperature at a speed of 15 mm/s. The blade-substrate gap was kept at 100 µm and a laminar flow air gun was used to induce crystallization of the precursor thin film. The films were then annealed at 70 o C for 10 min and 100 o C for 30 min, subsequently. The 2D passivation was done as described above. 
 Perovskite FAMAPbI3 and MAPbI3 layers (two-step method) The two-step inter-diffusion method was used to prepare double cation FAMAPbI3-and MAPbI3based perovskite films on ITO/2PACz substrates, with modification from previous report.  (31, 32)  A mixture solution of 1.5 M PbI2 in DMF/DMSO (9/1, v/v) solvent with 0.5 mol% of potassium iodide was stirred and heated at 75°C prior to use. Then, the solution was spin-coated at 2,500 r.p.m. for 30 s followed by annealing at 70°C for 1 min. After cooling to RT, mixed solution of 0.5 M FAI/MAI (0.7/0.3, molar ratio with or without 0.15 M of MACl) in IPA or 0.5 M MAI in IPA were dropped onto the PbI2 layers for preparing FAMAPbI3 and MAPbI3 perovskites, respectively. Then, the films were annealed at 80°C for 1 min. After cooling, the perovskite films were washed with IPA via drop-casting at 4,000 r.p.m. for 20 s, followed by thermal annealing at 120 °C for 20 min. The 2D passivation was done as described above. After the perovskite deposition, samples were transferred into a thermal evaporator for the C60 (25 nm) and BCP (5 nm) deposition. For the final step, a 120 nm thick Ag layer was evaporated at low pressure (< 10 -6 Torr) with an area of ~0.1 cm 2 . For J-V measurements, a black metal mask with an aperture area of 0.0715 cm 2 was used to define the active area of the devices accurately. A ~120 nm MgF2 was also evaporated at the glass side to minimize the reflection losses from the glass substrates. 
 Perovskite film characterizations The photo-emission spectra of the encapsulated perovskite thin films were collected using a hyperspectral imaging system coupled to a microscope with 2 nm spectral resolution (Photon etc., IMA). The samples were excited with a 405 nm laser where the excitation was incident on the top surface of the perovskite films. All Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) patterns of samples were acquired at the BL17A1 beamline in the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan. A Mar345 image plate detector was used to capture the scattering patterns. The sample-to-detector distance is 315.6 mm, which was calibrated from the AgBe standard. The wavelength of the incident X-rays is 1.32 Å. Typical GIWAXS patterns were obtained from an incidence angle of 0.20° to 1.00°. For the cross-sectional TEM measurements, the lamella was prepared first in a scanning electron microscope (Helios G4 DualBeam, FEI), equipped with an EasyLift nanomanipulator with the help of a Ga focused ion beam (FIB). To protect the sample, the protective carbon and platinum layers were deposited under electron and ion beams. The bulk of the sample was milled with the ion beam (30 kV, 20 nA), and attached to the TEM copper grid in accordance with the lift-out method. The lamella was thinned down with the FIB gradually decreasing the current (30 kV, 2.8 nA -90 pA). The final cleaning was performed at 5 kV, 81 pA and 2 kV, 28 pA to remove any possible contamination. The imaging and elemental mapping was conducted in Titan Cs Probe TEM equipped with EDX and HAADF detector in STEM mode at 300 kV operating voltage. Unless stated otherwise, all measured perovskite films for the characterization mentioned above used higher OLAI concentrations (2 mg/mL) to help the investigation of the 2D perovskite properties. The Bruker Dimension-Icon system atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried to investigate perovskite films' morphology. The X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded with a Bruker D2 Advance diffractometer (Bruker, PHASER) with Cu Ka radiation (l = 1.5418 A˚). Contact angles were measured with a KRUSS-The Drop Shape Analyzer DSA100 system using water as the wetting solvent. A Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorbance of perovskite films on the glass substrates. XPS, UPS, and LE-IPES characterization was carried out in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) ScientaOmicron multiprobe XPS/UPS system equipped with a home-built LE-IPES setup. Samples were mounted and transferred into the system with minimal exposure (< the 30s) to air. Two separate samples were used by cutting samples, one UPS and subsequent IPES analysis and one for XPS to prevent Xray or electron beam-induced degradation from impacting analysis. XPS utilized an Al Kα 1486.7 eV XM1000 X-ray source operating at a power of 390 W, with a Sphera II hemispherical analyzer equipped with a 7-channeletron detector. XPS scans were conducted with a 50 eV (15 eV) constant pass energy for the survey (high resolution) scans at an electron take-off angle of 0° (perpendicular to sample surface) with the sample surface in good electrical contact to the analyzer. The XPS/UPS electron analyzer work function was calibrated to an Ar+ sputter cleaned Ag foil's Ag 3d peak and Ef energy edge. UPS was acquired with a He vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) discharge lamp with a copper attenuation aperture to limit VUV intensity and surface charging. All scans were conducted with He1α (21.22 eV) excitation and a 5 eV constant pass energy at an electron take-off angle of 0°. The analysis region in both XPS and UPS is estimated to be 60μm in size. LE-IPES was conducted in the Bremsstrahlung isochromatic mode in the adjoining chamber consisting of a monoenergetic source (Staib) of 0.25 eV energy dispersion and drain current of 20-40 μA with a 2-3 mm sized spot, directed normal to the sample surface. The emitted IPES light was detected through a lens assembly (vacuum and airside), bandpass filter of 280 nm (4.43 eV), and solid-state photo-multiplier tube (PMT) (Hammatsu). Scans were conducted at a sample bias of +20V and 0 eV electron kinetic energy, and subsequent vacuum level calibration was done to the turn-on point in the drain current energy trace recorded simultaneously with the PMT signal. Spectra were interpreted without normalization to the drain current. Analysis of XPS was conducted in CASA XPS, where a Tougaard based background function was used for the inelastic background, and mixed Gaussian-Lorenzian (70:30) peaks were fitted. Analysis of UPS and IPES was made in origin fitting Gaussian functions to the VBM/CBM and linear extrapolation to identify the secondary electron cutoff (SECO). The 2D ligand concentration here followed the optimum concentration for the device's performance (0.5-1.0 mg/mL). 
 Device characterizations The J-V characteristics were investigated using a Keithley 2400 source unit under a light intensity of AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm -2 ) illumination with an Abet Technologies Sun 3000 solar simulator. The spectral mismatch was calibrated using a KG-5 filter-covered mono-silicon standard cell (Newport). All devices were measured for the reverse and forward scans with a scanning rate of 0.1 V s -1 . The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were obtained by passing the output of a 400 W Xenon lamp through a monochromator and filter under an N2 glove box. The calibration was performed with a 603621 Calibrated Silicon and Germanium Reference Detector. Next, the capacitance measurements were performed using an impedance spectrometer (potentiostat/galvanostat, Metrohm Autolab B.V.) with a sweeping frequency from 1 MHz to 1 Hz (10 mV AC voltage). The capacitance-voltage was monitored by varying the voltage from 0 to 1.2 V while keeping the frequency constant at 1 kHz. The transient photo-voltage (TPV), transient photo-current (TPC), and light-intensity dependent J-V measurements were performed using PAIOS 3.2(Fluxim) with white led under a maximum light intensity of 200 mW cm -2 . All measurements were done under an N2-filled glove box. 
 Computational method Density functional theory is used in the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (Vienna ab-initio simulation package;  (33)  projector augmented wave method; 500 eV plane wave cut-off). A 3 × 3 × 2 supercell of cubic α-FAPbI3 with space group Pm3m (for which a relaxed lattice constant of 6.52 Å is obtained in agreement with the literature(  34 ) is built and is augmented with a vacuum layer of 25 Å thickness in the [001] direction to achieve a slab model of the energetically favourable PbI2-terminated (001) surface. In agreement with the literature, the orientation of the FA molecules in the surface layer is found to change from horizontal to vertical.  (35)  The Brillouin zone is sampled on a Monkhorst-Pack 3 × 3 × 1 k-mesh, the total energy is converged to 10 -5 eV, and the maximum atomic force is converged to 0.001 eV Å -1 . 
 Device stability testing To measure the damp-heat test of the encapsulated devices, we kept the cells at constant temperature and humidity levels (85 °C/85% of RH) in the environmental test chamber (Weisstechnik as shown in figure  S14 ) for over 1,000 h. The encapsulated devices were measured periodically under an N2-filled glove box after around 30 min cooling of devices in ambient air. For the stability test, ~10 nm layer of tin(IV) oxide and an 80 nm layer of indium zinc oxide were deposited on top of the C60 sequentially, by atomic layer and sputtering depositions, respectively, to replace the BCP layer. Unless otherwise stated, a ~40 nm thick of nickel (II) oxide (using NiO target (Plasmaterials, 99.9%) and radiofrequency sputtering at room temperature in pure Ar atmosphere and base pressure of < 10 -6 Torr) with potassium chloride passivated for the champion damp-heat cells were used as holes transporting layers. The operational stability tests were carried out at the MPPT for the encapsulated devices under AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm -2 ) in ambient air at ~40 °C. The voltage at the MPPT was automatically applied, and the power output of the devices was tracked. 
 Encapsulation For our encapsulation, we use industry-compatible materials and processes. First, ribbons (Ulbrich Solar Technologies) are soldered to the electrodes of the devices to extend the connections. The device is encapsulated between two glasses and two layers of encapsulant films. We use edge sealant (PVS 101) to prevent moisture ingress from the sides of the device. The stack is vacuum laminated in an industrial laminator (Ecolam5 Ecoprogetti) at 120°C for 20 min. All processes were done in ambient air. It should be noted that the perovskite devices are stable during the encapsulation process.   . The slope of VOC versus the light intensity gives kT/q, where kB, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and the elementary charge, respectively. The larger the kT/q value, the greater the probability of trap-assisted recombination. The plot slope for the 2D passivation-based devices was lower (~1.29 kBT/q) than that of the control-based devices (~1.54 kBT/q), which indicates reduced trapassisted bimolecular recombination at 3D/C60 interfaces. Before the measurement, all devices were applied a bias voltage of 2 V to the electrodes by a source meter (Keithley 2400) for about a few minutes to induce the ion migration. All fresh devices have similar capacitance throughout a wide frequency range. However, after the stability test, the control device exhibits a significant increase of capacitance at low frequency (<1 kHz) which is almost one order of magnitude higher than that of the device with 2D perovskite passivation. It is known that the increase of capacitance at low frequency is due to the response of mobile ions in perovskites  (21) . Such a large increase of capacitance in the control device suggests the number of mobile ions within perovskites has been significantly increased, especially after stability stress. Contrastingly, the 2D passivated-based devices did not show any significant change before and after stability stress, suggesting the speculation that the ion dissociation and migration are effectively suppressed by stabilizing 3D perovskite surfaces through the 2D perovskite passivation approach. (D-F) Trap density of states (tDOS) deduced from C-f plots of each sample. Thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) was performed to elucidate the distribution of trap-states in the perovskite layers. It shows tDOS (denoted as N T) with respect to energetic defect levels from TAS, which were obtained from the relation: NT (Eω )=-(Vbi .dCω )/(qW kB T.dω), where C is the capacitance, ω is the angular frequency, q is the elementary charge, kB is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. It was reported that shallow traps were related to traps in grain boundaries, while deeper traps form primarily at the interfaces or surfaces. The trap density of the control 3D was 10 times higher than that for 2D passivated-based samples. Overall, the tDOS of 2D passivated-based devices has lower tDOS values in all regions (both shallow and deep traps levels), indicating sufficient defect passivation at 3D/C60 interfaces.   fig. S2B show two-dimensionalities of 2D layers in 2D-RT samples as the reduction of the density of C, Pb, and I elements, which correspond to n = 1 and n = 2 layers. In comparison, 2D-TA samples showed only n = 1 (fig. S2D). Further, profiling the position of 2D perovskites from TEM images confirmed the dimensionality of n = 2 and n = 1 by analyzing average distances between the two closest octahedral inorganic sheets. As a result, higher dimensionality (n = 2) had a wider distance (~1.5 nm) relative to n = 1 (~1.2 nm) (fig. S2, E to H).

Top-view SEM images of perovskite films with and without 2D perovskite passivation at various magnifications, (A) 25,000 and (B) 10,000 times. Over a large area of SEM images, the PbI2 species (higher contrast) are most likely at grain boundaries of control 3D perovskite films. These PbI2 species were disappeared after OLAI post-treatment (on both 2D-TA and -RT samples), confirming the effective conversion of PbI2 to 2D perovskite layer by post-treatment. The scale bar is 1 µm. (C) Atomic force microscopy images of perovskite films-based control, 2D-TA, and 2D-RT under the area of 20 µm × 20 µm. The 2D perovskite layers help reducing the surface roughness of 3D perovskite films by filling regions close to the grain boundaries, as indicated by reducing the RRMS values. 
 Fig. S7. (A) Water contact angles of control, 2D-TA, and 2D-RT samples. The improved water contact angles of perovskite films for 2D-RT (85.6±1.8°) and TA (71.2±2.1°) compared to control (51.4±2.7°) indicates the coverage of 2D perovskite coatings with long ligand molecules, thus dramatically enhancing the hydrophobicity of the films. The measurements were done with more than five samples with different spots on the films to see the adequate coverage of 2D perovskite layers. (B) After a few hours of contact angle measurements, the photograph of control and treated perovskite films from top and backside view. The higher hydrophobicity of the films shows the effectiveness of water droplets blocking into 3D perovskite underneath. Contrastingly, control films demonstrated a reverse reaction to form PbI2 species that confirms the control 3D perovskite films could not resist the water or humidity ingress.

The control 3D perovskite films were partially degraded, as indicated by reducing the emission intensity after thermal stress, following the XRD result. Contrastingly, 2D passivated-based films demonstrated more robust emission peak intensity with the same level of intensities at prominent peaks (~802 nm), indicates the effective approach of our 2D perovskite passivation strategy. In addition, the 2D perovskite emission at a shorter wavelength also showed no significant change, indicating a robust 2D perovskite itself, in accordance with the structural XRD patterns results.

O rganic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much interest thanks to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE)  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  , which has increased from 3.8% up to 23.7% in less than 10 years  6, 7  , facile processing methods  8, 9  and outstanding optoelectronic properties  [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]  . Many effective strategies have been implemented to improve the performance of PSCs, such as solvent engineering  [16] [17] [18]  , compositional engineering  19, 20  and alternative architecture design  [21] [22] [23]  . In particular, recent works  [24] [25] [26] [27]  show that minimizing the carrier recombination losses, both in the perovskite layer and at the interfaces between different layers, enables a PCE closer to the theoretical value  1  . 
 Articles One strategy for reducing carrier recombination losses is to minimize defects on polycrystalline perovskite films  5, 24, 26  . For instance, additional iodide ions can be introduced into the organic cation solution, which decrease the concentration of the deeplevel defects  5  . Another strategy is to engineer the device architecture employing mesoporous, planar or embedded structures to reduce the carrier losses during charge transport/extraction in PSCs  22, 28, 29  . Furthermore, the use of a bulk heterojunction active layer has been demonstrated to shorten the carrier transport distance in the perovskite films, thus reducing carrier losses  23, 30, 31  . Moreover, to decrease further the recombination losses and to improve the photoelectron collection, an inverted device architecture with a graded heterojunction structure has also been reported  32  . These results illustrate that improving the device architecture in heterojunction PSCs is a valid approach to decrease the carrier losses. While the heterojunction is constituted between the perovskite and electron/hole transport materials, the perovskite itself is also able to form a homojunction thanks to its unique self-doping property  [33] [34] [35] [36] [37]  , which would minimize the presence of impurities that can act as carrier recombination centres  38  . Within the perovskite homojunction, a built-in electric field is formed that could enhance the oriented transport of the photo-induced electrons/holes, thus decreasing further carrier recombination in the perovskite layer. Therefore, it is a promising route to further improve the performances of PSCs. Here, we fabricate a perovskite p-n homojunction structure, via a combined deposition processing method, which is then integrated into planar PSCs. The built-in electric field in the homojunction, identified by cross-sectional Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), induces the oriented transport of the photo-induced carriers, thus reducing the carrier recombination losses as further corroborated by wxAMPs simulations. Planar PSCs with a MAPbI 3 (MA, methylammonium) p-n homojunction exhibit a steady-state efficiency of 20.80%. Furthermore, an average PCE of 21.38% is achieved by utilizing a FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3 (FA, formamidinium) p-n homojunction, exceeding the previously reported efficiency for planar PSCs. 
 Fabrication of the planar homojunction PSC The proposed homojunction structure is composed of two perovskite layers with different doping, p-type and n-type perovskites, placed in junction with one another. A built-in electric field is therefore established at the p-n junction. Theoretical simulations and experimental evidence show that perovskites can be either p-type or n-type depending on the growth conditions and the ratio of the main precursors  [33] [34] [35] [36] [37]  . The MAPbI 3 films with Pb 2+rich/MA + -deficient/I --deficient precursors are n-doped and those with MA + -rich/Pb 2+ -deficient precursors are p-doped, due to the presence of the defects induced by vacancies or interstitial elements. Previously, we have demonstrated that self-doping in perovskites can be tuned serially by controlling the process conditions, such as annealing temperatures  39, 40  . Hence, it is feasible to fabricate a perovskite homojunction structure. We integrate the homojunction into PSCs based on the standard planar p-i-n  41, 42   structure are displayed in Fig.  1a, b . Figure  1c  presents a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a homojunction PSC, where a smooth and uniform n-type MAPbI 3 layer can be clearly observed. Meanwhile, the dense and small-grain p-type MAPbI 3 layer with a thickness of ~60 nm is deposited on the top of the ~480 nm n-type MAPbI 3 layer. To realize the perovskite homojunction structure, we propose a combined deposition method that combines a one-step spincoating method for the deposition of the bottom n-type perovskite layer on top of the TiO 2 compact layer and a vacuum vapour deposition followed by a dipping step for the deposition of the top p-type perovskite layer over the n-type perovskite layer. The one-step spin-coating method allows control of the morphology, coverage, roughness and grain size of the n-type perovskite film. By varying the stoichiometry of the PbI 2 /MAI precursor ratio (1, 1.05, 1.10 and 1.15, respectively), we are able to induce the n-type doping in the perovskite. The deposition of the top p-type perovskite layer of the homojunction should not degrade the bottom n-type perovskite layer. While spin-coating would dissolve the bottom layer, vacuum vapour deposition has been reported to avoid damage of the organic/inorganic thin films underneath while enabling highquality films  22, 43, 44  . We therefore choose this technique for depositing PbI 2 thin films on top of the n-type perovskite layer, followed by a dipping step in MAI/isopropanol solution to form MAPbI 3 . By adjusting the dipping time, we control the amount of MAI and thus the p-type doping. Finally, we choose the top p-type perovskite layer with a PbI 2 thickness of 60 nm followed by a dipping time of 60 s, whose precursor ratio is measured at ~0.91 (PbI 2 /MAI). The SEM images, X-ray diffraction patterns and high-resolution transmission electron microscope images (Supplementary Note 1) of perovskite layers are shown in Supplementary Figs.  1 2 3 , respectively. 
 Carrier generation and recombination in homojunction PSC Figure  2a  shows a schematic energy level diagram and the working principle of the homojunction PSC and how carriers are transported across the layers. As photons are absorbed by both the p-type and n-type perovskites, the photo-induced carriers are generated in two perovskite layers. Then, the electrons and holes at the homojunction drift in opposite directions. Finally, the electrons are injected into the compact TiO 2 layer, the electron transport layer (ETL), and transported to the FTO cathode whereas the holes are injected into the spiro-OMeTAD layer, the hole transport layer (HTL), and transported to the Au anode. In PSCs with the standard p-i-n structure, the carrier transport in the perovskite film has no preferred direction, which can lead to unwanted carrier recombination. The extraction of photo-induced electrons and holes mostly occurs at the perovskite/ETL and the perovskite/HTL interfaces, respectively  27  . Hence, we design the homojunction structure to provide an extra built-in electric field in the perovskite film, in which electrons and holes move in opposite directions towards the ETL and the HTL, respectively, as shown in Fig.  2b , with a view to reducing carrier recombination. To verify the reduction in carrier recombination losses, carrier generation and recombination in PSCs is simulated with wxAMPS, which has been used to simulate thin-film solar cells  39, 45, 46  . The simulated structures for these two PSCs are shown in Supplementary Fig.  4a . In Fig.  2c , under short-circuit conditions, the rates of carrier generation are similar for both devices whereas the carrier recombination rate for PSCs with the homojunction is dramatically reduced near the p-type/n-type perovskite interface. We suggest that this is due to the electric field (Supplementary Fig.  4b ) induced by the homojunction that favours the oriented transport of electrons and holes. As a result of the influence of the homojunction, the concentration of the free holes increases in the p-type perovskite region away from the interface, whereas the concentration of the electrons decreases (Supplementary Fig.  4c, d ), providing evidence for carrier oriented transport. Besides, the simulated photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) curve (Supplementary Fig.  5  and Supplementary Note 2) in the homojunction PSC shows an obvious enhancement in open-circuit voltage (V OC ). 
 Optoelectronic properties of the perovskite homojunction To detect the doping property of as-prepared perovskite films, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) is carried out on perovskite films with various contents of PbI 2 in precursor solution. The valence spectra and the schematic energy level of the perovskite films are shown in Fig.  3a, b . The energy difference between the valence band and the Fermi level (E F ) is 0.50 eV for the top p-type perovskite film with a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 0.91, which confirms the p-type doping due to the perovskite's bandgap of 1.55 eV. For the perovskite films containing excess PbI 2 , the E F is shifted close to the conduction band, with the increase in PbI 2 content in the precursor solution. This illustrates that the doping of the perovskite can be tuned from p-type to n-type by changing the PbI 2 content in the precursor solution. The full XPS spectra of the MAPbI 3 films are shown in Supplementary Fig.  6 . The position of the XPS peaks, especially for I and Pb, does not vary across the samples, thus indicating that the changes in the valence spectra are due to the perovskite materials, not measurement errors. The doping of the films is also characterized by Hall effect measurements. As shown in Fig.  3c  and Supplementary Table  1 , the carrier transport type converts from p-type to heavily n-type with increasing molar ratios of PbI 2 . In addition, KPFM, which is employed to characterize the surface potentials, also confirms the results presented above. Figure  3d, e  shows KPFM potential images of the p-type perovskite films with a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 0.91 and the n-type perovskite with a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 1.15 (other ratios are reported in Supplementary Fig.  7 ), respectively, whereas the insets show the atomic force microscope (AFM) topographic images. It can be seen from Fig.  3d  that the surface potential of the p-type perovskite film is lower than that of the n-type perovskite film (Fig.  3e ), because of accumulated holes that lead the Fermi level to be located close to the valence band  39  . Contrarily, the higher surface potential of the n-type perovskite film shown in Fig.  3e  correlates with the n-type doping of the sample, which is consistent with the XPS and Hall results. To get a quantitative comparison, the profiles of the surface potentials of the films are compared in Fig.  3f . The surface potential on the n-type perovskite film is approximately 0.1 V whereas that of the p-type perovskite film is about -0.3 V. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and the steady PL measurements are performed for the single n-type perovskite film (PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 1.15) and the perovskite homojunction film (n-type layer with a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 1.15 and p-type layer with PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 0.91). As shown in Fig.  3g , TRPL decay of perovskite films showed a bi-exponential decay with a fast and a slow component. The bimolecular recombination rate, a, and the decay lifetime, τ, are estimated by fitting the decay curves with the expressions I = I 0 (1 + at) -2 and I = I 0 × exp(-(t/τ) β ), respectively, and reported in the inset table of Fig.  3g . Previous studies of carrier recombination in perovskite films suggest that the fast decay process is caused by bimolecular recombination of photo-generated free carriers, whereas the slow decay process is attributed mainly to trap-assisted recombination  26, 39  . Here, the perovskite homojunction film possesses a higher bimolecular recombination rate (a = 2.9 × 10 8 s -1 ) and a shorter fast decay lifetime (τ 1 = 6.3 ns) than the n-type perovskite film while the slow decay lifetime (τ 2 ) is  similar in the two samples. This indicates that efficient carrier transfer occurs between the two type perovskite layers in the homojunction without introducing more traps in the homojunction, possibly because of the built-in field at the p-n junction. PL spectra of these two films are consistent with the results of TRPL. As shown in Fig.  3h , the intensity of PL for the perovskite homojunction film is quenched by over 80% relative to that of the single n-type perovskite film, proving the efficient oriented transport of carriers between the n-type and p-type perovskite layers of the homojunction induced by the built-in potential, which can potentially enable higher performances in PSCs. 
 Evidence for the perovskite p-n homojunction formation To further verify the formation of the p-n junction between the two perovskite layers, KPFM measurements have been performed on the cross-section of the homojunction structure under dark conditions, which can be used to study the electrical potential distribution across the internal interfaces in solar cells  37, [47] [48] [49]  . A schematic of the KPFM measurement principle is shown in Supplementary Fig.  8 . We fabricate the homojunction device based on FTO/n-type perovskite/p-type perovskite/Au and we cleave it to expose the cross-section without applying any treatments (for example, polishing or ion milling) to avoid complications and artefacts. Moreover, to exclude the influence of surface charges (defects) created on the cleaved cross-sectional surface, we employ a method for measuring the potential changes based on a series of bias voltages (V b ) that are sufficiently small (from the -1.0 V to + 0.5 V)  48, 49  . We can obtain the obvious potential change caused by the transport and extraction of carriers at the junction, because the configuration of surface charges trapped at defects would not change significantly with such a small V b (ref.  48  ). Figure  4a ,b shows the AFM topography of the homojunction device and the corresponding KPFM potential image at V b = 0, respectively. As shown in the potential profile in Fig.  4c , a potential drop is observed at the interface of the n-type/p-type perovskite layers caused by the carrier transport at the interface. This demonstrates the existence of a built-in electric field and thus the existence of the p-n junction. Besides, the dark and photoelectric J-V curves of homojunction devices show the typical rectifying characteristic of the p-n junction (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). Remarkably, this simple homojunction device composed of two perovskite layers and relative electrodes but without an HTL and an ETL exhibits a PCE of up to 8.08%, corroborating the presence of the p-n junction. To obtain accurate information about the bulk property by cross-sectional potential measurements, we measured the potential changes on the same area induced by applying various V b (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). The averaged line profiles of the potential under different V b are shown in Fig.  4d . We subtract the V b = 0 potential profile from the -1.0 V (reverse) up to the + 0.5 V (forward) potential profiles, calculate the potential difference curves at the various V b (Fig.  4e ) and then take the first derivative of the curves to obtain electrical field differences (Fig.  4f ). In Fig.  4d , we note that the potential in the FTO changes slightly with the different V b , even though the FTO is grounded. One reason could be the non-negligible resistance of FTO (~16 Ω sq -1 ) and the contact resistance (~2 Ω ), which act as series resistors with a voltage drop across them. Hence, the actual voltage applied on the homojunction is not the entire V b . Another reason is that cleaving the sample cross-section would create shunts and decrease the shunt resistance, so the current under V b is larger than that of a non-cleaved device under the same bias voltage  48, 49  . In addition, we also check for possible topographic effects. The topography of the cross-section is not very smooth because of the restriction of the sample preparation without further treatment. We choose two line-scan potential profiles whose locations are across large particles in topography maps (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). Although the topographic height changes significantly, the potential along the two lines appears to have an almost identical distribution, therefore suggesting minimal crosstalk between the topography and KPFM potential measurements (Supplementary Note 3). From the potential and field difference curves (Fig.  4e ,f, respectively), the significant potential drops and the electric field enhancement are observed across the n-type/p-type perovskite interface. Moreover, the position of maximum electric field corresponds to the n-type/p-type perovskite boundary, indicating a junction at the interface. Due to the p-n junction characteristic, the potential change trends at the junction area are different under the forward and reverse V b , and the electric field directions are also opposite under the forward and reverse V b . Besides, we use the same method to measure the control device (FTO/TiO 2 /undoped perovskite/ spiro-OMeTAD/Au) (Supplementary Figs.  11  and 12 ). We observe a potential drop and a rise at the TiO 2 /perovskite and the perovskite/ spiro-OMeTAD interfaces, respectively, at V b = 0. Under different bias voltages, two major electric fields are located across the two interfaces, which demonstrates that the control device works as a p-i-n junction as opposed to a homojunction device. 
 The homojunction-enhanced solar cell performance To check the effects of the homojunction on the performance of PSCs, MAPbI 3 -based and FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3 -based perovskite layers are chosen for fabricating planar PSCs. The performances of PSCs with and without the homojunction are presented in Fig.  5 . First, we fabricate the MAPbI 3 homojunction PSCs. The top p-type perovskite layer is fabricated with a PbI 2 thickness of 60 nm followed by a dipping time of 60 s (that corresponds to a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of ~0.91) and the n-type perovskite layer (480 nm) is fabricated with a PbI 2 /MAI ratio of 1.10. The performance-optimized results with the PbI 2 thickness for the top p-type perovskite and the self-doping concentration for the bottom n-type perovskite can be found in Supplementary Fig.  13 . The perovskite layer in MAPbI 3 standard p-i-n PSCs is deposited by solution processing to a thickness of about 540 nm, similarly to that of the homojunction film as shown in Supplementary Fig.  1i, j . As shown in Fig.  5a , the performances of the champion MAPbI 3 PSCs with and without the homojunction are compared. The homojunction PSC exhibits a better performance than the standard p-i-n PSC with an increase in the PCE from 17.76% to 20.80%. Among the photovoltaic parameters, the short-circuit current density (J SC ) shows the greatest improvement, increasing from 22.54 mA cm -2 to 23.86 mA cm -2 . To understand the reason behind the J SC increase, we measure the absorbance spectra of these perovskite films and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the corresponding PSCs. The absorption curves of these two perovskite films are similar, which indicates that the perovskite homojunction does not induce additional absorption (Supplementary Fig.  14a ). The EQE spectra and the corresponding integrated J sc estimated for the MAPbI 3 PSCs with and without the homojunction are shown in Supplementary Fig.  14b . The EQE of the homojunction PSC is higher than the standard p-i-n PSC, especially at long wavelengths (from 500 nm to 800 nm). The homojunction probably suppresses the carrier recombination. The integrated J SC matches well with the measured J SC . Hence, the notable increase in J SC , V OC and fill factor (FF) of the homojunction PSC is mainly attributed to the effective oriented transport of photo-generated carriers induced by the built-in field of the homojunction, which minimizes the loss in the photovoltaic performance. A 20.5% efficiency for the MAPbI 3 homojunction PSCs is certified by the National Institute of Metrology in China (Supplementary Fig.  15 ). Besides, the stabilized electric power output and the photocurrent density at the maximum power point are measured over a period of 200 s and shown in Fig.  5b . By holding a bias near the maximum power output point (+ 0.95 V), we obtained a stabilized PSC of ~20.6%, which is similar to the non-stabilized PCE of 20.80% measured for the same cell. As shown in Fig.  5c , the homojunction greatly improves the performance and reproducibility compared to the standard structure (other parameters are reported in Supplementary Fig.  16 ). The average PCE for 45 standard p-i-n PSCs is 15.92% with a J sc of 22.27 mA cm -2 , V oc of 1.06 V and FF of 67.20%. For the 45 homojunction PSCs, the average PCE reaches up to 19.95% with an average J sc of 23.43 mA cm -2 , V oc of 1.12 V and FF of 76.09%. Hysteresis has frequently been observed in PSCs, so its assessment is important to evaluate the performance of PSCs accurately. We perform serial forward/reverse scanned J-V measurements on one of the most efficient MAPbI 3 homojunction PSCs to examine the influence of the biasing history. We observe little difference between the J-V curves measured under reverse and forward scans (Supplementary Fig.  17 ), which indicates that the doping of the perovskite for the homojunction within the stoichiometry explored in this work does not lead to significant hysteresis. We obtained a mean PCE of 20.1% from 8 measurements (Supplementary Table  2 ), based on the averaged values of the reverse and forward scanned J-V curves with the MAPbI 3 homojunction PSC. The discrepancy in the PCEs derived from the two scanned direction curves (that is, reverse and forward) is only 0.7%, revealing that the homojunction PSCs have small hysteresis.   V b = 0 V b = +0.25 V V b = +0.5 V V b = -0.5 V V b = -1.0 V V b = +0.25 V V b = +0.5 V V b = -0.5 V V b = -1.0 V V b = +0.25 V V b = +0.5 V V b = -0. 
 Stability of the homojunction films and solar cells To study the stability of the homojunction, transmission electron microscope (TEM) studies are carried out to investigate the possible ion diffusion issue in the grain boundaries between the p-type and n-type perovskite layers. The whole PSC is cross-sectioned by means of a focused ion beam (FIB). Figure  6a -d shows the cross-sectional PSCs of the standard p-i-n structure and the homojunction structure, respectively. The interface between the p-type and n-type perovskite layers is clearly visible as a neat boundary. To verify the stability of the homojunction, we store the homojunction PSC without encapsulation in ambient air under dark conditions for 160 h. In Fig.  6e ,f, the interface between the p-type and n-type perovskite layers is still clearly visible after 160 h of storage compared with the fresh condition. Moreover, we mark the p-type perovskite layer with bromide and employ TEM with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis to inspect the ion migration in the homojunction (Supplementary Fig.  20 ). We note that little or no ion migration between the two types of perovskite layer after the PSC was measured under AM1.5 illumination and stored for 160 h. Therefore, the results suggest that the homojunction with self-doped perovskite layers is a stable structure under the conditions investigated. The long-term stability of PSCs is studied to evaluate the effects of the homojunction. We examine the performance of unencapsulated PSCs stored in ambient air (25 °C and 40 ± 10% relative humidity) under dark conditions for 792 h. As shown in Fig.  6g , the evolution of the PCE over time reveals a similar trend for PSCs with and without the homojunction. The result shows that the PCE of a MAPbI 3 homojunction PSC decreased from 20.27% to 19.56%, which maintained 96% of the initial PCE after 792 h, whereas the PCE of a MAPbI 3 standard p-i-n PSC maintained 94% of the initial PCE (from 17.39% to 16.29%). This indicates that the homojunction PSCs are relatively stable even in the presence of moisture and oxygen, which are known to be critical factors in perovskite degradation. The FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3 homojunction PSC shows a marginal decrease in PCE, from 21.23% to 20.66%, after 792 h, thus retaining 97% of the initial PCE (other parameters shown in Supplementary Fig.  21 ). Hence, it is clear that the as-fabricated PSCs with the homojunction possess excellent long-term stability, which can be ascribed to the fact that the large grains of the n-type perovskite layer and the film compactness of the p-type perovskite layer can minimize the negative impact of oxygen and moisture. 
 Conclusions In summary, we have demonstrated a perovskite homojunction structure to enhance the performance of planar PSCs using a p-type perovskite/n-type perovskite bilayer fabricated by a combined deposition method. The formation of the p-n junction in the homojunction structure has been verified by cross-sectional KPFM measurements under a series of bias voltages. The planar homojunction PCSs show an enhanced PCE with respect to standard p-i-n PSCs as a consequence of oriented charge transport and reduced carrier recombination. A certified efficiency exceeding 20% is achieved in the MAPbI 3 homojunction PSCs. Furthermore, FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3 homojunctions are investigated and integrated into PSCs, enabling efficiencies of up to 21.38%. This work demonstrates that the perovskite homojunction is a valid alternative approach to the p-i-n traditional heterojunction PSCs for fabricating highly efficient PSCs. 
 Methods Preparation of the perovskite homojunction. The perovskite homojunction is formed by n-type and p-type perovskite layers. To fabricate the n-type perovskite layer, a one-step spin-coating method was used as in previous published papers  39, 40  . To prepare the perovskite precursor solution, 159 mg MAI (Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp.), and 462 mg 1.0 M, 485 mg 1.05 M, 508 mg 1.1 M and 531 mg 1.15 M PbI 2 were mixed in anhydrous dimethylformamide/ dimethylsulphoxide (600 mg/78 mg) solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%), which was stirred at room temperature in a glove box. It was spin-coated directly on FTO/ compact TiO 2 substrate at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. During the spin-coating step, 0.5 ml of diethyl ether was poured on the surface at 25 s before the end. The light-yellow transparent films were converted into brownish-red perovskite films by heating at 130 °C for 5 min. From this process, n-type perovskite films with various doping concentrations were obtained with PbI 2 /MAI ratios of 1, 1.05, 1.10 and 1.15. For depositing the p-type perovskite film on the n-type film, a new formation method combining evaporating and dipping processes was developed. PbI 2 films with thicknesses of 10 nm, 20 nm, 40 nm, 60 nm and 80 nm were evaporated directly on the surface of n-type perovskite films, respectively. Then, these films were dipped in 40 mg ml -1 MAI/isopropanol solution. After rinsing with isopropanol (Sigma-Aldrich), the prepared films were heated at 100 °C. We chose a PbI 2 thickness of 60 nm followed by a dipping time of 60 s, whose precursor ratio is measured at ~0.91 (PbI 2 /MAI). Then the perovskite homojunction formed by n-type and p-type perovskite films was obtained through the above process. PSC fabrication. FTO glass substrates were cleaned by dust-free paper first, and then washed with deionized water, ethanol and acetone twice. Then the FTO substrates were dried by blowing with high-purity nitrogen.

Further improvement in the device efficiency is limited by the recombination of the charge carriers in the perovskite layer even when employing heterojunction-based architectures. Here, we propose and demonstrate a p-type perovskite/n-type perovskite homojunction whose built-in electric field promotes oriented transport of the photo-induced carriers, thus reducing carrier recombination losses. By controlling the stoichiometry of the perovskite precursors, we are able to induce n-type or p-type doping. We integrate the homojunction structure in a planar PSC combining a thermally evaporated p-type perovskite layer on a solution-processed n-type perovskite layer. The PSC with a MAPbI 3 homojunction achieves a PCE of 20.80% (20.5% certified PCE), whereas the PSC based on a FA 0.15 MA 0.85 PbI 3 homojunction delivers a PCE of 21.38%. We demonstrate that the homojunction structure is an effective approach, beyond existing planar heterojunction PSCs, to achieve highly efficient PSCs with reduced carrier recombination losses.

Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells
The carrier transport through the silicon-oxide (SiO x ) layer in tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) c-Si solar cells has been studied experimentally and by simulation. The current intensity versus voltage (J-V) characteristics of GaIn/n-c-Si/SiO x /n + -poly-Si/Al structures shows a linear Ohmic characteristic, while a non-Ohmic behavior is observed in the samples without the n + -poly-Si contact layer. Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy (c-AFM) images reveal some current spikes on the surface of the samples, which could be related to the transport through pinholes. The simulation results show that 1) a rectification characteristic is obtained when only the tunneling mechanism is included, 2) both the reverse saturation current and the forward current increase when a small amount of transport through pinholes is introduced, and 3) finally a linear Ohmic behavior is observed when the pinhole transport component reaches a certain level. Furthermore, the simulation for whole TOPCon solar cells provides some useful results. For very thin SiO x (< 1.2 nm), the tunneling provides sufficient high tunneling probability and high efficiency TOPCon solar cells can be obtained without transport through pinholes if the passivation is ensured; while for a relatively thick SiO x (> 1.2 nm) without the transport through pinholes, the TOPCon solar cell shows a poor fill factor (FF) with a high series resistance (Rs) because the tunneling does not provide a sufficient high transport channel for carrier transport, and the introduction of a small number of transports through pinholes improves the FF and reduces the Rs, hence improves the PCE. However, a high possibility for carrier going through pinholes reduces all of the performance parameters and degrades PCE for all the cases simulated. Therefore, an optimized pinhole density and size distribution is critical engineering for solar cell performance optimization. However, the establishment of an optimized method to precisely control the pinhole formation and characterization is still on the way.
Introduction Crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar panels have been dominating the photovoltaic (PV) market since the PV technology become a viable renewable energy source because of the well-developed manufacturing technology with low manufacturing cost, abundant environmentally friendly raw materials, and high-level market acceptance. With the manufacturing technology improvements, the solar cell efficiency has been increased steadily in recent years, especially with some new cell structures introduced to replace the conventional p-type polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) solar cells with an aluminum back surface field (ABF). Among them, the passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) solar cells have been developed and established a 25.0% world record efficiency in the 90's  [1, 2] . The PERC technology has been widely incorporated into large volume PV module productions in the PV manufacturing mainstream. Silicon Heterojunction solar cell with Intrinsic amorphous silicon (α-Si:H) Thin-layers (HIT) was also introduced in the 90's and has been proven to be a high efficiency (25.1%) solar cell structure with high open-circuit voltage (V oc ) up to 750 mV  [3] [4] [5] . The combination of the HIT with the Inter-digitized Back Contact (IBC) has resulted in a new world record efficiency of 26.7%  [6, 7] . In recent years, the HIT technology has been transferred from laboratory to manufacturing in several companies. Because of the effective α-Si:H passivation, HIT solar cells have shown several advantages over PERC solar cells such as high V oc , low temperature coefficient, and low manufacturing temperature. However, the manufacturing cost of HIT solar modules is still higher than that of PERC modules because of the low compatibility with the traditional silicon PV manufacturing process and the requirement for unique materials such as low temperature silver paste. To take the HIT advantages in the surface passivation and overcome the manufacturing non-compatibility issue at the same time, a new cell structure with a thin silicon oxide (SiO x ) surface-passivating layer and a doped poly-Si carrier collection contact was proposed. This new structure is named as TOPCon solar cell by taking the abbreviation of Tunnel Oxide Passivating Contact with the assumption of carrier transport through the ultrathin SiO x (< 2.0 nm) by quantum tunneling  [8] [9] [10] . The efficiency of TOPCon solar cell has been improved rapidly, and a 25.8% efficiency has been obtained without the IBC contact  [11] , which is higher than the 25.1% achieved by the HIT structure without the IBC contact  [5] . Although the TOPCon cell efficiency has been improved quickly, some fundamental device physics has not been fully understood yet. An example is the carrier transport in the TOPCon structure. It is well known that SiO 2 is a perfect insulator and has been widely used as the insulating dielectric layer in Thin Film Transistors (TFT) in displays  [12, 13] . It is also an excellent surface passivation layer on c-Si for solar cell application. However, in TOPCon solar cells, photo-generated carriers have to transport through the insulating SiO x layer, and the transport mechanism is logically assumed to be tunneling. On the other hand, because the SiO x is very thin and pinholes could easily form during the SiO x fabrication and/or thermal treatment. Therefore, one has proposed that the carrier transport could be through the pinholes in the SiO x layer  [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Experimentally, pinholes or weak SiO x areas are indeed observed by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM)  [15]  and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on the surface of TOPCon structure with etching back of the doped poly-Si layer  [16, 17] . Also, current spikes were observed by conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM)  [14] , which could be considered as the evidence of carrier transport through pinholes. These experimental results confirmed the existence of pinholes in the SiO x passivation layer and carriers could pass through the pinholes in principle. Recently, a temperature dependence dark current density versus voltage (J-V) study by Feldmann et al.  [18]  suggested that although transport through pinholes exists, the dominant transport is still going through tunneling. Then, the remaining question is how the carrier transport through pinholes affects the cell performance. In a simple word, are pinholes beneficial or harmful for TOPCon solar cell performance? The objective of this paper is to experimentally identify the existence of pinholes in the SiO x layer used in high-efficiency TOPCon solar cells and to study the carrier transport mechanisms in the SiO x layer. In addition, we use a simulation to study the property of transport through pinholes and its effect on the cell performance. The dark J-V and c-AFM measurements confirmed that a portion of carrier transports is through pinholes; the simulation results showed that a proper amount of carrier transport through the pinhole benefits for the TOPCon solar cell performance for the SiO x of and thicker than 1.0 nm, while too much carrier transport through pinholes degrades the cell performance by a noticeable reduction in all of the performance parameters. 
 Experimental details and simulation The samples for the dark current-voltage (I-V) measurements were made on commercially available 0.2-2 Ω cm 170-μm n-type Cz c-Si wafers. The sample preparation involved surface damage removal with 25% tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) solution at 85 °C, followed by RCA chemical cleaning and SiO x tunnel silicon oxide (SiO x ) growth in 68 wt% HNO 3 acid at 110 °C for 15 min. The resulting tunnel SiO x thickness was ~1.4 nm, determined by spectral ellipsometry. Next, a 40 nm thick phosphorus-doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (n + -α-Si:H) layer was deposited on one side using a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposited (PECVD), followed by an 820 °C annealing for 30 min in an inert atmosphere to facilitate crystallization and dopant activation to turn the n + -α-Si:H into n + -poly-Si. After annealing, the front side metal contacts was realized by thermally evaporated Al dots through a shadow mask with various circular openings for different electrode areas and the back electrode was covered by GaIn to form an Ohmic contact with the n-type c-Si wafer. The sample structures were GaIn/n-c-Si/SiO x /n + -poly-Si/Al and GaIn/n + -c-Si/SiO x /Al, as described in Fig.  1 (a), (b). Similarly, the samples for the minority carrier lifetime (τ) measurements were made with the same SiO x and n + -poly-Si fabrication process on both sides of the wafers but without the metal contact as shown in Fig.  1(c ). The dark I-V characteristics were measured by a Keithley-4200 multi-function meter at the room temperature. The lifetime of the samples with different passivation layers were measured using a Sinton (WCT-120) system and the single-side reverse saturated recombination current density (J 0 ) and implied open-circuit voltage (iV oc ) were extracted from the measured photoconductive decays. The crystalline structure of the n + -poly-Si layer was measured using a Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia-reflex) with 325 nm excitation laser to ensure the laser only probes the coating layer and the influence from the substrate c-Si wafer is minimized. The active phosphorus profile in the TOPCon structure was determined using an electrochemical capacitance-voltage (ECV) system (Buchanan, CVP21). The TOPCon solar cells fabricated within this study have a designated area of 2 cm × 2 cm and are made of 0.2-2 Ω cm 170-μm n-type Cz c-Si wafers. The solar cell structure is shown in Fig.  1(d) . The front side of the solar cells features an alkaline textured (random-pyramids) surface with a boron-doped p + emitter (80 Ω/□). Next, the ∼ 1.4 nm tunnel oxide and the 40 nm n + poly-Si layers were grown on the rear side according to the process described above. Then a thin Al 2 O 3 was deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and a capped SiN x :H film was deposited by PECVD for front surface passivation and anti-reflection coating. The rear-side full-area electrode was fabricated by thermally evaporated Ag; the front-side grids were realized by lithography technology cooperating with an e-beam evaporated Cr/Pd/Ag seed layer and then thickened by electroplating. The solar cell performance was characterized by one-sun light J-V measurements under a Class AAA solar simulator (Oriel, Sol3A) under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW/cm 2 ) at 25 °C. C-AFM imaging  [19] [20] [21]  was based on the contact mode of AFM (Veeco D5000 and NSV controller) setup in an Ar glove box to prevent oxidation of the Si samples under a bias voltage during the imaging. The Si probe coated with Ti/Pt (Asylum Research AC240TM) was pressed onto the sample surface in a moderate force (~50 nN), and the current was measured using a low noise sensor in a current range of 1 pA-100 nA. The sample was biased in Vs = 0.5 V, and the probe was virtually grounded. The contact mode AFM and current images were simultaneously obtained. We used the AFORS-HET V2.5 simulation program to perform the numerical simulation  [22, 23]  of the transport properties of the designed devices as shown in Fig.  1 (a) and the light J-V curve of the TOPCon solar cells as shown in Fig.  1(d) . The structures and the parameters of the transport model and the TOPCon solar cell are presented in Table  1 (a) and (b), respectively. The optical absorption is described by the multiple reflections and coherence model. The carrier transport through the SiO x layer is described by the thermionic-emission/thermionic-field model and the quantum tunneling model. The default parameters of the electrical and optical layers are generally referred to the published work  [8, 9] . The definition of the pinhole is demonstrated as follows. The pinhole of SiO x is the micro hole through the ultrathin SiO x in essence, which is caused by the impurity diffusion or by the high-temperature annealing  [14, 15] . A proportion of bulk carriers will leak through the oxide because of pinholes. Mathematically, the pinhole density can be considered as the proportion of the carriers that leak through the oxide layer, which turns the 2D physics issue into the 1D mathematics manipulation. where t is the thickness, SRV the surface recombination velocity, N a and N d the acceptor concentration and donor concentration, τ the lifetime, Chi the electron affinity energy, E g the band gap, dk the relative dielectric constant, m e and m h the relative effective mass of electron and hole, D ph pinhole density through the insulator layer (dimensionless unit) as described above, and w/o means without. 
 Results and discussion We first checked the passivation quality of our TOPCon structure. Fig.  2 (a), (b) plot an example of photoconductive decay and lifetime distribution as a function of injection intensity of our optimized doubleside TOPCon passivated sample, from which τ = 1.24 μs (at n = 1 × 10 15 cm -3 ), J 0 = 6 fA/cm 2 and iV oc = 731 mV were obtained, indicating a high quality of surface passivation. Fig.  2(c)  and (d)  show the Raman spectra and the P doping profile, respectively. The Raman spectra show that the n-a-Si:H is in a pure amorphous phase without detectable crystalline features, it is fully crystallized with very little amorphous component remaining after the high temperature (820 °C) annealing. The ECV profile reveals that the P doping concentration in the n + -poly-Si is about 4 × 10 20 cm -3 and a tail extends into the n-c-Si wafer as normally observed in TOPCon structures  [24] . From the analyses, we conclude that the TOPCon structure studied here could be a good rear side contact for high efficiency solar cell. Because the passivation is of high quality, the characterization results from this structure are meaningful for device analysis and optimization. We have systematically optimized our TOPCon solar cell design and fabrication processes and improved the cell efficiency to over 21%. Fig.  3  shows the light J-V and EQE curves of our best solar cell with an efficiency of 21.12%. The details of the solar cell optimization will be reported elsewhere. The primary purpose of showing the cell performance here is to demonstrate that the SiO x /n + -ploy-Si/Al TOPCon structure is indeed a device grade carrier-selective passivation junction and a reasonable good structure to study the carrier transport. We first take a simple approach to examine the carrier transport through the ultrathin SiO x layer in the TOPCon structure by dark J-V measurements. The two kinds of samples as described in the previous section were measured, where the GaIn layer forms a low resistance Ohmic contact with the n-type c-Si wafer. Thus, the J-V characteristics are dominated by the transport mechanism through the top contact formed by the n-c-Si/SiO x /n + -poly-Si/Al or n-Si/SiO x /Al, as shown in Fig.  1(a) . The carrier transport through such structures has been very well studied theoretically and experimentally because of the application of tunneling metal oxide semiconductor diodes (MOS or MIS)  [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . It has been shown that the J-V characteristic should have a diode behavior when the tunneling process through the SiO x layer can provide a high enough transport path and the current is limited by the junction in the semiconductor layer; but when the tunneling process current is smaller than the diode current at a higher positive bias and comes the limiting factor for the transport, the J-V curve would level off from the diode characteristic and become linear. However, if the carrier transport through pinholes is the main path, one would expect a linear behavior as if the pinholes are considered as micro-resistors. Therefore, by measuring the dark J-V characteristics of the structures mentioned above, one could find out if the tunneling is the only transport mechanism or additional transport paths exist. Accurately measuring the dark J-V is very tricky on the samples with high conductivity substrate and a special attention must be paid on We normalized the measured J-V with the electrode areas and obtained J-V curves and found that the curves do not coincide and large separations still exist even between the relatively large area electrodes, which indicates the current spreading has a large influence on the J-V characteristics. By comparing the slope of the I-V curves as shown in Fig.  4 (a), one can obtain the specific contact resistance or called contact resistivity from the plot of measured resistance versus the inverse of electrode area (1/S) as shown in Fig.  4(c ). For the sample used in Fig.  4 (a), the contact resistivity is 7.7 mΩ.cm 2 from the GaIn/n-c-Si/ SiOx/n + -poly-Si/Al sample, which is reasonably small and good enough for high efficiency TOPCon solar cells. Similarly the contact resistivity could be also obtained even if the I-V curves are not linear by taking the derivatives of the I-V curves at the low bias near zero. For the GaIn/n-c-Si/SiOx/Al sample, the contact resistivity is 771 mΩ cm 2 , which is larger than the sample with the n + -poly-Si contact layer. The most important observation is that a perfect linear Ohmic behavior is observed from the GaIn/n-c-Si/SiO x /n + -poly-Si/Al sample, but non-linear curves from the GaIn/n-c-Si/SiO x /Al sample. The results indicate that the carrier transport in the GaIn/n-c-Si/SiO x /n + -poly-Si/ Al structure is not a pure tunneling transport, while the J-V curve of the GaIn/n-c-Si/SiO x /Al looks like a mixture of a linear curve with a diode characteristic. The difference between the two samples is one with the n + -poly-Si contact layer and the other without the n + -poly-Si layer. We speculate that the nonlinear behavior from the GaIn/n-c-Si/SiO x /Al is caused by the band bending in the n-c-Si induced by the Al contact because of the different work functions, which normally forms a MOS diode. The imperfect of the diode characteristic in the sample without the n + -poly-Si layer is an indication of a second carrier path exists, and it could be through pinholes even without the n + -ploy-Si contact layer.  While the band bending occurs in the n + -poly-Si/Al interface in the sample with the n + -poly-Si layer, where Ohmic contact forms because the doping concentration in the n + -poly-Si is much higher than in the n-Si wafer. In addition, the diffusion of P through the SiO x into the c-Si wafer might also promote to form an Ohmic contact, which contributes to the difference between the samples with and without the n + -poly-Si layer. The key point is that the carrier transport through the ultrathin SiO x layer exhibits an Ohmic behavior, which confirms that the carrier transport through the ultrathin SiO x is not a simple tunneling process and additional paths such as through pinholes should be involved. To find out the additional transport channels through the insulating ultrathin SiO x layer, we did c-AFM measurements on the sample surface of c-Si/SiO x /n + -poly-Si without the Al contact. Fig.  5  shows an example of the c-AFM images. First, some current spikes are observed on the surface, which we believe the high current areas are the transport through the pinholes, or weak-insulating oxide areas where charge carriers can transport by hopping through defect state in the ultrathin SiO x layer, however, the weak-insulating areas are also referred ""pinhole"" through the paper. Second, the sizes of the pinholes are highly non-uniform, generally 2-10 nm in diameter. These measured pinhole sizes should be larger than the actual pinhole sizes because current routes through the pinholes spread out with a distance away from the pinholes in the n + -poly-Si layer. The measurements were taken with a small scan size of 120 nm by 120 nm to have a high resolution on the pinholes. Third, there are some non-uniformities from locations to locations on a sample, and therefore the statistics for estimation of the pinhole density is not very reliable, but a rough estimation gives the pinhole density in the order of 10 10 /cm 2 . Nevertheless, we may conclude that there are indeed some pinholes in the ultrathin SiO x in our TOPCon structure, which was used in real high-efficiency solar cells. We note that the surface morphology in this small scan area is relatively flat, with the roughness less than 2 nm and overall corrugation about 5 nm. This flat surface does not generate artifact of the current spikes as shown in the images that no correlation of the current and topography was observed. Although we have confirmed that quantum tunneling is not the only mechanism for carrier transport in the TOPCon solar cells and the transport through pinholes indeed exists, a remaining question is whether the transport through pinholes benefits for solar cell performance. If the pinholes are good for the solar cell performance, it needs to understand how much carrier transport through pinholes is the optimum for solar cell efficiency; but if the transport through pinholes is harmful to the cell performance, it is desired to figure out the tolerance level for the transport through pinholes. For this purpose, we did a systematic simulation study on the carrier transport in the TOPCon structure and the solar cell performance as a function of pinhole transport. Actually many simulation works have been reported in the literature  [23, 32, 33] . Steinkemper et al.  [32]  did a systematic simulation study of TOPCon solar performance as a function of various material and structure parameters such as the surface recombination speed and SiO 2 thickness with the assumption of the transport through tunneling only without considering the transport through pinholes. The contribution from Peibst et al.  [33]  considered the transport through pinholes, and studied the correlation between recombination saturation current J 0 and contact resistivity without the correlation to TOPCon solar cell performance. Here we are aiming the effluence of carrier transport through both tunneling and pinholes and study the correlation of TOPCon cell performance as a function of the degree of pinhole transport. First, we examine the case without any pinholes with the assumption of the pure tunneling transport. From the experimental results, we learned that TOPCon solar cell performance is affected by the SiO x properties such as fabrication process and layer thickness significantly, which agrees with the reported ones in the literature  [34] . Fig.  6  presents a set of simulation results for the carrier transport in the TOPCon structures as used for the J-V measurement in Fig.  4 (a), (b), where (a) and (b) are for the sample without the n + -poly-Si contact layer in the linear and semi-logarithmic, respectively; (c) and (d) are the same plots for the sample with the n + -ploy-Si contact layer. Noted that the simulation is one dimensional calculation and does not consider the lateral transport, and therefore no current spreading effect is included. For the sample without the n + -poly-Si layer, a set of diode characteristics is obtained for different SiO x thicknesses with the turn-on voltage increasing with the increase of the SiO x layer thickness. A perfect linear behavior in the low positive voltage in the semi-logarithmic plot indicates a perfect diode characteristic, and it levels off at high positive biases, indicating the tunneling cannot provide a high enough transport path and becomes the limiting factor for the current flow. This result agrees well with the analysis from Shewshun et al.  [26] ; the reverse saturated current density decreases significantly with the increase of the SiO x thickness; finally, for the case of no SiO x layer, an Ohmic  straight line is obtained. The situation for the sample with the n + -poly-Si contact layer shows three major differences from the results of no n +poly-Si contact layer sample. First, the forward current turns on at a much smaller voltage; second, the forward curves are no longer in a linear form in the semi-logarithmic plot, indicating an imperfect diode characteristic; third, the magnitude of the reverse saturated current density is significantly higher than from the sample without the n +poly-Si contact layer. The key points that we learned from the simulation results are that a non-linear rectification behavior is obtained when an ultrathin SiO x is inserted between the c-Si wafer and the back metal contact, and the transport property is sensitive to the thickness of the SiO x layer. As observed experimentally, a linear behavior forms in the TOPCon contact with the SiOx layer that produces a good solar cell performance (Fig.  4 ), and the transport through pinholes exists from the c-AFM measurements (Fig.  5 ), we simulated the transport properties in the TOPCon structure including the transport through pinholes. Fig.  7  plots the simulated dark J-V curves of two sample structures as shown in Fig.  6  with various possibilities of transport through pinholes, where the SiO x thickness is fixed at 1.4 nm which is consistent with the value used in our real TOPCon solar cells. The plots of Fig.  7(a), (b ) are for the sample without the n + -poly-Si contact layer, where the introduction of the transport through pinholes shifts the turn-on voltage to small values, increases the reverse saturated current, and keeps the similar shape of the curves as if the SiO x layer is reduced by the pinholes. In addition, a linear part in the negative bias appears as the pinhole current increase, and it extends to large voltage range to form a linear Ohmic characteristic when the transport possibility through pinholes reaches to 10 -2 . Similar to the case of different SiO x thicknesses, the J-V curves of the GaIn/n-c-Si/SiO x /n + -poly-Si/Al sample do not show the perfect diode characteristics; a small magnitude of pinhole transport increases both the forward and reverse currently noticeably (10 -7 ); the linear behavior appears with a much smaller possibility of transport through pinholes than in the GaIn/n-c-Si/SiO x /Al sample, as shown in Fig.  7(c), (d) . When the possibility of pinhole transport is larger than 10 -4 , all of the simulated curves come together, implying the transport is limited by the bulk of the c-Si instead of the junction. From the simulation results, we find that although the transport through pinholes is one of the transport channels, and a small amount of pinhole transport already affects the dark J-V characteristics significantly, the major transport is still through the quantum tunneling, which is consistent with the recent dark J-V measurements at different temperatures  [18] . We also simulated the double-side passivated sample structure with 1.4 nm SiOx. The J 0 and iVoc values with different transport probabilities through pinholes are listed in Table  2 , with the comparison of measured values. It shows that the transport through pinholes increases the J 0 and reduces the iVoc, which means it degrades the passivation quality. From the transport study, we learn that in addition to the tunneling, the transport through pinholes affects the J-V characteristics of the junction significantly. Therefore, it is logical to expect the transport through pinholes could affect the real TOPCon solar cell performance. For this purpose, we simulated the solar cell performance as a function of the possibility of carrier transport through pinholes.  ), when the solar cells are with a SiO x layer of equal to or less than 1 nm, the FF is not affected by transport through pinhole. In this case, the ultrathin SiO x layer provides high enough tunneling current to allow most of the photo-carrier passing through the SiO x layer freely. However, when the solar cells have a SiO x layer of more than 1.4 nm, the FF will be changed significantly by the transport through pinholes. For the solar cells with relatively thick SiOx (1.4 nm and 1.6 nm), the pure tunneling transport cannot provide enough transport channels, limits the current flow, and results in a high series resistance (Rs) and a poor FF. With the introduction of the transport through pinholes, the Rs decreases and FF increases, hence efficiency increases as well to reach the maximum at the pinhole transport probability around 10 -5 to10 -4 . In the high pinhole transport region (> 10 -3 ), increasing the pinhole transport further, all of the three performance parameters (V oc , J sc , FF) start to drop for all of the SiO x thicknesses and leads to a decrease of efficiency. The observations can be explained by the simulation results of the transport through the TOPCon contact as an example shown in Fig.  7  with 1.4 nm SiOx. With the pure tunneling transport, the non-linear J-V characteristic shows a high derivative resistance, corresponding to a high series resistance, therefore results in a poor FF. When pinholes are included, in addition to the transport through tunneling, the carriers can also pass the ultrathin SiO x in TOPCon junction through pinholes, which reduces the Rs, and therefore, improves the FF and efficiency until reaching the maximum. However, increasing the pinhole transport further equivalently adds a shunt path and reduces the carrier built up at the junction under the open circuit condition, therefore reduces the V oc . Furthermore, the exceeding pinholes could also reduce the passivation quality, increase the interface recombination, and degrade the cell performance in reality. From the simulation study, we learn that a proper amount pinholes in the ultrathin SiO x passivation layer are needed for highefficiency TOPCon solar cells with a thick enough SiO x such as 1.4 nm, which is essential for improving the FF, however, a low V oc in real solar cells could indicate too much transport through pinholes in addition to other causes such as a poor passivation. Experimentally, how to select a proper SiO x thickness and control the pinhole density with the compromising the effective passivation, which needs a minimum SiO x thickness, to reduce the interface defect state and control the P diffusion through the SiO x layer into the c-Si bulk is a kind of technical art, and a significant effort is needed for the optimization of the material properties and device structure. 
 Summary In summary, the dark J-V measurements show a linear Ohmic behavior of carrier transport in the high-quality TOPCon junction used in our high-efficiency solar cells, implies that a separated transport path exists in addition to the quantum tunneling. The c-AFM measurements reveal some high current spikes over the area of the TOPCon junction, which are reasonable to be assigned to the transport through pinholes. Therefore, we conclude that the transport through pinholes is one of the transport mechanisms in TOPCon solar cells. From the dark J-V simulation studies, we learn that 1) as expected, the pure tunneling transport in the TOPCon structure without pinhole results in a diode characteristic in the low bias, indicating the tunneling can provide enough transport in this low bias condition, and levels off from the diode characteristics due to the limited tunneling possibility, which is in consistent with the theoretical analysis  [26] ; 2) the SiO x thickness affects the transport significantly; 3) the introduction of transport through pinholes increases both the forward and reverse current largely and essentially changes the transport into a linear Ohmic behavior; 4) the insertion of the n + -poly-Si contact layer increases both the tunneling current and the current through pinholes, which leads to the transition from rectification to linear at a much lower possibility through pinholes than the case without the n + -poly-Si contact layer. Furthermore, from the simulation of TOPCon solar cell performance as a function of pinhole transport, we observed that for the solar cells with a relatively thin SiO x (≤ 1.0 nm), the cell performance is not affected by the transport through pinholes in the low pinhole transport probability (< 10 -3 ) regime, but declines at the high hole transport probability (< 10 -3 ) regime. With a relatively thick SiO x (≥ 1.0 nm), the TOPCon solar cell without pinhole transport shows a poor FF with a high Rs. The introduction of pinholes improves the FF by reducing the Rs, and hence improves the efficiency. In our case, the possibility of transport through pinholes in 10 -4 results in the highest efficiency. Increasing the transport through pinholes further leads to a reduction of all performance parameters and efficiency. In the real experiments, how to select the SiOx thickness and control the pinhole density and the amount of transport through pinholes is a great challenge for high-efficiency TOPCon solar cells.

 P erovskite solar cells have attracted great attention in recent years, as their efficiency has risen from 3.8% to 22.1% via film crystal growth control, interface and device engineering  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  . Up to now, TiO 2 mesoporous structures were commonly the most successful at delivering high efficiency and stable power output for perovskite solar cells  [1] [2] [3] [4]  . However, one disadvantage of the mesoporous structure is the high-temperature (>450 • C) sintering required for the TiO 2 mesoporous layer, which is a barrier to low cost and stretchable device fabrication  [1] [2] [3] [4]  . Further interest in perovskite solar cells developed after it was realized that lead halide perovskites have charge carrier diffusion lengths on the micrometre scale and possess ambipolar properties  6, 7  . Therefore, it is possible to remove the high-temperature sintered mesoporous layer to make a simple planar-structure solar cell, in which all of the layers can be processed at low temperature  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]  . Planar devices are typically divided into either n-i-p (regular) or p-i-n (inverted) structures, depending on the bottom transporting layer  12  . The p-i-n inverted planar structure usually shows negligible hysteresis when using fullerene as the top electron transport layer  12  . However, it exhibits lower efficiency due to inferior perovskite crystallinity and imperfect interfacial band alignment  11, 12  . For regular n-i-p planar structures using a TiO 2 condensed layer as the electron transport layer, the device could show high performance under reverse scan (V OC to J SC scan), whereas the forward I-V scan usually showed much lower efficiency (J SC to V OC scan)  4, 9  , which led to difficulty in obtaining a reliable power conversion efficiency  4, 9  . Further results indicated that charge accumulation induced by ion migration in the perovskite layer could be the main cause of hysteresis  [13] [14] [15]  . It was also found that the electronic contact between perovskite and electron transport layers (ETLs) could significantly affect the behaviour of the hysteresis  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20]  (generally, hole transport layers do not affect hysteresis, because the commonly used hole transport layer, Spiro-OMeTAD, can form good electronic contact with perovskite  6  ). When the electronic contact is imperfect, the charge accumulation will become worse and aggravate the hysteresis. However, if the electronic contact is perfect and the accumulated charges can be easily extracted, the hysteresis can be alleviated or fully eliminated  17, 20  . For example, either in the regular or the inverted planar structure, on introducing a fullerene layer with a strong electron extraction ability, the devices showed stable output with reduced hysteresis  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20]  . However, fullerene is expensive, as well as unstable for practical applications  12  . Inorganic metal oxides such as SnO 2 have a bandgap above 3.6 eV, and a deeper conduction band than TiO 2 . Thus, in principle they should facilitate more efficient electron transfer  21  . Furthermore, bulk SnO 2 has a mobility of up to 240 cm 2 /(V • s), which is 100 times that of TiO 2 , making it conceptually a more likely candidate for use in high-performance electronic devices  21  . Previously, SnO 2 has been used as an electron transport layer in organic solar cells or dye-sensitized solar cells  21, 22  . Recently, it was also used in perovskite solar cells in order to increase the efficiency and to reduce the hysteresis  [23] [24] [25] [26] [27]  . During the final preparation of this Article, ref. 28 was published, reporting planar perovskite solar cells with an average PCE around 18.5% and a mild hysteresis. Here, we develop a regular n-i-p planar structure of perovskite solar cells with solution-processed SnO 2 nanoparticles as the electron transport layer. The devices show a certified efficiency close to 20%, almost free of hysteresis. Given the SnO 2 layer's deep conduction band and high electron mobility, we ascribe the elimination of the I-V hysteresis to the enhanced electron extraction caused by the reduction of the energy barrier at the perovskite/ETL interface. Furthermore, an excess PbI 2 phase was introduced to passivate the traps in perovskite (FAPbI 3 ) 0.97 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.03 and deliver high device performance. 
 Characterization of nanoparticles and perovskite layer Transmission electron microscopy (Fig.  1a ) showed the SnO 2 particles we used are very uniform, with particle sizes around ARTICLES 3-4 nm. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy results (Fig.  1b ) indicated the SnO 2 nanoparticles are highly crystallized, which is good for reducing the number of defect traps in SnO 2 , and should also be beneficial for charge transfer when using it as a charge transport layer. Electron diffraction circles from the (110), (  101 ) and (  211 ) crystal planes of SnO 2 were observed (Fig.  1c ), indicating that the SnO 2 nanoparticles are polycrystalline. X-ray diffraction (Fig.  1d ) results further confirmed this conclusion. All X-ray diffraction peaks for SnO 2 (Fig.  1d ) are indexable to the tetragonal SnO 2 structure (space group P42/mnm, a = 0.4738 and c = 0.3187 nm), indicating the formation of pure SnO 2 crystals  29  . When spin coating SnO 2 nanoparticles solution onto glass/ITO substrate, it can form a dense, pinhole-free film (Fig.  1e ), and the film quality is much better than that of the conventionally used TiO 2 nanoparticles film (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). In addition, we found that the SnO 2 films formed showed good transparency, with transmission values greater than 95% in the visible region (Fig.  1f ), with minimized optical loss in the SnO 2 layer. NATURE ENERGY We have characterized the electronic states and band structures of SnO 2 and perovskite layers with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The Sn 3d core-level spectrum of SnO 2 nanoparticles is shown in Supplementary Fig.  2 . The peaks at binding energies of 486.9 eV and 495.3 eV correspond to Sn 3d 5/2 and Sn 3d 3/2 , respectively  30  . The Sn 3d peaks showed only one symmetric component without any shoulder, which indicates only a Sn 4+ chemical state in the SnO 2 nanoparticles. The O 1s X-ray photoelectron spectrum of SnO 2 exhibits a degree of asymmetry in its shape (Supplementary Fig.  2 ), where the peak with a lower binding energy (530.7 eV) corresponds to the O atoms of the SnO 2 crystal and the second peak (532.1 eV) can be attributed to the surface oxygen-group absorbance  30  . For comparison, the core-level spectra of TiO 2 have also been given (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), and are similar to SnO 2 (Supplementary Fig.  2 ), indicating no additional metal chemical states except for Ti  4+ (ref. 31) . The work function (W S ), valance band maximum (VBM) and bandgap (E g ) of the SnO 2 nanoparticles are 4.36 eV (Fig.  2a ), 3.74 eV (Fig.  2b ) and 3.79 eV (Supplementary Fig.  4 ), respectively. It can be calculated that the conduction band (E C ) of the SnO 2 nanoparticles is 4.31 eV, as obtained from E C = W S + VBM -E g based on the semiconductor band structure (Supplementary Fig.  5 ); this is much deeper than that of TiO 2 (3.77 eV, Fig.  2a, b  and Supplementary Figs  3  and 4 )  21  . One can also estimate that the conduction band of perovskite (FAPbI 3 ) x (MAPbBr 3 ) 1-x is 4.36 eV from Fig.  2  and Supplementary Figs  4  and 5 . In principle, the deeper conduction band of SnO 2 compared with TiO 2 could enhance charge transfer from perovskite to the electron transport layer (Supplementary Fig.  6 )  21  . The possible band alignment between (FAPbI 3 ) x (MAPbBr 3 ) 1-x and SnO 2 is shown in Fig.  2c . In addition to energy band alignment, the charge mobility of the electrons also For each material, the highest and the lowest energy levels are conduction band (E C ) and valence band (E V ), respectively. d, log(J)-log(V) plots for the SnO 2 and TiO 2 colloidal film using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model with device structure of ITO/Al/metal oxides/Al. Measurement data (circles), which were fitted by a line with a slope of 2 (blue), the intercepts of the fitted line on log(J) were used for the mobility calculation. affects the charge transfer. A low mobility of the electron transport layer indicates more traps and will slow down charge transport. This could lead to charge accumulation at the interface, which will induce an energy barrier to suppress the charge transport. We measured the mobility of SnO 2 and TiO 2 colloidal films by means of the spacecharge-limited current (SCLC) model  18  , and it was found that the mobility of the SnO 2 film is about 1.9 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 • s, which is much higher than that of TiO 2 (3.3 × 10 -5 cm 2 V -1 • s). The higher mobility of the ETL used could improve charge transport, and the higher injection current from the ITO/SnO 2 /Spiro-OMeTAD/Al device compared ITO/TiO 2 /Spiro-OMeTAD/Al could confirm this argument (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). 
 Charge transfer studies Steady photoluminescence (PL) (Fig.  3a ) showed a significant PL quench when depositing the perovskite layer on SnO 2 . Timeresolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results showed that the lifetime of the perovskite layer can be significantly reduced when depositing it on SnO 2 nanoparticles (Fig.  3b ), indicating efficient electron transfer occurred from perovskite to SnO 2 . Consistent with our and other groups' results  [16] [17] [18] [19]  , the PL intensity and lifetime of perovskite did not change very much when depositing the perovskite layer on TiO 2 (Fig.  3a, b ). This means that electrons cannot be efficiently transferred into the TiO 2 layer  [16] [17] [18] [19]  . The less efficient charge transport between TiO 2 and perovskite could be ascribed to the electron barrier at the interface of between TiO 2 and perovskite, which could due to the shallower conduction band and lower electron mobility of TiO 2 , or the interfacial traps at the perovskite/TiO 2 interface  16, 18, 19  . This could be the reason why a mesoporous TiO 2 structure was needed to increase the charge decay channel and reduce charge accumulation at the TiO 2 /perovskite interface, and thus deliver efficient devices without hysteresis  4  . The enhanced charge transfer from perovskite to the SnO 2 layer indicated that the energy barrier had been reduced or removed, which could be caused by the deeper conduction band and high mobility of SnO 2 . It can be anticipated that the SnO 2 -based device could deliver a better, stabilized efficiency. 
 Device fabrication and performance We fabricated devices with the structure ITO/SnO 2 /(FAPbI 3 ) x (MAPbBr 3 ) 1-x /Spiro-OMeTAD/Au using SnO 2 nanoparticles as ETLs. We used a two-step spin coating method to form the perovskite layer by inter-diffusion of lead halide and organic salts  32  . Here, a mixture of perovskite layers (FAPbI 3 ) x (MAPbBr 3 ) 1-x was selected. FAPbI 3 was chosen due to its lower bandgap than that of MAPbI 3 , in order to increase light harvesting  33, 34  . A small amount of MAPbBr 3 was added into FAPbI 3 to improve perovskite phase stabilization  34  . The composition of MAPbBr 3 in the perovskite mixture was about 3%, as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Supplementary Fig.  8 ), thus giving the form (FAPbI 3 ) 0.97 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.03 . The obtained perovskite film obtained showed an excellent morphology and was free of pinholes; the crystal size was close to 1 µm. The high quality of perovskite film formation was due to the introduction of Cl and moisture during the film growth  11, 35  . There is negligible Cl in the final perovskite film (Supplementary Fig.  8 ); the Cl element should have been vaporized, inferring that the Cl acts only as an intermediate element/material for perovskite film growth  11  . Moisture can enhance perovskite film growth via recrystallization  35  . It must be noted that the 'white phase' was observed when annealing the perovskite layer at higher temperature (for example, 150 • C) (Fig.  4a ,b and Supplementary Fig.  9 ). X-ray diffraction results (Fig.  4c ) confirmed that the PbI 2 phase was formed under higher temperature annealing, which is due to partial decomposition of the perovskite layer ( FAPbI 3 →PbI 2 (s)+FAI(g)). In situ energy dispersive X-ray analysis in a scanning electron microscope further confirms that the 'white phase' is a PbI 2 -rich region (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). The longer lifetime from the perovskite film with excess PbI 2 indicated that PbI 2 could passivate the defects and reduce recombination in the perovskite film (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). The passivation could be explained as follows: while PbI 2 was formed at the grain boundary in the perovskite layer, a type-I band alignment could be formed between perovskite and PbI 2 (ref. 36), which blocks electron from entering the hole transport layer and also reduces recombination. It was found that PbI 2 passivation is beneficial for device performance, as will be shown below  36, 37  . A cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy image of the completed device is shown in Fig.  4d . The thicknesses of the electron transport layer (SnO 2 ) and the hole transport layer (Spiro-OMeTAD) are 25 nm and 150 nm, respectively. The optimized process for the SnO 2 layer can be found in Supplementary Fig.  12 . To obtain the best performance, the SnO 2 layer should fully cover the ITO substrate, but it must not be so thick as to introduce a high series resistance. Therefore, a decent thickness of SnO 2 should be considered; in our case, the optimized thickness of SnO 2 is 25 nm. In this study, we deposited a thick perovskite layer (770 nm, Fig.  4c ) to enhance the photo response of the perovskite layer in the infrared region  38  .  We compared the device performance with and without the PbI 2 phase. It was found that the perovskite with excess PbI 2 showed better device performance, taking in account all the device performance parameters (Fig.  5a ). In terms of the lifetime enhancement (Supplementary Fig.  11 ), it could be assumed that the improvement of the device performance was due to passivation of the traps, including surface or grain boundary defects in the perovskite layer, which were considered as recombination centres  39  . In inorganic solar cells, a thin layer of wide bandgap or insulating materials is usually used for passivating the surface traps; for example, a thin layer of SiO 2 or Al 2 O 3 for Si solar cells  40  and the wide bandgap of AlGaAs for GaAs solar cells  41  . Here, in our study, the PbI 2 phase is expected to have a similar role in passivation for enhancing the device performance. 
 NATURE ENERGY ARTICLES 25 20 The best device performances of planar devices using SnO 2 nanoparticles as the ETL are shown in Fig.  5b . The device showed an open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.09V, a short-circuit current (J SC ) of 24.87 mA cm -2 , a fill factor (FF) of 74.77% and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.27% under reverse scan (V OC to J SC ). It showed a V OC of 1.09 V, a J SC of 24.88 mA cm -2 , a FF of 75.73%, and a PCE of 20.54% under forward scan (J SC to V OC ). The different scan directions showed almost the same performance, with only a slight difference in fill factor. More importantly, all the device performances are almost independent of the measurement conditions (Supplementary Fig.  13  and Supplementary Table  2 ), certainly indicating that the SnO 2 -based planar structure can achieve an efficient and stable power output. This behaviour is different from a traditional TiO 2 -based planar structure, as will be shown below. The typical external quantum efficiency of the devices is shown in Fig.  5c . The photo response edge has been extended to 820 nm, compared with 780 nm from CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . In the visible region, the external quantum efficiency can reach as high as 93%. The integrated short-circuit current (24.2 mA cm -2 ) matched well with the J-V results. The high short-circuit current can be ascribed to the high quality of the thick perovskite absorbing layer. To check reproducibility of the device performance, we collected the power conversion efficiency of one batch of devices (40 devices, Fig.  5d ). The power conversion efficiencies range from 17.9% to 20.5%, and most of the device efficiencies are greater than 19%. One of our best devices was sent to an accredited PV calibration laboratory (Newport, USA) for certification, which confirmed a PCE of 20.51% under AM 1.5 G full-sun illumination under reverse scan (V OC to J SC ) and 19.27% under forward scan (J SC to V OC ), with a slow scan rate (0.026 V s -1 ). The measurement details and results can be found in Supplementary Figs  14  and 15 . The certified efficiency is 19.9 ± 0.6% (Supplementary Fig.  14 ), which is consistent with our internal measurement results. The stability of our devices was tested, and it was found that the devices can maintain almost their original efficiency when stored in dry air conditions for 40 days (Supplementary Fig.  16 ). We also have tested the photo-stability of un-encapsulated SnO 2 -and TiO 2based devices under continuous one sun (100 mW cm -2 ) soaking in ambient air (temperature: 28 • C, humidity: 37%). Interestingly, it was found that the SnO 2 -based devices have better photostability than the TiO 2 -based devices (Supplementary Fig.  17 ); the mechanism is not entirely clear, and needs further study. 
 Hysteresis study To further illustrate the role of the SnO 2 layer in reducing the hysteresis, we also made n-i-p planar-structure devices using TiO 2 as ETLs. Consistent with most previous results, the devices with TiO 2 ETLs showed serious hysteresis (Supplementary Fig.  18  and Supplementary Table  3 )  4, 9, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20]  . In previous reports, on modifying the TiO 2 surface with fullerene, for example, the hysteresis could be eliminated. Moreover, it was found that the TiO 2 cannot efficiently transfer electrons from perovskite (Fig.  3 )  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20]  . However, rapid electron extraction took place when introducing fullerene. Therefore, a good electron contact layer with fast charge extraction could reduce charge accumulation at the perovskite/contact layer interface induced by ion migration, and could partially or fully resolve the hysteresis issue  16, 20  . From the band alignment shown in Fig.  2c , the conduction band of the SnO 2 layer aligned well with perovskite. Ideally, there will be no electron barrier formed at the perovskite/SnO 2 interface, which should facilitate electron extraction. In addition, the higher mobility of SnO 2 will enhance charge transport and reduce charge accumulation at the interface. Steady photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results confirmed the significant improvement of charge transfer from perovskite to SnO 2 compared with TiO 2 layers (Fig.  3 ). To confirm the enhanced charge extraction in the devices using the SnO 2 electron transport layer, we characterized the devices by means of transient photocurrent decay and photovoltage decay  18, 42  . It was found that the photocurrent decay time was significantly reduced from 22.53 µs to 4.01 µs (Fig.  6a ), while the decay time of the photovoltage was increased from 6.22 µs to 8.59 µs (Fig.  6b ) on replacing the TiO 2 layer with a SnO 2 layer as the electron transport layer, indicating a dramatic improvement of charge extraction and reduced recombination  42  . PL and transient photocurrent/photovoltage results both confirmed the enhancement of charge extraction on using SnO 2 as the ETL; thus, there will be no obvious charge accumulation at the interface between perovskite and SnO 2 , and the hysteresis can be eliminated, as shown in Fig.  5b . In addition, perovskite films grown on SnO 2 and TiO 2 showed similar crystal morphologies and thicknesses (Supplementary Fig.  19 ), which further confirms that the different hysteresis behaviours mainly originate from the different electron transport layers. Above all, ion migration in the perovskite layer could induce charge accumulation at the interface and lead to hysteresis  [13] [14] [15]  . However, if the electron transport layer has sufficient ability to extract the charges, such as the SnO 2 we used, the hysteresis could be alleviated or fully eliminated  16, 20, 43, 44  . 
 Conclusions In conclusion, we have adopted low-temperature, solutionprocessed SnO 2 nanoparticles as the electron transport for planarstructure solar cells, and close to 20% power conversion efficiency with almost free of hysteresis was obtained. Our study showed the possibility of obtaining highly efficient perovskite solar cells without mesoporous structures. The efficiency of the planar structure could be further improved in the future through perovskite film growth or further passivation of the perovskite surface. 
 Methods Preparation of SnO 2 and TiO 2 nanoparticles films. The SnO 2 colloid precursor was obtained from Alfa Aesar (tin(IV) oxide, 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion). (We have double-checked the solution concentration and the accurate concentration should be 20%, not the 15% labelled on bottle; before use, the particles were diluted by H 2 O to 2.67%). The final solution was spin coated onto glass/ITO substrates at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, and then baked on a hot plate in ambient air at 150 • C for 30 min. The TiO 2 nanocrystals were obtained from a non-hydrolytic sol-gel approach and the synthesis details can be found in ref. 9. The final TiO 2 was collected and dispersed in ethanol to make a suspension with a concentration of 6 mg ml -1 . To stabilize the as-obtained TiO 2 solutions, TiAcac was added into the solution, whose final concentration of 15 µl ml -1 . 
 Solar cell fabrication. The glass/ITO substrate was sequentially washed with isopropanol, acetone, distilled water and isopropanol. The sheet resistance of ITO is ∼15 / and the thicknesses of glass and ITO are 0.5 mm and 140 nm, respectively. The average transmittance of glass/ITO in the visible region is around 93%. For SnO 2 nanoparticles films, the diluted SnO 2 nanoparticles solution (2.67%) was spin coated on glass/ITO substrates in ambient air, and then annealed at 150 • C for 30 min. For TiO 2 nanoparticles films, 6 mg ml -1 of TiO 2 solution was spin coated on glass/ITO substrates at 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, and annealed in ambient air at 150 • C for 30 min. After depositing the electron transport layer, the perovskite layer was deposited by a two-step spin coating method; first, 1.3 M of PbI 2 in dimethylformamide (DMF) was spin coated onto the electron transport layer at 1,500 r.p.m. for 30 s, then annealed at 70 • C for 30 min; second, after the PbI 2 had cooled down, the mixture solution of FAI:MABr:MACl (60 mg:6 mg:6 mg in 1 ml isopropanol) was spin coated onto the PbI 2 at 1,500 r.p.m. for 30 s, and then the film was taken out from the glove box and annealed in ambient air (30%-40% humidity)  35  . It was confirmed that humidity is beneficial in obtaining high-quality perovskite films  35  . The annealing was under either 135 • C or 150 • C for 20 min; 150 • C annealing can deliver a higher performance due to the formation of the PbI 2 phase in the perovskite layer. After perovskite growth, the film was transferred into a N 2 -filled glovebox for Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer coating. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was coated at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, where 1 ml Spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (90 mg ml -1 ) solution was employed with the addition of 45 µl Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (170 mg ml -1 ) and 10 µl tBP. Finally, a Au back electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation at a pressure of 3 × 10 -6 torr. The active area was 0.108 cm 2 . Characterization. J-V characteristics of photovoltaic cells were taken using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under a simulated AM1.5G spectrum. With a solar simulator (Enli Tech, Taiwan), the light intensity was calibrated by means of a KG-5 Si diode. The I-V measurements were carried out in ambient air. The devices are measured both in reverse scan (1.2 V →0 V, step 0.02 V) and forward scan (0 V →1.2 V, step 0.02 V), and the delay time has been selected from 1 ms to 1,000 ms. The devices were taken out for EQE measurements using a Enli Tech (Taiwan) EQE measurement system. We sent our best devices to an accredited PV calibration laboratory (Newport, USA) for certification. High-resolution TEM images were taken on an FEI Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV. The diluted SnO 2 nanoparticles solution was dropped onto the copper mesh and dried, after which the sample was loaded into the TEM chamber for measurement. A field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FEI NanoSEM650) was used to acquire SEM images. The instrument uses an electron beam accelerated at 500 V to 30 kV, enabling operation at a variety of currents. The X-ray diffraction patterns (θ -2θ scans) were taken on a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 system using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5405 Å) as the X-ray source. Scans were taken with 0.5-mm-wide source and detector slits, with X-ray generator settings at 40 kV and 30 mA. The information was obtained from samples of SnO 2 powder and perovskite film deposited on glass substrates. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi using 200 W monochromated Al Kα (1,486.6 eV) radiation. A 500 µm X-ray spot was used for XPS analysis. The base pressure in the analysis chamber was about 3 × 10 -10 mbar. Typically, the hydrocarbon C1s line at 284.8 eV from adventitious carbon is used for energy referencing. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was also carried out on a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi, with the HeI(21.22 eV) emission line employed for excitation. 2 ) 2 22 PbI 3 -based perovskite solar cells Qi Jiang, Liuqi Zhang, Haolin Wang, Xiaolei Yang, Junhua Meng, Heng Liu, Zhigang Yin, Jinliang Wu, Xingwang Zhang * and Jingbi You * Planar structures for halide perovskite solar cells have recently garnered attention, due to their simple and low-temperature device fabrication processing. Unfortunately, planar structures typically show I-V hysteresis and lower stable device e ciency compared with mesoporous structures, especially for TiO 2 -based n-i-p devices. SnO 2 , which has a deeper conduction band and higher electron mobility compared with traditional TiO 2 , could enhance charge transfer from perovskite to electron transport layers, and reduce charge accumulation at the interface. Here we report low-temperature solution-processed SnO 2 nanoparticles as an e cient electron transport layer for perovskite solar cells. Our SnO 2 -based devices are almost free of hysteresis, which we propose is due to the enhancement of electron extraction. By introducing a PbI 2 passivation phase in the perovskite layer, we obtain a 19.9 ± 0.6% certified e ciency. The devices can be easily processed under low temperature (150 • C), o ering an e cient method for the large-scale production of perovskite solar cells.

Perovskite Quantum Wells Formation Mechanism for Stable Efficient Perovskite Photovoltaics-A Real-Time Phase-Transition Study

q r (Å -1 ) Normalized Intensity (a.u.) q r (Å -1 ) q r (Å -1 ) (d)          In the search for low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant research interest worldwide owing to their advantageous properties including a high light-to-electricity power conversion efficiency (PCE),  [1, 2]  low cost,  [3]  tunable bandgap,  [4]  and scalable processability.  [5, 6]  In the past decade, significant progress has been made in photovoltaic performance; the recently certified 25.2%  [7]  PCE, in single junction PSCs, has shown performance comparable to that of crystalline silicon solar cells. Therefore, in recent years, the focus of research has significantly shifted toward the removal of commercialization roadblocks, i.e., the long-term stability of devices and scaling up the fabrication process. It has been reported that in order to scale up PSCs technology, high-temperature blade coating,  [8] [9] [10]  air-knife-assisted room-temperature meniscus coating,  [9, 11]  and spray The ORCID identification number(s) for the author(s) of this article can be found under  https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202006238 . 
 The coating  [12, 13]  can be employed to fabricate high-quality perovskite solar cells with desirable photovoltaic performance. However, long-term stability under operational conditions must first be ensured. Perovskite quantum wells (PQWs, low-dimensional perovskite or quasi-2D perovskite) exhibit drastically enhanced stability in contrast to the traditional 3D perovskite; this ability originates from the relatively long-organic-chain ligands that form the PQWs. In contrast to the smaller size cations, such as FA, MA, Cs, the ligand molecules with a relatively longer chain can form an interdigitating structure at the interface stabilized by the van der Waals force, resulting in an overall stabilization of the stacked perovskite hierarchy. Several types of aryl-ammonium and alkyl-ammonium ligands, such as butylammonium,  [14, 15]  phenethylammonium pentafluorophenylethylammonium,  [16, 17]  and hexyl-trimethyammonium  [18]  etc., have been investigated and adopted for PQWs. Dou and coworkers demonstrated that the inorganic and organic building blocks of perovskite materials can be modified, yielding widely tunable single-crystalline PQWs.  [19]  The perovskite lattices terminated by organic ligand molecules provide a strong resistance to water and an increased formation of energy for the perovskite quantum wells compared to their 3D perovskite counterpart. Furthermore, they can significantly suppress the migration of mobile ions within the perovskite materials. All these can synergistically act against perovskite decomposition, which is induced either by water or ion-migration, leading to significantly improved thermal and humidity stability. The photovoltaic performance of pure 2D perovskite PSCs is not at par with that of its 3D perovskite counterpart owing to the issue of anisotropic charge-carrier transport. To combine the excellent light-to-electricity efficiency of the 3D perovskite with the desired stability of the perovskite quantum wells, the hierarchy of building a low-dimensional perovskite layer on top of a 3D bulk perovskite layer has been introduced. In the last few years, perovskite solar cells based on the PQWs/3D perovskite hierarchy have been reported to demonstrate a photovoltaic performance with an efficiency exceeding 20%, comparable with that of pure 3D devices. Notably, the stacked PQWs/3D hierarchy exhibits a superior thermal stability and long-term operating stability, as compared to pure 3D devices. Wang et al. introduced ligand molecules in a precursor solution prepared for 3D perovskite, enabling the formation of PQWs on top of the 3D perovskite bulk layer and consequently yielding the PQWs/3D perovskite hierarchy.  [20]  It was also reported that casting ligand molecules on top of a 3D perovskite bulk layer via spin coating or dip coating can also lead to the formation of PQWs on top of the layer.  [14, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25]  The recently certified PCE of PSCs based on this approach has shown an efficiency of 22.7%,  [18]  indicating potential benefits and applications of this perovskite hierarchy. Controlling the formation of PQWs on top of a 3D perovskite is critical for stacked PQWs/3D PSCs. Thus far, most studies on PQWs/3D perovskite have focused on the photovoltaic performance (including stability) after the formation of the hierarchy; while the critical issue of determining how the coated ligand molecules convert the 3D perovskite lattice into the reduceddimensional perovskite structure is rarely explored. The poor understanding of the hierarchy formation mechanism leads to the control of PQWs by empirical trial-and-error, impeding further scale-up processes and industrial implementation in the near future. Here, we explore in detail the formation mechanism of PQWs on top of a 3D perovskite bulk layer through the real-time tracking of crystal phase evolution with the help of in situ grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering measurements (GIWAXS) conducted during the ligand molecule (hexyltrimethyl ammouniumbromide) coating process. Theoretically supported by the density function theory (DFT) calculation, we first reveal that there is a strong chemical reaction between the ligand molecules (ions) and the 3D perovskite layer; this results in a highly ordered intermediate adduct phase involving the ligand molecules. Upon post-thermal annealing, the adduct phase is converted into compact PQWs, as indicated by the GIWAXS measurement presenting an enlarged q value. The formation of PQWs can be controlled via a chemical reaction by tuning the amount of ligand molecules, which is reflected by the change in intensity of the characteristic scattering peaks of PQWs and 3D perovskite, combined with time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). By building a thin structure of PQWs on top of a 3D perovskite bulk layer, we successfully demonstrate a highly stable perovskite photoactive layer and PSCs against high humidity (70-75%). Moreover, this stacked perovskite hierarchy enables a superior thermal stability based on a new dopant-free conjugated hole transporting layer with PCE exceeding 22%. Details regarding the PQWs formation mechanism and the relative phase transformation process elucidated in this study will guide the control of chemical reactions toward the desired PQWs/3D perovskite hierarchy, facilitating further improvements in both the optoelectronic property and stability, and ultimately benefiting the implementation of PQWs modified with the 3D perovskite hierarchy in the near future. Figure  1a ,b depicts schematics of the traditional 3D and PQWs heterostructures, respectively. A traditional 3D perovskite thin film (Cs 0.05 FA 0.81 MA 0.14 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45 ) was obtained via the spin-coating method assisted with anti-solvent (chlorobenzene) dripping and followed by thermal annealing. To explore the formation of PQWs on top of the 3D perovskite bulk layer, a 0-100 × 10 -3 m solution of hexyltrimethylammounium bromide (HTAB) was prepared in chlorobenzene: isopropanol (9:1 by volume) mixed solvents were then spin-coated on top of the 3D perovskite surface. Next, the samples were transferred to a hotplate for post thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min to form the PQWs. First, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was utilized to examine the morphology of the PQWs stacked perovskite thin film in comparison to the pristine one. Figure  1c -f presents a topographic AFM image of perovskite thin films after being treated with the following different concentrations of HTAB: 0, 1, 10, and 100 × 10 -3 m, respectively. In contrast to the pristine perovskite film (0 mg mL -1 ), impressive morphology changes can be observed after building PQWs atop. Especially, for the sample with a high concentration (100 × 10 -3 m), the complete morphological transition from a small compact-sized domain to a fibrillar crystal structure can be observed. This fibrillar structure has also been recorded by SEM in Figure  S1  in the Supporting Information. Considering the 1 × 10 -3 m HTAB treated sample, the morphology changed having an increased grain size and a blurred grain-boundary. In addition to the topographic AFM images, it has also been demonstrated by the top-view SEM images shown in Figure  1g ,h, which is similar to that of other reported studies.  [26, 27]  To examine the perovskite structure after HTAB treatment, 2D GIWAXS measurement was performed on the related samples to obtain detailed information. Figure  2a-d  presents the 2D GIWAXS patterns of the annealed perovskite layers at 120 °C for 10 min after being treated with different HTAB concentrations of 0, 1, 10, and 100 × 10 -3 m respectively. For the pristine 3D perovskite sample, a strong scattering peak located at q = 1.0 Å -1 appears, which is ascribed to the (110) of 3D perovskite crystals. The broadened yielded splitting of the (110) scattering peak is due to the large size (12 mm by 12 mm) of the substrate. A detailed comparison is available in Figure  S2  (Supporting Information). No scattering peak appears in the short q regime (q < 0.9 Å -1 ), indicating a pure 3D perovskite layer. After HTAB treatment, scattering halos in the short q regime appear, as shown in Figure  2b-d , suggesting the enlarged d-spacing resulting from reduced dimensional perovskite crystals. The radial integration of the 2D GIWAXS data for perovskite samples is plotted in Figure  2e .  The scattering features from both the 2D and 3D structures are marked by dashed lines as shown in Figure  2e . The scattering peaks with q = 0.367, 0.396, and 0.451 Å -1 correspond to the three different lattice d-spacings of 17.1, 15.8, and 13.9 Å, respectively. These relatively larger d-spacings resulted from the 2D structure after the inclusion of the long chain HTAB ligands. Further quantitative details can be found in the DFT calculation section. Three different structures with varying d-spacings in the 2D perovskite material have been reported in a previous study,  [28]  wherein they were denoted as 2D-α, 2D-β, and 2D-γ structures, respectively. The scattering peak with q = 1.0 Å -1 was attributed to the (110) of the 3D perovskite crystal structure. Along with the increasing HTAB concentration, the following were also observed: 1) an intensified scattering intensity from the PQWs, and a decreased intensity from the 3D perovskite crystals; and 2) an increased angular distribution (mosaicity) for the scattering halos from the PQWs. In contrast to the 3D (110) scattering peak, an approximately negligible scattering peak from the PQWs was detected for the sample after the treatment of HTAB with a concentration of 1 × 10 -3 m, indicating that only a very thin layer of the PQWs was formed. Impressively, the scattering peak from the 3D perovskite (110) nearly disappeared when the HTAB concentration was 100 × 10 -3 m; meanwhile, strong scattering peaks from the PQWs appear. Based on the radial integration data of the GIWAXS of the perovskite samples,  we found that the formation of the 2D perovskite layer can be directly controlled by varying the concentration of HTAB, i.e., a thin PQWs layer can be obtained with a low concentration of HTAB while a thicker one can be formed with an increase in the concentration of HTAB. To gain further insight into the stacked perovskite structure, time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) was performed to analyze the ion depth distribution in the perovskite photoabsorber layer treated with different HTAB concentrations. (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) PbI x N C H The results are plotted in Figure  2g  (1 × 10 -3 m HTAB) and Figure  2h  (100 × 10 -3 m HTAB), respectively. The thickness of the perovskite layer was ≈400 nm according to the depth profile of F -from the FTO substrate, which is close to the measurement performed via cross-sectional SEM, as shown in Figure  S3  in the Supporting Information. As a characteristic organic spacer in PQWs, based on the depth profile of HTA + , it was confirmed that a thin (≈15 nm) PQWs layer formed on top of the 3D perovskite layer when the sample was treated by HTAB with a low concentration (1 × 10 -3 m). In comparison, the measured SIMS intensity of HTA + nearly proceeded across the entire perovskite layer for the sample treated with a high concentration (100 × 10 -3 m) of HTAB. Unlike the sample treated with a high concentration (100 × 10 -3 m), the depth profiles of FA + and MA + of the sample treated with a low concentration (1 × 10 -3 m) exhibited a relatively stable intensity underneath the top surface composed of PQWs. This indicated the presence of an intact 3D perovskite layer underneath with a uniform chemical composition. A similar phenomenon was observed for other ions (I -, Br -), as presented in Figure  S4  in the Supporting Information. A time-resolved GIWAXS experiment was conducted to explore the in situ formation process of PQWs when HTAB was coated on top of the 3D perovskite layer. Figure  3a  illustrates the time-resolved GIWAXS characterization during the HTAB dripping process on top of the 3D pristine perovskite layer. The time-resolved GIWAXS intensity map during the spin-coating of HTAB on top of the pristine 3D perovskite layer is shown in Figure  3b , and the GIWAXS intensity profiles along the q z direction for perovskites with HTAB are plotted in Figure  S5  (Supporting Information). Before the HTAB dripping process, only the scattering rings from the 3D perovskite crystals at a large q regime appear, as shown in Figure  3c . After the HTAB was coated on the 3D perovskite layer, a new ordered intermediate phase immediately emerged in the low q regime (q = 0.31 Å -1 ), as indicated by the red arrow in Figure  3d . To further identify this species, we performed an XRD measurement on a pure HTAB sample, which presented a main diffraction peak at 2θ = 6.13°, as shown in Figure  S6  (Supporting Information), and corresponded to a d-spacing of 1.44 nm (q = 0.436 Å -1 ).  [29]  This clearly indicated that the scattering peak (q = 0.31 Å -1 ) resulted from a new phase rather the aggregation of HTAB molecules. The detailed integrated intensity versus q corresponding to Figure  3c ,d are plotted in Figure  3f . An apparent scattering peak at q = 0.31 Å -1 was observed after the GIWAXS patterns for the perovskite films before (@8 s) and after (@48 s) HTAB dripping, as indicated by the black dashed lines in (b). e) The extracted intensity @ q = 0.31 Å -1 (ordered intermediate phase, as indicated by red arrow in (d)) as a function of time. f) The integrated intensity versus q from the 2D GIWAXS patterns at 8 s (black) and 48 s (red). g) Zoom-in of the integrated intensity versus q in the low q regime. Adv. Mater. 2021, 33, 2006238  HTAB coating, as shown in Figure  3g . To quantify the formation of this ordered intermediate phase, we plotted the intensity with q = 0.31 Å -1 versus the frames (2 s per frame), as shown in Figure  3e . Surprisingly, we found that only a few seconds are needed to complete the entire formation process of the ordered intermediate phase, indicating a strong chemical reaction between the HTAB and 3D perovskite crystals. The existence of this reaction sufficiently explains the reason for the decrease in the 3D perovskite (110) scattering peak when the 2D perovskite scattering peaks in the low q regime intensified as the HTAB concentration increased. Real-time 2D GIWAXS patterns depicted in Figure  S7  (Supporting Information) present the evolution of the ordered PQWs intermediate phase after HTAB treatment. To exclude the possibility that the reaction is between a residual PbI 2 and HTAB, we performed a real-time GIWAXS experiment by coating HTAB on top of a pure PbI 2 film, as shown in Figure  S8  in the Supporting Information. The resulting real-time GIWAXS intensity map presents the different scattering peaks from the ordered intermediate phase in comparison to the 3D perovskite bulk layer. Moreover, a comparison of the 2D GIWAXS patterns between the perovskite and PbI 2 layers are shown in Figure  S9  (Supporting Information), which indicates that the reaction is not between the residual PbI 2 and HTAB. The ordered intermediate phase eventually converted into PQWs after the thermal annealing treatment; the entire perovskite evolution process is illustrated in Figure  S10  (Supporting Information). To further examine our hypothesis, we performed the realtime GIWAXS experiment with a lower HTAB concentration (1 × 10 -3 m) on a 3D perovskite film. As a result, the exact same location of the scattering peak in the low q regime (q = 0.31 Å -1 ) was shown, although the intensity decreased with the same fast transition process, as expected (detailed information has been presented in Figure  S11 , Supporting Information). Considering the PQWs formation, we have zoomed in on the low q regime to explore the evolution process. Initially, there were no scattering signals from the pristine 3D perovskite layer (Figure  3h ); then, the HTA + involved ordered intermediate crystal formation after the HTAB solution coating (Figure  3i ); and eventually the top of the film transited into the 2D perovskite upon the post thermal annealing treatment, as shown in Figure  3j . In addition to the HTAB ligand molecule, other widely used ligands, namely phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) and tert-butylammonium bromide (BABr) were also examined as the PQWs spacer ligands after coating the top of a 3D perovskite layer. After coating the ligand molecules on top of a 3D perovskite layer, an XRD measurement was immediately performed on the samples. New diffraction peaks at low 2θ values (larger d-spacing) appeared for both PEAI and BABr treated samples, as shown in Figure  S12  in the Supporting Information. This observed phenomenon is sufficiently consistent with the HTAB results indicated above. Furthermore, there is nearly no change in the XRD spectra of the 3D perovskite film before and after the pure solvent treatment (Figure  S13 , Supporting Information), which excluded the solvent effect during the PQWs formation process. The structural evolution of PQWs (n = 1) was investigated by first-principle calculations based on the density functional theory (see the Supporting Information for computational details). The lattice constants of the structures of the 3D perovskite intercalated by the HTA + ions replacing FA + , a) before and b) after optimization, are indicated in Figure  4 . The lattice constant after optimization was a = b = 7.253 Å and c = 28.95 Å. It is important to note that, this lattice constant c includes two ligands from both the sides. The c axis is the right direction the ligand molecules pack along, resulting in different enlarged d-spacings as indicated by the scattering peaks in the low-q regime. The structure of the 3D perovskites was destroyed when the small cation (FA + ) was replaced with HTA + (Figure  4a, b ), which revealed the strong chemical reactions that occurred between HTAB and 3D perovskites (instead of simple cation exchanges). This observation is in agreement with the real-time GIWAXS data, where intermediate phase formation occurred as soon as HTAB was coated. Furthermore, the HTA + ions were stabilized at the vertex of the PbI x Br 3-x octahedron with a binding energy of 6.72 eV (Figure  4c, d ). The charge density difference at the interface between the PbI x Br 3-x octahedron and the PQWs is depicted in Figure  4e . The charge redistribution mainly occurs near the N atom in the PQWs, reflecting a strong interaction. The long chains contribute weakly to the charge transfer, which is in agreement with the weak charge carrier transport in the reduced-dimensional perovskite layer. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the annealed perovskite layers at 120 °C for 10 min after being treated with different concentrations of HTAB are shown in Figure  5a . The blue-shift of the absorption shoulder of the perovskite film as the HTAB concentration increases corresponding to the wider bandgap of PQWs compared to the pristine 3D counterpart and the inclusion of bromide ions, the side product of the HTAB molecules. Figure  5b  presents the PL spectra of the related perovskite films. As can be seen the PL peak location also exhibits a noticeable blueshift as the HTAB concentration increases. For the 100 × 10 -3 m HTAB treated sample, the PL peak position significantly shifted to 701 nm in contrast to 769 nm of the pristine 3D sample; this was a result of the conversion of PQWs from the 3D perovskite and the inclusion of the bromide ions. Notably, PL peak quenching was observed for the sample with a moderate amount of HTAB treatment, suggesting a suppressed recombination due to the passivated top surface with reduced surface traps or defects. Planar n-i-p PSCs (as shown in Figure  5c ) are then fabricated to examine the effect of HTA + -based PQWs on the photovoltaic performance of related devices. As expected, the highly concentrated HTAB-treated samples demonstrated significantly inferior photovoltaic performance, due to the 3D perovskite structure severely diminished by the HTAB. In comparison, the device treated by HTAB with a moderate concentration (1 × 10 -3 m) yielded a PCE of up to 22.02%, which is higher than that of the pristine 3D perovskite device (20.95% champion device), as shown in Figure  5d . The enhanced PCE was mainly due to the increased V OC (by 30 mV), in agreement with the reported results.  [18, 26, 30]  The photovoltaic parameters are available in detail in Table  S1  in the Supporting Information . The PCE distribution (from over 20 devices in each condition) as a function of the HTAB concentration is plotted in Figure  S14  in the Supporting Information. The increased V oc indicates that the PQWs with a wide bandgap effectively passivated the 3D top surface, which led to a reduced trap density and resulted in a suppressed non-radiative recombination. This was also observed in PSCs upon poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) as a holetransport layer (HTL), as shown in Figure  S15  (Supporting Information). The stability issue for high efficiency PSCs with a lithium salt doped Spiro-OMeTAD HTL is well-documented due to the lithium salt. PTAA is an alternative widely used HTL. In this study, dopant free PTAA was used for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells based on a 1 × 10 -3 m HTAB treated perovskite, with a champion PCE of 20.09%. This value is ≈10% lower than that in the case of the traditional salt doped Spiro-OMeTAD HTL. Through the floriation strategy modified PTAA, called 1F-PTAA (the molecular structure is available in Figure  S16  in the Supporting Information), a high PCE of 22.16% was achieved (Figure  5e ) with a stabilized PCE of 21.89%, as shown in Figure  5f ; this is, thus far, the best among the reported perovskite solar cells with dopant free HTLs. In contrast to the benchmark material PTAA, the incorporation of fluorine atoms into the PTAA polymer chain resulted in a deeper HOMO energy level,  [31]  yielding an improved energy level matching of 1F-PTAA molecules with valance band maximums of the perovskite photoactive layer, which facilitates a more efficient charge extraction. The related energy diagrams are available in in Figure  S17  in the Supporting Information. Notably, the new HTL leads to a PSC with negligible hysteresis from the forward and reverse scans, as shown in Figure  S18  in the Supporting Information. The time-resolved PL (Figure  5g ) confirms an over threefold increase in the charge carrier lifetime after the application of the PQWs on top of the pristine 3D perovskite bulk layer (t = 127 ns for pristine 3D perovskite while t = 423 ns for the PQWs modified one), once again suggesting the high optoelectronic quality of the 3D/PQWs perovskite film and a suppressed non-radiative recombination. The value of the integrated J SC obtained from the EQE spectra (22.59 mA cm -2 ) is in agreement with the J-V measurement (23.72 mA cm -2 ) within an error of 5%, as shown in Figure  5h . Finally, we evaluated the influence of the 3D/PQWs heterostructure regarding the ambient and thermal stabilities.   layers of both fresh and aged ones, by completing the HTL (Lithium salt doped Spiro-OMeTAD) and Au top electrode. The pristine sample without HTAB presents approximately no photovoltaic performance after aging at room temperature, with an HR of 70-75% for 48 h due to the fast perovskite decomposition to yellow, as shown in the photograph above, although the fresh one can yield a high PCE of >20%. It is also noted that the PSC with the highly concentrated (100 × 10 -3 m) HTAB treated perovskite film failed to exhibit a photovoltaic performance due to the destruction of the 3D perovskite structure by the excessively long chain ions of HTA + . Furthermore, the one treated with a moderate concentration (1 × 10 -3 m) of HTAB exhibited a significantly enhanced stability in the ambient condition while yielding a decent PCE of 18.5% after 48 h of aging at an HR of 70-75%, as shown in Figure  6b , i.e., 86.0% of its initial PCE was maintained. It is a direct evidence of the significantly enhanced stability due to the formed PQWs. We also performed a related aging test under ambient conditions, as shown in Figure  S19  (Supporting Information). Additionally, we performed a thermal stability analysis of the PQW-modified perovskite solar cells. To exclude other factors, the thermal stability tests of unencapsulated devices were conducted in an N 2 -filled glove-box. We conducted a thermal cycling test (one thermal cycle: heating a device in a glove-box at 80 °C for 90 min and then natural cooling it down to room temperature for another 90 min) for the devices with the normal structure. Rapid degradation of the pristine normal perovskite device with Li-salt doped spiro-MeOTAD was observed under the thermal cycle test, while a slight improvement was observed for the PQWs modified, as shown in Figure  6c . For the PQW-modified perovskite architecture, replacing the doped spiro-OMeTAD with pure 1F-PTAA as HTL led to a significant enhancement in its thermal stability. As a result, it was able to maintain 81.0% of the initial PCE value despite undergoing 100 thermal cycles, indicating that the doped spiro-OMeTAD is the primary reason responsible for the thermal instability of the normal perovskite structure.  [32]  The enhanced thermal stability for the PQW-modified perovskite architecture with pure 1F-PTAA was attributed to the synergy between suppressed ion migration by PQWs and the stable dopant-free 1F-PTAA as HTL. We explored the in-depth mechanism of PQWs formation in the PQWs/3D heterostructure in order to realize efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. We concluded that PQWs derived from the reaction between HTAB cation molecules and 3D perovskite bulk material leads to an enlarged domain size. Time-resolved GIWAXS revealed a rapid ionic reaction immediately after HTAB casting, yielding a highly ordered intermediate phase within only a few seconds. We reported a systematic investigation on the effect of HTAB casting influencing the PQWs, morphology, photovoltaic performance, as well as the stability of the related perovskite devices. Controlling the reaction of HTAB and 3D perovskite bulk material was determined to be the primary challenge in the formation of the desired PQWs/3D perovskite hierarchy; PQWs with a thickness of ≈15 nm on top of a 3D perovskite were obtained with a moderate concentration of HTAB (1 × 10 -3 m) casting. This optimal PQWs/3D perovskite hierarchy lead to an improved photovoltaic performance. More importantly, it enabled the formation of the dopant-free PTAA-derivative (1F-PTAA) with a PCE of up to 22.16%, along with significantly improved moisture and thermal stress stability.

 combination of a bulk 3D perovskite layer and a reduced dimensional perovskite layer (perovskite quantum wells (PQWs)) is demonstrated to enhance the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) significantly in terms of stability and efficiency. This perovskite hierarchy has attracted intensive research interest; however, the in-depth formation mechanism of perovskite quantum wells on top of a 3D perovskite layer is not clearly understood and is therefore the focus of this study. Along with ex situ morphology and photophysical characterization, the timeresolved grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (TS-GIWAXS) technique performed in this study provides real-time insights on the phase-transition during the organic cation (HTAB ligand molecule) coating and PQWs/3D architecture formation process. A strikingly strong ionic reaction between the 3D perovskite and the long-chain organic cation leads to the quick formation of an ordered intermediate phase within only a few seconds. The optimal PQWs/3D architecture is achieved by controlling the HTAB casting, which is assisted by time-of-flight SIMS characterization. By controlling the second ionic reaction during the longchain cation coating process, along with the fluorinated poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) as a hole-transport layer, the perovskite solar cells demonstrate efficiencies exceeding 22% along with drastically improved device stability.

Not All That Glitters Is Gold: Metal-Migration-Induced Degradation in Perovskite Solar Cells
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have now achieved efficiencies in excess of 22%, but very little is known about their long-term stability under thermal stress. So far, stability reports have hinted at the importance of substituting the organic components, but little attention has been given to the metal contact. We investigated the stability of state-of-the-art PSCs with efficiencies exceeding 20%. Remarkably, we found that exposing PSCs to a temperature of 70 °C is enough to induce gold migration through the hole-transporting layer (HTL), spiro-MeOTAD, and into the perovskite material, which in turn severely affects the device performance metrics under working conditions. Importantly, we found that the main cause of irreversible degradation is not due to decomposition of the organic and hybrid perovskite layers. By introducing a Cr metal interlayer between the HTL and gold electrode, high-temperature-induced irreversible long-term losses are avoided. This key finding is essential in the quest for achieving high efficiency, long-term stable PSCs which, in order to be commercially viable, need to withstand hard thermal stress tests.
W hile the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly achieved remarkable values of 22.1%,  1  this has not been matched by equal developments in long-term stability.  2, 3  At this stage, operational stability is considered one of the main obstacles for the commercialization of PSCs.  4, 5  The perovskites used in photovoltaics commonly employ an ABX 3 formula, where A is a monovalent cation (methylamonium, MA; formamidinium, FA; Cs, etc.), B is a divalent metal, such as Sn or Pb, and X is I, Br, or Cl. In previous studies, perovskite films have been subjected to different environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and illumination.  [6] [7] [8]  It has been found that the stability of this material class varies greatly depending on the mixing of A and X ions.  [9] [10] [11] [12]  Perovskites are thermally stable at temperatures not exceeding those typically achieved by solar cells in operation (up to 85 °C),  6, 7  with humidity identified as the main degradation trigger.  6, 13  Similarly, stability of complete PSC devices has been investigated with relation to the same environmental factors.  6, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]  Interestingly, in addition to the perovskite-related degradation, the stability of the devices was found to greatly depend on device architecture.  17, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24]  This was explained partly by interfacial degradation  19, 25  and also by degradation of the charge-transporting layers.  14, 22  Recently, there have been efforts to substitute the widely used organic spiro-MeOTAD holetransporting layer (HTL) with inorganic materials to improve the stability of PSCs.  20, 21, 26  However, it is still unclear what the mechanism increasing the stability is. Furthermore, while most of the published reports focus on dark ""shelf stability"",  20, 22, 27  only a handful have investigated devices under load and illumination  17, 18, 26, 28  and even fewer attempted to match the realistic operation conditions of solar cells by subjecting them simultaneously to temperatures in excess of 70 °C,  29  which are routinely achieved on a hot, sunny day.  30  Here, we investigate the stability of state-of-the-art perovskite devices with PCEs above 20%. We show that operating devices, employing a spiro-MeOTAD HTL and a Au or Ag back contact (the most widely used architectures, currently yielding the highest PCEs), at temperatures exceeding 70 °C causes irreversible changes to the devices, which results in a dramatic performance loss. By means of elemental analysis on aged devices, we observe that considerable amounts of Au from the electrode diffuse across the HTL into the perovskite layer. We pinpoint the diffused Au to cause the irreversible loss of opencircuit voltage (V oc ), fill factor (FF), and short-circuit current density (J sc ) in the aged devices. We further show that introduction of a Cr interlayer alleviates the problem of fast device aging at elevated temperatures. This is an encouraging  finding as it shows that neither perovskite nor spiro-MeOTAD is the limiting factor for the high-temperature stability of PSCs. 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The PSCs were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass and composed of a typical stack of compact TiO 2 / mesoporous TiO 2 /perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au as recently reported by us.  31  The active layer of the device consists of a perovskite-filled mesoporous TiO 2 scaffold and a solid perovskite layer sitting on top of it. The chemical composition of the perovskite precursor is a Cs-containing FA 0.83 MA 0.17 Pb-(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 formulation, referred to as ""triple cation"" perovskite in this work.  12  Figure  1a  shows the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the device with a thin perovskite-infiltrated mesoporous TiO 2 layer (an electron selective layer, ESL) of ca. 200 nm and a 500 nm perovskite capping layer composed of large crystals. A 200 nm layer of spiro-MeOTAD (as HTL) sits atop the perovskite layer, and finally, a gold top electrode is deposited to contact the device. With this architecture, we achieved very high PCEs of up to 20.6% (stabilized at 20.0%; Figure  1b ). The aging experiments were conducted by keeping the devices at controlled temperature (20 or 75 °C), in nitrogen atmosphere and under 1 sun equivalent white light-emitting diode (LED) illumination at maximum power point (MPP) for over 15 h (see Scheme S1). Figure  2a  shows the currentvoltage (J-V) curves of the device aged at 20 °C: before, at the end of the aging experiments, and after 7 h of recovery (in dark, under nitrogen flow and 20 °C; cf. Figure  S1a  for the evolution of J-V parameters), while Figure  2c  shows the evolution of PCE, V MPP , and J MPP over the course of the experiment. The 20 °C device has shown very high stability overall, with V oc being the most stable parameter individually. The limited decrease in PCE was mostly due to a small and temporary loss of J sc , and the device regained its performance following 7 h of recovery (Table  1 ). On the other hand, the degradation of the device aged at 75 °C was much more severe (Figure  2b ,d and Figure  S1b ), and no recovery was seen. All J-V metrics saw a substantial reduction, with J sc /J MPP suffering the most and the earliest into the experiment. Additionally, a large, irreversible loss of V oc was observed. This pattern of small, reversible PCE loss for devices aged around room temperature and a severe, permanent PCE loss including a substantial reduction in V oc after aging at 75 °C is reproducible, and we confirmed this by repeating the experiment several times (Figure  S2 ). A similar pattern was found for samples aged under the identical conditions but by keeping the devices at V oc , indicating that the degradation was not primarily due to the load on the device (Figure  S3 ). Moreover, a similar observation was made for devices aged at 75 °C in the dark (Figure  4c ), confirming that light was only partially responsible for the degradation. Hence, we concluded that the heating is responsible for most of the degradation. In order to investigate the effect of aging on perovskite, we performed UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (Figure  S4 ) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Figure  S5 ) before and after the aging experiments (Au electrode was removed). No major difference was found in the material's structural and optical properties with the temperature treatment. The absorption of aged devices was independent of the aging temperature. Similarly, XRD analysis showed no correlation between temperature of aging and perovskite degradation. However, the peak indicating the presence of PbI 2 (2θ = ∼12.8°; the devices are fabricated with a small PbI 2 excess) has slightly increased in both devices aged at 20 and 75 °C. Since the structural and optical changes of the perovskite are not the main cause of the dramatic device performance loss, the elemental composition of the aged devices was investigated. Time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) elemental depth profiling is a perfectly suited technique for this, and it has been proven to work well to characterize perovskitebased devices.  [32] [33] [34]  By rastering an energetic beam of ions across a sample and analyzing the debris of those collisions, spatially resolved elemental maps can be obtained. Figure  3a  shows a depth profile of an as-fabricated control device, which has never been exposed to high-intensity light, electric field, or temperature higher than room temperature. The Au -ion trace is indicative of the top electrode; the CN -ion can be ejected from either the spiro-MeOTAD HTL or the perovskite layer. I - comes from the perovskite layer, TiO 2 -is from either the mesoporous scaffold or the ESL; and SnO 2 -is from the FTO electrode. The relative intensity of CN -and I -from the HTL to the FTO layer is beyond the scope of this publication and will be the subject of future work. Further, these ions are sensitive to diffusion and segregation at the surface because of the primary ion bombardment/implantation, which can explain their long diffusion tails in the FTO and the substrate.  35  We clearly see a sharp interface between Au and HTL; however, roughness induced by the primary ion erosion explains the sharpness decrease with the increased fluence. Moreover, passing the TiO 2 mesoporous layer also affects the interface evaluation. When comparing the control device with the aged ones (see Figure  S6  for full SIMS profiles and the Methods section for an explanation of how ToF-SIMS profiles can be compared), one striking observation for the device aged at 70 °C is the occurrence of a Au -signal (in yellow) in the mesoporous TiO 2 perovskite, which peaks close to the TiO 2 /SnO 2 interface. This unexpected occurrence of the high Au peak is the first ever reported direct evidence of metal migrating from the electrode to inside the perovskite layer. This phenomenon, however, has been observed previously in inorganic semiconductors for several different metals such as Au, Ag, Ni, Cu, and Fe.  [36] [37] [38] [39] [40]  Figure  3b  presents the 3D distribution of the ions shown in Figure  3a  across a 100 μm 2 region of the samples (see Movie S1 for an animated 3D reconstruction). One can clearly see that the respective ions are distributed uniformly in the xy plane of the device. At 70 °C, a considerable amount of Au has diffused inside the perovskite layer and accumulated close to the TiO 2 / SnO 2 interface. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to quantify the amount of Au diffused in the    instrument (∼1 ng for the amount of solution used). This translated to a concentration of 1.45 nM cm -2 of Au (or 8.9 × 10 14 Au atoms cm -2 ; compared to ∼10 17 Pb atoms cm -2 ) in the perovskite layer of the aged device. Based on the evidence (ToF-SIMS, ICP-MS), it was concluded that Au from the top electrode can diffuse across the organic spiro-MeOTAD HTL and into the perovskite before it is stopped at the TiO 2 /perovskite interface. Since some Au was already found within the HTL of the control device (Figure  3 ), it shows that spiro-MeOTAD is a very poor barrier for the migration of Au. Therefore, even heat produced during back contact evaporation is sufficient to cause Au diffusion into the HTL. Subsequently, the Au -signal in HTL increases in the device aged at 30 °C. However, this does not seem to have a detrimental effect on the performance of the device. When the aging temperature is increased to 70 °C, Au appears to easily pass through the HTL and accumulate within the perovskite layer. It appears that only when inside the perovskite, Au critically degrades the performance of PSCs. Au diffusing inside the perovskite can have several detrimental effects. First of all, it can produce shunts across the device, reducing the FF.  24  Moreover, Au atoms can create deep trap states within the semiconductor, which enhances nonradiative recombination and consequently degrades V oc as well as J sc . Indeed, we observe a severe, irreversible reduction in V oc , J sc , and FF in the devices aged at high temperature. The phenomenon of Au creating mid-band-gap states for silicon devices has been reported before.  36, 37  In order to pinpoint the observed degradation to Au diffusion into perovskite and to exclude possible influence of interfacial or HTL degradation, we performed dark heating experiments on two identically fabricated devices, one of which had the Au electrode temporarily removed for the duration of the heating phase (see Methods). We found that the device heated without the Au electrode did not degrade significantly and later recovered almost all of its initial performance (Figure  4a ). On the other hand, the device aged with Au on top has seen a severe degradation (Figure  4c ) similar to that shown above. While replacing the Au electrode of the degraded devices with a fresh one helped to partially recover J sc , the loss of V oc and FF was permanent. The reason for the recovered J sc is likely due to the partially reversible nature of degradation in PSCs when they are left in the dark. We note that the process of replacing the electrode takes around 1.5 h. However, it may also indicate degradation of the Au/spiro-MeOTAD interface. Next, Au was compared to the other most widely used electrode for PSCs, namely, Ag. The average initial efficiency of Ag-contacted devices was 11.8% compared to 18.3% for Aucontacted devices from the same batch. By heating the devices to 75 °C in the dark and in a nitrogen atmosphere, we found that devices with a Ag electrode degrade dramatically, as seen for the Au analogues (Figure  S7 ). While the loss of V oc was relatively lower, the increased degradation may come from the fact that iodine can migrate through the HTL, reacting with Ag and altering the electronic properties of the Ag/HTL interface.  23, 27  A similar phenomenon has been also shown for Al-contacted devices.  27  This further confirms that metal electrodes (Au and Ag) are intrinsically incompatible with organic spiro-MeOTAD HTL-based perovskite devices such as solar cells,  [41] [42] [43]  photodetectors,  [44] [45] [46]  lasers,  47  and LEDs.  48  The problem of metal-induced degradation cannot be simply resolved by sealing the devices, and metal diffusion must be stopped by an alternative HTL or an interfacial layer preventing this phenomenon. Several strategies were explored to resolve the issue of metalmigration-induced degradation of PSCs. First, the HTL was modified by mixing spiro-MeOTAD with Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles. This approach has been proposed by Guarnera et al. to stop metal diffusion across the HTL.  24  While the stability of asprepared devices aged under MPP conditions and 75 °C was improved significantly, the extent of degradation proved unacceptable and a linear degradation component was observed (Figure  5b  and Figure  S8 ). Thin interlayers of Cr (10 nm) were deposited as diffusion barriers between the spiro-MeOTAD HTL and Au. The initial performance of these devices was 13.0%, which was lower than that without a Cr layer and likely due to high series resistance or work function mismatch of the Au/Cr/spiro-MeOTAD stack. By subjecting the Cr/Au devices to realistic solar cell operating conditions (75 °C, 1 sun illumination, and MPP tracking), the stability was found to improve critically (Figure  5c ), and any degradation was reversible (due to an increase of V oc , the device outperformed itself following 9 h of recovery, Figure  S9a ). After an early period of exponential decay, the PCE stabilized at 83% of the initial value. Importantly, no degradation of V oc in the aged devices occurred (Figure  S9 ), indicating that Au diffusion across the HTL into perovskite has been hindered by the Cr interlayer. We have confirmed this by performing ICP-MS spectrometry on the aged Cr/Au devices and not finding any trace of Au or Cr inside the perovskite layer. Furthermore, we imaged the fresh and degraded Au electrodes of the three devices with different HTL/electrode configurations (Figure  5b ). While the Au electrode of the spiro-MeOTAD + Au device became evidently porous following high-temperature exposure, both devices with spiro-MeOTAD/ Al 2 O 3 + Au and spiro-MeOTAD + Cr/Au architectures had no visible evidence of electrode degradation or decomposition. This finding suggests that it is plausible that the spiro-MeOTAD layer cracks when heat-stressed, which in turn creates pores and a point of contact between Au/perovskite. This effect could be hindered by a Cr interlayer, or cracking of spiro-MeOTAD could be considerably reduced by mixing it with Al 2 O 3 . The high-temperature stability of Cr/Au devices is unprecedented, and such behavior has never been observed in devices using Au or Ag as contacts. In addition, deposition of a thin Cr interlayer is industrially feasible as Cr can be evaporated from Cr-plated W wires by sublimation. Finally, this work brings to light the misconception that the perovskite materials and HTLs are the main contributors to the long-term degradation of device performance. Several reports of successful employment of inorganic HTLs, inorganic interfacial layers, or transparent conductive oxide electrodes have shown considerable improvement of PSC stability.  20, [24] [25] [26] 50  Although not directly acknowledged, the improvement in stability may have come from hindering metal diffusion from the contact across the HTL into the perovskite rather than more efficient protection of perovskite from oxygen or humidity. 
 CONCLUSIONS We investigated the stability of state-of-the-art, ""triple cation"" perovskite devices with PCEs above 20%. We show that operating devices employing a spiro-MeOTAD HTL and a Au or Ag back contact at temperatures exceeding 70 °C causes irreversible changes to the devices, which results in a dramatic performance loss. By means of elemental analysis on aged devices, we observe that considerable amounts of the Au from the electrode diffuse across the HTL into the perovskite layer. We pinpoint the diffused Au to cause the irreversible loss of V oc , FF, and J sc in the aged devices. We further show that insertion of a thin Cr interlayer between the HTL and Au alleviates the problem of severe device degradation at elevated temperatures. This shows that neither perovskite nor spiro-MeOTAD is the primary limiting factor for high-temperature stability of PSCs in the current configuration, as it has previously been suggested. Our study creates a roadmap for high-temperature stability measurements of PSCs by taking into consideration metal migration. Therefore, it is important for the field to investigate other interlayer materials that can hinder this phenomenon. 
 METHODS Device Fabrication. Perovskite Precursor Solution and Film Preparation. Nippon sheet glass (10 Ω cm -2 ) was cleaned by sonication in a 2% Hellmanex water solution for 30 min. After being rinsed with deionized water and ethanol, the substrates were further cleaned with UV ozone treatment for 15 min. Subsequently, a 30 nm TiO 2 compact layer was deposited on FTO via spray pyrolysis at 450 °C from a precursor solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis-(acetylacetonate) in anhydrous ethanol. After being sprayed, the substrates were left at 450 °C for 45 min and left to cool to room temperature. Then, a mesoporous TiO 2 layer was deposited by spincoating for 20 s at 4000 rpm with a ramp of 2000 rpm s -1 , using a 30 nm particle paste (Dyesol 30 NR-D) diluted in ethanol to achieve a 150-200 nm thick layer. After the spin-coating, the substrates were dried at 100 °C for 10 min and then sintered again at 450 °C for 30 min under dry air flow. Li-doping of mesoporous TiO 2 , as described elsewhere,  31  is accomplished by spin-coating a 0.1 M solution of Li-TFSI in acetonitrile at 3000 rpm for 10 s followed by another sintering step at 450 °C for 30 min. After being cooled to 150 °C, the substrates were immediately transferred in a nitrogen atmosphere glovebox to deposit the perovskite films. Perovskite Precursor Solution and Film Preparation. The organic cations were purchased from Dyesol, the lead compounds from TCI, and CsI from abcr GmbH. The triple cation perovskite precursor solutions were prepared from a precursor solution containing FAI (1 M), PbI 2 (1.1 M), MABr (0.2 M), and PbBr 2 (0.2 M) in anhydrous DMF/DMSO 4:1 (v/v).  51, 52  Then CsI, which was predissolved in DMSO, was added to this perovskite precursor to achieve the 5 mol % triple cation composition. We note that this composition contains a lead excess as reported elsewhere.  12  The perovskite solution was spin-coated in a two-step program at 1000 and 6000 rpm for 10 and 20 s, respectively. During the second step, 100 μL of chlorobenzene was poured on the spinning substrate 5 s prior to the end of the program. Films with Cs-containing perovskite turned dark immediately after spin-coating. The substrates were then annealed (at 100 °C) for 1 h in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Hole-Transporting Layer and Top Electrode. After the perovskite was annealed, the substrates were cooled for few minutes and a spiro-MeOTAD (Merck) solution (70 mM in chlorobenzene) was spincoated at 4000 rpm for 20 s. Spiro-MeOTAD was doped with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, Sigma-Aldrich), tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III) tris-(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209, Dynamo), and 4-tertbutylpyridine (TBP, Sigma-Aldrich). The molar ratio of additive spiro-MeOTAD was 0.5, 0.03, and 3.3 for Li-TFSI, FK209, and TBP, respectively. Finally, 70-80 nm of the Au top electrode was thermally evaporated under high vacuum. The active area of the device, as defined by the overlap of Au and FTO electrodes, was 0.26 cm -2 . The Cr interlayer between spiro-MeOTAD and Au was thermally evaporated. The vacuum was not broken between evaporation of Cr and Au. J-V and Stability Measurements. The initial efficiency of the record devices was measured under AM 1.5G illumination provided by 450 W xenon lamp (Oriel) fitted with a Schott K113 Tempax filter (Prazisions Glas & Optik GmbH). The light intensity was calibrated with a Si photodiode equipped with an IR cutoff filter (KG3, Schott). All the other J-V curves were measured with a Biologic SP 300 potentiostat under a 1 sun equivalent white LED lamp. The light intensity of the LED lamp was adjusted so that the stabilized J sc of the devices matched their stabilized J sc measured under aforementioned calibrated xenon lamp setup. The devices were masked to 0.16 cm 2 , cooled to 20 °C, and flushed with nitrogen with an in-house developed sample holder. The stability measurements were performed by tracking the maximum power point of the devices illuminated with a white 1 sun equivalent LED lamp with a Biologic SP 300 potentiostat. The MPP was updated every 60 s by a standard perturb and observe method. The temperature of the devices was precisely controlled with a Peltier element in direct contact with the films, and the temperature was measured via a surface thermometer inserted between the Peltier element and the film. Before the beginning of each experiment, J-V curves of the devices were measured (at 10 mV s -1 ). Additionally, J-V curves were taken every 15 min (at 100 mV s -1 ; only backward scan) during the aging in order to track the evolution of J-V metrics. Finally, several hours after the end of the experiment, the J-V characteristics of the devices were remeasured (the devices being stored in the dark, at 20 °C, and under nitrogen flow between the measurements). The experiment shown in Figure  4  with Au electrode removal was performed in the following way. Two devices (pixels) were fabricated on one substrate. J-V characteristics of both pixels were measured, and subsequently, the Au electrode was removed from one pixel. The devices were left in the dark under a nitrogen flow and at 75 °C overnight. Subsequently, the pixel aged with Au was remeasured, and then it had the electrode removed. Finally, the Au electrode was redeposited on both pixels (the process took approximately 1.5 h), and their J-V characteristics were remeasured immediately and then measured again after 7 h or recovery in the dark, under nitrogen flow and 20 °C. ToF-SIMS Spectrometry. A dual-beam ToF-SIMS V (IONTOF) was used with Cs + primary ions (1 keV, 65 to 72 nA, 250 × 250 μm 2 ) for the erosion and a Bi + pulsed primary ion beam for the analysis (30 keV, 1.2 pA, 100 × 100 μm 2 ). The analysis area was centered inside the cesium raster area. The noninterlaced mode was used, with 2.5 s sputtering after each bismuth analysis cycle (128 × 128 pixels). The gold electrodes were connected to the sample holder with carbon tape for a better charge compensation using the electron flood gun. The analyzer reflectron voltage was adjusted 25 V over the cutoff voltage on the secondary ion image. The depth profiles (Figures  3a  and S7 ) were normalized to the SnO 2 -signal (from the FTO substrate). The SnO 2 -interface of the control devices was used as a reference for the fluence scale on each batch of samples. Indeed, the deposited layer thicknesses are similar, although small variations of the cesium sputtering current and of the interface positions are expected in the same batch of measurements. It is important to note that the relative fluence scale of the subsequent layers does not reflect their actual thickness. The apparent thickness of each layer depends on the erosion rate of the cesium primary ion beam in different materials. Although ToF-SIMS is a sensitive analytical technique, the relative secondary ion intensities cannot be related to their relative concentration/amount because it depends on their ionization probability. For a given departing secondary ion, the ionization probability depends on factors such as the surrounding chemical element or the probability of neutralization when it escapes the surface.  49  Hence, a meaningful comparison can only be made for the same element within the same layers for different devices. ToF-SIMS analysis was performed on devices based on FA 0.83 MA 0.17 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 . However, the formulation of the later devices used for aging experiments contained a small addition of Cs. We found identical degradation patterns (Figure  S10 ) for both types of devices, and hence, we concluded that the addition of a small amount of Cs to the perovskite blend does not affect the phenomena of metal-induced degradation of PSCs. ICP Spectrometry. The Au electrodes of complete devices were removed from the samples with a piece of scotch tape. This step was repeated three times using a fresh piece of tape each time. Subsequently, the samples were cut into three pieces (the areas of the electrodes were cut off the central piece), and only the central region which contained the active area was taken for further processing. Next, the samples were immersed in a bath of chlorobenzene for 5 min in order to dissolve the spiro-MeOTAD layer with any remains of Au. Then, each sample was rinsed with chlorobenzene individually, dried, and, finally, placed in a vial containing 10 mL of 4:1 HCl (37%)/HNO 3 (67%) aqua regia. The vials were subsequently sonicated for 1 min, and the samples were left overnight to dissolve. The ICP analysis was performed with Shhimadzu ICPE-9000 on the aqua regia solution diluted in a 1:1 ratio with water. The detection limit for Au was ∼1 ng in 20 mL of the solution. The active area of the device, as defined by the overlap of Au and FTO electrodes in the central part of the device, was 0.26 cm 2 . SEM, XRD, and UV-Visible Absorption Spectrometry. A Zeiss Merlin HR-SEM was used to characterize the morphology of asfabricated device cross sections. XRD and absorption measurements were performed on complete devices, just prior to evaporation of the Au contact. Following Au contact evaporation and subsequent aging, the Au electrode was removed from the devices with a piece of scotch tape and XRD and absorption characterization were repeated. Hence, the aging, absorption, and XRD data shown here were obtained physically from the same devices. XRD analysis was performed using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154178 nm) at a scanning rate of 2°min -1 in the 2θ range from 11 to 40°and separately with a rate of 0.5°min -1 in the range from 12.5 to 15°. UV-visible absorption measurements were performed on a Varian Cary 5.

Perovskite Solar Cells
Two-dimensional hybrid perovskites are used as absorbers in solar cells. Our first-generation devices containing (PEA) 2 (MA) 2 [Pb 3 I 10 ] (1; PEA = C 6 H 5 (CH 2 ) 2 NH 3 + , MA= CH 3 NH 3 + ) show an open-circuit voltage of 1.18 V and a power conversion efficiency of 4.73 %. The layered structure allows for high-quality films to be deposited through spin coating and high-temperature annealing is not required for device fabrication. The 3D perovskite (MA)[PbI 3 ] (2) has recently been identified as a promising absorber for solar cells. However, its instability to moisture requires anhydrous processing and operating conditions. Films of 1 are more moisture resistant than films of 2 and devices containing 1 can be fabricated under ambient humidity levels. The larger bandgap of the 2D structure is also suitable as the higher bandgap absorber in a dual-absorber tandem device. Compared to 2, the layered perovskite structure may offer greater tunability at the molecular level for material optimization.
Three-dimensional (3D) hybrid perovskites of the form (MA) [PbX 3 ] (MA = CH 3 NH 3 + ; X = Cl, Br, or I) have recently emerged as promising absorbers for solar cells.  [1]  The first reported perovskite solar cell with (MA)[PbI 3 ] showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.81 %.  [1a]  Rapid material and device optimization has led to PCEs exceeding 15 % in just a few years.  [2]  Though progress in device efficiencies has been remarkable, the lead-halide perovskites have two main drawbacks: the toxicity of the water-soluble source of lead and the instability of the material to atmospheric moisture. Recently, the lead perovskite was replaced by the significantly less toxic tin analogue in solar cells with efficiencies of up to approximately 6 %.  [3]  However, the moisture sensitivity of the lead perovskite has not yet been addressed. Motivated by our observations that the structurally related two-dimensional (2D) perovskites readily formed high-quality films that appeared more resistant to humidity than the 3D analogues, we sought to assess if the layered materials could function as solar-cell absorbers. Herein, we report the structure of the layered perovskite (PEA) 2 (MA) 2 [Pb 3 I 10 ] (1; PEA = C 6 H 5 (CH 2 ) 2 NH 3 + ) that can act as an absorber in a solar cell with an open-circuit voltage of 1.18 V and a PCE of 4.73 %. Although our first-generation devices have lower efficiencies than current solar cells with 3D perovskite absorbers, the layered structure brings distinct advantages. In contrast to (MA)[PbI 3 ] (2), high-quality films of 1 can be obtained through one-step spin coating under ambient conditions without annealing. Films of 1 are also more resistant to moisture compared to 2, and devices containing 1 can be fabricated under humid conditions. Importantly, the layered structure affords greater tunability, which may provide additional routes for material optimization. Layered perovskites can be structurally derived from the 3D analogue by slicing along specific crystallographic planes.  [4]  The interlayer separation and thickness of the inorganic layers can be controlled through the choice of organic cations.  [5]  The inorganic layers of most layered perovskites comprise a single sheet (n = 1) of corner-sharing metal-halide octahedra sandwiching layers of organic cations.  [4]  These 2D materials do not have electronic properties typically associated with good solar-cell absorbers. Along with larger bandgaps compared to the 3D analogue (n = 1), the spatial confinement of the 2D structure and dielectric mismatch between organic and inorganic layers lead to strongly bound excitons with low mobility.  [6]  Such tightly bound excitons are difficult to dissociate into free carriers at room temperature and the localized charge carriers are unlikely to reach the electron/hole selective contacts in a typical solarcell geometry. To access the more favorable electronic properties of the 3D structure, we sought an intermediate structure between the n = 1 and n = 1 materials. We synthesized the n = 3 member of the series (PEA) 2 (MA) nÀ1 [Pb n I 3n+1 ] (n = number of Pb-I sheets in each inorganic layer), by combining (PEA)I, (MA)I, and PbI 2 in a 2:2:3 stoichiometric ratio in a solvent mixture of nitromethane/acetone. Slow solvent evaporation afforded dark red crystals of (PEA) 2 (MA) 2 [Pb 3 I 10 ] (1), the first crystallographically characterized n = 3 lead perovskite (Figure  1 ). Decreasing the dimensionality of the inorganic components from the 3D structure causes an increase in the bandgap and the exciton binding energy. The reported n = 1 and 2 structures have bandgaps of 2.57 and 2.32 eV, respectively, and exciton absorption bands at 2.35 and 2.15 eV, respectively.  [7]  Their exciton binding energies can be estimated as the difference between bandgap and exciton absorption energies to be 220 and 170 meV for the n = 1 and 2 structures, respectively.  [7]  Absorbance measurements of 1 show the exciton band at 2.06 eV, which lies close to an estimated bandgap of approximately 2.1 eV, indicating that the exciton binding energy is significantly smaller and close to the value of 2 (circa 40 meV).  [6]  The bandgap of 1 is larger than that of 2 (1.61 eV)  [8]  and larger than the ideal value of 1.34 eV calculated by Shockley and Queisser for the highest efficiency obtainable by a single-junction solar cell (circa 34 %).  [9]  However, 1 can absorb a significant fraction of the solar spectrum to afford a theoretical PCE of approximately 20 %. The bandgap of 1 is also close to the ideal value (1.9 eV) for the higher bandgap absorber in a dual-absorber tandem device,  [10]  which can exceed the Shockley-Queisser limit.  [11]  High-quality films of 1 can be deposited from precursor solutions through one-step spin coating. Similar processing of 2 does not afford continuous films (see Figure  S1  in the Supporting Information). The layered structure of 1 likely aids film formation: unlike 2 that crystallizes as rhombic dodecahedra at room temperature,  [12]  1 forms plates (Figure  S2 ). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of films of 1 show reflections indicating a preferential orientation of crystallites (Figure  2 , top). To confirm the n = 3 perovskite structure in these films, we scraped the films into a powder, loaded it into a glass capillary, and obtained unoriented PXRD patterns (Figure  2 , middle). These unoriented PXRD data show the reflections calculated from the single-crystal Xray structure of 1 (Figure  2 , bottom). The absorption spectrum of films of 1 shows exciton absorption bands at 2.06, 2.19, and 2.41 eV (Figure  S4 ). We assign the peak at 2.06 eV to the n = 3 material. The peaks at 2.19 and 2.41 eV match the exciton absorption energies of the n = 2 and n = 1 structures, respectively.  [5c, 13]  These phases are not visible in the PXRD patterns of films of 1, suggesting defect layers of less than n = 3 within the structure. Small amounts of n = 1 and 2 phases can show in the absorption spectrum because of the high oscillator strength of excitons in these materials.  [13]  Slight shoulders at 1.94 and 1.87 eV may be caused by trace amounts of n = 4 and 5 phases, respectively. The absorption spectrum does not show peaks corresponding to 2 (Figure  S4 ). When excited at 2.54 eV, the emission spectrum of 1 shows a peak at 1.68 eV (Figure  S5 ). This energy lies between the emission maxima for 2D perovskites with lower values of n (n = 1 at 2.36 eV  [13]  and n = 2 at 2.15 eV  [14]  ) and the 3D perovskite (n = 1 at 1.58 eV). A weak emission at 2.36 eV is likely because of photoluminescence (PL) from n = 1 layers. Devices utilizing 1 as the absorber were constructed employing TiO 2 as the electron-selective contact and 2,2',7,-7'-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as the hole-selective contact. Films of 1 were deposited from a N,N-dimethylformamide solution containing stoichiometric quantities of PbI 2 , (MA)I, and (PEA)I using a single spin-coating step. Importantly, devices containing 1 can be processed in humid air, which does not affect film quality or device performance. In contrast, devices with 2 must be processed under low-humidity levels for optimal performance. High-quality films of 2 also require high-temperature thermal evaporation  [2b]  or multistep deposition methods, such as heat-assisted conversion of spincoated PbI 2 films to the perovskite through exposure to (MA)I solution  [15]  or vapor,  [2a]  or simultaneous deposition of PbCl 2 and (MA)I and high-temperature annealing.  [16]  A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a fully constructed device is shown in Figure  3  A. Typical thicknesses of TiO 2 , 1, spiro-OMeTAD, and gold layers are 50, 425, 125, and 75 nm, respectively. We obtained current-voltage (JV) curves of these devices using simulated AM1.5G solar illumination (Figure  3 B ). The open-circuit voltages (V oc ) for these devices  routinely exceed 1.0 V; the best device shows a value of 1.18 V. Owing to the larger bandgap of the 2D material, these V oc values are higher than for cells containing 2 (highest reported V oc = 0.924-1.07 V).  [2a-c, 15]  The increase in V oc value of approximately 0.1 eV correlates well with the measured 0.1 eV increase in the peak PL energy (Figure  S5 ), indicating that carriers are extracted from the same energy levels where radiative recombination occurs. The JV curve characteristics of these devices are sensitive to measurement speed. Faster scan rates afforded a maximum current density of 11.53 mA cm À2 , a V oc value of 1.21 V, and a PCE of 7.02 %, but the forward and reverse scans showed a large hysteresis (Figure  S8 ). Similar effects have been detected in thin-film devices with 2.  [17]  To minimize these effects, the current densities were measured at each voltage after a delay period (70 s) to allow the current to approach steady-state conditions (Figure  S9 ). Even at this slow measurement rate, there is a slight overestimation of photocurrent near the maximum-power point as a result of slow, capacitive effects. We therefore fit the data to the characteristic solar-cell equation (Figure  S9 ) in order to obtain more reliable values of 0.60 for the fill factor (FF) and 4.73 % for the PCE. The current density under short-circuit conditions (J sc ) is 6.72 mA cm À2 . The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum matches the profile of the absorption spectrum of 1 (Figure  S10 ). The integrated current from the EQE spectrum yields a net current density of 7.47 mA cm À2 , corroborating the J sc value obtained through steady-state measurements. We calculate an internal quantum efficiency of 70 %, assuming 10 % parasitic absorbance by non-absorber components of the device. This indicates that charge extraction could be limited, caused likely by the layered structure of 1, which has no direct path between adjacent inorganic layers. Low-dimensional inorganic materials have previously been effectively used in photovoltaic devices,  [18]  and device optimization should afford improvements in J sc values and overall efficiency. Upon exposure to ambient humidity at room temperature, opaque black films of 2 convert into a translucent yellow solid.  [12b, 19]  Finished devices containing 2 can be encapsulated to avoid exposure to water. However, inherent stability to moisture will likely be necessary for large-scale manufacture or for achieving the long lifetimes required for broad commercialization. To compare the stability of 1 and 2 to moisture, we exposed spin-coated films of both materials to humidity-controlled environments. Because direct spin coating results in poor-quality, discontinuous films of 2 (denoted 2 a), we also formed higher-quality films of (MA)[PbI 3 ] (denoted 2 b) by depositing a 1:3 molar ratio of PbCl 2 :(MA)I and annealing the films at 100 8C.  [16]  All films were exposed to a relative humidity level of 52 % for up to approximately 40 days and their PXRD patterns were periodically recorded (Figure  4 ). Upon humidity exposure, the PXRD patterns of 2 a and 2 b show a new phase after circa 4-5 days, which can be indexed to the PXRD pattern of PbI 2 (Figure  S11 ). These new reflections completely dominate the PXRD patterns after approximately 40 days. Absorption spectra of 2 a and 2 b show a decrease in absorbance near the bandgap and an increase in absorbance above 2.4 eV (Figures  S12  and 13 ) as the higherbandgap PbI 2 phase grows as yellow patches on the films (Figure  S14 ). In contrast, the PXRD pattern of 1 does not show additional reflections over a period of 46 days of humidity exposure and the absorption spectra show no significant changes over this time (Figure  S15 ). We show that a layered Pb-I perovskite can act as a solarcell absorber. The n = 3 perovskite takes an intermediate  position between n = 1 perovskites with strongly bound excitons and n = 1 perovskites with weakly bound excitons. Strongly bound excitons in n = 1 Pb-I perovskites lead to green PL,  [20]  and green electroluminescence,  [14, 21]  and we recently reported on broadband white PL from Pb-Br perovskites.  [22]  In contrast, weakly bound excitons and shallow trap states could contribute to the unusually long carrier diffusion lengths seen in n = 1 perovskites.  [23]  These dramatic changes in electronic properties as a function of the structural evolution from n = 1 to n = 1 are of both fundamental and technological interest. Solar cells containing 1 display PCEs up to 4.73 %. Though devices containing 2 have exceeded PCEs of 15 %,  [2a-c]  their moisture sensitivity remains a concern for large-scale device fabrication or their long-term use. The layered structure of 1 aids the formation of high-quality films that show greater moisture resistance compared to 2. The larger bandgap of 1 also affords a higher V OC value of 1.18 V compared to devices with 2. Further improvements in material structure and device engineering, including making appropriate electronic contact with the anisotropic inorganic sheets, should increase the PCEs of these devices. In particular, higher values of n as single-phase materials or as mixtures may allow for lower bandgaps and higher carrier mobility in the inorganic layers while the organic layers provide additional tunability. For example, hydrophobic fluorocarbons could increase moisture stability, conjugated organic layers could facilitate charge transport, and organic photosensitizers could improve the absorption properties of the material. We are focused on manipulating this extraordinarily versatile platform through synthetic design.

Abbreviations used: PEA = phenylethylammonium, MA = methylammonium, spiro-OMeTAD = 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)9,9′spirobifluorene (PEA)I Unstabilized HI was purified using a 0.36-M tributyl phosphate solution in chloroform. After 3-5 extractions a clear, colorless solution was obtained. The HI solution was added dropwise to a cold (0 °C), stirred solution of phenylethylamine (5.0 mL, 40 mmol) in ethanol (5.0 mL) until a colorless precipitate formed. The solid was filtered through paper and washed repeatedly with diethyl ether. Cooling a hot (60 °C), saturated isopropanol solution of the solid to -10 °C afforded (PEA)I in ca. 90% yield. 
 (MA)I Purified HI was added dropwise to a 2.0-M solution of methylamine (10 mL, 20 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the colorless solid was washed repeatedly with diethyl ether and recrystallized in isopropanol as described above to afford (MA)I in 60% yield. (PEA) 2 (MA) 2 [Pb 3 I 10 ] (1) films Solid (PEA)I (144 mg, 0.578 mmol), (MA)I (92.0 mg, 0.578 mmol), and PbI 2 (400 mg, 0.868 mmol) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (0.87 mL) and filtered through paper. This solution was deposited on the substrate (60 L) and spun at 3000 rpm for 45 seconds. This procedure was used for device fabrication, powder x-ray diffraction, and optical measurements.   2 .30 mg, 0.0145 mmol), and PbI 2 (10.0 mg, 0.0217 mmol) were dissolved in acetone (10 mL) and nitromethane (5 mL). Solid NaI (6.50 mg, 0.0434 mmol) was added to this solution to enhance solubility. Slow solvent evaporation over 6 days afforded dark red, plate-shaped crystals suitable for x-ray structure determination. Anal. Calcd. for 1: C, 9.83; N, 2.55; H,  1.65.

 Device fabrication Substrate Preparation. Devices were fabricated on FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) coated glass slides (  15 Ωsq -1 ). The FTO was removed from one edge of the substrate to avoid a shunt pathway upon contacting the finished device with the anode. Scotch tape was applied as a mask and the FTO in the unmasked area was etched with Zn powder and 2-M HCl. These etched substrates were sequentially cleaned with Extran detergent, acetone, isopropanol, and oxygen plasma. The TiO 2 hole-blocking layer was deposited by spray pyrolysis. Titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (3.0 mL, 6.2 mmol) was diluted in ethanol (27 mL) and sprayed on the FTO substrates maintained at 500 °C. The substrates were cooled to room temperature, heated at 70 C for 0.5 h in a 0.04-M aqueous solution of TiCl 4 , and then washed in deionized water. Top contacts. A film of 1 was spincoated on the TiO 2 /FTO substrate as described above (ca. 425 nm thick). A solution containing 12 mol% pre-oxidized spiro-OMeTAD was made by combining spiro(TFSI) 2 (spiro-OMeTAD oxidized with silver bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) 1 (12 mg, 0.007 mmol) and as-purchased spiro-OMeTAD (62 mg, 0.051 mmol) in chlorobenzene (1 mL) and heating at 75 C for 1 h. Upon cooling, a 1.9-M lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide solution in acetonitrile (17.5 L) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (28.8 L, 0.197 mmol) were added and the solution was filtered through a 2-m PTFE syringe filter. This solution was deposited at 4000 rpm over the film of 1. A gold contact was then deposited by thermal evaporation at 10 -6 -10 -7 Torr and a deposition rate of 0.1 nm/s. 
 Device characterization Current-voltage (JV) curves were collected using a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination from a xenon lamp that was calibrated by a reference silicon diode. Fast scans were performed by reducing the delay time between voltages to 10 -3 s. Steady-state measurements were collected by holding the device at sequential voltages for 70 s and allowing for the current density to reach a constant value. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices was measured as a function of wavelength using a Keithley 236 source meter. A Princeton Instruments SpectraPro 150 monochromator was used with a 100-W tungsten lamp from Newport to provide the excitation light. Data were collected every 5 nm with an integration time of 2 s. An internal quantum efficiency value was calculated from the EQE data and absorption data (collected using an integrating sphere and the same equipment used to collect the EQE spectrum). 
 Powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) Experiments on oriented films were conducted on a Panalytical X'Pert Pro diffractometer with a Bragg-Brentano geometry and PIXCEL 1D detector equipped with a nickel filter. Experimental conditions are given in Table  S1 . Unoriented scans were collected on powders loaded into a 0.1-mm diameter glass capillary on a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer using monochromated Mo K 1 (0.71073 Å) radiation and a PHOTON 100 area detector. Images were collected and integrated using the APEX2 software package. 
 Crystal structure determination Crystals were coated with Paratone-N oil, attached to a Kapton loop, and transferred to a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer equipped with a Photon 100 CMOS detector. Frames were collected using ω and ψ scans and the unit-cell parameters were refined against all data. Data were integrated and corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects using SAINT 8.27b, and were corrected for absorption effects using SADABS V2012.  2  The space-group assignment was based upon systematic absences, E-statistics, agreement factors for equivalent reflections, and successful refinement of the structure. The structure was solved by the charge-flipping method implemented in OLEX2.  3  It was refined against all data using SHELXTL and OLEX2 software.  3, 4  Hydrogen atoms were inserted at idealized positions and refined using a riding model with an isotropic thermal parameter 1.2 or 1.5 times that of the attached carbon or nitrogen atom, respectively. Thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Due to similar electron density and equivalent geometry, definitive assignment of the nitrogen and carbon atoms in the methylammonium groups was not possible. Current assignments are based on improved statistics and thermal-ellipsoid shape. Three out of the four methylammonium ions do not show any evidence of positional disorder, although carbon/nitrogen disorder cannot be ruled out with the current data. The fourth methyl ammonium group is disordered in two different positions. This group was modeled using similarity restraints on 1,2-distances as well as rigid-bond restraints for anisotropic displacement parameters. The occupancies of the disordered groups were allowed to refine freely while constraining the sum of the occupancies to unity. Similar rigid-bond restraints were also applied to atoms not involved in the disorder to stabilize the refinement. Details regarding data quality and a summary of the residual values of the refinements are listed in Table  S2 . 
 Optical measurements Transmission measurements were collected on a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Emission spectra were collected on films using a Horiba Jobin-Yvon Spex Fluorolog-3 fluorimeter equipped with a 450-W xenon lamp and a thermoelectrically-cooled R928P detector. Incident light was passed through a double-grating monochromator and data were collected using the FluorEssence 2.3.15 software. 
 Humidity studies Perovskites films deposited on clean quartz slides (ca. 900 nm thick) were placed inside sealed glass jars containing a saturated solution of Mg(NO 3 ) 2 , exposing them to a relative-humidity level of 52%.  5  The films were not in direct contact with the solution and were periodically analyzed with PXRD (Figure  4 ).        1 ) as the absorber. The steady-state current density at each voltage was used to construct a JV curve (inset) and the data were fitted to the characteristic solar cell equation 6 (shown at the bottom of the figure) to find J sc , V oc , FF, and PCE. I is current, I SC is short-circuit current, I 0 is reverse-saturation current, V is applied voltage, R S is series resistance, n is the diode ideality factor, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and R SH is shunt resistance.

Suppressed Halide Ion Migration in 2D Lead Halide Perovskites
Two-dimensional (2D) lead halide perovskites represent an emerging class of materials given their tunable optoelectronic properties and long-term stability in perovskite solar cells. In order to assess the halide ion mobility, we have tracked the changes in the bromide and iodide composition in physically paired 2D lead halide perovskite films of different layer numbers (n = 10-1). These low-dimensional perovskites suppressed halide ion migration as a result of their intercalated spacer ligands and their strong van der Waals interactions. The rate constants for halide exchange of low dimensionality perovskites follow the Arrhenius relationship with thermal activation energy ranging from 58 kJ/mol (n = 10) to 72 kJ/mol (n = 1). The suppression of halide ion mobility (and diffusion coefficient) with modulating perovskite layer number (n) provides further insight into the role of 2D perovskites in improving the performance of photovoltaic devices.
A s an alternative to three-dimensional (3D) ABX 3 lead halide perovskites, two-dimensional (2D), e.g., the Ruddlesden-Popper phase, perovskites have drawn attention in stabilizing solar cells.  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  The tunable layer number (n) in the 2D perovskites with R 2 A n-1 B n X 3n+1 (R: intercalating cation) provides flexibility in tailoring optoelectronic properties such as tunable bandgap energy, exciton binding energy, and emission wavelength across the entire visible.  3, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]  Furthermore, as a result of the intercalated organic spacer ligands, 2D and 2D/3D heterostructure perovskite solar cells also exhibit suppressed halide ion migration and enhanced long-term device stabilities against moisture and heat under operating conditions.  [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17]  Halide ion mobility in lead halide perovskites that arise from soft, ionic crystalline lattices remains a topic of recent debate since it directly affects the perovskite device performances.  [18] [19] [20] [21]  Specifically, the mixed halide perovskite films undergo halide phase segregations under continuous light irradiation, and the original mixed halide composition is restored upon stopping the illumination.  [22] [23] [24]  Several mechanistic models have been proposed to explain the intriguing, reversible photoinduced phase segregation and dark recovery, including polaron-induced lattice strain,  25  two-state thermodynamic model,  26  and defect-driven halide ion movement.  22, [27] [28] [29]  In a recent study, we have shown that the halide ion mobility under light irradiation originates from hole trapping at the iodide site, and there is a threshold for energy of photo-excitation that is needed to overcome the entropy of mixing.  22, 30, 31  The increase in stability, despite the trade-off of lower efficiency, has fueled the utilization of 2D lead halide perovskites in solar cells and optoelectronic devices.  32  However, the halide ion mobility in two-dimensional metal halide perovskites has been less studied as compared to 3D perovskites. Temperature-dependent conductivity measurements have provided some insight of halide ion movement in low-dimensional perovskites. An activation energy of 41 ± 7 meV was estimated for the electronic conduction in the dark and under illumination.  28, 33  The complex interplay between ionic and electronic conductivity dictated by different temperature regimes is still under discussion. In a previous study we have demonstrated a solid-state halide ion exchange in the paired 3D MAPbBr 3 /MAPbI 3 films by tracking absorption changes with time.  34  Upon being subjected to thermal activation, mechanically clamped films undergo the halide ion exchange across the interface. Strong temperaturedependent halide ion mobility (and diffusion coefficient) in these 3D systems follows the Arrhenius relationship with a thermal activation energy of 51 kJ/mol.  22, 34  A fundamental question that arises is how the dimensionality (n) affects the halide ion mobility within these 2D perovskites. In order to obtain a better understanding of halide ion mobility in low-dimensional perovskites, we have now probed halide ion movement in the 2D layered lead halide perovskites (n = 10-1). The halide ion mobility dependence on the perovskite layer number (n) can provide fundamental insight into designing perovskite devices with more desired properties. Halide Ion Homogenization in Paired 2D Halide Perovskite Films. One of the convenient ways to monitor halide ion mobility is to monitor the halide compositional changes through absorption and emission spectra.  [22] [23] [24] 26, 34, 35  Since the bandgap of mixed halide perovskite films shifts linearly with the ratio of halides (e.g., Br:I in MAPbBr x I 3-x ), we can monitor the changes in the onset of the absorption peak.  30, 36  In order to investigate the effect of dimensionality (n) of 2D layered perovskite on the halide ion mobility, 2D lead halide perovskite films with tunable layer numbers (n = 10-1) were prepared using the experimental procedure reported previously (see the Supporting Information).  1, 2, 6  Stable 2D lead halide perovskite films with tunable layer numbers of n = 10, 6, 3-2, and 1 were obtained by varying the cation ratio of methylammonium:phenylethylammonium (MA:PEA) of 80:20, 66:33, 33:66, and 0:100, respectively. The corresponding layer number (n) of 2D lead halide (bromide and iodide) perovskite films was assigned based on the exciton absorption peak position.  3, 6, 8, 9, [37] [38] [39]  The absorption spectra of 2D lead bromide and lead iodide perovskite films of different n values are presented in the Supporting Information. It is worth noting that 2D layered perovskite films (n<6) have a propensity for formation of mixed phases with different n values due to the similar formation enthalpy of 2D layers (-50 ∼ -80 kJ/mol for the layer number of n = 1-5), as can be seen from Figure  S2 .  37  We probed the exchange of halide ions between 2D lead bromide and lead iodide films by pairing the two films with direct physical contact. The glass slides of different 2D perovskite films with the same layer number (n) but with different halides (viz., bromide on one slide and iodide on the other slide) were clamped together with binder clips. The physically paired films were placed on the temperaturecontrolled hot plate in the range of 23-140 °C. The clamped films were maintained at a constant temperature to induce migration of bromide and iodide across the two films. All halide ion exchange experiments were carried out ≤140 °C to avoid thermal-induced destabilization of the perovskites.  40  The absorption spectra of paired films (and separated film) were recorded periodically until the films are fully homogenized (i.e., the films attained halide equilibrium). Figures  1A  and 1B  show the absorption spectra of 2D lead halide (bromide and iodide) perovskite films with n = 10 and n = 1 before (spectra a and b) and after annealing (spectra a′ and b′) at 140 °C, respectively. For the films with n = 10, both excitonic absorption peaks were observed at 510 nm and at 735 nm corresponding to 2D lead bromide and lead iodide perovskites (Figure  1A ). The absorption characteristics of 2D perovskite films with n = 10 closely resemble those of the corresponding 3D perovskite films. When physically paired films of these two perovskites are subjected to thermal treatment for a period of 60 min, we induce migration of Br and I from one side to the other until both films are homogenized. Insets of Figure  1A  and Figure  S1  confirmed visual color changes of the films from greenish yellow (lead bromide) and from dark brown (lead iodide) to similar light brown (mixed halide composition) following homogenization. This observation is confirmed from the single characteristic peak at 615 nm in both films (spectra a′ and b′ in Figure  1 ). Similar absorption changes were observed for paired films with the single-layer 2D lead bromide and lead iodide perovskite films. The initial absorption maximum peaks at 405 nm for 2D lead bromide and at 515 nm for 2D lead iodide perovskites merged to produce a single absorption peak at 435 nm following homogenization at 140 °C (Figure  1B ). We also extended these thermally induced exchange of halides in 2D perovskites with n = 6, 3-2, and 1, respectively (Figures  S2  and 1B ). The thermally-activated halide ion movement across the interface of 2D lead halide films with the layer number of n can be described by eq 1.  + → - + - + - + ( Interestingly, all of the 2D perovskite films were fully homogenized at 140 °C within 60-120 min. To track the kinetics of halide ion exchange between bromide and iodide 2D perovskite films, absorption spectra were recorded at intermediate times. The representative spectra for 2D perovskite films with n = 10 and n = 1 are shown in Figures  2A  and 2B . With increasing annealing time, the absorption spectra show significant changes with the appearance of a new absorption band at 610 nm for 2D perovskite films with n = 10 (Figure  2A ) and 430 nm for perovskite films with n = 1 (Figure  2B ). The appearance of the new band confirms the formation of mixed halide composition as the films are homogenized. The changes in the absorption during the homogenization process are better visualized through difference absorption (ΔA) spectra. By subtracting the absorption spectrum (t = 0 min) from the spectra recorded at different times, we can observe the change in absorbance that occurs during the course of homogenization (Figure  2C  and D ). These spectra further highlight the disappearance of bromide and iodide 2D perovskite and appearance of a new band corresponding to the mixed halide formation. These spectral evolutions also point out that the time required for homogenization (or mixing of Br and I) for 2D perovskites with n = 1 is greater than n = 10. Activation Energy of Halide Exchange in 2D Perovskites. The mixing of halide ion (or homogenization) is an entropically-driven process as the mixed halide phase is thermodynamically more favorable.  26  The halide ion homogenization experiments (as described in Figure  2 ) were repeated with paired films with n = 10, 6, and 1 at different temperatures. The absorption changes at 495 nm with time at different temperatures (140-23 °C) show an increased rate of bromide disappearance from the 2D lead bromide perovskite (n = 10) film (Figure  3A ). The individual absorption (and difference absorption) spectra corresponding to these kinetic traces with n = 10 are shown in Figure  S3 . At room temperature (23 °C), we notice negligible change in absorption. However, the rate of homogenization of the two paired halide film increased with increasing temperature. Since the absorption shifted to shorter wavelengths upon mixing of iodide with bromide, we were able to track the change in the bandgap of the materials. As shown earlier,  30, 36  the bandgap of the mixed halide film directly correlates with the Br:I ratio. Figure  3B  shows the kinetic traces of rate of change in iodide (in 2D lead iodide perovskite film) as monitored from the shift in the bandgap with time. The bandgap was measured from the Tauc plots (Figure  S4 ) using the absorption spectra recorded at different temperatures (140-23 °C). The bandgap of pure 2D lead iodide film (∼1.6 eV) shifts to 1.9 eV as the film undergoes homogenization and attains mixed halide composition. The halide composition of mixed halide films after homogenization was further confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental analyses and mappings. Both 2D lead bromide and lead iodide films following homogenization at 140 °C for 1 h show homogeneous elemental distributions of Pb, Br, and I across the films along with equimolar ratio of Br:I = 1:1 (Figure  S5 ). These changes in absorption and EDS mapping confirmed the bidirectional movement of bromide and iodide in paired films and the rate of exchange of halide ions being dependent on the temperature. The pseudo-first-order rate constants (k, s -1 ) were determined from fitting all the traces shown in Figures  3A  and 3B  (absorption and Tauc plots) with monoexponential fits. The apparent rate constants for halide ion exchange in the films of n = 10 increased by 2 orders of magnitude from 1.75 × 10 -5 to 1.09 × 10 -3 s -1 (from absorption plots) and from 1.85 × 10 -5 to 1.15 × 10 -3 s -1 (from Tauc plots) upon increasing the annealing temperature from 60 to 140 °C. The temperature-dependent halide ion exchange rate constants were then analyzed using Arrhenius relationships (eq 2). = - + k E RT A ln( ) / ln( ) a (2) From the linear dependence of ln(k) versus 1/T (Figure  3C ), we determined an activation energy (E a ) for halide ion exchange to be 57.8 ± 2.4 kJ/mol (from change in absorption at 495 nm, Figure  3A ) and 59.5 ± 2.8 kJ/mol (from Tauc analysis, Figure  3B ), respectively. Similarity between these activation energy values further validates our analysis of tracking halide ion homogenization by monitoring the optical changes either in 2D lead bromide or 2D lead iodide in the paired films. We repeated the above temperature-dependent homogenization rate constant measurements for other 2D perovskite films (n = 6 and 1). The individual absorption spectra along with corresponding difference absorption spectra during homogenization were recorded for n = 6 (Figure  S6A-H ) and for n = 1 (Figures  2B, 2D  and S7A-F ). The absorption  changes in the paired 2D lead halide films with n = 6 (at 488 nm) and n = 1 (at 403 nm) as a function of annealing time at different temperatures (140-60 °C) and associated kinetic fits are shown in Figure  S8 . The Arrhenius plots (ln(k) versus 1/ T) of these two 2D perovskite films with n = 6 and 1 are compared with that of n = 10 in Figure  4A . The activation energy for halide exchange determined from these plots was 66.9 ± 0.6 kJ/mol (n = 6) and 71.5 ± 2.0 kJ/ mol (n = 1). It is evident that the activation energy increases with decreasing n value of the 2D perovskites. The activation energy as a function of the perovskite layer number (n), plotted in Figure  4B , shows a marked increase in the activation energy when the n value decreases from 10 to 1. Since 2D perovskites with n = 10 resemble that of bulk perovskite (n = ∞), we only see a small change in E a . The increased activation energy with the decreasing layer number of 2D perovskite (n < 10) shows the increased thermal barrier for the halide ion mobility in 2D perovskites as compared to their 3D counterparts. As one would expect, the intercalation of the bulky phenylethylammonium cation in 2D layered perovskite architectures hinders the halide ion mobility. During halide exchanges, the bromide and iodide halide ions diffuse in opposite directions. The bromide ions diffuse into iodide side, while the iodide ions move into the bromide side until the two physically paired films equilibrate with a nearly 50:50 Br:I composition. A simplified version of Fick's second law is employed to calculate the apparent diffusion coefficient (eq 3). The parameters evaluated from the halide exchange lifetime are listed in Table 1 τ = d l / 2 diffusion ( 3 ) where d is defined as the effective diffusion coefficient, l is defined as the diffusion length (average film thickness), and τ diffusion is defined as average lifetime of halide exchange. The diffusion length (l) corresponds to the distance between two centers of paired 2D lead halide films as there is only one directional movement for each halide ion diffusion (vice versa). The average film thickness of the films between n = 10 and n = 1 was determined to be 97 ± 15 nm from crosssectional SEM image analyses by averaging out the thickness of four films (Figure  S9 ). For the calculation of the diffusion coefficient, we employed a value of l = ∼100 nm. The diffusion coefficients summarized in Table  1  show that the 2D perovskite layer number (n) dictates the halide ion mobility. The diffusion coefficient values measured in the temperature range of 60-140 °C were in the range of 10 -15 -10 -13 cm 2 s -1 (Table  1 ). The film of n = 1 generally has a lower diffusion coefficient as compared to the film of n = 6 or n = 10 at the same temperature due to the increased fraction of organic layers suppressing halide ion movement. The observed values are consistent with the previous reports measured using absorption and emission spectroscopy.  34, 41  This suppressed halide ion mobility in 2D perovskites explains the improved stability one observes in perovskite solar cells with the introduction of a small amount of 2D perovskites.  16, 42  The apparent diffusion coefficient values for all perovskite films (n = 1, 6, 10) increased by 2 orders of magnitude with increasing the temperature from 60 °C to 140 °C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have shown that halide ion movement is facilitated by vacancy-mediated halide transport.  28, 33  The 2D lead halide perovskites which have higher halide vacancy formation energy (5.46 eV) than that of conventional 3D MAPbI 3 perovskites (3.44 eV) also contribute to the overall lower halide ion mobility.  28  During the halide ion homogenization discussed in the experiments above, we expect the halide ion diffusion to be affected by diffusion length, crystallinity of films, crystallographic grain boundary, and number of halide ion vacancy sites.  35  The crystallographic domain size and shape of the 2D lead halide perovskite films (between n = 10 and n = 1) employed in this study remain unchanged after homogenization (Figure  S10 ). The halide ion diffusion across the films is driven by thermal activation of vacancy-mediated halide ion movement. Scheme 1 compares the halide ion migrations (and exchange) across the interface of the paired 2D lead bromide and lead iodide perovskite films with different dimensionalities of n = 10 and 1. The halide ion mobility in the 2D architecture is reduced through the introduction of the organic cation between different layers within the film. The intercalated organic spacer ligands, thus, effectively suppress the halide ion mobility across the films, resulting in long-term stability of lowdimensional perovskite films. Similar stabilization aspects of 2D have been observed in the long-term operation of solar cells.  16, 28, 33  The comparison of halide mobility in the present study offers direct evidence for the suppressed mobility of halides in 2D perovskites.

In summary, a simple approach of pairing two dissimilar 2D perovskite films provides a means of tracking the halide ion movement. The halide ion movement can be tracked by recording the absorption spectra of the physically paired 2D lead halide perovskite films with different dimensionality of n = 10-1. The temperature-and layer-number-dependence of halide ion mobility sheds light on the overall stability of 2D lead halide films. Efforts are underway to elucidate the reversible photoinduced halide phase segregation and dark recovery in the 2D lead halide perovskites.

 2D Lead Halide Perovskite Films with different dimensionality (n). The preparation of 2D lead halide (bromide and iodide) perovskite films with tunable layer numbers of n = 10-1 follows the previously reported method in the literature.  [1] [2] [3]  FTO-coated glasses (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) were used as a substrate to make 2D layered perovskite films. The FTO substrates were cleaned with soapy water and sonicated in an ethanol bath for 20 min. After that, the substrates were rinsed additionally with excess isopropanaol and dried with air-stream at ambient conditions. To remove any organic residues, the FTO substrates were further treated with plasma for 10 minutes. The FTO substrates were then immediately transferred to a N 2 -filled glovebox for the deposition of lead halide films. The 2D perovskite films were prepared in the glove box (< 10 ppm H 2 O). The 2D lead bromide and iodide perovskite films were made through the same procedures except for the halide (X = Br and I) precursors employed for the synthesis. The mixed precursor solutions containing MAX, PEAX, and PbX 2 with a stoichiometric amount was used to control the dimensionality (n). The ratio of MAX:PEAX were systematically varied such as MA:PEA = 80:20 (n = 10), 66:33 (n = 6), 33:66 (n = 3-2), and 0:100 (n = 1), respectively. The mixed solutions dissolved in DMF:DMSO mixture with a 4:1 volumetric ratio were vigorously stirred for 1 hr at room temperature. The precursor solutions were then syringe-filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE membrane filter. The 2D lead halide perovskite films were acquired through static spin-casting of 50 μL of 0.6 M PbX 2 precursor solution followed by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 25 s with an acceleration of 1200 rpm. A 0.5 mL of chlorobenzene was rapidly injected as antisolvent after 10 seconds. After spin-casting process was completed, the perovskite films were transferred to using a hot plate and annealed at 100 °C for 5 minutes. The films were cooled down and stored inside of the glovebox until use. Halide Ion Homogenization Experiments. The 2D lead halide (bromide and iodide) perovskite films with different layer number of n = 10-1 were physically paired each other, clamped with binder clips, and then transferred to a pre-heated hot plate with different homogenization temperature (140-23 °C). Care was taken to keep the annealing temperature of the paired 2D lead halide perovskite films at constant temperature. The clamped films were then placed on a 
 S3 brass plate for direct-heating of the paired films. The temperature of the brass plate was monitored and controlled by adjusting the temperature of the hotplate. The clamped (or separated) films were periodically monitored during homogenization process. The completion of homogenization was visually inspected based upon the change of film colors and confirmed by spectroscopic measurements. Steady State Absorption Measurements. UV-Vis absorption spectra were obtained using a Varian Cary 50 bio spectrophotometer in the wavelength of 450-800 nm for 2D lead halide perovskite films with n = 10 and 350-700 nm for 2D lead halide perovskite films with n = 1. The difference absorption spectra were acquired by subtracting the absorption spectrum at 0 min (as a reference) from the absorption spectra acquired at different annealing (or homogenization) time. Tauc Plot Analysis in conjunction with Estimation of Bandgap energy. The absorption spectra were converted to Tauc plots using the equation of (αhν) 2 versus hν for the directlyallowed transitions materials. The straight line was fitted and extrapolated from the curvature onto X-axis to estimate the bandgap energy (E g ) of the perovskites during the course of homogenization at different temperature with time. Halide ion compositions were further analyzed based upon the bandgap energy of mixed lead iodide perovskite films with n = 10 determined from the Tauc plots (equations 1 and 2). The estimated bandgap energy (E g ) is determined to be 1.62 eV for pure 2D lead iodide film with n = 10, 2.24 eV for pure 2D lead bromide film with n = 10, and 1.93 eV for mixed 2D halide film with n = 10 (Br:I = 50:50). A simple Vegard's law with a linear interpolation is applied to approximate the halide composition. I composition (%) = [(2.24 -E g (mixed iodide film))/(0.62)] x 100 equation (1) Br composition (%) = 100 -I composition (%) equation (  2 ) Characterizations.

Figure  4 , the mean diameter of PbI2-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) complexes in the reference is measured to be 334.3 nm, while in the case NaF is added, the PbI2-DMSO complex diameter increases to 455.8 nm. We speculate that the stronger interaction between PbI2 and F leads to larger colloidal particles. Interestingly, the morphology of PbI2 films (Supplementary Figure  5 ) is also modified by NaF. Larger PbI2 crystals are formed if NaF is added, and the PbI2 film has a larger number of voids per unit volume, regardless of the annealing process. We attribute the increased void density to the inhomogeneity of the PbI2 precursor solution, caused by larger PbI2 colloidal particle sizes with the introduction of NaF. Such a ""porous PbI2"" film with larger grain size obtained by NaF addition may possess fewer nucleation sites, resulting in a reduced nucleation rate during perovskite formation. Hence the slower nucleation rate in a PbI2 film in the presence of NaF, results in a larger grain size in the perovskite film, if the growth rate is fixed, consistent with other reports  3  . perovskite semiconductor, the defect activation energy (Ea) can be calculated by the trap state energy level (ET) and the perovskite VBM energy level (EVBM) (Ea = ET -EVBM). Ea and the characteristic transition angular frequency (ω0) can be formulated in the following equation: ω0 = βT 2 exp(- 𝐸 𝑎 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 ), where β is a temperature dependent parameter, T is the temperature and kB is the Boltzmann's constant. The derivative of the capacitance spectrum can be used to determine ω0. According to this relation, the value of Ea can be obtained from the slope of the graph by fitting the Arrhenius formula: ln( ), where Vbi is the builtin potential, W is the depletion width, q is the elementary charge, C is the capacitance, and ω is the applied angular frequency. The Mott-Schottky junction was obtained by capacitancevoltage measurement, which was analyzed to obtain Vbi and W. According to the depletion approximation  12  , the C, Vbi, and W at the junction can be expressed in the relation： , where A is the active area, ε is the static permittivity of perovskite, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, N is the apparent doping profile in the depleted layer, and V is the applied bias. A Mott-Schottky plot ： O rganic-inorganic halide perovskites (ABX 3 , where A is an organic cation, such as methylamine (MA) or formamidine (FA); B is lead or tin; X is a halide ion) have emerged as exciting new materials for solar cells due to their unique combination of properties, such as strong light absorption 1 , superb charge carrier mobility  2  and low-cost fabrication  3  . Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have risen from 3.8% to a certified 23.7%  1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]  , close to that of crystalline silicon solar cells. In spite of the unparalleled growth in photovoltaic performance, the industrial application of PSCs is hampered by instability issues. One of the main sources of the instability is the defect chemistry of perovskites. In particular, owing to the ionic nature of perovskite materials  11  , as well as their solution-based fabrication processes, numerous defects are formed at the surfaces and grain boundaries of polycrystalline perovskite films  [12] [13] [14] [15]  . In particular, point defects such as halide anion vacancies and organic cation vacancies are easily produced in perovskite materials due to their low formation energies  [16] [17] [18]  . Although these defects mostly create shallow electronic levels near the band edges  8, 19  , they still have profound unwanted effects on carrier dynamics and the I-V hysteresis of PSCs  [20] [21] [22] [23]  . Even more importantly, such defects are believed to play an important role in the chemical degradation of the perovskite material and of the interfaces with the charge transport layers, leading to long-term instability of the PSCs  [24] [25] [26] [27]  . Ion vacancies diffuse into the crystallites, and promote the diffusion of cations and anions to the surfaces and grain boundaries. Decomposition reactions at these locations, such as evaporation of the organic species MA or FA, then lead to degradation of the material. Therefore, control and mitigation of the number of organic cation or halide anion vacancies has become an important research direction towards more efficient and stable PSCs. As organic components such as MA or FA easily evaporate from the surface during the thermal annealing process  11, 28  , thereby creating organic cation vacancies, one way to suppress the formation of such vacancies is to use excess MA/FA during or after the perovskite annealing process  29  . Another approach to prevent the formation of organic cation vacancies is to create a two-dimensional layered structure by introducing a small amount of larger organic molecules, such as phenethylamine, polyethylenimine and trifluoroethylamine, which are difficult to evaporate  30  . Similar methods have also been reported to be effective for passivating or suppressing halide anion vacancies  8, 31, 32  . Previously, iodide ions have been introduced into the organic cation solution, which decreases the concentration of iodide vacancies  8  . Elsewhere, guanidinium, an organic ion that probably forms hydrogen bonds, has been used to suppress the formation of iodide vacancies  31  . Addition of KI to perovskites has also demonstrated a positive effect of small alkali ions on Defects play an important role in the degradation processes of hybrid halide perovskite absorbers, impeding their application for solar cells. Among all defects, halide anion and organic cation vacancies are ubiquitous, promoting ion diffusion and leading to thin-film decomposition at surfaces and grain boundaries. Here, we employ fluoride to simultaneously passivate both anion and cation vacancies, by taking advantage of the extremely high electronegativity of fluoride. We obtain a power conversion efficiency of 21.46% (and a certified 21.3%-efficient cell) in a device based on the caesium, methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA) triple-cation perovskite (Cs 0.05 FA 0.54 MA 0.41 )Pb(I 0.98 Br 0.02 ) 3 treated with sodium fluoride. The device retains 90% of its original power conversion efficiency after 1,000 h of operation at the maximum power point. With the help of firstprinciples density functional theory calculations, we argue that the fluoride ions suppress the formation of halide anion and organic cation vacancies, through a unique strengthening of the chemical bonds with the surrounding lead and organic cations. passivating I -vacancies, which consequently improves the efficiency and stability of PSCs  [33] [34] [35]  . In addition, small ions (Cl and Cd) were doped into the perovskite lattice to suppress the formation of halide vacancies via lattice strain relaxation  26  . Although significant advances have been made in defect engineering of the bulk and grain boundaries of perovskites, most strategies focus on passivating or preventing only one type of defect, either the organic cation or the halide anion vacancy. Only recently, choline chloride was used to passivate both positive and negative charged defects by quaternary ammonium and halide ions  11  . This 'charged components compensation' provides a possible method of multi-vacancy defects passivation. 
 Cation and anion immobilization through chemical bonding enhancement with fluorides for stable halide perovskite solar cells 
 Nengxu Li Here we report a chemical bonding modulation of perovskite films by tuning the bond strength of the additives with the perovskites. We start from the state-of-the-art triple-cation perovskite (Cs 0.05 FA 0.54 MA 0.41 )Pb(I 0.98 Br 0.02 ) 3 absorber and add a small amount of alkali halide, NaX (X = I, Br, Cl or F), using a twostep solution process (for details, see Methods). Although all alkali halides improve the quality of the perovskite, the fluoride-containing material gives by far the best performance. Planar n-i-p solar cells made on the basis of the fluoride-containing perovskite yield a PCE of 21.46% (and a certified 21.3%-efficient solar cell). More importantly, non-encapsulated PSCs using the fluoride-containing materials exhibit an excellent long-term stability. They retain 90% of their original PCE after 1,000 h of continuous illumination under maximum power point (MPP) operating conditions, or under thermal stress of 85 °C. From results obtained with a wide range of experimental characterization techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we argue that the fluoride ions are very effective in passivating both the organic cation and halide anion vacancies by forming strong hydrogen bonds (N-H•••F) with organic cations (MA/FA) and strong ionic bonds with lead in the perovskite films. 
 Properties of CsFaMa-X films Passing through the halide series I, Br, Cl and F (Fig.  1a ), the electronegativity increases and the ionic radius becomes smaller. This leads to an increased chemical bonding between the halide anions with the A and B cations. In the following, we first compare the properties of the (Cs 0.05 FA 0.54 MA 0.41 )Pb(I 0.98 Br 0.02 ) 3 perovskite, modified by adding 0.1% NaX (X = I, Br, Cl, or F), to those of the unmodified perovskite as a reference. We denote the reference perovskite as 'CsFAMA' and the NaX-containing perovskite as 'CsFAMA-X' . Figure  1b  shows the reflectance micro-Fourier transform infrared spectra of CsFAMA and CsFAMA-X films. Compared to the reference CsFAMA, the spectrum of the CsFAMA-F film shows a substantial shift of the N-H vibration modes (3,500-3,350 cm -1 ) towards a lower wavenumber. This kind of shift is absent in the CsFAMA-X (X = I, Br, Cl) samples. We attribute this shift to the formation of hydrogen bonds N-H•••F between the FA/MA and F species  36  . This hydrogen bond results in a delocalization of the electronic cloud of the N-H bond. It weakens the N-H chemical bond, which decreases the corresponding vibrational frequency. Our solid-state 1 H NMR measurements also confirm the formation of hydrogen bonds between the fluoride and the MA ions, as evidenced by the larger chemical shift of NH 3 protons in the CsFAMA-F sample (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). These experimental findings are supported by DFT calculations (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). Our calculations show that the presence of a fluoride ion at the surface induces the reorientation of several adjacent FA cations, and the formation of N-H•••F hydrogen bonds. As a result, the stretching modes of the corresponding N-H groups shift to lower frequencies. Averaged over the stretching modes of all N-H groups of the affected FA ions, this leads to an overall shift of 63 cm -1 . DFT results also indicate that the inclusion of a sodium ion has negligible effects on these vibration modes, confirming that fluoride is responsible for the change in the vibration dynamics of the FA cations. As we will discuss later, the strong fluoride-organic cation interaction significantly stabilizes the perovskite surface and suppresses the formation of organic cation vacancies. The effects of NaX additives on the optical properties and the structure of the perovskite thin films are carefully investigated by a range of techniques. The bandgap of the CsFAMA-X films is the same as that of the reference CsFAMA, according to ultraviolet-visible and photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig.  1c ). Neither shifts in the peaks, nor new peaks are observed in the X-ray diffraction patterns (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), indicating that addition of NaX does not alter the crystal structure of the perovskite films. Whereas these basic optical and crystal structural properties of all CsFAMA-X films are similar, time-resolved PL (TRPL) results (Fig.  1d  and Supplementary Table  1 ) reveal an important difference in the lifetime of free charge carriers between the CsFAMA and the CsFAMA-X films. The CsFAMA-F sample exhibits carrier lifetimes (τ 1 : 97.16 ns, τ 2 : 401.64 ns) that are much longer than those of the CsFAMA reference (τ 1 : 30.82 ns, τ 2 : 193.29 ns). In contrast, the carrier lifetimes of the other CsFAMA-X (X = I, Br, Cl) samples are much closer to those of the reference. This implies that non-radiative recombination is effectively suppressed by the addition of fluoride. It should be noted here that another difference between the CsFAMA-X films can be found from field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images (Fig.  1f ). We observe that CsFAMA-Cl and CsFAMA-F films exhibit a slightly larger grain size than that of CsFAMA-Br and CsFAMA-I, which is probably due to the fact that the chloride and fluoride may influence the crystal nucleation and crystallization kinetics of perovskites (Supplementary Figs.  4  and 5 ). As shown from the TRPL results above and thermal stability properties in the following paragraph, the effect of the NaF additive is much more pronounced than that of NaCl, implying that the larger grain size, while a contributing factor, does not explain all of the improvements found in CsFAMA-F films. We explore the thermal stability of the perovskite films by maintaining them at 85 ο C in a nitrogen atmosphere, followed by a thermal annealing at 100 °C in air. During these ageing tests, we monitor the relative content of PbI 2 via X-ray diffraction patterns (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), given that PbI 2 is one of the known decomposition products of perovskites. Figure  1e  summarizes the relative X-ray diffraction intensity of PbI 2 and perovskite in the films. Clearly the CsFAMA-F film has a much lower PbI 2 content than all of the other films, which confirms the outstanding thermal stability of this material. The main degradation reactions caused by thermal stress are the deprotonation and desorption of volatile organic cations  37  . The improvement in thermal stability observed in the CsFAMA-F sample is attributed to the hydrogen bonds between the fluoride and MA/FA ions inhibiting the diffusion and dissociation of organic cations. In short, of the halide salts studied, NaF enables the greatest improvements in terms of thermal stability and carrier lifetimes in CsFAMA perovskites. Therefore, in the following, we focus on CsFAMA-F and the role played by the fluoride in the context of photovoltaics performance of solar cells made with this material.  
 Possible location of fluoride and its passivation effects To investigate the presence and distribution of NaF in the perovskite film, time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) is employed to probe the depth profiles of the atomic species in the CsFAMA-F perovskite sample (Fig.  2a ). The maximum signals of Na and F are observed on the surface of the perovskite thin film and at the perovskite/ITO interface. Nevertheless, signals with appreciable intensity are observed along the entire film thickness. The presence of NaF in the film is also confirmed by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy results, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  6 . As no significant peak shifts are observed in X-ray diffraction results, it rules out the possibility of NaF entering the CsFAMA crystal lattice (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). As analysed above, we therefore suggest that NaF is indeed in the film, possibly concentrated at the surface, as illustrated by Fig.  2b . To probe the effect of NaF at the surface of the perovskite film, we apply scanning Kelvin probe microscopy  38, 39  , and combine a threedimensional spatial map of the topography and a map of the surface potential. In the reference sample (CsFAMA), the surface potential at the boundaries of the grains is 40 mV higher than in the middle of the grains (see Fig.  2c ). In the CsFAMA-F sample (Fig.  2d ), this surface potential difference is only about 20 mV. We conclude that NaF modifies the surface potential (Supplementary Fig.  7 ), which further suggests that NaF species are probably located at the surface. To gather more atomistic information regarding the possible location of NaF and its effect on the stability of the perovskite, we calculate the relative energies of incorporation of Na and F ions in the bulk and on surfaces, using DFT. The Na ion is found to be more stable on surfaces than in the bulk by 0.2 to 0.3 eV. On both FAI-and PbI 2 -terminated surfaces, Na preferentially occupies an interstitial site, rather than an A site (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). A detailed chemical analysis (Fig.  3c ) shows that incorporation of a Na ion increases the ionic charge on the nearby I ions. It indicates that Na may play a role in suppressing the diffusion of halide ions. We find that incorporating a F ion into the perovskite lattice is extremely difficult, and it has a strong preference for staying at the surface. By far the most energetically favourable position of a F ion is substitution of an I ion at an FAI-terminated surface. Positions of F ions either in the perovskite bulk, or in a PbI 2 -terminated surface, have an energy that is about 3.5 eV higher (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). The size mismatch between I and F ions probably prevents the latter from being incorporated comfortably inside the perovskite lattice, as it would induce too much strain. This is avoided by incorporating F ions on the FAI surface. However, the incorporation of F ions on the FAI surface changes the local bonding at the surface and subsurface layers. The most dramatic change is that the FA cations surrounding a F site reorient towards the F ion, in such a way as to maximize their interactions with this ion (Fig.  3a, b ). This is in agreement with the N-H vibration mode analysis discussed above (Fig.  1b  and Supplementary Fig.  2 ), supporting the finding that FA ions closest to a F site form hydrogen bonds with the F ion. In addition, the ionic charge on the Pb ions surrounding a F site also increases (Fig.  3c ), indicating that the F ions form stronger ionic bonds. In summary, the introduction of F at FAI-terminated surfaces stabilizes the local structure via increased bonding with Pb, and via hydrogen bonds with FA ions. To further elucidate the effect of incorporation of F ions, we calculate the formation energies of FA cation vacancies on the surface of the clean perovskite, and that on the surfaces incorporated with NaI or NaF species (Fig.  3d  and Supplementary Fig.  10 ). Whereas the FA vacancy formation energy close to a NaI species increases by a mere 0.12 eV, compared to the pristine perovskite, close to a F ion it increases by a sizeable 0.55 eV. The presence of F therefore significantly prevents the formation of FA vacancies at the surface. This result supports the excellent thermal stability of the CsFAMA-X perovskite films (Fig.  1e ), where the creation of organic cation vacancies is typically believed to be responsible for the degradation of the perovskites under thermal stress. 
 Solar cell performance To investigate the photovoltaics performance based on our improved material, we fabricate n-i-p planar PSCs using CsFAMA and CsFAMA-F perovskites as the absorbers. The cross-sectional SEM image in Fig.  4a  shows the device structure, which comprises an ITO glass substrate covered by a 50-nm-thick SnO 2 electron transport layer. On top of that we deposit a 600-nm-thick perovskite film, covered with a layer of Spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer (200 nm), and an 80-nm-thick gold electrode as the back contact. As summarized in Table  1  and shown in Fig.  4b , the CsFAMA-F cells give rise to a PCE of 21.46% (average value from reverse and forward scan results) with negligible J-V hysteresis. This is to be compared to the reference CsFAMA with an average PCE of 19.03% with moderate J-V hysteresis. Examples of CsFAMA and CaFAMA-X cells with stabilized PCEs of 19.37% and 20.96%, respectively, are shown in Fig.  4c . The statistics of 60 devices with or without NaF are shown in Supplementary Fig.  11  and Supplementary Table  2 . The average PCEs for the CsFAMA and CaFAMA-F devices are 18.86% and 20.56%, respectively. The short-circuit current density (J sc ) increases only slightly in CsFAMA-F cells (the spectral responses of the external quantum efficiency of these devices are shown in Supplementary Fig.  13 ), while the most dramatic enhancement is found in the open-circuit voltage (V oc ) and fill factor (FF). We attribute this improvement to the immobilization of mobile ions and vacancy defects such as iodide and MA (FA) due to the incorporation of fluoride ions. The best CsFAMA-F device has been certified by a third party (Supplementary Fig.  12 ). The certified PCEs are 21.7% under the reverse scan direction (1.2 to -0.1 V) and 20.8% under the forward scan direction (-0.1 to 1.2 V), with a slow scan rate (33 mV s -1 ) under AM1.5G full-sun illumination (1,000 W m -2 ). This certified efficiency of 21.3% (average value from certified reverse and forward scan results) agrees well with measured performances in our own laboratory. To examine the effects of incorporation of NaF on the defects in the perovskite absorber, we use admittance spectroscopy, and conduct a Mott-Schottky analysis to analyse the defects profile. We first conduct temperature-dependent admittance spectroscopy measurements on the CsFAMA and CsFAMA-F devices with the temperature rising from 210 to 350 K without illumination (Supplementary Fig.  14a, b ). Subsequently, the defect activation energies (E a ) in the CsFAMA and CsFAMA-F samples are calculated to be 0.275 and 0.201 eV, respectively (Fig.  4d ). The trap density-of-states distribution and their energy levels are presented in Fig.  4e . Incorporation of fluoride effectively reduces the energy level of trap states from 0.26 to 0.18 eV, as well as their density of states from 22.4 × 10 15 to 14.9 × 10 15 cm -3 eV -1 . We have further carried out PL quantum efficiency (PLQE) measurements. Figure  4f  shows that the CsFAMA-F sample has a higher PLQE compared to the CsFAMA sample. Moreover, its PLQE increases more rapidly with increasing laser intensity. Spacecharge-limited current measurements, transient photovoltage, transient photocurrent decay experiments and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements all show agreement with our finding that NaF effectively passivates electronic defects in PSCs, which is responsible for the improved PCE (see Supplementary Notes 11-13 and Supplementary Figs. 15-17).  To establish the stability of our improved CsFAMA-F material, we carry out a series of investigations on unencapsulated devices. The results of stability tests under continuous one-sun illumination, or at a fixed temperature of 85 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere, are shown in Fig.  5a, b . The photo-stability of CsFAMA-F-based cells is superior to that of the reference cells, maintaining 95% of their original PCE after 1,000 h of illumination. As shown in Fig.  5b , the thermal stability of F-containing devices shows an even more significant improvement. The CsFAMA-F-based devices retain 90% of their initial PCE after annealing at 85 °C for 1,000 h, while CsFAMA PSCs retain only 50% of their initial PCE. We attribute this to the excellent thermal stability of NaF-containing perovskite films (Fig.  1e ). In addition, we probe the storage lifetime of devices in an environment with humidity of about 25%-45% at a temperature of about 25-40 °C (Fig.  5c ). The evolution of the normalized PCE shows that CsFAMA-F cells exhibit a significantly improved long-term stability, retaining 90% of their original PCE after over 6,000 h of storage in ambient air. Most importantly, we investigate the operational stability of unencapsulated devices under MPP tracking with a continuous one-sun irradiation in a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig.  5d ). The reference cells show a rapid loss of PCE (below 40% of the original PCE after working for 600 h), while the CsFAMA-F cell exhibits a long lifetime, retaining over 90% of its initial PCE after 1,000 h. In addition, we also investigate the operational stability of unencapsulated PSCs under MPP tracking with continuous light irradiation (solar simulator source, 100 mW cm -2 ) in air (Supplementary Fig.  18 ). It can be found that CsFAMA-F PSCs exhibit superior stability performance compared with reference cells (CsFAMA): the CsFAMA-F cells retain 85% of their PCE after 350 min, while the PCE of the CsFAMA reference cells drops below 60% in less than 50 min, which further confirms that the incorporation of NaF in the perovskite film brought about remarkable improvements in the long-term stability of PSCs. It is important to emphasize that the effect of NaF is different from that of other sodium halides NaX (X = Cl, Br, I). To demonstrate this, we fabricate PSCs based on CsFAMA absorbers treated with other sodium halides. The corresponding PCEs are then slightly improved compared to the untreated CsFAMA (Supplementary Fig.  19a ), which is in line with other reports  40  . However, these devices exhibit an obvious J-V hysteresis (larger hysteresis index), while the NaF-containing devices show an almost negligible J-V hysteresis (Supplementary Fig.  19b ). It is possible that the Na ion can penetrate the perovskite film under an external bias because of its small size 34 (about 0.102 nm). Mobile ions and their accumulation at interfaces are reported to be responsible for the J-V hysteresis  41  . When using NaF, however, Na is bonded more closely to F, and is therefore localized mostly. The above analysis emphasizes the uniqueness of fluoride to immobilize the counter ions, as compared to other halides. To test the generality of these findings, we also consider the use of KF as an additive. We fabricate KF-containing PSCs (CsFAMA-K), using the same procedure as for NaF-containing PSCs (CsFAMA-Na). Supplementary Fig.  20  shows that KF-containing PSCs exhibit almost the same PCE as NaF-containing PSCs. In addition, both KF-and NaF-containing PSCs show negligible hysteresis, indicating that KF is also effective in passivating both anions and cations for efficient and stable PSC devices. The analysis above highlights the fact that fluoride ions are desirable for both chemical and electronic passivation in perovskites, and can be combined with a number of alkali metals. 
 Conclusions In summary, we have explored an effective approach for simultaneous passivation of both the cation and anion vacancy defects in perovskite materials via chemical bonding enhancement, to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs. By adding NaF to the triple-cation perovskite absorber, we obtain a PCE of 21.46% (and a certified efficiency of 21.3%) in planar PSCs, which is among the top efficiencies for this type of solar cells. Without any encapsulation, these solar cells exhibit remarkable long-term stability, retaining 90% of their original PCE after 1,000 h under MPP operation conditions at continuous illumination. The addition of NaF also results in a superb thermal and environmental stability of materials as well as devices. It is found that NaF is indeed present in the perovskite film and forms hydrogen bonds with organic cations within the perovskite crystals, which effectively retards the diffusion of these cations and their dissociation. Fluoride ions also increase the ionic bonding, thus immobilizing both organic cations and halide anions. Passivating the surfaces and grain boundaries through increased chemical bonding, the fluoride ions effectively block the materials degradation pathway at the corresponding interfaces. The present passivation approach that makes use of the high electronegativity of F is generally applicable for improving the stability of perovskite materials by suppressing the formation of halide anion and organic cation vacancies. These findings provide a new approach to the fabrication of highly efficient and stable PSCs. 
 Methods Materials. Materials used in experiments include PbI 2 (99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich), CsI (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), NaF (AR 98%, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), spiro-OMeTAD (Lumtec), SnO 2 colloid precursor (Alfa Aesar, tin(iv) oxide, 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), isopropanol (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), chlorobenzene (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), acetone (AR Beijing Chemical Works), ethanol (AR Beijing Chemical Works), aminomethane (CP Beijing Chemical Works), hydrogen iodide (57%, Aladdin Industrial Corporation) and ITO substrate (Shanghai B-Tree Tech. Consult.). MAX (MAI, MACl, MABr) and FAI were synthesized using the methods reported previously  42  . The details are as follows: 16 ml methylamine water solution (0.1 mol) was added to a 100 ml three-neck flask immersed in a water/ice bath. A certain amount (0.1 mol) of HX acid was slowly dropped into the bottle with continuous stirring. The mixture was refluxed for 2 h under a N 2 atmosphere. Subsequently, the solution was concentrated to a dry solid by using rotary evaporation at 80 °C. This crude product was re-dissolved into 20 ml ethanol, then 100 μl diethyl ether was slowly dropped along the bottle wall and a white product deposited. This recrystallization was repeated three times, and the obtained precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven for 10 h at 40 ℃. The final products were sealed in a N 2 -filled glovebox for future use. The synthesis procedure for FAI was similar to MAI, except that HI acid was added into an 8.8 g formamidine acetate (0.10 mol) ethanol solution. Solar cell device fabrication. The ITO substrate was cleaned with ultrapure water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol successively. After 45 min of ultraviolet-O 3 treatments, a SnO 2 nanocrystal solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s to form a 50-nm-thick film, which was then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in air. The reference perovskite film was fabricated by a two-step solution process: the PbI 2 (1.3 M, dissolved in DMF/DMSO (9:1, v/v)) mixed with 5% CsI was spin-coated on ITO/SnO 2 at 2,500 r.p.m. for 30 s and annealed at 70 °C for 1 min in a nitrogen glovebox. After cooling the PbI 2 -coated substrate to room temperature in a nitrogen glovebox, a mixed organic cation solution (MAI 0.12 M; MABr 0.05 M; MACl 0.07 M; FAI 0.23 M, dissolved in isopropanol) was spin-coated at 2,300 r.p.m. for 30 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 15 min in air. Then the HTM solution, in which a spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (75 mg ml -1 ) solution was employed with the addition of 35 μl Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (260 mg ml -1 ), and 30 μl 4-tertbutylpyridine, was deposited by spin-coating at 3,500 r.p.m. for 30 s. The device was finished by thermal evaporation of Au (80 nm) under vacuum. For the NaX-containing perovskite film, we dissolved a certain amount of NaX with DMF/ DMSO (9:1, v/v), and used it as a solvent to dissolve the PbI 2 powder. The optimal content for NaF was about 0.1% mol relative to PbI 2 (Supplementary Fig.  21 ), and we assumed that all NaF added was successfully incorporated in the final perovskite films because of its high vaporization enthalpy. The other steps are all the same as for the reference sample. For PSC stability tests, we changed the organic cation solution components (MABr 0.05 M; MACl 0.07 M; FAI 0.35 M, dissolved in isopropanol), and the HTM solution was replaced by polymer-modified spiro-MeOTAD to achieve better performance and stability. The other steps are all the same as for the reference and NaF-containing perovskite films. 
 Material characterization. The morphology of perovskite and PbI 2 thin films and cross-sectional SEM image were measured using a cold field-emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800). The X-ray diffraction patterns were collected using a PANalytical X'Pert Pro X-ray powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54050 Å). PL was measured by the FLS980 (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd) with an excitation at 470 nm. The ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra were obtained using an UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer (UV-vis DRS, Japan Hitachi UH4150). UPS measurements were carried out on an XPS AXIS Ultra DLD (Kratos Analytical). The transient photovoltage and transient photocurrent measurements were performed on a Molex 180081-4320 simulating one-sun working conditions, and the carriers were excited by a 532 nm pulse laser. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were determined on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner Company), employing light-emitting diodes (LEDs) driven by Export (Zahner Company). The thermal admittance spectroscopy analyses were conducted on a Zahner Zennium pro Electrochemical Workstation at various temperatures (T = 210-350 K) in the dark from 10 0 to 10 6 Hz. A small a.c. voltage of 50 mV was used, and the d.c. bias was kept at zero to avoid the influence of the ferroelectric effect for perovskite material during measurement. For temperature-dependent characterization, the sample was mounted in Cryo Industries Liquid Nitrogen Dewars with a Lake Shore model 335 cryogenic temperature controller. The current density-voltage characteristics of the perovskite devices were obtained using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit under AM1.5G illumination at 1,000 W m -2 with a Newport Thermal Oriel 91192 1,000 W solar simulator. The shading mask and one of our best devices were sent to the National Institute of Metrology, China for certification. The active area was defined as 0.09408 cm 2 . External quantum efficiencies were measured by an Enli Technology EQE measurement system. Scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy was performed on perovskite samples in ambient conditions using an MFP 3D-Classic Scanning Probe Microscope (Asylum Research, Inc.). This technique relies on an a.c. bias applied to the tip to produce an electric force on the cantilever that is proportional to the potential difference between the tip and the sample. The scanning was carried out in a dual-pass scan mode; during the first scan the spatial variations in the surface potential were directly measured, and the second scang gives the workfunction by nulling the local electrostatic force gradient arising from the contact potential differences between the AFM tip and the sample surface. The conductive AFM probe was ASYELEC-01-R2 with a Ti/Ir coating and a resonant frequency of 75 kHz. The PLQE data were obtained from a three-step technique through the combination of a 445 nm continuous wave laser, a spectrometer, an optical fibre and an integrating sphere. Computational methods. Since FA as a cation and I as an anion are the most abundant species in the experimentally studied (Cs 0.05 FA 0.54 MA 0.41 )Pb(I 0.98 Br 0.02 ) 3 system, the incorporation of Na and F ions at different locations on the surfaces and bulk was investigated using FAPbI 3 as a model system. The DFT-optimized lattice parameter of cubic FAPbI 3 is 6.360 Å. The surfaces were modelled using slab models consisting of (2 × 2) cells in the x and y direction and 5 repeating FAPbI 3 units constructed from the bulk structure with a vacuum of 15 Å in the z direction. Structural optimizations of all structures were performed using DFT implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package  43, 44  . The Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof functional within the generalized gradient approximation was used  45  . The outermost s, p and d (in the case of Pb) electrons were treated as valence electrons, whose interactions with the remaining ions were modelled by pseudopotentials generated within the projector-augmented wave method  46, 47  . During the structural optimization, all ions were allowed to relax. An energy cutoff of 500 eV and a k-point scheme of 3 × 3 × 1 were used to achieve energy and force convergence of 0.1 meV and 20 meV Å -1 , respectively. Information on chemical bonding analysis and formation energies of FA + vacancies in the reference, NaI-and NaF-containing perovskites is presented in Supplementary Notes 7 and 8. Reporting Summary.

Strain engineering in perovskite solar cells and its impacts on carrier dynamics
The mixed halide perovskites have emerged as outstanding light absorbers for efficient solar cells. Unfortunately, it reveals inhomogeneity in these polycrystalline films due to composition separation, which leads to local lattice mismatches and emergent residual strains consequently. Thus far, the understanding of these residual strains and their effects on photovoltaic device performance is absent. Herein we study the evolution of residual strain over the films by depth-dependent grazing incident X-ray diffraction measurements. We identify the gradient distribution of in-plane strain component perpendicular to the substrate. Moreover, we reveal its impacts on the carrier dynamics over corresponding solar cells, which is stemmed from the strain induced energy bands bending of the perovskite absorber as indicated by first-principles calculations. Eventually, we modulate the status of residual strains in a controllable manner, which leads to enhanced PCEs up to 20.7% (certified) in devices via rational strain engineering.
O ver the past decade, hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskites have received enormous interest as low-cost and highly efficient light absorbers in photovoltaics  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]  . The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has shortly surpassed 22% in the lab scale  7  , and that of larger-area (>1 cm 2 ) devices has exceeded 20%  [8] [9] [10] [11]  . The highest PCEs are mostly achieved by employing the mixed halide perovskites (e.g., (HC(NH 2 ) 2 PbI 3 ) 0.85 (CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 ) 0.15 i.e., (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 ). Through element substitution, it provides a largely unexplored compositional space to tailor the physiochemical properties of corresponding materials for efficient and stable devices  1, [12] [13] [14] [15]  . However, the mixed hybrid perovskites potentially suffer from materials inhomogeneity partially due to composition separation  16, 17  and/or thermal stress. This may be originated from substantial chemical mismatch among each component, and the nonequilibrium growth conditions during film fabrication. On one hand, serious material inhomogeneity is regarded as phase separation, deviating from the originally desired materials properties to deteriorate the resultant device performance (both efficiency and operational stability)  18, 19  . On the other hand, moderate material inhomogeneity correlates to local lattice mismatches and emergent residual strains in perovskite films. It deserves more attention, because such residual strains should result in lattice distortion of microscopic crystal structure, and further affect optoelectronic properties of the perovskite thin film  [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25]  . Recently, the residual strains have been identified in the singlecomposition MAPbI 3 polycrystalline films, and were found to influence stability of perovskite films under illumination  22  . In an even wider spectrum of semiconductors, strain has been extensively investigated, and accordingly, strain engineering has been exploited to tailor the optoelectronic functionalities. For instance, the application of tensile strain was found to improve light emission in Germanium crystals and drive indirect-to-direct optical transition in bilayered two-dimensional WSe 2  [26] [27] [28]  . Strain compensation strategy has been demonstrated to improve efficiencies of GaAs-based quantum dot solar cells  29, 30  . Strainengineered MoS 2 monolayer was also proposed to have broadrange capture of solar energy  26  . For hybrid halide perovskites, especially mixed perovskites, in-depth understanding of their characteristics and effects on the material's optoelectronic properties, is still absent. This precludes effective employment of strain engineering to further enhance the device performance. In this report, we probe the residual strain distribution profiles in the mixed perovskite thin films and its effects on photovoltaic device efficiency. We investigate the evolution of in-plane residual strain over the film thickness in the typical mixed perovskite (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 by using grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurement. We identify a gradient distribution of in-plane strain component that correlates to the composition inhomogeneity perpendicular to the substrate. We further demonstrate a feasible method to modulate the tensile or compressive nature of residual strain and even its gradient over perovskite films in a controllable manner. With the aid of firstprinciples calculations, we find that the strain gradient induces energy bands bending and thus affects the carrier dynamics across the interfaces over the solar cell. By deliberately engineering the residual strains to enhance carrier extraction efficiency, we successfully fabricate strain-engineered perovskite solar cells to achieve enhanced PCEs up to 20.7% (certified). 
 Results Probing residual strain gradient of mixed perovskite films. In the direction parallel to substrates, the grain-to-grain inhomogeneity in polycrystalline films was already observed by adopting photoluminescence in a scanning electron microscopy (PL-SEM) and conductive-atomic force microscopy (C-AFM)  31  . However, it lacks depth profile along the film thickness regarding the lattice structure inhomogeneity. At the macroscopic level, the vertical homogeneity of thin films can be quantitatively evaluated by residual strain to reflect the lattice mismatch  20, 22, 32  . The macroscopic residual strain is an internal strain in polycrystalline materials that is balanced over a wide range of grains. We explored the residual strain distribution for mixed perovskite films vertically with the depth-dependent GIXRD measurement, wherein the classical sin 2 φ measurement is combined with grazing incident X-ray diffraction to probe the in-plane residual strain. This method has been used in thin films of ZrO 2 and TiN, which provides reliable depth resolution to reveal lattice structure evolution  [33] [34] [35]  . As depicted in Fig.  1a , we fixed the 2θ and varied the instrument tilt angle ψ to obtain corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns as shown in Fig.  1b . For detailed test information, please see the Supplementary method, Supplementary Fig.  1  and Supplementary Table  1 . The mixed perovskite films on the SnO 2 /ITO/glass substrates showed XRD peaks (2θ) at around 14.0°, 31.6°, and 40.5°, corresponding to (001), (012), and (022) crystallographic planes, respectively  36  . Among all three planes with intensive diffraction peaks, the (012) plane was chosen for further analysis due to its high diffraction angle and multiplicative factor, which provides the most reliable structure symmetry information. We picked up three representative depths of 50, 200 and 500 nm to check the residual strain in the mixed perovskite films with the nominal formula of (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 . At each fixed depth, diffraction data were fitted with Gaussian distribution function and it clearly observed a systematic shift in peak position to lower 2θ when the penetrated depth increased (Fig.  1b  and Supplementary Fig.  2 ). Generally, sin 2 φ and 2θ follow a linear relationship and the slope of the fitting line stands for the magnitude of the residual strain (see equation (1) in Supplementary method). As shown in Fig.  1b , all fitting lines exhibited negative value in the slopes, which means (012) crystal planes exhibit enlarged distance when turning to the out-of-plane direction at the same detected depth. It thus indicates the entire sample is subjected to tensile strain. It is in agreement with previous study wherein the residual tensile strain was observed in perovskite thin films upon the similar annealing process  22  . With the increase of probe depth, the fitting lines show smaller slopes in absolute value, which implies the macroscopic residual tensile strain gradually decreases. Moreover, we found the most significant deviation in lattice constant at 50 nm as compared to that of 200 and 500 nm. Besides, the (001) and (022) crystal planes were also found to follow the similar trend (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). It indicates the residual strain inhomogeneity in the mixed perovskite thin film, wherein the top surface of the film bears the largest tensile strain. It is worth noting that residual strain correlates to the lattice distortion, which might affect the carrier dynamics at the relevant interfaces, as will be discussed later. Therefore, the residual tensile strain gradient was clearly identified, which gradually decreases from the top surface to the core in the mixed perovskite polycrystalline thin films. So far, we have observed the gradient distribution of tensile strain in the perovskite thin film. And it will be interesting to understand the origin of the residual strain. The residual stain is often stemmed from the lattice mismatch due to lattice structure evolution. We thus conducted GIXRD measurements with variable grazing incident angle ω (Supplementary Table  1 ) to reveal the lattice mismatch along the film thickness. These depthdependent XRD patterns were roughly similar and no new diffraction peaks appeared, indicating the film exhibited the same cubic phase structure at different depths. However, we observed a systematic shift of diffraction peaks along with the probing depths at 50, 200, and 500 nm in the perovskite film. Take (001) planes for example, the corresponding diffraction peaks for 50, 200, and 500 nm exhibited peak centers at 14.01°, 13.94°, and 13.90°, respectively (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). Among different crystal planes of (001), (012) and (022), corresponding peak positions gradually shift towards the low diffraction angle with the increase of probing depths. According to the Bragg's law, larger lattice constant was expected in the deeper zone of films. Thus, the crystal structure inhomogeneity along the film thickness is detected unambiguously. To provide the evidence regarding the structure inhomogeneity in the microscopic level, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) nano-beam electron diffraction measurement was further carried out to investigate crystal structure evolution along the depth direction of mixed perovskite films. We obtained the high-resolution TEM image with microarea diffraction patterns to inspect three typical regions with different depths (Fig.  1d-f ). After careful calibration of all measured diffraction patterns (Supplementary Table  2 ), we found that the crystal plane distance increased with scanning depth. As shown in Fig.  1e-g , lattice parameters of (004) planes were measured to be 1.60, 1.64 and 1.67 Å for three individual areas, respectively, which is consistent with the GIXRD results. Combining the microscopic analysis (TEM) and the long-range structure characterization (GIXRD), we clearly illustrate lattice structure evolution developed vertically in the mixed perovskite polycrystalline thin films, wherein the lattice constant decreases from the surface to the bottom. The above-mentioned crystal structure inhomogeneity is likely to correlate to the composition evolution in mixed perovskite thin films. It is commonly accepted that FAPbI 3 exhibits the cubic phase with the lattice constant of 6.357 Å  36  . When MA and/or Br element are incorporated to form the mixed perovskites single crystals, they hold the cubic phase with decreased lattice parameters. We observed smaller lattice constant at the surface of the film, which may partially attribute to higher ratio of MA and/or Br components in the long-range ordered FA based perovskite lattices. To identify the distribution of MA and/or Br components, we resorted to time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) depth profiles and TEM/EDX mapping for the (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 perovskite film samples as shown in the inset of Fig.  1h , Supplementary Figs.  4  and 5 . It shows a homogeneous distribution of CsBr 2+ , CsI 2+ , FA + in the all samples, which indicates the even distribution of the halogen Br -. It is reasonable because the smallest halogen ion Br -can diffuse and be evenly distributed during the crystallization process. To be noted, the signal intensity of MA + fragment decreased substantially from the surface to the core region in all mixed perovskite thin films, consistent with the XRD and TEM results. Unambiguously it reveals the gradient evolution of composition and thus lattice structure across the depth direction due to the gradient distribution of organic cation MA + . The nonuniform composition distribution indicates the unique kinetics for film growth, which is possibly related to the coordination strength of different precursors  37  and film processing conditions. It clearly implies the compositional distribution serve as one major factor that leads to the gradient residual strain. It is revealed that hybrid perovskites with different lattice structures often exhibit different optoelectronic properties  25, 38  and it is expected to observe the gradient variation in terms of optoelectronic properties within the gradient phase structure of the film. Therefore, we examined the depth-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra within the film by using confocal fluorescence microscope. With the increasing depth of the beam probe, a systematic red shift of PL spectra was observed (Fig.  1h  and Supplementary Fig.  6 ). Fitting with the Gaussian distribution function, we found the PL peak positions shifted from 781 to 788 nm, and their full width at half maximum (FWHM) decreased along the film thickness. Since the emission photon energy is determined by the bandgap of semiconductors, it indicates the perovskite film exhibits gradually decreased bandgap from the surface to the bottom vertically. To be noted, it follows the similar trend in gradient evolution of lattice structure and compositional distribution, wherein more MA + ions are incorporated in the perovskite crystals at the top surface of the film. In addition, narrower PL linewidth emission at the deeper region of perovskite film was observed, which may indicate weakened interaction between charge carriers and lattice vibrations (phonons) due to improved film homogeneity and lattice order  39, 40  . Modulating the residual strains. Based on the analysis above, we reveal that the observed residual strain gradient in perovskite films is closely related to lattice structure evolution due to detectable compositional inhomogeneity. However, it may not be the only contributor that governs the residual strain, given the largest tensile strain concentrated on the film surface. Interestingly, when examining the pure MAPbI 3 perovskite thin film, we still observed the existence of gradient residual strain (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). It is thus speculated that the thermal strain may take effects due to the temperature gradient during perovskite film fabrication. To illustrate, the perovskite film is roughly divided into two regions, e.g., the surface and the bottom (near the substrate). When heated on a hot plate, both regions experienced substantial temperature gradient (higher at the bottom). Consequently, the inorganic framework near the bottom expands more in volume upon annealing as compared to that at the surface, which facilitates the insertion of larger cation (FA + ) to form the perovskite crystalline structure. It possibly results in the inhomogeneous composition in the film, wherein MA + prefers to stay at the surface. Upon cooling, it is reasonable that the surface cools down much faster than that of the core, which leads to less volume shrinkage. As a result, the surface withstands tensile strain and the core is subjected to compressive strain accordingly. Additionally, since the thermal expansion coefficient of perovskites is much larger than that of the substrate, the entire film bears the tensile strain during film cooling process. Thereby, the core experiences not only compressive strain from the surface, but also tensile strain from the substrate, which leads to the gradient residual tensile strain in the perovskite thin film. To verify the speculation, we attempted to modulate the gradient in-plane residual strain in the perovskite thin films by adjusting the annealing process. We first tried to anneal the film at 150 °C high temperature for a long time, which is a conventional approach to eliminating residual strains in metal alloy materials. Unfortunately, it led to the significant occurrence of PbI 2 (Supplementary Fig.  7 ) in the resultant thin films due to the relative poor thermal stability of hybrid perovskites  41  . We then tried to change the temperature gradient when the films were annealed. Simply, we modified the heat treatment process by flipping over the thin film sample to provide an invert temperature gradient. Interestingly, tensile strain was significantly reduced in the samples upon this treatment as shown in Fig.  2a, b . With small strain gradient and the closer lattice distance in the perovskite film, the lattice structure was almost homogeneous. It thus suggests an effective way to significantly reduce the tensile strain inhomogeneity across the film thickness by tuning the temperature gradient during film processing. Furthermore, we tried to directly perform flipped annealing process to the intermediate state film after the spin-coating process ends, which is expected to apply compressive strain with vertical gradient over the film. In contrast to the previous samples, the as-prepared films show the fitting curves possessed slopes in positive values (Fig.  2c, d ), which increased along with the probe depth. It clearly indicates films exhibit compressive strain, which is also distributed in a vertical gradient. Unfortunately, we observed a lot of pinholes in the resultant film possibly because the solvent cannot be spread smoothly during the annealing process (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). Therefore, we demonstrate the temperature gradient is also an important source to residual strain during the film growth, which further suggests a method to manipulate the evolution of lattice structure of polycrystalline thin films and the surface strain. To investigate whether the upper contacting layer influences the surface strain, we prepared a tensile-strained film to test the surface residual strain as a reference point. Then for the same sample, 1 mL chlorobenzene solution was dripped on the film surface during the spin-coating process and the film was tested. Furthermore, the same sample was coated with Spiro-OMeTAD layer and then tested again. We found the same slope of the fitting curves indicating the magnitude of the surface strain remained constant. (Supplementary Fig.  10 ) It clearly shows that the chlorobenzene dripped process and/or Spiro-OMeTAD contacting layer does not affect the surface strain significantly. The residual strain and its gradient distribution reflects the structure inhomogeneity in the perovskite thin film along the vertical direction. It is known that the strain gradient is derived from the XRD peak offset, which actually reveals the variation of lattice parameters leading to the crystal structure mismatch across the thin film. In hybrid halide perovskites, the framework of corner-sharing PbI 6 octahedral contributes to the electronic configuration, especially at the band-edge  42, 43  . It means variations in the inorganic framework would possibly result in the change in optoelectronic properties of the materials. The structure variations include enlargement/shrinkage, tilting, and other deformation of the octahedral network, which can be clearly illustrated by measuring the residual strain. Therefore, it is of great interest to bridge the gulf between the residual strain and the optoelectronic properties of the materials and relevant devices. Given the thin film surface exhibits the most significant strain, it is reasonable focus on the carrier dynamic behavior across the interface via strain modulation, and their effects on device performance. 
 Impacts of strain on carrier dynamics and device performance. To investigate the impact of the gradient residual strain on the device performance, we first fabricated planar heterojunction solar cells by adopting the perovskite absorbers with/without residual strains. The device architecture follows the regular structure of ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. We then compare the J-V curves of the tensile-strained and the strain-free devices. To avoid possible misleading due to sample variation, we fabricated 40 cells under optimal conditions in each batch. Figure  3a  shows the histograms of PCEs for each batch of samples with/without strain. The tensile-strained devices exhibited the PCE averaged around 18.7% with a wider distribution from 17.3% and 20.3%. In comparison, the strain-free devices achieved the averaged PCE of 19.8%, whose PCEs were distributed in a narrow range between 18.8% and 20.7%. The narrow distribution in PCEs of the strain-free devices stands for the good processing reproducibility. We also conducted the current-voltage (I-V) measurement for devices under different annealing conditions to preserve different tensile strains in the absorbers, which provided the statistics of parameters in Supplementary Fig.  11  and Supplementary Table  4 . It is found that the fill factor (FF) and the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) have significantly improved with the increase of the flipped annealing time, wherein the surface tensile strain is gradually released through prolonged annealing at 120 °C. We measured current-density voltage (J-V) characteristics of one of the best devices under a simulated illumination of air mass (AM) 1.5 and 100 mW cm -2 . This device generated a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 22.8 mA cm -2 , a FF of 78.0%, an opencircuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.17 V, and a power conversion efficiency of 20.7% (Fig.  3b ). The forward and reverse scanning current density-voltage (J-V) curves showed negligible hysteresis in the corresponding device in Supplementary Fig.  11e , which was likely attributed to the improved carrier extraction at the interface  44, 45  . By holding a bias near the maximum power output point (0.96 V), a stabilized photocurrent of 21.3 mA cm -2 was obtained, corresponding to a stabilized efficiency of 20.5% (the inset of Fig.  3b ). The device performance was certified by the independent third party (Supporting Information). The External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for the two types of devices were shown in Supplementary Fig.  11f . Compared to the tensile strain device, the strain-free device showed improved light harvesting efficiency along the entire absorption wavelength range of 350 to 800 nm. The integrated photocurrent densities were calculated to be 20.81, 22.7 mA cm -2 , respectively, which was in good agreement with the J SC derived from the J-V measurement. Thus far, we observed the significant improvement in FF and V OC in strain-engineered devices. This is likely attributed to improved carrier extraction dynamics around the absorber interface, which is subjected to further analysis. Firstly, the carriers transport behavior at the interface was probed with transient photocurrent (TPC) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement. The TPC measurement (Fig.  3c ) was often used to monitor the carrier transport across the device. By fitting with the exponential function, the photocurrent decay time was significantly reduced from 12.96 to 1.0 µs (Supplementary Table  5 ). A faster decay of photocurrent than the reference device suggested the improvement in carrier extraction when tensile strain gradient was almost eliminated at the surface. Further investigation with the TRPL measurement indicates improved hole extraction due to elimination of residual strain, as observed in the samples with the configuration of glass/ perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD. As shown in Supplementary Fig.  12  and Supplementary Table  6 , the average decay time τ avg related to PL quenching was dramatically decreased from 14.6 to 4.9 ns in the strain-free sample, showing the higher quenching rate. It indicates that the strain-free sample exhibits better hole extraction at the interface between absorber and hole transport material (HTM), as compared to that of the tensile strain sample. This result is in accordance with the TPC measurement, showing that modulation of residual tensile strain can accelerate the carrier transfer process. Secondly, we investigated how the carrier recombination process of devices is affected by the residual strain. We conducted the combined measurements of light-intensity-dependent V OC , electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and transient photovoltage decay (TPV). The light-intensity-dependent V OC provides critical insights into the mechanism of recombination processes in solar cells  46  . The corresponding charge carrier recombination process is reflected by the ideality factor of ''n'' as determined by the slope of the V OC versus incident light-intensity according to the equation V OC = E g /qnk B T/qlnJ 0 /J; where q is the elementary charge, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. When the ideality factor n approaches 2, Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) type, trap-assisted recombination dominates. As shown in Fig.  3d , from the relationship between V OC ~ln(I), the ideality factor n are 1.01, 1.55 for the devices with/without tensile strain, respectively. It indicates that trap-assisted SRH recombination is effectively suppressed by reducing the tensile strain that is mainly located at the absorber surface. The alleviated SRH recombination may be attributed to the reduced trap density in strain-free devices, wherein crystal structure homogeneity is achieved. The carrier dynamics across the perovskite/HTM interface upon strain modulation is further examined by EIS. Corresponding Nyquist plots were obtained from solar cells with/without gradient residual strain in dark without applied bias (Fig.  3e ). It shows two separate arcs, equivalent to the resistive and capacitive components of various interfaces  47, 48  . Generally, the first arc in the intermediate-frequency region is associated with the recombination impedance due to the selective contacts or their interface with the perovskite active layer in the device. Here, we mainly focused on the mid-frequency region and found that the recombination impedance increased from 23.69 to 521.10 KΩ when the tensile strain was relaxed. It is consistent with that of the light-intensity-dependent V OC measurement. We further measured the recombination resistance (R rec ), wherein the device was subjected to applied bias ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 V. By fitting with the simple RC equivalent circuit, we exacted the recombination resistance under different bias as shown in Fig.  3f . It is clear that strain-free devices display a larger R rec than that of the tensile-strained one, which indicates that the interfacial charge recombination is suppressed in strain-free device. The reduced recombination loss was further confirmed by TPV measurement  49  , wherein the photovoltage decay time was significantly increased from 4.01 to 10.32 µs (Supplementary Fig.  12  and Supplementary Table  5 ) when tensile strain was released. It is also in agreement with higher V OC observed in the devices with strainfree absorbers. Mechanisms of the effect of strain on photovoltaic properties. The above results unambiguously indicate that the gradient distribution of residual strains directly affects the hole carrier dynamics across the perovskite/HTM interface and thus the device performance. To reveal the underlying mechanism, we performed first-principles calculations to simulate changes of electronic structure and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite films under strained condition. In particular, we chose the (001)-oriented FAPbI 3 perovskite film represented by six-layers Ruddlesden-Popper phase of FAPbI 3 and applied in-plane biaxial strains to it. Since (001) is one of predominate growth direction of perovskite crystals as indicated by the XRD measurements, and FAPbI 3 , MAPbBr 3 and their mixture have similar electronic structures  50, 51  , we expect the above model can reasonably mimic the strained mixed perovskite (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 films in experiment. We embedded the (001) FAPbI 3 film in the vacuum and applied biaxial strains of 1%, 0.5% (compressive) and -0.5%, -1% (tensile), respectively (Supplementary Fig.  13 ). We found that the perpendicular direction exhibit quite small opposite stain components as the rotation of organic FA/MA molecules contributes substantially to strain relaxation. The calculated band structures under tensile, zero, and compressive strains are shown in Fig.  4a, b . One sees that the band gaps of the films show increase with the strain changing from compression, zero-strain, to tension. This agrees with the observed tendency of bandgap change from the ultraviolet (UV)-visible (Vis) absorption and PL measurement (Fig.  4c ). To be noted, the bandgap measured from UV-Vis absorption and PL spectra less than the theoretical value. It is because the theoretical value was calculated with the assumption that the entire lattice structure is subjected to strain state. In our experiment however, the largest strain only locates at the surface region rather than the entire film (Fig.  1c ), wherein quite a large portion of films remain the original bandgap. The tendency can be explained by consideration of the band-edge features of Pb halide perovskites APbX 3 , where the valence band (VB) edge is composed of the strong anti-bonding interaction between Pb-s and X-p orbitals, and the conduction band (CB) edge is predominantly from Pb-p orbital with weak anti-bonding character  51, 52  . With the perovskite film experiencing compressive, zero, to tensile biaxial strain, the in-plane lattice gradually expands, which weakens the Pb-X bonds and thus in principle pulls down both the anti-bonding VB and CB energy levels. However, the VB with strong anti-bonding hybridization is substantially decreased, while the CB is less affected. As the result, the bandgap shows increase from compressive, zero, to tensile strain. This explanation is indeed supported by our calculations as shown in Fig.  4a . Based on the changed electronic structure in the strained perovskite, we attempt to illustrate how residual strains affect hole carrier dynamics in solar cells. Figure  4b  (left panel) shows the evolution of band-edge energies under tensile strains. The CB decreases slightly with increasing strain magnitude, whereas the VB exhibits pronounced downshift. It reveals that strains evolve vertically in the perovskite film, wherein the largest tensile strain is observed at the perovskite/HTM interface. Therefore, the VB bends downward monotonously over the entire perovskite absorber layer, as depicted in the Fig.  4b  (right panel). This VB downward bending has dual effects on the hole carrier dynamics. On one hand, it creates the ''cliff-type'' band alignment by repelling hole carrier energy level away from that of the HTM (Fig.  4b ). This was reported to be unfavorable for hole extraction in Cu(In,Ga)Se 2  53  and perovskite solar cells  [54] [55] [56] [57] [58]  . On the other hand, the hole mobility is possibly affected along the direction of VB downward bending, wherein the hole carrier diffusion suffers from extra hindering force field due to unfavored energy level gradient. As indicated by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement (Fig.  4d ) of the fabricated capacitor-like devices by sandwiching the perovskite films between ITO and Au, the mobilities of the samples with and without tensile strain were calculated to be 7.04 × 10 -4 and 1.02 × 10 -3 cm foot_1  V -1 S -1 , respectively. Indeed, the experimentally observed carrier mobility is improved when tensile strain is released. In short, by eliminating the tensile strain gradient in the perovskite film, the VB is flattened to cancel the ''cliff-type'' band alignment of perovskite absorber/HTM and hole mobility is enhanced simultaneously. It thus favors the charge transport and extraction of photogenerated holes, which suppresses the carrier recombination and leads to the significant improvement in FF and V OC in the corresponding device. In addition to the above two main effects, the tensile strain induced downward shift of valence bands may also result in the deeper defect levels of the perovskite films with the assumption of defect energy levels being not sensitive to strain. This is supported by the experimental observation that the hydrostatic pressure render the shallower defect energy levels of hybrid halide perovskites  59, 60  . As demonstrated above we also observed the prolonged carrier lifetime in the strain-free samples (Supplementary Fig.  14 ). 
 Discussion In conclusion, we revealed gradient evolution of residual strain in the vertical direction of the mixed halide perovskite film by depth-dependent grazing incident X-ray diffraction characterization. The residual strain distribution may be stemmed from composition inhomogeneity and/or gradient thermal stress during film processing. A simple technique was developed to modulate the strain nature (e.g., tensile and compressive) and its gradient over the perovskite film in a controllable manner. This allows us to identify substantial impact of the residual strain gradient on hole carrier dynamics across the perovskite solar cell. First-principle calculations reveal that the strain gradient induces valence bands bending of perovskite absorber and thus affects the interfacial hole dynamics. By reducing the strain gradient of the perovskite film through strain engineering, we achieved substantial improvement in hole carrier transport and extraction across the interface of perovskite absorber/HTM. Consequently, the optimized perovskite solar cell reaches the certified power conversion efficiency of 20.7%. By demonstrating the impact of residual strain on optoelectronic properties of halide perovskite film, this contribution sheds a light on further understanding the composition-structure-property relationship of halide perovskite system, which may be exploited to further advance the performance of halide perovskite based optoelectronic devices.

Passivation Mechanism Exploiting Surface Dipoles Affords High-Performance Perovskite Solar Cells
The employment of 2D perovskites is a promising approach to tackling the stability and voltage issues inherent in perovskite solar cells. It remains unclear, however, whether other perovskites with different dimensionalities have the same effect on efficiency and stability. Here, we report the use of quasi-3D azetidinium lead iodide (AzPbI 3 ) as a secondary layer on top of the primary 3D perovskite film that results in significant improvements in the photovoltaic parameters. Remarkably, the utilization of AzPbI 3 leads to a new passivation mechanism due to the presence of surface dipoles resulting in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.4%. The opencircuit voltage obtained is as high as 1.18 V, which is among the highest reported to date for single junction perovskite solar cells, corresponding to a voltage deficit of 0.37 V for a band gap of 1.55 eV.
■ INTRODUCTION High-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with efficiencies exceeding 20% hold considerable promise in photoelectric energy conversion.  [1] [2] [3] [4]  However, PSCs have yet to reach a suitable level of technological readiness for large-scale production.  5, 6  Improvements in the efficiency and stability of halide PSCs are still needed,  [7] [8] [9]  and whereas many approaches have been used to improve the stability and performance of PSCs, the application of passivation agents is among the most promising approaches.  10, 11  Grain boundary passivation of perovskites by inorganic or organic agents enhances both the stability and performance of PSCs.  [12] [13] [14]  Moreover, these agents not only act as a protective thin layer on the perovskite film to passivate the surface defects and reduce intergrain boundary recombination but also protect the perovskite film against moisture, leading to increased stability and durability.  [15] [16] [17]  Passivating agents can be divided into two main categories: first, passivation agents that do not form any new perovskite layer but modify the grain surface (e.g., cations such as potassium,  18  sodium,  19  guanidinium,  20  imidazolium,  21  and choline  22  and neutral compounds such as PCBM  23  and pyridine)  24  and second, passivation agents that form an additional perovskite layer on top of primary perovskite. In the latter case, 2D perovskites were used exclusively as the source of the secondary layer.  11  However, 2D perovskites have the disadvantage that their performance is highly dependent on the orientation of the 2D perovskite on the primary perovskite layer. In other words, the existence of an insulating organic layer causes charges to be confined in the inorganic layer; therefore, charge transport from the bulk perovskite to the 2D perovskite layer depends on their relative orientation.  25  The Az cation previously showed improvements in the efficiency of methylammonium lead iodide-based perovskite when employed in the bulk.  26  Here, we demonstrate a highly desirable modification effect via the passivation of surface and grain boundaries by employing an azetidinium lead iodide (AzPbI 3 ) layer using a secondary perovskite growth (SPG) technique to introduce an additional perovskite phase at the hole-transporting material (HTM)/perovskite interface. The SPG technique involves two steps: deposition of a primary perovskite layer followed by the introduction of the secondary perovskite (by deposition of AzI dissolved in isopropanol). AzPbI 3 has a pseudo-3D structure made from interlinked 1D perovskites. This structure advantageously coats the perovskite surface and enhances photovoltaic characteristics such as the open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and photocurrent as well as the stability. 
 ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION AzI was deposited via spin coating at different concentrations (3, 5, and 7 mg in 1 mL of dry isopropanol) on the primary perovskite layer composed of Cs 0.05 MA 0.1 FA 0.85 PbI 2.7 Br 0.3 . Xray diffraction (XRD) studies of the films do not show any significant change following SPG treatment (Figure  S1 ), which is not unexpected due to the small amount of AzI employed. To obtain a more detailed understanding of the surface structure, the film was probed by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), indicating that unreacted PbI 2 on the surface of perovskite has reacted with AzI to form AzPbI 3 (Figure  1a, b ). The newly formed peak at 2θ ≈ 11.5 corresponds to the (101) face of the AzPbI 3 structure previously reported.  27  Additionally, a new peak at 720 nm was observed in the PL spectra of the SPG-based films (Figure  1c ), which is also in agreement with the expected emission from AzPbI 3 perovskite single crystals.  27  To complement these data, cathodoluminescence (CL) was employed (Figure  1d ), confirming that PbI 2 is absent from the SPG-based film (no emission detected at around 500 nm for the SPG-based film) but present in the control film (shown in blue). Notably, an emission at 710 nm was detected in the SPG-based film, which is due to the presence of AzPbI 3 , and it is shown in green. However, the background 710 nm emission in the control film is mainly due to the tail of the Cs 0.05 MA 0.1 FA 0.85 PbI 2.7 Br 0.3 emission at ca. 770 nm (measured at 15 K, so the bandgap is increased  28  ). The dark areas (from both 710 and 770 nm emissions) belong to relatively nonemitting areas due to the surface roughness. SEM images of the control film and films containing different concentrations of AzI are shown in Figure  2a . As the AzI concentration increases to 5 mg/mL, a layer of AzPbI 3 was observed to coat the surface of perovskite. Although the crystal dispersion and the size of grains remain uniform, the SPG-based film with 5 mg/mL AzI showed a unique surface microstructure in which the surfaces of grains are completely covered with AzPbI 3 . The unique microstructure results in an improvement of the perovskite layer stability (see below). However, as the concentration of AzI increases to 7 mg/mL, small grains and a thick layer of AzPbI 3 or AzI form on the surface, which detrimentally interferes with the efficiency of the device (Figure  S2 ). The photovoltaic performance of the devices (fabricated as shown in Figure  2b ) containing the secondary AzPbI 3 perovskite film was studied under A.M. 1.5 and compared to the control device. The 5 mg SPG-based devices give an optimum photovoltaic performance (Table  S1 ). The mean  device power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases from 19.52% in the control to 22.03% for 5 mg of SPG-based devices (Figure  3a ). The photocurrent hysteresis of the SPGbased devices was negligible compared to that of the control solar cells (Figure  S3 ). The mean open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the SPG-treated perovskite films is higher than that of the control film (1.14 vs 1.07 V for the 5 mg SPG and control devices, respectively, see Figure  3b ). An open circuit voltage that is as high as 1.18 V was also achieved. Moreover, the average fill factor (FF) was enhanced to 79% for the 5 mg SPG devices versus 76% for the control (Figure  3c ). Surprisingly, the average current density also increases as a result of the SPG treatment (24.55 vs 23.91 mA/cm 2 for the 5 mg SPG and control devices, respectively, see Figure  3d ) as reflected in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements (Figure  3e ). The EQE data suggests a better charge extraction for the SPGbased devices. A similar effect has been observed for devices passivated with 1D perovskite nanowires.  29  High concentrations of AzI (7 mg/mL) result in an increase in the series resistance and thus lower FF (Figure  S4 ). The best-performing SPG cell with a PCE of 22.39% has a short circuit current (J sc ) of 24.7 mA cm  2  , an open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V, and a fill factor of 79.5% with a stabilized efficiency of 22% (Figure  3f  and Figure  S5 ). The aging of devices was monitored for unencapsulated control and treated devices under 1 sun illumination and a nitrogen atmosphere with a constant load of 200 Ω for more than 1000 h at ∼52 °C. The 5 mg SPG device retained ∼85% of its initial PCE (Figure  3g ), whereas the control device retained 47% of its initial efficiency. The conjugated acid of secondary amine azetidine (pK a = 11.29) is a much weaker acid than methylammonium (pK a = 9.25) (Scheme 1). Therefore, decomposition via deprotonation of the ammonium group, which is reported as a major instability factor, is much slower.  30, 31  It is likely that the application of AzI stabilizes the primary perovskite surface due to the formation of an AzIterminated instead of PbX 2 -terminated surface.  32  Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was used to further study the films (Figure  4a, b ). The 5 mg/mL SPG-based film has a higher work function than the reference, which is reflected in contact potential difference (CPD) values (-368 ± 20 vs -237 ± 40 mV for SPG-based and control films, respectively). The CPD value is different from that of AzPbI 3 (+108 mV, Figure  S6 ), which suggests that the difference in the potential between the control and the SPG-based film mainly originated from the perovskite layer. This may be due to the dipole moment effect of Az on the surface of perovskite.  33  The crystal edge of perovskite will be covered by Az cations in a way in which the ammonium group of Az will form hydrogen bonds with the perovskite lattice. Therefore, an assembly of Az cations will shift the work function due to the electrical field produced by Az cations (Figure  4c ).

 Scheme 1. pK a Comparison of Azetidinium and Methylammonium Journal of the American Chemical Society copy (UPS) was employed to confirm the KPFM data. As shown in Figure  5a ,b, the work function of the SPG-based films is higher than that for the control film, and this shift can indicate the formation of an electrical field due to the dipoles on the surface of the perovskite (Figure  5c ). The effect of surface dipoles on the work function is a wellknown concept in the fields of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics.  34, 35  Other possibilities such as band bending and the formation of a p-type perovskite are unlikely explanations for the work-function shift due to the absence of dopants at the surface, which act as electron acceptors, and a low concentration of charge carriers in the absence of light. (The experiments were conducted at the minimum light intensity.) The electrical field drives the holes to the HTM and repels the electrons back to the perovskite to find their way to the electron transport material (ETM) (Figure  5d ). Therefore, less recombination occurs at the perovskite and HTM interface, which results in the passivation of the traps at the interface. The electrical field causes better charge extraction and higher voltages of the SPG-based PSCs. Furthermore, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements showed the higher carrier lifetime for SPG-based films (Figure  6 ). The TRPL data reveal a longer lifetime of charge carriers and therefore the reduction of trap-assisted recombination in the perovskite layer of the 5 mg/mL SPGbased film (from τ = 1.3 to >2.8 μs for the control and the SPG-based films, respectively), which along with the higher V oc of the SPG-based devices suggests the passivation role of the AzPbI 3 layer. Due to the electrical field produced by the dipole moment of the azetidinium cations on the surface of the perovskite, electrons will be pushed away from the interface and therefore the nonradiative recombination will be reduced. Thus, the presence of dipoles with the correct orientation can result in the passivation.    The AzPbI 3 structure was made according to Riccardo et al.  27  Remarkably, the presence of AzPbI 3 did not result in reduced conductivity of the resulting devices, which is presumably due to the interwoven structure of the AzPbI 3 layer (Figure  7 ) that maintains the current through the film. In other words, the Pb-I-Pb bonds that connect the primary and secondary structures allow charge to flow between them. This results in a nonconfined charge within the AzPbI 3 structure and, therefore, efficient hole transport to the HTM. 
 ■ CONCLUSIONS We hereby demonstrate a means of fabricating efficient and stable perovskite solar cells by employing AzPbI 3 as a dual passivating and protecting layer. The engineered perovskite structure exhibits high photovoltaic performance due to the presence of surface dipoles, resulting in a unique mechanism of passivation. Our results suggest that employing different dimensionalities of perovskites is key to enhancing the stability and efficiency of perovskites.

Phenethylammonium (PEA + ) and butylammonium (BA + ) are widely used in three-dimensional (3D) perovskites to form two-dimensional perovskites at film surfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) for defect passivation and performance enhancement. Here we show that these cations are unstable with 3D formamidinium (FA + )-containing perovskites under high-temperature light soaking. PEA + and BA + are found to deprotonate to amines, which then react with FA + to produce (phenethylamino) methaniminium (PEAMA + ) and (butylamino)methaniminium (BAMA + ), respectively, severely limiting device high-temperature photostability. Removing these cations greatly improves the photostability but compromises device efficiency by leaving non-fully passivated surfaces and GBs. Ammonium cations with a high acid dissociation constant (pK a ), including PEAMA + (pK a = 12.0) and BAMA + (pK a = 12.0), can replace PEA + or BA + for passivation and are stable with FA-based perovskites due to their resistance to further deprotonation. P-i-n structure solar cells with PEAMA + additive maintained over 90% of their initial efficiency after light soaking at open circuit and 90 °C for 1,500 hours. Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites have many interesting physical properties due to confinement effects that three-dimensional (3D) perovskites do not have, including exciton dynamics, spin dynamics and electron-phonon coupling  [1] [2] [3]  . Generally, 2D perovskites are considered to be much more stable than their 3D counterparts due to better moisture resistance of the hydrophobic organic cation  4, 5  , larger energy barrier to ion migration  6, 7  and increased tolerance to structural stress  8, 9  . As a result, they have been widely applied in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to improve device efficiency and stability in various ways  4, [10] [11] [12]  . To overcome their poor carrier transport along the out-of-plane direction, a thin layer of 2D perovskite can be stacked on top of 3D perovskites via sequential deposition, which not only protects but also passivates the 3D perovskite surface  10, 13  . They can also be incorporated into the grain boundaries (GBs) of 3D perovskites by adding the large organic cations into the precursor solution  14  . The much larger size of these organic cations causes them to be excluded form the 3D lattice to GBs which, in return, stablizes the GBs  5, 15  . Additionally, high layer number (n) phase-pure quasi-2D perovskites have been developed to retain both the advantages of 3D perovskites-such as good charge transport and carrier lifetimes-and 2D perovskites, such as good stability, but neither their efficiency nor stability have reached the parity of other multi-dimensional perovskites  16, 17  .

FAH 2 PO 2 and FACl were added to enlarge the grain size of perovskite films and passivate the non-radiative recombination defects  30  . PEACl was added to passivate the surface and grain boundaries by formation of 2D perovskite and suppress the halide ion migration  32  . ZnCl 2 was added to increase device efficiency by optimizing the perovskite morphology and decrease trap density  33  . Excess CsI was added to compensate iodide vacancies and suppress ion migration and defect generation during long-term illumination  29  . We speculated that some additive(s) may induce the quick degradation observed at high temperatures. To verify this, additives were removed one by one from the perovskite precursor solutions, PSCs were fabricated and then the same high-temperature photostability study was conducted (Supplementary Fig.  3g-h ). Results showed that the PSCs became much more stable after the PEACl additive was removed from the perovskite precursor solution. As shown in Fig.  1b  and Supplementary Fig.  3h , devices without PEACl retained 90% of their initial efficiency over 750 hours at 85 °C under 1 sun light illumination but started with a lower efficiency of ~20%. This suggests that PEA + cations were the main reason for the poor photostability of FACs-perovskites at high temperatures; note that chloride was excluded using control studies where chloride was replaced by iodide (Supplementary Fig.  3i ). Additionally, to evaluate whether the location of phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) makes a difference, we removed PEAI in the precursor and instead applied PEAI as surface treatment to the perovskite films. A poor stability was again observed for these PSCs with PEAI surface treatment (Supplementary Fig.  3i ). This shows that the PEA + cations cause poor high-temperature photostability, regardless of how PEA + is introduced into the FACs-perovskites. The impact of PEA + on FACs-perovskite intrinsic stability was manifested by the perovskite morphology and crystallinity evolution after light soaking at 85 °C for different durations. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results shown in Supplementary Fig.  4  revealed that the crystallinity of FACs-perovskite films with PEA + quickly decreased after testing for 260 hours, while FACs-perovskite films without PEA + experienced a slower degradation in crystallinity and retained the majority of their initial crystallinity over 860 hours of testing. This is evidenced by a slower decrease in XRD peak intensity and smaller changes in full-width half maximum values of the (001) plane peak. Additionally, cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that voids formed along grain boundaries during the stability measurement for films containing PEA + (Fig.  1c ). This can be explained by the PEA + ions that accumulated at the GBs, which damaged the 3D perovskites during the high-temperature light soaking testing. In contrast, devices without PEA + did not develop voids even after testing for 860 hours (Fig.  1d ). Electron beam induced current (EBIC) measurements were conducted to further research the stability of PSCs with and without PEACl. For this measurement, devices with thinner electrodes (30 nm) were deposited so that an electron beam with an energy of 5-15 keV could penetrate through the electrode and electron transport layer (ETL), depositing its energy into the perovskite layer. Monte Carlo simulations of the electron trajectories indicate that 75% of the beam energy was deposited within the ETL and the first 10 s of nanometers (nms) of the perovskite (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). EBIC results in Fig.  1e  reveal that PEA + incorporation results in a lower and less uniform current that further decreases over device ageing, in contrast to PSCs without PEA + . As can be seen in Fig.  1f , the pristine PSCs without PEA + show an average EBIC current of ~3.0 nA. PSCs with PEACl show both a more heterogenous and lower average current collection of ~2.2 nA. Because the devices with PEACl have a larger photocurrent under 1 sun light, we interpret the smaller and more heterogenous EBIC by the faster degradation of the device with PEACl under electron beam. After the devices light soaked under 85 °C 1 sun for 250 hours, the mean current extraction from the device with PEACl decreased to ~1.1 nA. In contrast, the device without PEACl showed a modest increase in current to ~3.7 nA The ability of 2D perovskites to enhance the efficiency of perovskite solar cells as additive or surface capping layer is very evident  4, 12, 13, [18] [19] [20]  . Among the numerous organic cations reported for 2D perovskites, phenethylammonium (PEA + ) and butylammonium (BA + ) are the most frequently used ammonium cations. Additionally, they have yielded many certified record power conversion efficiencies  12, 13, 21  . Encouraging shelf lifetime or even operational stability under light has also been frequently reported  22, 23  . Nevertheless, almost all previous studies were conducted at relatively low temperatures. Because the operational lifetime of perovskite solar cells are reaching several thousand hours, higher temperatures are needed to accelerate the operational stability test, as demonstrated by several recent studies  22, 23  . Some recent studies have shown poor stability of 2D:3D mixed perovskites and 2D/3D stacking structure at a high temperature of 85 °C, despite their promising stability at a lower temperature of 55 °C  [24] [25] [26] [27]  , which raises concerns about whether 2D:3D mixture structure or stacking structure is viable for long-term stability. The underlying mechanism of 2D:3D interfacial instability is still unclear. In this manuscript, we show that several commonly used ammonium cations, including PEA + and BA + , are not stable with formamidinium (FA)-containing perovskites at 85 °C under illumination. We identify the easy deprotonation of PEA + and BA + cations as the underlying chemistry for the observed instability. New ammonium cations with high pK a , a parameter characterizing the resistance to deprotonation  28  , were used to replace PEA + and BA + cations. These devices based on formamidinium caesium (FACs) perovskites not only retain the high efficiencies but also dramatically enhanced the high-temperature photostability of perovskite solar cells. 
 PEA + induced worse high-temperature photostability PSCs with a structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA)/FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 /C 60 /bathocuproine (BCP)/copper (Cu) (Supplementary Fig.  1a ) were fabricated via blade coating. A methylammonium (MA + )-free perovskite composition with a slight excess of FAI or caesium iodide (CsI) (0.25 mol%) was used to achieve high intrinsic stability  29  . Additionally, 0.25 mol% phenethylammonium chloride (PEACl) (relative to Pb 2+ ) and several other additives were added to the perovskite precursor solution to passivate defects at grain boundaries and film surfaces, which has been widely shown to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs at relatively low testing temperatures  [29] [30] [31]  . The optimized PSCs yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.3% (Supplementary Fig.  1b ). Additionally, they showed remarkably good operational stability when soaked under open circuit condition beneath a white light emitting diode (LED) lamp at 1 sun intensity with a spectrum as shown in Supplementary Fig.  2a . The lamp also heated the devices to a temperature of 55 ± 5 °C. These devices maintained 90% of their initial efficiency after 3,200 hours on operational stability test, as shown in Fig.  1a . However, when the temperature was raised to 85 °C using the testing setup shown in Supplementary Fig.  2b  with the actual temperature of perovskites of 90 °C as shown in Supplementary Fig.  2d , the PSCs showed dramatically faster degradation. The efficiencies of the PSCs reduced to 90% of their initial value within ~150 hours (Fig.  1b ). Stability data from additional devices is displayed in Supplementary Fig.  3a-d . All photovoltaic parameters, including short-circuit current (J SC ), open circuit voltage (V OC ) and fill factor (FF), rapidly declined. Furthermore, when elevating the measurement temperature to 100 °C, the average T 90 lifetime (T 90 : the time it takes for device efficiency to drop to 90% of initial value) of the devices decreased to ~80 hours. The quick degradation of PSCs at high temperature and under light is not sensitive to encapsulation methods. The PSCs encapsulated with epoxy, polyisobutylene and atomic layer deposition SnO 2 all showed quick degradation (Supplementary Fig.  3e ). The perovskite precursor solutions in this study had several additives to improve device efficiency, including phenethylammonium  
 The mechanism for PEA + induced instability To further understand how PEA + cations damage FACs-perovskites, we increased the amount of PEA + cations in the FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 films by directly mixing PEA 2 PbI 4 and FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 solutions at molar ratios of 2:1 and 1:2 so that the 2D perovskites could be clearly observed in XRD. These mixed films, pure PEA 2 PbI 4 and FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 were encapsulated by an inert poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) layer with >1 μm thickness and stressed under 1 sun illumination at 120 °C for a further accelerated photostability test. As shown by the XRD patterns in Fig.  2 , pure PEA 2 PbI 4 remained unchanged after testing for 260 hours while FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 decomposed slightly to PbI 2 , showing the better intrinsic stability of PEA 2 PbI 4 than FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . For the fresh PEA 2 PbI 4 : FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 mixture films, only 2D phases with n = 1 and/or n = 2 showed up in the XRD patterns. After testing for 130 hours, the mixture films quickly degraded, and a new set of XRD peaks appears at 7.1° and 14.2° that do not belong to any known low-dimensional perovskites of PEA + . This suggests that a chemical reaction occurred between the PEA + and FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 during testing. It has been established that amines with lone pairs of electrons can easily attack the electrophilic imine bond in FA + cations, even at room temperature  34, 35  . We thus hypothesize that PEA + and FA + ions react via deprotonation of PEA + to PEA 0 followed by a quick condensation reaction between PEA 0 and FA + to form (phenethylamino)methaniminium (PEAMA + ), as shown by the scheme in Fig.  3a . To provide further evidence for this, we verified that the same reaction product could be produced from the reactions of (1) PEA 0 with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 and (2) PEAI with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . In this study, both PEAI and PEA 0 were spun onto FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 films, followed by annealing at 120 °C for 0, 130 and 260 hours under 1 sun illumination. The PEAI-treated samples showed the formation of the PEA + -based 2D perovskites with n = 1 and n = 2 in the fresh films. These PEA + -based 2D perovskites transferred from lower n 2D phases to a higher n 2D phase (n = 3) after annealing at 120 °C for 130 hours, as shown in Fig.  2e , indicating loss of PEA + in the films. Meanwhile, the XRD peak at 7.1° emerged. This new material  
 Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01362-0  was denoted as PEAMA product hereinafter and could be a lead iodide octahedral-based low-dimensional perovskite. This result resembles that of directly mixing PEAI with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 , indicating that the PEA + -based 2D perovskites reacted with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . The same PEAMA product was observed from the reaction of PEA 0 with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 as shown by the 7.1° peak in the XRD pattern in Fig.  2f . This indicates the reaction of PEAI with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 goes through a deprotonation process to generate PEA 0 . To understand why PEA + easily deprotonates at high temperature, we examined its acid dissociation constant (pK a ), which represents a cation's deprotonation capacity: pKa (A + ) = -log 10 [A 0 ] [H + ] [A + ] in which [A 0 ], [H + ], [A + ] represent the concentrations of A 0 , H + and A + , respectively. The lower the pK a of a cation, the greater its ability to deprotonate. pK a is also temperature dependent based on Van't Hoff equation  36  : dln (Ka) dT = ΔH RT 2 Because the acid dissociation is an endothermic reaction, the reaction enthalpy change ∆H is positive. R and T indicate the ideal gas constant and temperature, respectively. Thus pK a increases with temperature, and deprotonation accelerates at higher temperatures. Figure  3b  shows the pK a values of common A-site cations. pK a of MA + , ethylammonium (EA + ), dimethylammonium (DMA + ) and BA + have similar values between 10.6 and 10.8 (ref. 37), which are much smaller than those of FA + (11.5-13) and guanidinium (GA + ) (13.6) (refs. 38-40). The chemical structures of these cations are shown in Fig.  3c . FA + and GA + differ from other ammonium cations by their conjugated structure with better stabilized electrons, which results in more stable interaction with the proton and thus makes deprotonation more difficult. Among all these cations, PEA + has the smallest pK a of 9.8 (ref. 38), explaining its quick deprotonation to PEA 0 and the resultant device degradation under high-temperature photostability study. It is noted that BA + , the other most widely used cation for 2D perovskites in perovskite solar cells, also has a small pK a of 10.8. We thus followed the same process to evaluate the protonation and chemical reaction of BA + with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . As shown in the XRD patterns in Supplementary Fig.  6 , the reactions of BAI or BA 2 PbI 4 and FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 were also observed under high-temperature photostability tests, regardless of whether BAI was mixed directly into or deposited onto the surface of FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . Similarly, the reaction generated a new phase with XRD peaks at 7.9° and 15.7°, resembling the reaction of BA 0 with FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . The pK a table also predicts that GA + cations should be more stable with FA + . To verify this, we introduced 0.2 mol% GAI in PSCs and conducted high-temperature photostability measurements. As illustrated in Supplementary Fig.  7 , the addition of GAI did not accelerate the degradation, as evidenced by the retention of 90% of the initial efficiency after a light soaking stability test at 85 °C for 600 hours, in striking contrast to PEA + . These results suggest that pK a is a reliable parameter for evaluating the high-temperature photostability of various ammonium cations with FA + . However, oversized GA + incorporation into FACs-perovskites The rapid degradation of FACsPbI 3 with PEA + can be explained by the generated ammonia (NH 3 ) by the reaction of PEA 0 and FA + . NH 3 has a strong coordination with FACsPbI 3 and can dissolve it  34  , which can accelerate the decomposition of FACsPbI 3 into yellow phases. It also explains the observed void formation at the GBs in the devices with PEA + (Fig.  1c ), considering that PEA + cations are generally excluded to GBs during the crystallization process. The reaction of amines (including PEA 0 ) with FA + in solution has been reported to be as fast as seconds at room temperature  34, 42  , which was also confirmed in this study. Thus we can reasonably infer that the reaction rate between PEA + and FA + ions is limited by the PEA + deprotonation process. Because light also enhances the mobility of proton, light should also accelerate the deprotonation of PEA + in the photostability test. 
 Passivation additives with high pK a Although completely removing PEA + ions from the precursor solution improves the high-temperature photostability of the devices, it also reduces the device efficiency because of the exposed unpassivated film surfaces and GBs. A passivator is still needed to enhance the device efficiency. The passivator needs to meet three criteria: (1) it should have a suitable terminal size to fit into A-site vacancy at the perovskite surfaces and GBs; (2) it should have a high pK a to resist deprotonation; (3) it should not react with FA + itself. Fortunately, we found that the reaction product of PEA 0 and FA + , that is, PEAMA + , perfectly meets these criteria. It terminates with an amidinium group with the same size as FA + , it keeps delocalized electron structure of FA + , making it difficult to deprotonate, and its lack of deprotonation prevents further reactions with FA + . We calculated the pK a of PEAMA + to be 12.0, which is higher than the PEA + benchmark. To better understand this cation, we synthesized PEAMAI by the reaction of PEA 0 with FAI, generating white powders. The single crystals of this salt can be formed by the recrystallization process, with a photograph of the crystal shown in Fig.  3d . The crystal structure obtained from single-crystal XRD confirmed the crystal is PEAMAI co-crystallized with two FAI (Supplementary Table  1 ). The bond lengths of C1-N1 and C1-N2 in PEAMAI are 1.30 Å, which is same as in FAI, indicating the resonance stabilization as we expected (Supplementary Table  2 ). The 1 H,  13  C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in Supplementary Figs.  8  and 9  confirmed the chemical structure of the obtained salt. The BAMAI was synthesized by the reaction of BA 0 and FAI confirmed by the 1 H,  13  C NMR in Supplementary Figs.  10  and 11 . The BAMA + showed a similar pK a value of 12.0 with PEAMA + . In addition, the synthesized co-crystal was mixed with PbI 2 in dimethylformamide (DMF) to fabricate films by spin coating. The XRD pattern in Supplementary Fig.  12  verified that PEAMAI-FAI reacted with PbI 2 to form a low-dimensional perovskite phase with XRD peaks at 7.1° and 14.2°, and BAMAI-FAI reacted with PbI 2 to form a low-dimensional perovskite phase with XRD peaks at 7.9° and 15.7°. To evaluate if PEAMAI is capable of passivating FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 , we used PEAMAI as a surface treatment for FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 . Different from using PEAMAI as additive, using PEAMAI as a surface treatment avoids a perovskite morphology change as shown by the SEM included in Supplementary Fig.  13 . The optimized surface treatment using PEAMAI resulted in a 57% increase of steady-state photoluminescence (PL) intensity, accompanied by a small blue shift of the PL peak (Fig.  4a ). Step I: Cation deprotonation P E A + M A + D M A + E A + B A + F A + G A + Step II: Amine/FA   
 Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01362-0  Furthermore, the carrier lifetime increased from 390 ns to 496 ns (Fig.  4b ), confirming that PEAMAI passivates traps on the perovskite surface. To passivate perovskite GBs, we added 0.2 mol% PEAMAI as an additive in the perovskite precursor solution. The samples with and without PEAMAI are referred to as PEAMA + device and control device. We blade coated perovskite films with or without PEAMA + on glass substrates and checked material morphology and passivation effect. Adding PEAMAI increased the steady-state PL intensity by 56% (Fig.  4c ) and increased the carrier lifetime from 384 ns to 497 ns (Fig.  4d ), indicating a reduced density of deep traps. Direct defect density measurement by thermal admittance spectroscopy shows that the trap density of states (tDOS) in PEAMA + devices is much lower within the trap band III (Fig.  4f ). A previous study indicates that this trap band is caused by the amorphous phase in the perovskite material  43  . Therefore, it appears the PEAMAI additive does change the crystallization process and slightly changes the morphology of perovskite film. This is consistent with PEAMA + films showing better crystallinity with stronger and sharper XRD peaks (Fig.  4e ). We estimated the mobile ion concentration in these devices by applying a 1.5 V forward bias for about 30 s to perturb the ion distribution and then measuring the current induced by the back diffusion of ions at zero bias. The measurements were performed in the dark. As shown in Fig.  4g , the mobile ions in the control devices required a much longer time (~5 s) to reach the steady state compared to the mobile ions in the PEAMA + -devices (~1 s). Additionally, the mobile ion concentration in the PEAMA + devices is three times smaller than the  
 Device efficiency and high-temperature photostability The impact of PEAMA + on the performance of FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 PSCs was investigated. Figure  5a  shows typical current density (J)-voltage (V) curves of PSCs with and without PEAMA + under both forward and reverse scans. The control PSCs had a PCE of 21.2% with a J SC of 24.7 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.07 V and a fill factor (FF) of 80.2%. PEAMA + -PSCs had a PCE of 24.1% with a J SC of 25.8 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.14 V, and a FF of 82.1%. The statistical distributions of the V OC , J SC , FF and PCE are shown in Fig.  5b . The steady-state PCEs of the devices with and without PEAMA + under AM 1.5 illumination are 20.9% and 23.8%, respectively (Fig.  5c ). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices are shown in Fig.  5d . PEAMA + primarily increased the EQE in the long wavelength range, consistent with a longer carrier diffusion length due to reduced non-radiative charge recombination. The calculated J SC from EQE agrees well with the measured J SC . Figure  5e  shows the PCE of unencapsulated control devices and PEAMA + devices as a function of measurement duration under 85 °C 1 sun illumination under V OC condition in N 2 . Stability data for each sample are listed in Supplementary Fig.  14a, b . The devices maintained 90% of the initial efficiency after ~800 hours in the  
 Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01362-0  absence of ammonium cations in the perovskites, while the devices with PEAMA + maintained 90% of the initial efficiency after ~1,500 hours. The J-V curves of the PSCs with PEAMA + after operational measurement for different durations were exhibited in Supplementary Fig.  14c . Furthermore, the high-temperature light stability of PEAMA + devices was also evaluated at 100 °C under 1 sun illumination. As illustrated in Supplementary Fig.  14d, e , the average T 90 of PEAMA + devices was approximately 500 h, notably surpassing that of the control devices. The improved high-temperature stability of PSCs is attributed to the increased crystallinity and passivation induced by PEAMA + in perovskite films. Supplementary Fig.  14f ,g displayed the cross-sectional SEM images and XRD patterns of PSCs before and after 1,400 hours of 1 sun illumination at 85 °C and the V OC condition. The cross-sectional SEM images of the stressed PSCs showed no voids, in striking contrast to the PEA + containing FACs-perovskite devices, which showed voids along the GBs. It demonstrates the excellent high-temperature photostability of PEAMA + with FACs-perovskites. The XRD patterns revealed that the PEAMA + devices had a relatively slower crystallinity degradation compared to PSCs with PEA + after the initial crystallization process induced by heat. 
 Conclusion In conclusion, we found the widely used organic cations PEA + and BA + for 2D perovskites are unstable in FA + -containing perovskites when the films or devices were subject to high-temperature light soaking. The PEA + and BA + deprotonate to amines, which further react quickly with FA + to produce PEAMA + and BAMA + , respectively. This process also generates ammonia, which causes damage to perovskite interfaces and grain boundaries, severely limiting the high-temperature photostability of perovskite solar cells. Removing PEA + or BA + cations from precursors or using ammonium cations with high pK a , including PEAMA + and BAMA + can improve the high-temperature photostability due to the difficulty of deprotonation. 
 Methods 
 Materials FAI, formamidinium chloride (FACl), zinc chloride (ZnCl 2 ) and phenylethylammonium chloride (PEACl) were purchased from GreatCell Solar and used without further purification. Lead iodide (PbI 2 , 99.99%) was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry. 2-Mercaptoethanol (2-ME), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), toluene (TL), isopropanol (IPA), ethanol (EtOH), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), caesium iodide (CsI; 99.999%), PTAA (average Mn 7,000-10,000), BCP ( > 96%), deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d 6 ) and phenylethylamine (>99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. C60 ( > 99.55%) was purchased from Nano-C. Formamidinium hypophosphite (FAH 2 PO 2 ) was synthesized via a method that was based on and modified from a previously published method  30  . Copper (Cu) pellets were purchased from Kurt J. Lesker Company. 
 Synthesis of PEAMAI A colourless solution of 7.74 g (45 mmol) FAI in 50 ml absolute ethanol (EtOH) was stirred with an ice bath and added dropwise into a solution of 0.5 ml (4.5 mmol) phenylethylamine in 50 ml absolute ethanol. After the addition finished, the reaction was stirring for another 2 h and then worked up by evaporating the solvent. The crude product was washed out by 30 ml ethyl acetate two times to remove excess FAI. The eluate was concentrated by rotary evaporation resulting in light yellow oil. Recrystallization from 30 ml EtOAc/EtOH/IPA under -18 °C yielded 0.879 g (1.4 mmol, 31.1%) white solid, which is a co-crystal of PEAMAI and 2 FAI. The co-crystals are mixture of trans-and cis-PEAMAI isomers determined by NMR spectra (Supplementary Fig.  8 ).  1    
 Synthesis of BAMAI BAMAI can be similarly prepared from BA 0 and excess FAI. The crude product as a mixture of BAMAI and FAI was used without further purification. The ratio of BAMAI: FAI was determined by NMR spectra (Supplementary Fig.  10 ).  1    
 Preparation of PSCs The ITO glass was cleaned with acetone and isopropanol using ultrasonic cleaning for 15 minutes, followed by 15 minutes of ultraviolet ozone treatment before blade coating the hole transport layer (HTL) layer using 2.2 mg ml -1 PTAA in toluene with a 200 μm blade gap. To fabricate high-quality FACsPbI 3 films with PEACl, a mixture of 0.9 M FAPbI 3 (in 2-ME solution) and 0.1 M CsPbI3 (in DMSO solution) was prepared with a molar percentage of DMSO to Pb around 56% in precursor solutions. 2.5% FACl, 1.0% FAH 2 PO 2 , 0.25% PEACl, 0.5% ZnCl 2 and 0.25% CsI were added to the perovskite precursor solution. The FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 films were blade coated on PTAA/ITO substrates at room temperature with a gap of 300 μm and N 2 blowing at 20 pound per square inch (psi), followed by annealing at 150 °C for 3 min to obtain the perovskite phase. The humidity and temperature of the air is ~30% and 21 °C, respectively. We removed each of the additives from the perovskite precursor to fabricate perovskite solar cells and evaluated their effect on the high-temperature photostability of PSCs. For instance, in FACsPbI 3 films without PEACl, a mixture of 0.9 M FAPbI 3 (in 2-ME solution) and 0.1 M CsPbI 3 (in DMSO solution) was used with a molar percentage of DMSO to Pb around 56% in precursor solutions. To produce high-quality perovskite films, the perovskite precursor solution was supplemented with 2.5% FACl, 1.0% FAH 2 PO 2 , 0.5% ZnCl 2 and 0.25% CsI, too. In addition, we replaced PEACl with PEAI in the precursor solution, adding 0.25% PEAI while retaining the other additives, including 2.5% FACl, 1.0% FAH 2 PO 2 , 0.5% ZnCl 2 and 0.25% CsI in the perovskite precursor solution. To check PEAI surface treatment effect on stability of PSCs at high-temperature light soaking condition, 1 mg ml -1 PEAI solution was prepared in IPA. The solution was spin coated onto perovskite films without PEACl at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. To check the passivation effect of PEAMAI, 1 mg ml -1 PEAMAI solution was prepared in IPA. The solution was spin coated onto perovskite films without PEACl at 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. For FACsPbI 3 films with PEAMAI, 0.2% PEAMAI was added to the FACs-perovskite solution along with 2.5% FACl, 1.0% FAH 2 PO 2 , 0.5% ZnCl 2 and 0.25% CsI in the perovskite precursor solution. To prepare FACsPbI 3 with PEAMAI, we used 0.9 M FA 0.99 PbI 3 (in 2-ME solution) and 0.1 M CsPbI 3 (in DMSO solution), as the synthesized PEAMAI lattice contains FAI. The precursor solution was blade coated with a 300 μm blade gap and N 2 blowing at 20 psi, followed by immediate annealing at 150 °C for 3 minutes. To assemble PSCs, we first evaporated 30 nm of C 60 onto the perovskite films at a vacuum pressure of 10 -6 Pa. We then evaporated 6 nm of BCP onto the sample substrates, which had been heated to approximately 80 °C before BCP deposition. Finally, we thermally evaporated Cu electrodes with 150 nm thickness. The area of shadow masks used in this work is 0.08 cm 2 .

Then we mixed the PEA 2 PbI 4 and FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 solutions at a ratio of 1:0, 2:1, 1:2 and 0:1. Subsequently, 40 μl perovskite solution was spin coated onto glass substrates at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s in a glovebox, followed by the addition of 130 μl TL after ~12 s and annealing at 120 °C for 15 minutes. The 3D films were prepared by spin coating FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 solution onto glass substrates at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s in a glovebox, followed by the addition of 130 μl TL as antisolvent after ~6 s and annealing at 150 °C for 15 minutes. A PMMA solution in TL was dropped onto the prepared films and annealed at 100 °C for 1 minute to form a PMMA layer with a thickness >1 μm to cover on perovskite films. The BA + and FA + mixed perovskite films were fabricated by mixing 1 M BA 2 PbI 4 precursor solution and 1 M FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 using same way to the PEA + and FA + mixed perovskite film fabrication. 
 XRD Powder XRD patterns were measured by a Rigaku Smart Lab diffractometer with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The scan rate was 10° min -1 at the step-scan size of 0.01°. Single-crystal XRD was performed on a Bruker D8 VENTURE diffractometer with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The diffraction data were handled by Olex2 software  44  , and the crystal structures were solved and refined by the ShelXT  45  and ShelXL 46 programmes, respectively. Thermal ellipsoid models were rendered by VESTA 47 or Ortep3  48  . PEAMAI-FAI-PbI 2 and BAMAI-FAI-PbI 2 films in Supplementary Fig.  12  were prepared by spin coating 1 M PEAMAI-FAI (or BAMAI-FAI) and PbI 2 with equal molar ratio in DMF solution at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. 
 SEM The morphology of the samples was measured by a Hitachi-4700 microscope with an electron beam accelerated at 10 kV. The surface of the samples was coated with Au to prevent charging during the measurement. 
 Photocurrent measurement J-V curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under the simulated AM 1.5 G 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm -2 ) using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3 A class AAA) equipped with 450 W Xenon lamp (Newport 6280NS). The light intensity was calibrated using a Si solar cell with a KG-5 filter. The active area of devices is 0.08 cm 2 , defined by the size of the Cu electrode. The devices were measured at ambient air with humidity of 30-60% without temperature control. The scan rate during measurement was set to 50 mV s -1 . Steady-state PCE was conducted by measuring stabilized photocurrent density under a constant bias voltage at maximum power point derived from J-V curves. An anti-refection coating was used during measurement. 
 EBIC EBIC was performed using a Mighty EBIC 2.0 Controller from Ephemeron Labs Inc. (currently Ephemeral Devices) and a FEMTO DLPCA-200 pre-amplifier. EBIC and a SEM image were collected concurrently in an FEI Scios DualBeam FIB/SEM from Thermo Fisher Scientific. In this study, EBIC was measured at a short-circuit condition. To collect an EBIC scan, first the electron beam was focused on the edge of the device area at low magnification, then moved along the edge to a fresh area to focus on a higher magnification. Once the desired magnification was achieved, the beam was moved towards the centre of the device in one direction to take EBIC measurements on unscanned fresh areas. Five EBIC scans in fresh regions were collected on each active device area. 
 Monte Carlo simulation Monte Carlo simulations of the electron beam interaction volume were performed using Monte Carlo simulation of electron trajectory in solids (CASINO) open-source software to estimate the beam spot size and penetration depth. In CASINO, each electron trajectory is approximated as a zigzag trajectory as a result of elastic and inelastic collision of the electron with the atoms in the material  49  . For this study, 1,600 electron trajectories were simulated for each run. The incident beam radius is set to 10 nm. 
 EQE A Newport QE measurement kit was used to measure the EQE of PSCs. A monochromatic light beam from a Xenon Arc lamp coupled with a Bruker Vertex 80 v Fourier Transform Interferometer was incident and focused onto the devices. Then, the photocurrent was obtained through a Stanford Research SR570 current pre-amplifier. EQE of devices was calibrated by a Newport reference silicon solar cell with a known EQE. 
 TPV TPV decays were measured under 1 sun illumination with a 337 nm laser pulse (SRS NL 100 Nitrogen Laser, pulse duration of less than 3.5 ns) to add a small perturbation to the background illumination. The voltage of the device was measured with a digital oscilloscope (DOS-X 3104 A) with an input impedance set to 1 MΩ. 
 PL PL spectra were collected with a Horiba iHR320 Spectrometer. A 532 nm green laser (Laserglow Technologies) with an intensity of 100 mW cm -2 was used as the excitation source. 
 TRPL TRPL measurement was conducted on a DeltaFlex modular fluorescence lifetime system from Horiba Scientific with a pulsed laser source at 406 nm (Horiba NanoLED 402-LH; pulse width below 200 ps, 20 pJ per pulse, ~1 mm 2 spot size) with a repetition rate of 0.3125 MHz. The signal was recorded using time-corrected single photon counting (TCSPC). The fluence of excitation light was 200 nJ m -2 . tDOS tDOS measurement was performed by the thermal admittance spectroscopy measurement using an LCR meter (Agilent E4980A). The tDOS was derived from the frequency-dependent capacitance and voltagedependent capacitance based on the equation: N T (E ω ) = - 1 qkT ωdC dω V bi W , where q, k, T, ω and C are elementary charge, Boltzmann's constant, temperature, angular frequency and specific capacitance, respectively. W and V bi are the depletion width and build-in potential, respectively. 
 Mobile ion concentration measurement The measurement of mobile ion concentration was conducted using Keithley 4200A-SCS system. We estimated the mobile ion concentration in these devices by applying 1.5 V forward bias for about 30 s to perturb the ion distribution and then measuring current induced by the back diffusion of ions that were quickly zero biased to allow ions to diffuse back to steady state. The transient current induced by ion back diffusion was recorded and the measurements were performed with devices in the dark. The mobile ion concentration was obtained from the integrated transient current over time divided by the perovskite volume and the elementary charge. following the standard procedure for 1 H and  13  C. Chemical shifts were referenced to tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. HRMS was measured by a Q Exactive HF-X (ThermoFisher) mass spectrometer.

 Stability characterization Photostability measurement was conducted at 55 ± 5 °C; before conducting photostability measurements, the PSCs were encapsulated by epoxy and glass. The encapsulated PSCs were then exposed to white LED irradiation at an intensity of 1 sun, which was calibrated using a Si reference solar cell with a KG-5 filter. The spectral distribution of the lamp used was depicted in Supplementary Fig.  2a . The PSCs were measured under V oc conditions without temperature controlling. Due to the light exposure, the sample temperature rose to 50-60 °C. High-temperature photostability measurement: to prevent the release of toxic gas into the air due to the instability of the epoxy under high temperature and light, the PSCs were not encapsulated during high temperature photostability measurements. Instead, the measurements were conducted in an N 2 glovebox to maintain an inert atmosphere. The arrangement used for the high-temperature photostability measurement is illustrated in Supplementary Fig.  2b , wherein unencapsulated PSCs were placed on a hot plate set at a temperature of 85 °C or 100 °C. The PSCs were then exposed to white LED irradiation from above. The uniformity of the hot plate, as displayed in Supplementary Fig. was verified using a thermometer. In addition, the actual temperatures of perovskite under different set temperatures and 1 sun LED light were monitored by sticking a temperature sensor directly onto the Cu electrode layer. As shown in Supplementary Fig.  2d , the actual temperature of perovskites was about 90 °C when the set hot plate temperature was 85 °C. After continuous illumination at high temperature for 48 or 72 hours, unencapsulated devices were taken out from the N 2 glovebox for the J-V measurement. The J-V measurement was conducted in air with humidity of 30-60% without temperature control. An anti-refection coating was used during measurement. Flack test results are ambiguous.

Efficient, stable and scalable perovskite solar cells using poly(3-hexylthiophene)
Perovskite solar cells typically comprise electron-and hole-transport materials deposited on each side of a perovskite active layer. So far, only two organic hole-transport materials have led to state-of-theart performance in these solar cells 1 : poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) 2-5 and 2,2ʹ,7,7ʹ-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9ʹspirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) 6,7 . However, these materials have several drawbacks in terms of commercialization, including high cost 8 , the need for hygroscopic dopants that trigger degradation of the perovskite layer 9 and limitations in their deposition processes 10 . Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is an alternative hole-transport material with excellent optoelectronic properties 11-13 , low cost 8,14 and ease of fabrication 15-18 , but so far the efficiencies of perovskite solar cells using P3HT have reached only around 16 per cent  19  . Here we propose a device architecture for highly efficient perovskite solar cells that use P3HT as a hole-transport material without any dopants. A thin layer of wide-bandgap halide perovskite is formed on top of the narrow-bandgap light-absorbing layer by an in situ reaction of n-hexyl trimethyl ammonium bromide on the perovskite surface. Our device has a certified power conversion efficiency of 22.7 per cent with hysteresis of ±0.51 per cent; exhibits good stability at 85 per cent relative humidity without encapsulation; and upon encapsulation demonstrates long-term operational stability for 1,370 hours under 1-Sun illumination at room temperature, maintaining 95 per cent of the initial efficiency. We extend our platform to large-area modules (24.97 square centimetres)-which are fabricated using a scalable bar-coating method for the deposition of P3HT-and achieve a power conversion efficiency of 16.0 per cent. Realizing the potential of P3HT as a hole-transport material by using a wide-bandgap halide could be a valuable direction for perovskite solar-cell research. Despite the potential advantages of P3HT as an organic hole-transport material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells (Extended Data Table  1 ), the resulting devices have a low open-circuit voltage (V OC ) due to additional non-radiative recombination at the perovskite/P3HT interface 20 . It has also been suggested that strong electronic coupling between the flat P3HT molecules and the perovskite results in a relatively lower
Letter reSeArCH electron lifetime (as compared with spiro-OMeTAD  21  ), and physically poor contact hampers efficient hole transfer from the perovskite to P3HT  22  . To overcome these issues, here we introduce a double-layered halide architecture (DHA) in which an ultrathin wide-bandgap halide (WBH) is stacked onto a narrow-bandgap-halide (NBH) light-absorbing layer, prior to deposition of the HTM (Fig.  1a ). The aim of inserting the WBH layer is to effectively reduce recombination at the perovskite/ P3HT interface. This DHA concept is analogous to that of a heterojunction with an intrinsic thin-layer structure, which is a successful strategy for high-performance silicon-based solar cells  23  . The WBH layer is formed simply by the in situ reaction of n-hexyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (HTAB) on the perovskite surface. The HTAB molecule comprises a functionalized moiety (N + (CH 3 ) 3 -) and an aliphatic moiety (C 6 H 13 -), the latter of which could enable favourable van der Waals interactions between the organic HTM and the perovskite. In particular, when P3HT is deposited onto the surface of the DHA, interdigitation of its alkyl chains and the analogous alkyl chains of HTAB (C 6 H 13 -) should promote the self-assembly of P3HT. Moreover, it has previously been reported that the N + (CH 3 ) 3 -moiety renders a perovskite surface more resistant to degradation under humid conditions  24  . Figure  1b , c shows 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns of the control perovskite (NBH) and DHA (WBH/NBH). Compared to the control, a distinct signal at a q z of 0.39 Å -1 along the perpendicular direction to the substrate was detected for the DHA. Another intense signal was observed at a q xy of 0.67 Å -1 along the direction parallel to the substrate, which could be associated with lateral ordering in the WBH layer of the DHA (Extended Data Fig.  1 ). The distinct crystalline phase forms only at a composition of HTAB 0.3 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 (where FAPbI 3 is formamidinium lead iodide and MAPbBr 3 is methylammonium lead bromide; Extended Data Fig.  2a ). Figure  1d , e shows scanning electron microscopy images of the surface of the control and the DHA samples. In the DHA sample, the surface of the perovskite is fully covered with the WBH layer, which is thin enough to discern the grain boundaries underneath it. The concentration of the HTAB solution is a critical factor in the fabrication of the WBH layer (Extended Data Fig.  3 ). In order to distinguish the two different halide layers, a cross-section of the DHA was observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (Fig.  1f, g ). As compared to a cross-sectional HRTEM image of the control, a thin WBH layer with a thickness of around 12 nm could be clearly discerned. The results obtained from high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning TEM and energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy show that the WBH layer contains a lower content of lead atoms as compared with the underlying NBH layer; this is a result of the lower proportion of lead in the WBH due to the incorporation of HTAB molecules (Extended Data Fig.  4 ). The energy levels of each layer in the DHA device were determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy (Extended Data Figs.  2b, 5 ). The enhanced V OC of HTMfree DHA-based perovskite solar cells and the longer charge lifetime in the DHA device demonstrate that the WBH layer effectively passivates charge traps on the perovskite surface (Extended Data Fig.  6 ). We next investigated the effect of the aliphatic moiety of HTAB in the WBH on the deposition of P3HT. We observed the morphology of the P3HT layer on top of a pristine perovskite (NBH) and in the DHA (WBH/NBH) using atomic force microscopy (Fig.  2a, b ). In the control sample, the P3HT layer showed a smooth morphology along the perovskite grains. In the DHA sample, a fibril structure of selfassembled P3HT was observed. The charge-transporting properties of the P3HT polymer are known to be highly dependent on the morphology  12, 13  ; amorphous P3HT has a low charge mobility  13  of the order of 10 -5 cm 2 V -1 s -1 , whereas self-assembled P3HT nanofibrils with strong π-π interactions lead to a considerably higher mobility of 0.1 cm 2 V -1 s -1 without any dopants  12  . The different morphologies of the P3HT layer on the control and the DHA surface were also confirmed by other analytical methods. Raman spectra of both the control and the DHA samples covered with P3HT show a symmetric C=C stretch (around 1,446 cm -1 ) and a  
 Letter reSeArCH C-C intraring stretch (around 1,380 cm -1 ) corresponding to the main in-plane ring-skeleton modes of the thiophene units  25  (Fig.  2c ). The Raman intensities of P3HT on the DHA surface are much higher than those of P3HT on the control perovskite surface. This suggests that more of the P3HT polymers on the DHA surface are oriented along the preferred direction. Raman spectra were then obtained for P3HT on DHA surfaces that had been treated with alkyl trimethyl ammonium bromides of different chain lengths. It was found that treatment with HTAB produces DHAs with the optimal surface for interaction with P3HT, with these devices showing the highest photovoltaic performance among those treated with other alkyl ammonium bromides (Extended Data Fig.  7 ). This is also evidenced by the azimuthal cuts along the (100) peak of P3HT on the control and DHA obtained from GIWAXS measurements with various incidence angles (Fig.  2d, e ). The full-width at half-maximum of the corresponding azimuthal cuts indicates that the extent of edge-on orientation of the P3HT polymers on DHA is higher in all regions-regardless of the location on the P3HT film-than that of P3HT polymers on the control (Fig.  2f ). We consider that the alkyl chain of HTAB in the WBH interacts with the P3HT polymer, resulting in a highly oriented, self-assembled P3HT layer. We attained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.3% for the best-performing DHA-based perovskite solar cell, along with a stabilized PCE of 23.0% in a maximum power point tracking system (Fig.  3a ). It is especially notable that a PCE of greater than 23.0% is achieved by P3HT without any dopants as a HTM. Figure  3b  compares the photovoltaic performance of control and DHA devices using P3HT as the HTM. The DHA device achieved a certified photovoltaic performance of 22.7% with negligible hysteresis of ±0.51% at a credible photovoltaic laboratory (Extended Data Fig.  8 ). The DHA configuration thus shows a marked improvement in PCE, which is associated with an enhanced V OC and fill factor as well as an absence of hysteresis. Figure  3c  shows Mott-Schottky plots of control and DHA devices without electron-transport layers. These plots directly demonstrate the higher flat-band potential of the DHA device compared with the control device, which is related to an increase in V OC . To further investigate this, we fabricated DHA devices using other dopant-free HTMs. Although these devices also showed an enhanced V OC , the largest improvement was obtained using P3HT as the HTM (Extended Data Fig.  9 , Extended Data Table  2 ). This suggests that, among the tested HTMs, P3HT shows the greatest synergistic effect on photovoltaic performance in the DHA devices, because the WBH layer not only leads to a higher flat-band potential but also to the self-assembly of P3HT. Moreover, we found that the DHA device with P3HT has a lower series resistance (R s ) than the control device with P3HT, whereas the DHA film has a higher R s than the control perovskite film due to the high aliphatic content of the WBH (Extended Data Fig.  10 ). The lower R s in the DHA device supports interfacial charge transfer and transport through the WBH and P3HT layers under operation conditions, and accounts for the enhanced fill factor. A statistical analysis of the photovoltaic parameters of 27 corresponding devices reveals that the performance of the DHA device is reproducible (Fig.  3d ). Therefore, our strategy of constructing a DHA device with P3HT is considered to be effective in improving the interfacial contact between the perovskite and the P3HT, thereby achieving a considerable enhancement of the PCE. To explore the effect of the configuration of the DHA on its resistance to moisture, we monitored the long-term stability of control and DHA devices without any encapsulation under 85% relative humidity at room temperature (Fig.  4a ). The DHA device maintained nearly 80% of its initial efficiency after 1,008 h, whereas the control device was   Letter reSeArCH completely degraded within 200 h. Furthermore, we tested the operational stability of devices that were encapsulated with a face-sealing adhesive sheet, under continuous 1-Sun illumination at room temperature by tracking their maximum power point (Fig.  4b ). The DHA device showed substantial long-term stability, maintaining more than 95% of its initial PCE for 1,370 h, whereas the control device showed severe degradation within 100 h. Better interfacial contact between the perovskite and the HTM is therefore crucial for facilitating hole transfer at the interface, reducing the hysteresis of the device, and achieving long-term device stability against bias and light. As well as the performance of perovskite solar cells, another issue of importance to commercialization is their large-scale production. Recently, some promising progress has been made in the fabrication of highly uniform large-area perovskite films via scalable coating methods  26  . However, with the exception of spin-coating approaches, there have been few reports of the deposition of HTM on large-area modules  10, 16  . We fabricated DHA-based modules at a size of 5 cm × 5 cm (Fig.  4c , Extended Data Fig.  11 ) and used two different deposition methods-spin-coating and bar-coating-for deposition of the P3HT layer. The performance of both modules was similar, with high PCEs of 16.3% and 16.0% (average values obtained under reverse-and forward-bias scan directions) for devices fabricated using spin-coating and bar-coating, respectively (Fig.  4d ). This demonstrates that scalable methods for P3HT deposition can be applied to a DHA configuration without a reduction in performance. Our work establishes the potential of P3HT as a HTM using a double-layered halide architecture, and could contribute towards the realization of commercial perovskite solar cells.

A dense TiO 2 layer was deposited on a fluorine-doped SnO 2 (FTO, Pilkington, TEC8) substrate by spray pyrolysis using a 10 vol% titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution in ethanol at 450 °C. A mesoporous TiO 2 was coated on the dense TiO 2 /FTO substrate using mesoporous TiO 2 dispersed solution diluted in mixed solvent (2-methoxylethanol:terpineol = 3.5:1 w/w) and heat-treated at 500 °C for 1 h for calcination. Bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt was treated on the substrate. Then, for fabrication of the perovskite film, the perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving 889 mg ml -1 of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ), 33 mg ml -1 of methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr 3 ) and 33 mg ml -1 of methylammonium chloride (MACl) in N,Ndimethyl formamide/dimethyl sulfoxide (8:1 v/v) mixed solvent. The solution was deposited by two consecutive spin-coating steps of 1,000 r.p.m. and 5,000 r.p.m. for 5 s and 20 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step (5,000 r.p.m.), 1 ml of diethyl ether was quickly poured onto the substrate after 15 s. The intermediate phase film was put on a hotplate at 150 °C for 10 min. After the fabrication of perovskite film, for the development of the double-layered halide architecture, 1.0 mM n-hexyl trimethylammonium bromide solution in mixed solvent (o-dichlorobenzene:isopropanol = 97:3 v/v) was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 5,000 r.p.m. for 10 s. Then, the substrate was heat-treated at 150 °C for 30 s. The hole-transport layer was deposited by spin-coating P3HT solution (10 mg ml -1 ) in mixed solvent (chlorobenzene:diphenyl ether = 97:3 v/v) at 3,000 r.p.m. For the deposition of other organic hole-transport layers, PTAA solution (7.5 mg ml -1 ) in toluene, spiro-OMeTAD solution (20 mg ml -1 ) in chlorobenzene, and PCPDTBT and PTB7 solution (10 mg ml -1 ) in chlorobenzene were stacked. Finally, a gold electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. Fabrication of 5 cm × 5 cm DHA modules. The module composed of eight-strip cells connected in series was scribed using CO 2 laser RF type (EL-MKRF Series, South Korea). For fabrication of solar modules, 7 cm × 7 cm FTO substrates were patterned by a laser with a power of 85 W and a scribing width of 150 μm. Next, dense TiO 2 /mesoporous TiO 2 /DHA/P3HT layers were scribed by a laser with a power of 50 W and a scribing width of 150 μm. Finally, gold layers were scribed by a laser with a power of 30 W and a scribing width of 100 μm. We designed the modules to have a geometric fill factor of 94.4%. A dense TiO 2 layer was deposited on the pattered FTO substrate by same method with unit-cell case. A mesoporous TiO 2 was spin-coated with 1 ml of the mesoporous TiO 2 dispersed solution at 2,500 r.p.m. and heat-treated. On the mesoporous TiO 2 layer, bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt was treated by same method with unit-cell case. Then, for fabrication of the perovskite film, 0.3 ml of the perovskite solution was loaded on a mesoporous TiO 2 /dense TiO 2 /FTO substrate and deposited by two consecutive spin-coating steps of 1,000 r.p.m. and 3,000 r.p.m. for 5 s and 20 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step (3,000 r.p.m.), 4 ml of diethyl ether was poured onto the substrate. The intermediate phase film was put on a hotplate at 150 °C for 10 min. For double-layered halide architecture development, 2.7 ml of n-hexyl trimethylammonium bromide solution was spin-coated at 3,000 r.p.m. and put on a hotplate at 150 °C for 30 s. For P3HT deposition on the perovskite modules by spin-coating, 630 μl of the P3HT solution was spin-coated onto the DHA surface. When using the bar-coating method, 40 μl of P3HT was loaded in the gap (around 140 μm) between the bar and the DHA surface, and the bar was advanced towards the opposite side at a speed of 15 mm s -1 . Finally, a gold electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. Characterization. GIWAXS measurements were conducted at the PLS-II 6D UNISTPAL beamline of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory in South Korea. The X-rays coming from the bending magnet were monochromated (λ = 1.069 Å). oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-bʹ]dithiophene-2,6-diyl] [3-fluoro-2- ((2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl) thieno The incidence angle of the X-ray beam was set to 0.10°, which is close to the critical angle of the surface of samples. For the depth profile analysis of the thin film, various incidence angles were applied (0.08°, 0.10°, 0.12°, 0.14° and 0.19°). Two-dimensional GIWAXS patterns were recorded with a 2D charge-coupled device detector (Rayonix MX 225-HS). Diffraction angles were calibrated by a pre-calibrated sucrose sample (monoclinic, P21, a = 10.8631 Å, b = 8.7044 Å, c = 7.7624 Å, β = 102.938°) and the sample-to-detector distance was 248.5 mm. The surface morphologies of the film were observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (MIRA3 LMU, Tescan) and cross views of samples close to the surface were observed using a field-emission transmission electron microscope and a high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (Tecnal G 2 F30S-Twin, FEI). P3HT surfaces were observed using an atomic force microscope (MultiMode 8 non-contact mode, Bruker). Raman spectra of P3HT were obtained using a high-resolution dispersive Raman microscope (LabRAM HR Evolution, Horiba) equipped with an argon ion continuous-wave laser (λ = 514 nm) at room temperature. To estimate photovoltaic performance, perovskite solar cells were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) with a source meter (Keithley 2420) of 100 mA cm -2 under illumination at AM 1.5G and a calibrated Si-reference cell certificated by NREL. The J-V curves were obtained by scanning along the reverse scan direction and the forward scan direction in the range of -0.2 V to 1.5 V in the case of unit cells and -0.2 V to 9.0 V in the case of modules. The step voltage was set at 10 mV for unit cells and 54 mV for modules, and the scan speed was fixed at 150 mV s -1 . The designated illumination area of the module is defined as shown in Extended Data Fig.  11  and estimated by averaging values of five separate measurements from the open-source image processing program 'ImageJ' . The photovoltaic performance measurements were carried out at room temperature under air. For Mott-Schottky analysis, capacitance-voltage measurements were performed at fixed frequency (1 kHz), using FTO/NBH/(WBH)/P3HT/Au devices without an electron-transport layer (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm AG). The X-ray diffraction spectra were measured using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with an X-ray tube (Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å). Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV 2550 spectrophotometer. Valence-band maxima and work functions of each layer were obtained from a photoelectron spectroscopy system (Thermo VG Scientific, Sigma Probe) using a HeI (21.22 eV) discharge lamp with 0.47 eV full-width at half-maximum energy resolution under ultra-high vacuum (10 -9 Torr). Time-correlated single-photon counting measurements were performed using a single-mode pulsed diode laser (470 nm with an instrument response function of around 30 ps and an average power of around 0.1 μW) as an excitation source at Korea Basic Science Institute, Daegu centre in South Korea. A single photon avalanche diode (PDM series, MPD) was used to collect emissions from the samples. Device stability testing. For conducting stability tests against humidity, bare devices were kept in a thermo-hygrostat (TH-DG-150, JEIO TECH) which was set under 85% relative humidity at 25 °C. Photovoltaic performance of the aged devices was measured under ambient conditions. Maximum power point tracking was carried out to estimate long-term operational stability. Power conversion efficiency of the encapsulated device under AM 1.5G simulated white LED light (LSH-7320, Newport) was measured by using a source meter (Keithley 2420), and a maximum power point tracking system was operated by a program designed in our laboratory with a perturb-observe algorithm. The environmental conditions during operation were maintained at 25 °C with a relative humidity of around 30%. The device was encapsulated by laminating face-sealing adhesive sheets developed for organic electronic devices.

Ionic transport in hybrid lead iodide perovskite solar cells
Solar cells based on organic-inorganic halide perovskites have recently shown rapidly rising power conversion efficiencies, but exhibit unusual behaviour such as current-voltage hysteresis and a low-frequency giant dielectric response. Ionic transport has been suggested to be an important factor contributing to these effects; however, the chemical origin of this transport and the mobile species are unclear. Here, the activation energies for ionic migration in methylammonium lead iodide (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ) are derived from first principles, and are compared with kinetic data extracted from the current-voltage response of a perovskitebased solar cell. We identify the microscopic transport mechanisms, and find facile vacancyassisted migration of iodide ions with an activation energy of 0.6 eV, in good agreement with the kinetic measurements. The results of this combined computational and experimental study suggest that hybrid halide perovskites are mixed ionic-electronic conductors, a finding that has major implications for solar cell device architectures.
the field-switchable photovoltaic effect to the drift of charged ions or vacancies, although they provided no direct evidence for ion diffusion. In addition to ion migration, ferroelectric and charge-trapping effects have also been suggested as possible mechanisms  13  . Recent analysis of quasielastic neutron scattering data  23  , as well as polarization and piezoresponse force microscopy measurements  38  suggests that ferroelectric behaviour in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism behind the observed hysteresis. Simple capture and release of photogenerated charges in bulk or interfacial defects is also unlikely due to the magnitude and duration of the changes in photocurrent during relaxation following biasing. Previous electronic structure calculations have been used to examine band structures, spin-orbit coupling and intrinsic defects in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 (refs 39-51). The defect studies  45, 46  suggest that Pb 2 þ , I À and CH 3 NH 3 þ (MA þ ) vacancies create shallow donor or acceptor levels. Recent simulation work  41  shows the prevalence of ionic over electronic disorder in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 with low formation energies for Schottky-type defects associated with anion and cation vacancies, shown in the following reaction in the Kro ¨ger-Vink notation for the full Schottky defect, nil ! V 0 MA þ V 00 Pb þ 3V I þ MAPbI 3 ð1Þ where nil represents the perfect CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 lattice, V indicates a vacancy, subscripts the ionic species and superscripts the effective defect charge (a dot for each positive charge and prime for each negative charge); recent results  41  suggest a significant equilibrium concentration of I À , Pb 2 þ and CH 3 NH 3 þ vacancies at room temperature, which could support vacancy-mediated diffusion. Macroscopic conductivity or diffusion experiments, however, have so far not enabled the mobile defect species or the atomistic transport mechanism to be identified. Here, we investigate key issues related to intrinsic defect migration in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 using first-principles techniques combined with kinetic experiments monitoring the photocurrent relaxation of devices, extending our previous work on hybrid perovskites  [39] [40] [41]  and ion transport in perovskite-type oxides  33, 52  . We have carried out a detailed examination of the pathways and relative activation energies for the vacancy-mediated migration of I À , Pb 2 þ and CH 3 NH 3 þ ions, and compared these values directly with kinetic data extracted from a working CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 solar cell. The results support a mechanism of vacancy-mediated ion diffusion, pointing to mixed ionic-electronic conduction in these hybrid perovskites. The implications for perovskite solar cell operation and stability are discussed. 
 Results Migration mechanisms and energies. It is well established that the mobile ionic species in the solid state is associated with some type of vacancy or interstitial defect, the concentration of which is controlled by intrinsic Schottky and Frenkel defect reactions, non-stoichiometry or aliovalent doping  33, 34, 53  . In materials with the ABX 3 perovskite structure, vacancy-mediated diffusion is the most common process, which is further supported for CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 by the ease of formation of Schottky disorder (reaction (1)), with an intrinsic concentration of I À , Pb 2 þ and CH 3 NH 3 þ vacancies predicted to exceed 0.4% at room temperature  41  . Interstitial migration has not been observed in inorganic perovskite oxides or halides due to the lack of interstitial space in such close-packed structures. In this study, three vacancy transport mechanisms involving conventional hopping between neighbouring positions (illustrated in Fig.  2   
 ARTICLE migration into a neighbouring vacant A-site cage. Energy profiles for these mechanisms were mapped out by performing a series of transition-state calculations between adjacent equivalent sites. Particular care has to be taken to ensure the starting and end point configurations are well converged to avoid anomalously low migration energies. This approach allows the energy barrier to ion migration to be determined, and has been used successfully in previous studies on oxide-ion, proton and metal-ion migration in perovskite oxides  52, 54  . One particular challenge is to adequately describe the polarization response to the change in position of the migrating ion, which involves a combination of electronic polarization and lattice relaxation; this required the large supercells employed here to minimize any spurious interactions. The migration activation energies for the three mechanisms are reported in Table  1 . The lowest activation energy of 0.58 eV suggests favourable vacancy-assisted diffusion of iodide ions. A higher activation energy of 0.84 eV is found for CH 3 NH 3 þ migration, which involves motion through the unit cell face or bottleneck comprising four I À ions (ion radius of 2.20 Å); this value is probably at the lower limit since we have considered the ideal migration path normal to the unit cell face. In addition, neutron diffraction  55  and quasielastic neutron scattering  23  studies confirm a high level of orientational motion of the CH 3 NH 3 þ ion at room temperature, which is likely to further inhibit long-range transport. Table  1  shows a high energy barrier for Pb 2 þ vacancy migration, suggesting an immobile Pb sublattice. This result is consistent with the thermodynamic stability of the inorganic lead iodide sublattice of the perovskite structure. The high activation energy for Pb 2 þ transport also suggests that such cation diffusion is likely to be rate controlling for crystal growth processes. From the calculated activation energies a diffusion coefficient can be estimated. Assuming a Boltzmann-like barrier-hopping process with a typical attempt frequency of 10 12 Hz for ionic species at a temperature of 320 K, we estimate a diffusion coefficient of 10 À 12 cm 2 s À 1 for I À ions, which is four orders of magnitude higher than the value of 10 À 16 cm 2 s À 1 for CH 3 NH 3 þ , suggesting negligible diffusion of CH 3 NH 3 þ ions. These results clearly indicate that hybrid halide perovskites are mixed ionic-electronic conductors with iodide ions as the majority ionic carriers. A key factor for ionic conductivity will be the level of intrinsic iodide ion vacancies in the material, which will be sensitive to the synthesis conditions (equilibrium or nonequilibrium) and thermal processing routes. It is recognized that, as in binary lead halides, there are stability and photodecomposition issues with these hybrid lead perovskites  1, 2, 56  , which require further investigation. With regard to mechanistic features, it is often assumed that the migrating ion takes the shortest path between adjacent sites, that is, a direct linear jump. However, detailed analysis of the migration paths for the iodide ion vacancy mechanism reveals a small deviation from the linear route involving a curved path between iodine sites, with the saddle point slightly bowed away from the neighbouring Pb ion (shown in Fig.  3  together with the corresponding energy profile); such an atomic-scale mechanism is difficult to extract from an experiment alone. It is worth noting that analogous curved paths have been found from both atomistic simulation  52  and neutron diffraction studies  33, 57  of oxide-ion conduction in inorganic perovskite oxides such as doped LaGaO 3 . Similar mechanisms may feature in related hybrid halide perovskites. Kinetic measurements. Several recent studies have probed current-voltage hysteresis in hybrid perovskite solar cells  [13] [14] [15] [16] [17]  . However, there is currently an absence of temperature-dependent kinetic data. Hysteresis is frequently observed when performing a photocurrent-voltage scan on the device. If the voltage is held at forward bias and then swept from forward to reverse, the power conversion efficiency inferred from the measurement can be as much as 90% higher than that inferred if the current-voltage scan proceeds from reverse to forward bias. The size of the difference depends on the scan rates, the preconditioning voltage and time and the light level. Recent studies indicate that there is no direct influence of light on the hysteresis in the photocurrent  15, 17  . Light may have an indirect effect on hysteresis by generating a photovoltage that influences device performance in a similar way to the application of an external bias. The effect of sweeping voltage with time can be decoupled from the hysteresis phenomenon by making stepped chronophotoampereometry measurements where the relaxation of the photocurrent towards a steady-state value at short circuit is observed following application of a constant bias in the dark. By measuring the temperature-and time-dependent photocurrent following forward and reverse biasing in the dark, the rate at which the cell relaxes to equilibrium can be determined and thus activation energies for the relaxation of the device can be estimated (see Fig.  4a, b ). The temperature range covered in this study is representative of typical device-operating temperatures

Following dark reverse bias conditions, the photocurrent rise at short circuit was fitted well by a bi-exponential. The time constant for the initial part of the photocurrent rise after reverse biasing varied between 53 s at À 9.5 °C and 0.36 s at 50 °C. The time constant for the slower phase of the rise was six times longer, with values very similar to those obtained by fitting to single exponential functions to the tail of the photocurrent decay following forward biasing in the dark (Fig.  4a ). The shape of the photocurrent relaxations remained relatively constant but scaled with time according to the temperature, implying that only the kinetics of the relaxation process had changed. The activation energies for short-circuit photocurrent relaxation from both forward (1 V) and reverse bias ( À 0.5 V) preconditioning were similar: 0.68 eV and 0.60-0.62 eV, respectively. This similarity, combined with the observation that the slow phases of both the rise and fall of the photocurrent have approximately the same time constants for a given temperature, suggests that the underlying process controlling the relaxation is reversible. The measured activation energies for hysteresis, 0.60-0.68 eV, are very close to the value calculated for the migration of iodide ion vacancies, 0.58 eV. Our measured and calculated values are also compatible with experimental ionic conductivity studies of inorganic perovskites, which have reported similar activation energies for halide-ion vacancy conduction in perovskite halides (for CsPbCl 3 )  [35] [36] [37]  and oxide-ion vacancy transport in perovskite oxides  33, 34  . In contrast, the activation energies calculated for the migration of MA þ and Pb 2 þ vacancies (0.84 and 2.31 eV, respectively) are higher than the measured values, confirming that significant migration of these ions is unlikely at the temperatures and timescales examined. The diffusion length of an iodide vacancy on the timescale of a photocurrent relaxation at room temperature (around 10 s) using our estimated diffusion coefficient (10 À 12 cm 2 s À 1 ) is of the order of 30 nm. The corresponding drift distance in this time due to an °C was E A ¼ 0.60 eV (the measurement duration was insufficient to reliably estimate the slow component at lower temperatures). The photocurrent rise at 50 °C did not reach a stable plateau and started to decline after its peak; we did not fit to this portion of the curve. The red crosses show the rates inferred from a single exponential fit to the tail of the photocurrent decay (k 3 ) following forward bias at 1 V in the dark; the corresponding activation energy is 0.68 eV (red line) evaluated between 15 and 50 °C. Given the spread of points, we consider that the range of activation energies determined is similar to the uncertainty of the estimation. electric field that might be found in a device of this thickness (1 V dropped uniformly across 500 nm) is around 80 nm. As an example, the change in potential across a layer of accumulated vacancies of thickness w of 10 nm yields a value of E0.6 V, using the relation qw 2 N/(2e 0 e r ) assuming a relative permittivity (e r ) of 24 and 0.4% Schottky defects (NE1.6 Â 10 19 cm À 3 ) at room temperature  41  . Hence, a change of this magnitude in electric potential in the perovskite adjacent to electrodes would certainly result in a significant variation in the observed photocurrent in a solar cell. Migration of iodide ion vacancies under the influence of an electric field could change the photogenerated charge collection efficiency of devices with time and so helps to explain hysteresis. The possible influence of iodide ion vacancies on band energies of a perovskite thin film device and its interfaces is described in Figure  5 . We suggest the following model to explain the chronophotoamperometry measurements (see Fig.  5b ). When the cell is short-circuited, a built-in electric field is present in the perovskite layer due to the difference in the work functions of the contacts. This could result in the migration of iodide ion vacancies towards the contacts (while immobile vacancies remain fixed), partially screening the field. As discussed above, we expect the magnitude of the short-circuit photocurrent to be controlled by the extent to which the electric field is screened (as also recently suggested by Tress et al.  17  ). A reduced internal field within the device (due to ionic screening) would lead to less efficient collection of photogenerated charge carriers. Prolonged poling of the device under forward bias reduces (or reverses) the built-in field, which could allow a dissipation of ionic charge from the contacts by diffusion. This tempering would result in more efficient collection of photogenerated charges when the device is returned to short circuit, since the built-in field is no longer screened by accumulated ionic or vacancy charge. Conversely, holding the device under reverse bias would accentuate the migration of ions and vacancies to the interfaces, resulting in less efficient collection of photogenerated charges when the device is returned to short circuit. Within this model, the rate at which the short-circuit photocurrent relaxes towards equilibrium following poling, under either forward or reverse bias, gives an indication of the rate of ion diffusion. The temperature dependence of iodide ion migration would then correspond to the measured activation energy. The agreement between the measured and predicted activation energies supports ionic transport as one of the primary causes of the anomalous hysteresis in current-voltage curves  [13] [14] [15] [16] [17]  , and the giant switchable photovoltaic effect  32  . 
 Built-in electric field Built-in field screened in bulk The detailed behaviour may be more complex owing to additional contributions from, for example, electronic charge redistribution (at faster timescales). Although this investigation is not exhaustive in terms of possible polarization phenomena and direct observation of ion migration, it does highlight a crucial area for further work on this fascinating system. Indeed, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations could be used to explore diffusion mechanisms and defect association effects, while isotope diffusion measurements would provide a direct probe for determining the extent of ion transport in these materials.

 Discussion Our combined computational and experimental study has provided new atomic-scale insights into the ion transport mechanisms operating in the hybrid perovskite CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . We find facile vacancy-assisted diffusion of iodide ions, with good agreement with activation energies derived from kinetic measurements on a CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 -based solar cell. A key factor influencing the conduction of iodide ions (as the majority ionic carriers) will be the levels of intrinsic iodide ion vacancies in the material, which will be sensitive to the fabrication conditions and sample thermal history. Our study provides a framework for understanding ionic transport phenomena in organic-inorganic halide perovskites, including the influence of the migration of iodide ion vacancies to and from interfaces in solar cell devices. Such ion migration has been suggested as a factor contributing to their unusual behaviour, including current-voltage hysteresis and a giant dielectric response at low frequencies. The picture emerging is that hybrid halide perovskites are mixed ionic-electronic conductors. This behaviour has major repercussions for interpreting solar cell device performance and degradation pathways, and for the design of future architectures. 
 Methods Computational. The theoretical framework for modelling ion transport in the solid state is well developed  53  , and has been extensively validated for perovskite oxides  52, 54  . The CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite structure and energies were calculated using density functional theory methods (employing the ab initio code VASP 58 ). A 4 Â 4 Â 4 supercell (768 atoms) of the pseudo-cubic unit cell was modelled; a plane wave cutoff energy of 500 eV, k-point sampling at the gamma point, PAW pseudopotentials  59  and the PBEsol exchange-correlation functional were employed. For structure relaxation, forces were converged to o0.01 eV Å À 1 . For the hybrid perovskites, PBEsol reproduces the experimental crystal structure in good agreement with neutron diffraction data, and also describes the finite temperature behaviour (lattice vibrations and dynamics) in agreement with Raman and neutron scattering. We obtained an average lattice parameter of 6.28 Å for CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 , in good agreement with the observed values of 6.28-6.32 Å from X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments (Table  2 )  11, 55, 60, 61  . The defect results using PBEsol are very similar to those using other functionals, for example, see discussions of LDA/PBE in ref. 50. For migration barriers, the expanded lattice volume for standard GGA functionals (such as PBE) could be a major source of error, which PBEsol avoids. Activation energies for diffusion processes can be computed from the total energy difference between the diffusing species in their ground-state configuration and at the saddle point of the diffusion process. Migration mediated by ion vacancies was examined using nudged elastic band and constrained energy minimization methods  58  ; in the latter, the migrating species is propagated along the migration direction in a series of small steps with all unconstrained degrees of freedom relaxed at each step. While in a cubic lattice with disordered CH 3 NH 3 þ ions, each iodine site is equivalent, for an ordered cell that we used there are distinct apical and equatorial positions. We previously confirmed  41  that the vacancy formation energy is similar on both sites; here, we performed nudged elastic band calculations involving each iodine position, and find that the resulting activation energies are within 0.01 eV, and also insensitive to the alignment of methylammonium ions. Solar cell fabrication. Methylammonium lead iodide solar cells were fabricated using a modification of standard recipes  5  . Fluorine-doped tin oxide (F:SnO 2 )coated glass (TEC 15, Hartford Glass Co. Inc.) was patterned by etching with zinc powder and 2 M HCl, cleaned with deionized H 2 O, isoproponal and heated at 450 °C for 30 min. A dense titanium dioxide (B80 nm) blocking layer (d-TiO 2 ) was deposited on SnO 2 :F glass substrates via spray pyrolysis and heated at 450 °C for 30 min 62 . A solution of 2.64 M methylammonium iodide and 0.88 M lead chloride in dry DMF was spun at 2,000 r.p.m. (acceleration 1,000 r.p.m. s À 1 ) onto the substrate and dried at room temperature for 30 min before heating at 90 °C for 3 h in a glove box. Studies suggest that negligible chloride remains in the film following this preparation. The resulting CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite film thickness was B500 nm. A solution of 61.6 mM spiro-OMeTAD, 55 mM tBP and 26 mM LiTFSI in dry chlorobenzene was then spun onto the perovskite, as above, to create the hole-transporting layer. A gold electrode was evaporated onto this with an active area of 0.08 cm 2 . The cell was sealed in the glove box using a glass coverslip and a surlyn gasket. Kinetic measurements. Chronophotoampereometry measurements were made using the TRACER system  15, 63  . The current and voltage were measured while bias light (from white light-emitting diodes), applied voltage and short-circuit/opencircuit status were modulated in an arbitrary sequence of steps. The modulation was accomplished with three MOSFET switches possessing o1 ms switching time and synchronicity (for both the optical and electrical steps). The temperature of the cells was controlled to within ± 1 °C using a Peltier cooler/heater to which the devices were coupled using thermal paste. Devices were stabilized for 5 min at each temperature before measurement. Illumination by the light-emitting diodes was also found to result in o1 °C temperature increase of the device. The chronophotoampereometry measurement sequence was as follows. The current through the cell was recorded with a reverse bias of À 0.5 V for 102 s, the device was then switched to short-circuit mode (0 V) and the light simultaneously turned on (with 1 sun equivalent absorbed photon flux) for a further 102 s. The light was then turned off and a forward bias of 1 V was simultaneously applied to the cell for 102 s. The cell was then returned to short-circuit mode (0 V) and the light simultaneously switched on for a final 102 s. Empirically, the rise in the photocurrent (J sc ) towards equilibrium (J sc,equilibrium ) after reverse bias was found to be well fit by a double exponential function: J sc t ð Þ ¼ J sc;equilibrium À J 1 exp½ À k 1 tÀJ 2 exp½ À k 2 t; ð2Þ where t is the time after switching, k 1 and k 2 are the rate constants (units: s À 1 ) for the fast and slow phases of the rise and J 1 and J 2 are constants. The decay of the photocurrent towards equilibrium was observed to have a more complicated functional form with a shoulder in the decay at early times. The tail of this decay could be well fit by a single exponential function: J sc t ð Þ ¼ J sc;equilibrium þ J 3 exp½ À k 3 t; ð3Þ where k 3 is the rate constant for the decay and J 3 is a constant. As discussed in the main text, we hypothesize that these phenomenological rates of photocurrent relaxation (k 1 , k 2 and k 3 ) are related to the formation or removal of energetic barriers in the material, which change the efficiency of photogenerated charge carrier collection  17  . The barriers result from the motion of ionic charge to or from the interfaces following a change in the electric field across the device caused by switching the bias voltage state. Measurements were taken as a function of temperature (T) from 263 to 323 K, representative of device-operating temperatures but below the tetragonalto-cubic phase transition. Associated activation energies (E A ) were determined by fitting the expression ln[k] ¼ C-E A /(k B T) to an Arrhenius plot of the rate (k) data, where C is a constant and k B is Boltzmann's constant. Although the activation energies are derived from the rates of photocurrent relaxation, they are likely to be related to the underlying mechanism that causes the change in photocurrent. 3 þFigure 1 | 31 Figure 1 | Perovskite structure of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 .

We further analyze the underlying film growth mechanism in a theoretical point of view. And we assume the same interdiffusion process between the organic and inorganic species for either the α-phase (cubic) and δ-phase (hexagonal) of FAPbI3 reasonably, due to the same preparation method. The conversion process might be influenced by the alkalinity of additives. And we calculate the activation energies with existence of OH  ions in the synthesis of the α-phase (cubic) and δ-phase (hexagonal) of FAPbI3. The formation energies of both phase in normal condition and alkaline condition have been considered and the corresponding reactions of FAPbI3 are shown as follows: PbI2 + FAI → FAPbI3 (2) PbI2(OH)n + FAI → FAPbI3(OH)n (3) where the constant n represents the concentration of OH  ions in the synthesis. The OH  molecule has been inserted into the PbI2 model and FAPbI3 unit cells with different ratio n (n = 0.1 ~ 0.5) to represent the different concentration, which can be referred as ""#/unit cell"" in this simulation. The formation energies in normal condition of α-and δ-phase of FAPbI3 have been calculated as 0.157 eV and -0.271 eV, respectively. Such results indicate δ-phase of FAPbI3 is thermodynamically favored in normal synthesis conditions, in which the combination of both phase in the corresponding thin film is likely to be observed. After the introduction of OH  during film formation, the activation energy changes for the two phases follow different patterns, as is summarized in Fig.  3e  (main text). At the low OH  concentration, the δ-phase FAPbI3 has shown much higher activation energy of 5.352 eV, which is 1.834 eV higher than that of α-phase. As the OH  concentration increases, the activation energies of δ-phase FAPbI3 will experience an evident drop around 0.7 eV meanwhile α-phase FAPbI3 will undergo a subtle increase (<0.1 eV) of the activation energies. Notably, the variations of activation energy of α-phase FAPbI3 are relatively inert to the OH  concentration at low level. On contrary, the activation energy of δ-phase FAPbI3 is very sensitive, which decrease around 1 eV from n = 0.1 to n = 0.33 that is 10 times to the variation of α-phase FAPbI3. Nevertheless, when the OH  concentration reaches a high level (n = 0.5), the activation energy of these two phases will meet a cross, in which the δ-phase FAPbI3 will keep decreasing to 4.143 eV. The α-phase FAPbI3 will suddenly experience an obvious increase from 3.660 eV to 4.293 eV, which becomes larger than that of δ-phase FAPbI3. All the above-mentioned results suggest that the OH  concentration exhibits substantial influence to the formation of two phases of FAPbI3. As the OH  concentration increases, the formation of α-phase will gradually lose its advantage, and finally will be suppressed by the formation of δ-phase FAPbI3 at high OH  concentration. This preliminary result is in consistent with the observation of experiment above, illustrating the importance of control of OH  in the synthesis of different phase of FAPbI3. 
 Supplementary Note 7. In this part, we aim to generalize our findings from two perspectives. Firstly, we verify that the above finding could be applied to all iodine-based perovskite films, e.g. MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, since the elimination of incident I2 in organic precursor solutions could effectively reduce the defect state density in resultant films. Thus, four most widely studied perovskites with different processing are investigated, like one-step Cs0.05(MA0.85FA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3, two-step MAPbI3, two-step FAPbI3, and quasi two-dimensional (2D) BA2MA3PbI13 perovskite films. Secondly, we validate the operational guideline of weak alkalinity for additive selection by using formamidine acetate (FAAc, pKa ~ 7.64), triethanolamine hydrochloride (TEAHCl, pKa ~ 7.8) and sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2, pKa ~ 7.4) as examples. Subsequently, we conducted the TRPL measurement to characterize the defect state profile of these different kinds of perovskite films with different additives. When TEAHCl, NaH2PO2 and FAAc were introduced into two-step MAPbI3 (Supplementary Fig.  19a ) film, the carrier lifetime was all prolonged than that of the reference film, suggesting the reduced defect state density. The reference film in this comparison is pure MAPbI3 with NO additive. Similarly, when TEAHCl, NaH2PO2 and FAAc were introduced into two-step FAPbI3 (Supplementary Fig.  19b ) film, the carrier lifetime was all prolonged than that of the reference film, suggesting the reduced defect state density. The reference film in this comparison is pure FAPbI3 with NO additive. We validated the effectiveness in one-step Cs0.05(MA0.85FA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 (Supplementary Fig.  19c ) and quasi 2D BA2MA3PbI13 (Supplementary Fig.  19d ) films, respectively. The fitted lifetime values with the bi-exponential rate law also confirm this phenomenon (Supplementary Table  3 ). We have further investigated the device performance based on the above different perovskite absorbers and additives, to find the relationship between TRPL and solar cell efficiency. As shown in Supplementary Fig.  19e , when TEAHCl, NaH2PO2 and FAAc were introduced into two-step MAPbI3 device, the VOC and efficiency show slight improvement than that of reference device, which is consistent with TRPL result (Supplementary Fig.  19a ). The reference device in this comparison is pure MAPbI3 device with NO additive. And similarly, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  19f , when TEAHCl, NaH2PO2 and FAAc were introduced into two-step FAPbI3 device, the VOC and efficiency also increased, consistent with TRPL result (Supplementary Fig.  19b ). So it does in one-step Cs0.05(MA0.85FA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 (Supplementary Fig.  19g ) and quasi two dimensional BA2MA3PbI13 (Supplementary Fig.  19h ) based devices, respectively. To wrap up, we have validated the generality of our findings in both perspectives of additives and materials systems. 
 Supplementary Note 8. The PLQE was relatively small for either PVSK or PVSK-FA at low excitation power, but rapidly went up with the increase of excitation power, which is consistent with other studies  8, 9  . At the lower exciton power, the number of photon generated carriers is relatively small, which is trapped by the defect states leading to predominately non-radiative recombination. Thus, the PLQE of PVSK and PVSK-FA films are both very small. However, with the increase of exciton power, non-radiative recombination centers are gradually filled up and the bimolecular radiative recombination became dominant. Thus, the PLQE was increased dramatically for both PVSK and PVSK-FA films. If the exciton power further improved, the third recombination pathway, namely density-dependent non-radiative recombination or Auger recombination, become more and more important and finally dominate, leading to a drop of PLQE. In our research, we focus on the significant enhancement of PLQE for PVSK-FA film, when compared to PVSK film. Notably, the PLQE of PVSK-FA achieved 61% when the excitation power was 100 mW cm -2 , which is more than twice as that of PVSK (PLQE = 25%), which confirms the reduction of deep level defect state in PVSK-FA. It correlates to the improvement in VOC in the corresponding device. 
 Supplementary Note 9. We consider the discrepancy in iodine management is mostly due to different physiochemical properties in the corresponding absorber layers from the two film growth techniques. More specifically, we consider the major difference in physiochemical properties for two kinds of perovskite films from Yang's work  10  and our study is the defect state properties. In Yang's work, the authors employed deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and confirmed that the main deep level defects in their fabricated perovskite film was located at energy levels of 0.78 and 0.82 eV below the conduction band, which may be associated with interstitial Pb (Pbi) and antisite defects. However, in our work, we employed the thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) as the main characterization method to determinate the defect state profile, which have been widely used in the organic and perovskite solar cell  11, 12  . From the TAS result, we proved that the dominant deep level defect state in our perovskite film has energy level of 0.283 eV above valence band, which might be originated from the interstitial I (Ii). Several published calculation articles have mentioned the amphoteric interstitial I defect can trap both electrons and holes through the +/0 and 0/-ionization levels placed at 0.57 and 0.29 eV below and above the CB and VB edges, respectively  13, 14  . For different possible deep level defects, various strategies might been need. Thus, Yang et al reduced the concentration of deep level defects, possibly interstitial Pb, by introduction of iodide ions, and we employed alkaline additives to suppress the incident I2 in the halide precursor solution and effectively reduce the density of deep level defects, possibly interstitial I, in the resultant films. In addition, the chemical component (the ratio of FA and MA) for our perovskite film is also quite different with the Yang's perovskite film. And the Yang's perovskite film has more FA component. Our perovskite film contains 5% CsI, which was introduced during the deposition process of PbI2 film. Thirdly, we think the major difference in physiochemical properties for two kinds of films was originated from the different film growth techniques. For this point, Yang's group have emphasized the difference between the intramolecular exchange process (IEP, their method) and conventional two-step deposition process (our method) in reported literature  15  . Thus, we won't go into detail of the literature. And we concluded that there are several differences between the conventional two-step process and the intramolecular exchange process, such as the interdiffusion of FAI in pristine PbI2 film, the insertion of FAI into PbI2 crystal, and the crystal structure transformation from PbI2 film (hexagonal phase) to perovskite film (cubic phase). Considering the second and third point we mentioned above simultaneously, we think all these factors might influence the physiochemical properties for perovskite film and how does the impurity or additives in organic cation precursor solution work when FAI or MAI organic cation reacted with PbI2 or PbI2(DMSO) films. Therefore, we think that the approach in our Further minimizing the defect state density in the semiconducting absorber is vital to boost the power conversion efficiency of solar cells approaching Shockley-Queisser limit. However, it lacks a general strategy to control the precursor chemistry for defects density reduction in the family of iodine based perovskite. Here the alkaline environment in precursor solution is carefully investigated as an effective parameter to suppress the incident iodine and affects the crystallization kinetics during film fabrication, via rationale adjustment of the alkalinity of additives. Especially, a 'residual free' weak alkaline is proposed not only to shrink the bandgap of the absorber by modulating the stoichiometry of organic cation, but also to improve the open circuit voltage in the resultant device. Consequently, the certified efficiency of 20.87% (Newport) is achieved with one of the smallest voltage deficits of 413 mV in the planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell. O rganic-inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have attracted broad attention 1 , owing to their low fabrication cost and intriguing optical and electronic properties  [2] [3] [4] [5]  . Impressively, it witnessed the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells boosted from 3.8% 6 to a certified 23.7% rapidly  [7] [8] [9] [10]  . To enable a truly competitive PCE of perovskite solar cells as that of the most efficient inorganic counterpart, e.g., GaAs, it is required to further reduce their energy loss. This relies on the improved charge generation and mitigated non-radiative charge recombination within the complete device. With careful investigations on the absorber materials  11, 12  , device configuration  13, 14  , and relevant interfaces  15, 16  , it is found that the intrinsic defect properties  17, 18  in perovskite films influence the charge dynamics in the devices significantly. Halide perovskites are generally regarded as relatively soft ionic solids, which are prone to contain point defects  3, 19  in polycrystalline films (e.g., vacancies, interstitials, and cation and anti-site substitutions). They often serve as the non-radiative recombination centers to affect the quantum efficiency of photoluminescence and deteriorate the photovoltaic performance  17, 20  . Therefore, to assure the best power output by reducing energy and voltage loss, it is of great importance to gain profound understanding on the defect physics and chemistry, which results in defects elimination in perovskite films for efficient photo-carrier transport. During the past few years, efforts have been attempted to probe the defects to unveil their nature. In the methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ) perovskite, it reported a variety of shallow native point defects, e.g., Pb vacancies (V Pb ), MA vacancies (V MA ), interstitials MA (MA i ), etc  3  ., and deep energy-level defects 2 in forms of complex and derivatives, such as interstitials I (I i ) and its derivatives  21, 22  . In mixed perovskites, it reveals even more complicated defect physics, wherein formamidinium (FA)related defect I FA (the complexes of I i and V FA ) makes a transition at a Fermi level that sits deep within the bandgap  19  . Furthermore, defect formation is reported to be correlated to the processing conditions, wherein films grown under iodine-rich conditions exhibit a higher defect density  23  . Among all defects, iodine-related defects receive most interest. It is reported that polyiodide complexes in dimethylformamide (DMF) solution could easily induce defects due to a nonstoichiometric Pb/I ratio in the resultant films  24  . When dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was further introduced, either I-rich or I-deficient intermediates were identified, depending on the ratio of the starting materials  25  . Recently, it demonstrated iodine redox chemistry to convert hole traps into electron traps possibly by oxidation during film processing  26  . Subsequently, the iodide management was proposed to effectively decrease the concentration of mid-gap defects in the perovskite films, and improve the PCEs of perovskite solar cells  [27] [28] [29]  . Yet, it lacks a feasible approach to be universally adopted in various halide perovskites, which suppresses the incidental I 2 in the absorber for enhanced device performance with reduced energy and voltage loss. In this work, we demonstrate a universal technique to suppress the incident I 2 in the halide precursor solution by employing alkaline, wherein iodine can be effectively eliminated via a disproportionation reaction under a number of different alkaline environments. The alkalinity is further demonstrated to affect the crystallization kinetics and optoelectronic properties of perovskite films. For instance, formamidine acetate as a 'residual free' weak alkaline, is found to effectively manipulate the stoichiometry of the cations in the mixed perovskite ((FA,MA,Cs)Pb(I,Br) 3 ) precursor, and in particular to reduce the density of deep-level defects in the resultant films substantially. Consequently, the corresponding mixed perovskite solar cells achieve an average PCE of 20.87% (certified). More interestingly, this modified absorber possesses a smaller bandgap, but the resultant device revealed unambiguous improvement in the open-circuit voltage (V OC ), corresponding to a V OC deficit of 413 mV, which is one of the smallest certified value in the planar perovskite solar cells. These findings provide a universal approach for defect reduction in iodide-based perovskite films, which substantially reduce the energy and voltage loss to boost the efficiency of the devices. 
 Results Suppression of I 2 impurity via alkaline additives. Precise control of precursor solutions is crucial for perovskite film deposition. Generally, the organic precursors are hygroscopic and unstable in air or under illumination. In particular, formamidine iodide (FAI) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) can be easily oxidized to form I 2 and/or other by-products, which induces the nonstoichiometric ratio in the precursor solution. It further leads to defect states in perovskite films that eventually deteriorate device performance. The degradation mechanism involves the formation of I 2 , which is thoroughly studied in previous work  30  . Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy was conducted to semiquantitatively investigate the formation of iodide species in the precursor solution  [27] [28] [29] 31  . As shown in Fig.  1a , the organic cation solution used to prepare the perovskite films shows a characteristic peak at 360 nm. It is often attributed to the absorption of I 3 -, stemmed from I -reacting reversibly with I 2 . Interestingly, the peak intensity equals to that of 10 -4 M I 2 in isopropanol, indicating the trace amount of I 2 in the organic cation precursor solution. To eliminate the incident I 2 in the precursor solution, we propose to create an alkaline environment by introducing additives in the precursor solution. A series of alkaline additives with different alkalinity were employed, such as formamidine acetate (FAAc, pK a ~7.64), sodium acetate (CH 3 COONa, pK a ~9.24), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 , pK a ~10.33), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, pK a ~14.56), and potassium hydroxide (KOH, pK a ~14.7), to create the full spectrum of alkalinity precursor environment in the context of the alkalinity (see Supplementary Notes 1 and 2 for details). Take the alkaline solution of FAAc/ ethanol for example, we observed that along with an increasing amount of FAAc, the absorbance at 360 nm for precursor solution was dramatically reduced (Fig.  1a ). Similarly, reduced absorbance at 360 nm was also observed when FAAc was added to the iodine solution (10 -4 M, Supplementary Fig.  1 ). This indicates that the diminishing absorbance at 360 nm in the precursor solution is due to the reduction of incident I 2 . Furthermore, CH 3 COONa, NaHCO 3 , NaOH, and KOH took the same effects as expected when added to the precursor solution (Fig.  1b-e ). Meanwhile, the addition of pure ethanol does not reduce the absorption peak of I 3 -(Supplementary Fig.  2 ). The disappearance of I 3 -(mostly related to I 2 ) in the alkaline environment possibly suggests a disproportionation reaction in the precursor solution, wherein I 2 is converted into iodate and iodide  32  (see Supplementary Note 3). In addition (Fig.  1f ), we found that the alkalinity of additives would largely influence the disproportionation reaction. It requires less amount of NaOH or KOH to eliminate the I 2 peak of precursor solution than that of FAAc, CH 3 COONa, or NaHCO 3 , mostly because the former ones are 'strong' alkaline in the context of conventional inorganic chemistry. Morphology, phase, and carrier lifetime analysis. The typical two-step approach was employed to fabricate the perovskite films (see details in the Methods section). We named the two-step processed reference perovskite film ((FA,MA,Cs)Pb(I,Br) 3 ) as the PVSK film. To ascertain the impact of alkaline additives on the morphology and crystallographic structure of the resultant films, we performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements accordingly. Compared with the PVSK film, the perovskite films with CH 3 COONa or FAAc additive exhibited enlarged grain size (Fig.  2a-c ), while those with NaOH or KOH remain the same grain size (Fig.  2d , Supplementary Fig.  3 ). It possibly indicates the different crystallization kinetics during film growth induced by the alkaline additives. Upon the employment of CH 3 COONa or FAAc, volatile acetate ions are reported to facilitate grain growth for better film quality  33  , which might account for the relatively enlarged grain size. On the contrary, perovskite films with the introduction of NaOH or KOH showed similar grain size, but a distinct crystalline grain morphology, as compared with the reference. It is often ascribed to the fact that Na + or K + is too small to incorporate into the perovskite lattice according to the Goldschmidt tolerance factor  34  . However, we cannot fully rule out the influences for crystal growth in the kinetics perspective, given the different chemical environments introduced by different alkalines, which will be discussed later. Furthermore, XRD results showed a dominating α-phase perovskite in all films (Fig.  2e ), indicating that all these additives do not impact the thermodynamics of crystal growth substantially. However, PbI 2 conversion process was affected by additives, as inferred from the formation of δ-phase perovskite, as well as the residual PbI 2 . We purposely controlled the stoichiometry in all samples with a bit excessive of PbI 2 for efficient passivation  35, 36  (see also Supplementary Note 4). We observed that perovskite films with mild alkaline additives (CH 3 COONa or NaHCO 3 ) only exhibited a relatively stronger PbI 2 peak, while a distinct δ-phase perovskite peak occurred when strong alkaline additives (NaOH or KOH) were added during film fabrication. It suggests that the alkalinity of the additives would affect the formation of the by-products, where the stronger alkaline would promote the formation of the δ-phase and suppress the formation of the α-phase perovskite as well. To confirm our speculation, MA (pK a = 10.62)/ethanol was introduced into the precursor solution (Fig.  2f ). We found a considerable amount of δ-phase perovskite in the resultant perovskite film. As predicted, the formation of the α-phase perovskite was suppressed substantially when the content of MA/ethanol was twice more. Interestingly, compared with the other additives, the weak alkaline FAAc resulted in the desirable phase quality, with significantly improved film crystallinity and less PbI 2 content, as compared with that of the reference and other additives. The intrinsic defects in perovskite films affect the photogenerated carrier behavior and device performance, which also would be affected by the alkalinity of the additives. We therefore conducted time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analysis to study the dynamics of carrier recombination. The perovskite films were deposited on glass by using a precursor solution with different alkaline additives. The TRPL decay curves (Fig.  2g ) were fitted with the bi-exponential rate law (Supplementary Table  1 ). We found that the perovskite films with addition of a weak alkaline possessed a longer carrier lifetime than those with the addition of a strong alkaline. The prolonged lifetime of perovskite films with a weak alkaline additive, compared with that of the PVSK film, was attributed to the suppression of incident I 2 in precursor solution and the desired film features, e.g., morphology and phase. Among all samples with alkaline additives, the perovskite film with FAAc exhibited the longest lifetime for both fast and slow recombination (τ 1 = 132.7 ns and τ 2 = 802.2 ns), indicating its lowest non-radiative recombination centers. To be noted, the introduction of Na + or K + also could possibly deform the perovskite crystal structure, which may lead to shallow defect sites or off-bandgap defects in perovskite films  [37] [38] [39] [40]  (see Supplementary Note 5). Crystallization kinetics control via alkalinity. We further investigate the underlying crystallization kinetics of the formation of the α-phase perovskite by developing an in situ UV-vis absorption measurement. In a typical experiment, the organic cation solution was spin-coated onto the annealed PbI 2 layer, which was further characterized by a UV-vis absorption spectrometer immediately. By varying the alkalinity in precursor solution (Fig.  3a ), we clearly observed that the formation of the αphase perovskite, whose main absorption peak ranged from 450 to 800 nm, was suppressed substantially when the alkalinity gets stronger. To be noted, the absorption before 450 nm might stem from the PbI 2 or the δ-phase perovskite. Moreover, we judiciously selected two typical alkaline additives, e.g., FAAc (weak alkaline) and NaOH (strong alkaline), and continuously tracked the conversion evolution from PbI 2 to the α-phase perovskite. Compared with the reference (Fig.  3b ), the weak alkaline does not affect the formation of the α-phase perovskite, as expected. Accordingly, the absorption peak of the α-phase perovskite in the main range (450-800 nm) is increased continuously as time grows. The inset figure in Fig.  3b  provides a visualization of the improved absorption in the range of 450 and 800 nm, suggesting the continuous formation of the α-phase perovskite. On the contrary (Fig.  3c ), the formation of the α-phase perovskite with a strong alkaline was suppressed substantially. Even over time, only small changes occurred, as visualized in the inset figure of Fig.  3c . Based on the above analysis, we confirmed that the crystallization kinetics of the transformation from PbI 2 to the α-phase perovskite, namely the activation energy, was influenced by the alkalinity of additives. As shown in scheme (Fig.  3d ), when the alkalinity in the precursor gets stronger, the activation energy becomes larger, leading to an increased barrier for the transformation from the PbI 2 to the α-phase perovskite. The results suggest that while incident I 2 could be effectively eliminated via a disproportionation reaction under various alkaline environments, the alkalinity of the additives is also crucial to fabricate highquality perovskite films with a desired phase. Because of the enrichment of the OH -anion when alkalinity gets stronger, we speculate that the oxygen in the OH -anion could participate in the coordination with lead iodide with stronger bonding. This may facilitate the structural transformation from PbI 2 to the δphase perovskite, leading to an increased energy barrier for the transformation of PbI 2 to the α-phase perovskite. To verify the argument, we further performed the DFT simulation to analyze the exact activation energy for the formation of both the α-phase and δ-phase of the FAPbI 3 perovskite in different conditions. The Calculation setup was given in Methods and Supplementary Note 6. As shown in Fig.  3e , two converse trends of the activation energy change are observed upon the introduction of OH -into synthesis. At the low OH -concentration, the δ-phase FAPbI 3 has shown a much higher activation energy of 5.352 eV, which is 1.834 eV higher than that of the α-phase. As the OH -concentration increases, the activation energies of δ-phase FAPbI 3 decline from 5.352 to 4.143 eV. However, the activation energies of α-phase FAPbI 3 increase from 3.518 to 4.293 eV, and finally exceed that of δ-phase FAPbI 3 . It clearly suggests that the formation of the α-phase perovskite is only preferred at a low OH -concentration. With the increase of OH -concentration, δ-phase FAPbI 3 is more preferred kinetically, which is in consistent with the observation of the experiments above. Weak alkaline additives to reduce defect state density. To generalize the above findings, we selected three alkalines with a weak alkalinity, such as FAAc, triethanolamine hydrochloride The results demonstrate that the additives with a weak alkalinity could successfully decrease the trap state density of iodine-based perovskite films via effectively inhibiting incident I 2 in the precursor solution. Combining the influence for alkalinity on the crystallization kinetics of perovskite films, the resultant devices show improved photovoltaic efficiency. To obtain an in-depth understanding of the influence of a weak alkaline on the defect state of the perovskite, we chose the FAAc as an example and named the corresponding two-step processed perovskite film ((FA,MA,Cs)Pb(I,Br) 3 -FAAc) as the PVSK-FA. At first, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of PVSK and PVSK-FA over a temperature from 78 to 350 K were obtained and investigated (Fig.  4a, b ). Within the temperature range of interest, the emission peak of PVSK-FA exhibited a distinct red shift as compared with PVSK, which was consistent with the UV-vis absorption results (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). It indicates a higher ratio of FA + incorporated into the PVSK-FA due to the addition of an additive in the precursor. It was documented that the MAPbI 3 film exhibited a broadening inhomogeneous multi-peak emission feature from a lowtemperature phase, partially attributed to additional charge or exciton trap states only activated in low temperature  41  . However, in Figure  4a , b, we did not observe the above-mentioned multipeak feature at a low temperature in the PVSK and PVSK-FA, indicating the characteristics of less traps. With temperature increasing, we observed a broadening of the emission line due to the electron-phonon coupling near room temperature, which was a consistent recent study in the FAPbI 3 film 42 . Interestingly, the PL spectra of the PVSK-FA exhibited a better symmetry than the PVSK with temperature increasing from 250 to 350 K (Fig.  4c ). On the one hand, the absence of an asymmetric feature in this film may suggest significant reduction of defect states near the band edge. It is believed that reduced grain boundaries may lead to reduced defects  43  , which is consistent with the morphology analysis of larger grains in the corresponding films (Fig.  2a, b ). On the other hand, better symmetry in the PL peak indicates the absence of shoulder peaks often attributed to the slight phase segregation in the mixed perovskites  37  . It is thus implied that PVSK-FA possibly exhibited a retarded phase segregation and decreased defect states, when compared with the PVSK. We further carefully examined the luminescence efficiency of the absorber, which serves as an important measure to identify a high-quality semiconductor  [44] [45] [46]  . Generally, deep-level defects serve as non-radiative recombination centers to capture the photogenerated charge carriers, thereby dramatically cutting down the quantum efficiency of photoluminescence and photovoltaic efficiency in solar cells. To be noted, a good solar cell has to be a good light-emitting diode  44  . According to Shockley-Queisser equation, the V OC of the device decreases when the luminescence quantum efficiency of the absorber decreases. Here, the PL quantum efficiency (PLQE) of the perovskite film was examined as a function of excitation power (Fig.  4d ). The PLQE was relatively small for either PVSK or PVSK-FA at low excitation power, but rapidly went up with the increase of excitation power. It indicates that the radiative recombination prevails at high optical injection levels, wherein non-radiative recombination centers were filled up, which have been further discussed in Supplementary Note 8. Notably, the PLQE of PVSK-FA achieved 61% when the excitation power was 100 mW cm -2 (close to the device working condition), which is more than twice as that of PVSK (PLQE = 25%). It further revealed obvious enhancement of PLQE compared with PVSK To find the defect energy level in the perovskite films, we conducted thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) analysis. It is widely adopted in perovskite solar cells to extract the native defect state-level information through the identification of junction capacitance. Given a p-type perovskite semiconductor, the defect activation energy (E a ) is approximately the depth of defect state energy level relative to the valance band of the perovskite  47, 48  . Here, TAS measurement was carried out from 250 to 350 K with a step of 10 K to obtain the temperature-dependent admittance spectra for PVSK and PVSK-FA-based devices (Fig.  4e, f ). The characteristic transition angular frequency (ω 0 ) was extracted from the derivative of the capacitance-frequency spectrum. The relationship between E a and ω 0 follows the equation: ω 0 = βT 2 exp(-E a /kT), where β is a temperature-dependent parameter, k is the Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. The Arrhenius plot (Fig.  4g ) derived from the temperature-dependent ω 0 and fitted curves revealed that the E a of PVSK and PVSK-FA devices were 0.282 and 0.238 eV, respectively. Moreover, attempted to illustrate the energetic profile regarding the trap density of states (tDOS) in the perovskite absorber (Fig.  4h ). It could be derived from the equation N T (E ω ) = -ωV bi /qkTW × dC/dω and E ω = kT ln(βT 2 /ω), where q is the elementary charge, ω is the angular frequency, V bi is the built-in potential, and W is the depletion region, respectively  49  . The V bi and W were obtained from the Mott-Schottky analysis (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). As expected, the PVSK device exhibited a relatively large density of defect states, especially around the deep defect level at 0.282 eV. Previous DFT calculation study  26  reported that this defect-state level (0.282 eV) could potentially be ascribed to iodine interstitials (I i ), which was the deep-level defect state and dominating non-radiative recombination centers in devices. Interestingly, the PVSK-FA device exhibited a striking reduction of the deep-level defect state at 0.282 eV for two orders of magnitude. In addition, the shallow defect states (0.1-0.2 eV) were also suppressed. Considering the analysis above, we reasonably claim that the introduction of a weak alkaline additive could effectively suppress the incident I 2 in the precursor solution and significantly reduce the I i defect states and achieve a much smaller defect activation energy in the resultant perovskite films. In this case, our iodine suppression approach looks contradictory with the previous research  29  ; however, we argue that the discrepancy in these two approaches of iodine management is mostly due to different physiochemical properties in the corresponding absorber layers. It likely stemmed from the two film growth techniques applied and different material compositions, which is further discussed in Supplementary Note 9. Beside of defects at the deep energy level, tail defects at the band edge were further investigated. Urbach tail profiles of perovskite films were calculated according to the formula equation: α = α 0 exp(hv/E U ), where α 0 is a constant, E U denotes Urbach energy, and α is an absorption coefficient. The absorption coefficient versus energy plots were presented in Supplementary Fig.  6 . As is reported  33, 50  , low E U is highly desirable for semiconductor devices, indicative of less electronic disorders in the crystal lattice (or less impurities). Accordingly, the E U values were estimated to be 31.22 and 29.64 meV for PVSK and PVSK-FA, respectively. Assuming the same level of thermal disorder, the smaller E U value obtained from PVSK-FA demonstrated a lower level of electronic disorder at the band edge. To quantitatively assess the concentration of defects across the entire device, the current density-voltage curves under the dark state for capacitor-like devices with indium tin oxide (ITO)/ perovskite/gold (Au) configuration were measured (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). The linear current density-voltage relation at the low bias suggested an ohmic response, and the transition point was considered as the voltage at which all the traps were filled (trapfilled limit voltage: V TFL ). The concentration of defects was determined by the equation N defects = 2εε 0 V TFL /qL 2 , where q is the elementary charge, ε is the relative dielectric constant, ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, and L is the thickness of the perovskite films obtained from the cross-sectional SEM images of the ITO/ perovskite/Au devices (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). It is reasonable to assume that the slight introduction of an additive would not affect the relative dielectric constants of perovskite films significantly  51  . The defect density N defects was estimated to be 1.38 × 10 16 and 0.47 × 10 16 cm -3 for PVSK and PVSK-FA devices, respectively. It clearly confirms that the defect density in the perovskite absorber has been significantly reduced to nearly an order of magnitude by the addition of a weak alkaline additive. Moreover, we have conducted femtosecond optical measurements  52  and confirmed that PVSK-FA exhibited a lower defect density than the PVSK film, which is the same order of magnitude as the above result (Supplementary Note 10). Weak alkaline additive to improve photovoltaic performance. The significant reduction in intrinsic defect density within the perovskite film was expected to suppress the non-radiative recombination channel effectively and improve the device performance. To prove it, we fabricated the planar heterojunction devices using the structure ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMe-TAD/Au (Supplementary Fig.  9 ) and studied the impacts of weak alkaline additives on photovoltaic performance. Figure  5a  presents the current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the optimized perovskite devices measured under standard AM 1.5 G at ambient condition. The typical PVSK device yielded a PCE of 19.97% with a V OC of 1.102 V, a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 23.83 mA cm -2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 76.05%. Meanwhile, the best PVSK-FA device exhibited a significantly improved performance with a V OC of 1.145 V, a J SC of 24.05 mA cm -2 , a FF of 76.31%, and the corresponding PCE of 21.01%. One of our best devices was sent to the accredited PV calibration laboratory (Newport, USA) and the certified PCE was 20.87% (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). The slightly enhanced J SC value was attributed to improved lightharvesting capacity and a slightly red shift of the absorption onset. The major improvement in device performance was contributed from V OC enhancement, thanks to the high-quality perovskite thin film with significantly reduced intrinsic defect density by the addition of a weak alkaline additive. To be emphasized, in the present study, the addition of FAAc could slightly reduce the bandgap of the resultant film from 1.57 eV to 1.56 eV but increase V OC from 1.102 to 1.147 V in the resulting device. It is interesting that although the bandgap of the perovskite film decreased, the V OC of the relevant solar devices actually improved (Fig.  5b ). It thus reveals one vital feature for this high-efficiency device, which is the small V OC deficit (defined as E g /q -V OC , where E g is the optical bandgap and q is the elemental charge). V OC deficit is an essential indicator to measure the potential of the photovoltaic material and the maturity of the relevant technology. Current V OC deficit for c-silicon, GaAs, and organic solar cells are around 400, 300, and 600 mV, respectively  53  . Surprisingly, the corresponding V OC deficit in our device decreased to 413 mV upon FAAc addition, wherein both the V OC (1.147 V) and the bandgap (1.56 eV) were certified through a third party. The V OC deficit of 413 mV is one of the smallest certified value for planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells to date. It further implies substantially reduced non-radiative recombination losses in the PVSK-FA device, which was consistent with the high PLQE measured previously. In addition, we did not observe an appreciable J-V hysteresis in the corresponding device, and the average PCE of 20.91% was achieved (Fig.  5c  and Supplementary Fig.  10 ). The integrated photocurrent density gave a calculated value of 23.47 mA cm -2 from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum (Supplementary Fig.  11 ), which was comparable with the result from J-V   measurement. In addition, a steady-state current density of 21.89 mA cm -2 and a stabilized PCE of 20.80%, were also achieved by holding the voltage at the maximum power point (0.95 V) for the PVSK-FA device (Fig.  5d ). To probe the reliability and repeatability, 20 individual devices were fabricated with the identical processing condition and the corresponding statistical distribution of the PCE values was presented (Supplementary Fig.  12 ). The average efficiency for the PVSK and PVSK-FA devices were 19.34% and 20.63%, respectively. Furthermore, we have investigated the long-term stability of the PVSK and PVSK-FA-based devices, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  13 . The reference without further encapsulation degraded to be around 80% within 1500 h of storage in an N 2 glove box, whereas the PVSK-FA-based devices exhibited less degradation. It is possibly because of the higher thin-film quality of PVSK-FA with reduced defect states, which inhibits the penetration of undesirable water or oxygen molecules that further decompose perovskite films. Meanwhile, it may also correlate to the elimination of incident I 2 , which has been demonstrated to induce the chemical chain degradation of the perovskite  31  . To gain further insights into the carrier dynamics across the device, we measured transient photocurrent (TPC) and photovoltage (TPV) decays of PVSK and PVSK-FA-based devices on the microsecond scale  54  . The PVSK-FA-based device exhibited a faster decay than that of the PVSK-based device, and the charge transport lifetime (τ t ) derived from TPC measurements (Supplementary Fig.  14 ) was decreased from 4.13 to 1.97 μs, indicating a dramatic improvement of charge transport capability for the PVSK-FA-based device. The TPV curves were correlated to the carrier recombination rates under the open-circuit condition in the full cell. We observed that the PVSK-FA-based device demonstrated a much slower decay, when compared with that of the PVSK-based device (Fig.  5e ). The charge recombination lifetime (τ r ) derived from the TPV curves was significantly prolonged from 12.40 to 19.37 μs, suggesting that the carrier recombination was predominately prohibited in the device. It indicates that the prolonged lifetime constant τ r contributed from substantially reduced defect density in the perovskite material by the addition of weak alkaline additives. Furthermore, we measured the V OC change as a function of illumination intensity to elucidate the carrier recombination mechanism during device operation. For both PVSK and PVSK-FA-based devices, the V OC increased monotonically with incident light intensity (Fig.  5f ). According to the equation V OC = nkT/q ln(I SC /I 0 + 1), the values of the ideality factor were calculated to be 1.51 and 1.02, respectively. Generally, the ideality factor derails from unity if Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination occurs  55  . In our study, the ideality factor for the PVSK-FA-based device showed a significant reduction from 1.51 to 1.02, when compared with that of the PVSK-based device. It demonstrates that trap-assisted SRH recombination was suppressed substantially due to the reduced intrinsic defect density, which was in good agreement with previous results. 
 Discussion In summary, we demonstrate a universal pathway to effectively suppress the incident I 2 defects and manipulate the stoichiometry via the iodine disproportionation reaction under an alkaline environment. The alkalinity is proven to be a crucial parameter that greatly impacts the crystallization kinetics and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite films. A weak alkaline consisting of the FA + cation was demonstrated to serve as a 'residual' free agent to suppress deep-level defect density in the mixed perovskites ((FA,MA,Cs)Pb(I,Br) 3 ), which provides extra benefits in tuning the A-site stoichiometry and film morphology. Featured with a narrower bandgap of the absorber though, the device exhibited a significant enhancement on V OC . It observed one of the smallest V OC deficits of 413 mV in a certified planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell with an average PCE of 20.87%. These findings would bridge the gap between precursor chemistry and deep-level defect behavior in the perovskite film, particularly the iodide-based perovskite, which guides the design of nextgeneration perovskite solar cells with an efficiency approaching the theoretical limit. 
 Methods Materials. All the reagents and chemicals were used as received, including PbI 2 (99.999%, Sigma Aldrich), CsI (99.90%, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), N,Ndimethylformamide (99.99%, Sigma Aldrich), dimethyl sulfoxide (99.50%, Sigma Aldrich), sodium acetate (AR, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), formamidine acetate (99%, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), sodium bicarbonate (AR, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), sodium hydroxide (AR, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), potassium hydroxide (AR, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), sodium hypophosphite (99%, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), triethanolamine hydrochloride (99.5%, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), spiro-OMeTAD (Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp.), chlorobenzene (99.9%, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), 4tertbutylpyridine (99.90%, Sigma Aldrich), lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (99.95%, Sigma Aldrich), anhydrous ethyl alcohol (99.5%, Sigma Aldrich, product code: 459836), anhydrous isopropanol (99.5%, Sigma Aldrich, product code: 278475), and tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) substrates. All the formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium iodide (MAI), methylammonium bromine (MABr), and methylammonium chloride (MACl) were synthesized and purified according to the procedure mentioned in the pervious literature  54  . Preparation of the SnO 2 films. The tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) substrates were cleaned with acetone, deionized water, and isopropanol ultrasonically. The tin (IV) oxide colloidal dispersion (SnO 2 , 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. The precursor solution was diluted by H 2 O to 2.67% and then spin-coated onto glass/ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and finally baked on a hot plate at 150 °C for 30 min in ambient air. Preparation of the perovskite precursor and films. To prepare the PbI 2 and organic cation precursors, 600 mg of PbI 2 and 18 mg of CsI were dissolved in 1 mL of mixture solvent of DMF:DMSO (9:1 v:v) and then annealed on a hot plate at 70 °C for 2 h with vigorous stirring. In all, 40 mg of FAI, 19 mg of MAI, 6 mg of MABr, and 5 mg of MACl were dissolved in 1 mL of isopropanol and then continuously stirred for 2 h at room temperature. To prepare the alkaline additive solution, 45 mg of different additives were dissolved in 1 mL of anhydrous ethyl alcohol at 70 °C for 30 min with vigorous stirring. Due to the different solubility of alkaline additives in ethyl alcohol, the possible supernatant was separated (Supplementary Note 11). For the certified perovskite solar cell, 45 mg of FAAc were dissolved in 1 mL of ethyl alcohol at 70 °C for 30 min with vigorous stirring. Then, 30 μL of FAAc ethanol solution was added to 1 mL of organic cation solution before being prepared with the perovskite film. The typical sequent-step method was employed to fabricate the perovskite film. First, the PbI 2 precursor was spincoated on the SnO 2 substrate in an N 2 glove box at 2300 rpm for 30 s (accelerated speed 6000 rpm s -1 ) and then annealed at 70 °C for 1 min in an N 2 glove box. Then, the organic cation precursor was spin-coated on the PbI 2 film at 2000 rpm for 30 s (accelerated speed 6000 rpm s -1 ) in an N 2 glove box. Finally, the film was kept under vacuum for 5 min and annealed at 150 °C for 15 min in ambient air to form the perovskite film. Preparation of the Spiro-OMeTAD films and gold electrode. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was first prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD, 17.5 μL of a stock solution of 520 mg mL -1 LiTFSI/acetonitrile, and 28.8 μL of tBP in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. Then the Spiro-OMeTAD precursor was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s (accelerated speed 6000 rpm s -1 ) in an N 2 glove box. Finally, 100 -nm-thick gold was thermally evaporated as a counterelectrode under a pressure of 1 × 10 -4 Pa on top of the Spiro-OMeTAD films to form the back contact by using a shadow mask to pattern the electrode. Calculation setup. The calculations have been applied through DFT within CASTEP packages  56  . For the functional, the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof-based generalized gradient approximation (GGA)  57  has been selected to describe the electronic exchange-correlation interaction. All the geometry optimizations have been operated based on the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shannon (BFGS) algorithm, in which the residue of the Hellmann-Feynman forces will be converged to less than 0.001 eV A -1 . The additional convergence criteria for the total energy and the interionic displacement are set to be less than 5 × 10 -5 eV per atom and 0.005 Å per atom, respectively. The ultrafine plane-wave cutoff energy with the ultrasoft pseudopotential scheme has been chosen as the basis set. The OH - molecule has been inserted into the PbI 2 model and FAPbI 3 unit cells with a different ratio n (n = 0.1-0.5) to represent the different concentration, which can be referred to as '#/unit cell' in this simulation. The corresponding effect to the activation energies will be calculated based on the following equation: E act ¼ E FAPbI 3 OH ð Þ n À E PbI 2 OH ð Þ n À E FAI ð1Þ The Monkhost-Pack reciprocal space integration was performed using a spacing of 0.07 Å -1 in all models with a different OH -concentration  58  , which was also self-consistently suggested by total energy minimization. With this special kpoint sampling, the total energy is converged within the maximum expected selfconsistent cycles. Characterization. The absorbance of different precursor solutions and perovskite films was measured by a Hitachi UH4150 spectrophotometer. The integrating sphere was employed when we characterized the perovskite film. A field-emission SEM instrument (Hitachi S-4800) was used to acquire SEM images. The electron beam was accelerated at 5.0 kV. Temperature-dependent steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained by FLS980 (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.), equipped with a Xe lamp, a liquid nitrogen cryostat (Oxford Instruments, Optis-tatDN-V), and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector. The excitation wavelength was 470 nm. The picosecond pulsed diode laser (EPL-470, Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.) was used to measure PL lifetime with a repetition rate of 0.2 MHz, a pulse width of 91.5 ps, a excitation fluence of ∼30 nJ cm -2 , and maximum average power of 5 mW. The PLQE data were obtained from a three-step technique through the combination of a 445-nm continuous-wave laser, a spectrometer, an optical fiber, and an integrating sphere  59, 60  . The powder XRD spectra (θ-2θ scans) were taken on a X'Pert3 powder X-ray diffraction system (PANalytical Inc.) with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) as the X-ray source. The thermal admittance spectroscopy were conducted on Zahner Zennium pro Electrochemical Workstation at various temperatures (T = 250-350 K) in the dark from 10 0 to 10 6 Hz. A small AC voltage of 50 mV was used, and the DC bias was kept at zero to avoid the influence of the ferroelectric effect for perovskite materials during measurement. For temperaturedependent characterization, the sample was mounted in the Cryo Industries Liquid Nitrogen Dewars with Lake Shore model 335 cryogenic temperature controller. The current density-voltage (J-V) curves were measured (2400 Series SourceMeter, Keithley Instruments) under a simulated AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm -2 (Newport Thermal Oriel 91192 1000-W solar simulator). The light intensity was calibrated using a KG-5 Si diode. The J-V measurements were carried out in ambient air. The sweep speed was fixed at 40 mV s -1 (step 0.02 V, delay time 500 ms). The shading mask and one of our best device were sent to an accredited PV calibration laboratory (Newport, USA) for certification. The active area was defined as 0.09408 cm 2 . External quantum efficiencies (EQE) were obtained by an Enli Technology (Taiwan) EQE measurement system. A calibrated silicon diode with the known spectral response was used as a reference. For the transient photovoltage or photocurrent (TPV or TPC) decay measurements, a white light bias was from an array of diodes (Molex 180081-4320) to simulate 1-sun working condition, and the carriers were excited by a 532-nm pulse laser.

Record Open-Circuit Voltage Wide-Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells Utilizing 2D/3D Perovskite Heterostructure
wide-bandgap organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (WBPs) exhibiting a bandgap of E G ∼ 1.7-1.8 eV are a key focus of current research since they are ideally suited for the top absorber material in tandem PV architectures based on established low-bandgap PV technologies, such as the market-dominating crystalline Si waferbased solar cells or copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) thin-film devices. [11][12][13][14] In recent years, the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite/Si tandem solar cells rose quickly, reaching 26.4% for perovskite/Si tandem solar cells in 4-terminal configuration and 27.3% in 2-terminal configuration. A PCE of 23.9% was reported for perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cells. [12,15,16]  Moreover, WBPs are of key relevance for the emerging perovskite/perovskite thin-film tandem PV technology. [17]  For all of these perovskite-based multijunction solar cell technologies, promising first steps toward the upscaling to solar modules architectures have been demonstrated. [15,[18][19][20] In order to enable perovskite-based multijunction PV technologies to significantly outperform the market-dominating crystalline Si single-junction solar cells (record PCE of 26.6%), further advancement of WBP solar cells with regard to stability In this work, the authors realize stable and highly efficient wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells that promise high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) and are likely to play a key role in next generation multi-junction photovoltaics (PV). This work reports on wide-bandgap (≈1.72 eV) perovskite solar cells exhibiting stable PCEs of up to 19.4% and a remarkably high open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.31 V. The V OC -to-bandgap ratio is the highest reported for wide-bandgap organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells and the V OC also exceeds 90% of the theoretical maximum, defined by the Shockley-Queisser limit. This advance is based on creating a hybrid 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure. By spin coating n-butylammonium bromide on the doublecation perovskite absorber layer, a thin 2D Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite layer of intermediate phases is formed, which mitigates nonradiative recombination in the perovskite absorber layer. As a result, V OC is enhanced by 80 mV.
(2 of 10) and PCE is of uppermost importance.  [9, 10, 21]  WBPs conventionally consist of organic-inorganic mixed-halide lead perovskites, represented by the crystal structure ABX 3 . The bandgap (E G ) of these perovskites can be tuned by changing the stoichiometric ratio of Br and I at the halogen anion site X as well as the incorporation of Sn at the Pb cation site.  [22] [23] [24] [25] [26]  In order to circumvent the instabilities in WBPs with high Br content due to phase segregation, compositional engineering of the A cation site using methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), Cesium (Cs), or Rubidium (Rb) was proven to be successful. Starting from double-cation (FA/Cs) compositions at the A cation site, a large variety of different A cation compositions has shown high PCE and enhanced stability, including both triple-cation (FA/MA/Cs) and quadruple-cation (FA/MA/Cs/Rb) compositions.  [12, 14, [27] [28] [29] [30]  In addition to the compositional engineering of the perovskite structure, several complementary strategies have been explored to further advance the stability and PCE, e.g., i) by controlling the crystallization of the perovskite film; ii) the incorporation of additives, such as Pb-(SCN) 2 , potassium or formamide; and iii) the use of surface passivation layers, such as quaternary ammonium halide anions or fullerenes like C 60 .  [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38]  Recently, 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures have emerged as a new concept to further enhance the stability and increase the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of multication perovskite solar cells by employing alkylammonium organic cations (e.g., butylammonium (BA), phenylethylammonium iodide) in the perovskite structure.  [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47]  The resulting 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures mitigate nonradiative recombination, resulting in an impressive V OC of 1.24 V for a bulk perovskite absorber bandgap of 1.72 eV.  [41]  There is virtue of layered perovskite materials that can be explored in the future for the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) or 2D Dion-Jacobsen (DJ) families of perovskites.  [48, 49]  Despite the remarkable progress, the maximum V OC of all WBP solar cells in the optimal optical bandgap range for perovskite-based tandem PV (1.7-1.8 eV) remains limited to 1.24 eV (see Figure  1 ) and a PCE of 17.2%.  [50, 51]  In this work, a significant advance is demonstrated in this regard, making use of 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures. By depositing n-butylammonium bromide (BABr) on the 3D perovskite surface, a hybrid 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure is created at the interface toward the hole-extracting layer of the WBP solar cells (E G ∼ 1.72 eV). For very thin 2D perovskite layers, an unprecedented stable power output conversion efficiency (SPCE) of 19.4% and a V OC up to 1.31 V in planar architecture WBPs solar cells is demonstrated (see Figure  1  and Figure  S1 , Supporting Information). The WBP solar cells in focus of this study employ a doublecation perovskite absorber layer based on the cations FA and Cs in the composition Cs 0.17 FA 0.83 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 , exhibiting a bandgap of 1.72 eV (see Figure  S2 , Supporting Information), as first reported by McMeekin et al.  [27]  The devices were fabricated using the following planar device architecture: glass substrate, indium tin oxide (ITO) front electrode, nanoparticle-based SnO 2 electron transport layer (ETL), double-cation perovskite absorber layer (Cs 0.17 FA 0.83 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 ), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N, N′-di-p-methoxy phenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) hole transport layer (HTL) and Au back electrode (see Figure  2a ). The detailed device fabrication is presented in the Experimental Section. The reference device (without interlayer) exhibits a SPCE under constant illumination at AM 1.5G for 5 min of 16.7% and a V OC of 1.23 V (see Figure  2b, c ). By spin coating BABr dissolved in isopropanol (2 mg mL -1 ) on top of the perovskite absorber layer, an interlayer is introduced in between the bulk perovskite layer and the HTL. As shown later, this interlayer is likely composed of 2D-RP perovskite in intermediate phase of n = 2, resulting in a thin 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure at the hole-extracting side of the solar cell. The device incorporating the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure demonstrates a very high PCE of 19.8% and SPCE of 19.4% with less hysteresis under continuous illumination of one-sun irradiation intensity (AM 1.5G with 1000 W m -2 ) (see Figure  2b ,c and Figure  S3 , Supporting Information). Moreover, an enhancement in V OC of up to 80 mV is observed, leading to a stable unprecedented V OC for WBPs (E G ∼ 1.72 eV) of up to 1.31 eV (see Figures  1  and 2b,d ). This V OC reaches >90% of the maximum V OC attainable for this bandgap according to the Shockley-Queisser limit (S-Q limit) and represents the highest ratio of qV OC /E G (0.76) reported for any perovskite solar cell of PCEs > 13% (see Figure  1  and Table  S1 , Supporting Information). It shall be noted that the E G is determined in different ways for the various references provided in Figure  1 , which introduces a small inaccuracy (<2%) in the comparison of qV OC /E G . In this work, we determine the bandgap from a Tauc plot, which is sufficient considering the sharp absorption edge of perovskites (see Figure  S2 , Supporting Information). While the ratio qV OC /E G serves as a coarse but convenient figure-of-merit to quickly examine the quality of any PV absorber material, the ratio of the experimental V OC to the maximum attainable V OC according to the S-Q limit represents a fundamental comparison to a hypothetical perfect solar cell Adv.

The dash line indicates a V OC representing 90% of the maximum V OC for a certain E G defined by the S-Q limit. The gray region indicates the ideal top cell bandgap range (1.7-1.8 eV) for perovskite-based multijunction solar cells with a crystalline Si bottom solar cell.

 (3 of 10) that exhibits exclusively radiative recombination and no nonradiative recombination losses.  [52] [53] [54]  Thus, the demonstrated high experimental V OC manifests the high quality of the presented 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure in the wide context of PV materials. Along with the improved V OC , the fill factor (FF) also increases (up to 0.78), without any loss in short-circuit current density (J SC ), indicating that the efficiency of charge extraction at low external fields is also very good. The stable and reproducible performance of the perovskite solar cells employing the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure is proven further by providing data on the statistics of a number of devices (>29) that all demonstrate a significant V OC enhancement compared to the 3D reference perovskite devices (see Figure  2e ). Besides, devices with 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure exhibit stable V OC over time if kept under one-sun illumination (see Figure  2f ) and stable power output up to 20 h (see Figure  S3 , Supporting Information). The high V OC and PCE of WBP solar cells require optimization of the thickness of the 2D-RP perovskite interlayer, as presented in Figure  3 . Here, the statistics of the PV characteristics of several devices using 2D-RP perovskite interlayers processed by spin coating of BABr solution with various concentrations (2, 5, and 7.5 mg mL -1 ) are provided. The V OC increases up to 1.32 V for a concentration of 5 mg mL -1 , but drops for higher concentrations. The FF and J SC increase slightly for an optimal concentration of 2 mg mL -1 compared to the reference case and decrease strongly for higher concentrations along with a significant increase in series resistance (see Table  S2 , Supporting Information). This trend is attributed to the low conductivity of the disordered 2D-RP perovskite interlayers and the expected increase in thickness of the interlayers with increasing BABr concentration (2, 5, and 7.5 mg mL -1 ), which is indicated in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the surface of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information) and cross-sectional SEM images (Figures S5 and S6, Supporting Information).  [55, 56]  In addition, the absorptance spectra (Figure  S7 , Supporting Information) show a thickness reduction of the 3D perovskite layer explained by the increasing 2D-RP perovskites interlayer thickness along with increasing BABr concentration, which in turn also accounts for a reduction in short-current density. It should be noted further that the J SC derived from external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements of the 3D reference perovskite and 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure solar cells treated with different BABr concentrations (2, 5, 7.5 mg mL -1 ) are 18.4, 18.6, 17.4, and 11.8 mA cm -2 , respectively, which is in good agreement (± 0.8 mA cm -2 ) with the J SC obtained from the J-V scans of the corresponding devices (see Figure  S8 , Supporting Information). In order to confirm that the interlayer formed by spin coating BABr solution on top of the perovskite is indeed a 2D-RP perovskite, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed. The as-prepared double-cation perovskite thin-film exhibits the typical XRD peaks resulting from perovskite crystal plane diffraction of (100), (110), (111), and (200), corresponding to the Cs 0.17 FA 0.83 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 perovskite lattice (see Figure  4a ).  [31]  A very prominent new periodic diffraction pattern with peaks at 2θ ≈ 4.5°, 9.0°, 13   
 (4 of 10) stars in Figure  4a ) and is well pronounced for the samples with high concentration BABr surface treatments (5 and 7.5 mg mL -1 ). This new periodic diffraction pattern corres ponds neither to the XRD pattern of the double-cation perovskite nor the pure precursor BABr (see Figure  S9 , Supporting Information). Instead, the additional periodic XRD peaks are characteristic for layers of stacked 2D perovskite material (superlattice), namely, a periodic pattern with Δ2θ ∼ 4.5° and peaks at low angles below the first diffraction peak of the 3D perovskite structure are indicative of a material with a larger unit cell.  [57] [58] [59] [60]  From the periodic diffraction pattern peaks and the fundamental Bragg's law of diffraction, the superlattice spacing of the 2D-RP perovskite interlayers, formed on top of the 3D perovskite layer, is determined to be around 2.0 nm (see Figure  S10 , Supporting Information). The XRD peaks of the 2D-RP perovskite are indexed based on the cell parameters (a = 8.559, b = 38.117, c = 8.770 Å, α = β = γ = 90°) found for the high-concentration (7.5 mg mL -1 ) BABr-coated sample. Comparing the cell parameters and the superlattice spacing to very similar 2D-RP perovskite materials reported in literature (e.g., (BA) 2 (MA)Pb n I 3n+1 with n = 2), the 2D-RP perovskite in this work is considered to be an intermediate phase with n = 2, which implies that the 2D-RP perovskite exhibits two unit cells of the perovskite crystal structure orthogonal to the 2D plane, as illustrated in Figure  4c .  [59, 60]  Given that BABr is a long-chain organic cation that commonly features the formation of the 2D-RP perovskite crystal structure (BA) 2 (B)Pb n I 3n+1 on CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 (where the B cation site is FA, Cs, or MA, and n is referring to the number of the intermediate phase), it is consistent that 2D-RP perovskites are created when the double-cation perovskite is exposed to BABr.  [31, 58]  This suggests that a 2D-RP perovskite of the structure BA y (Cs x FA 1-x ) 1-y Pb 2 (Br 0.4 I 0.6 ) 7 is formed, where x and y remain yet unknown. It should be noted that the distinct XRD pattern of the 2D-RP perovskite is not apparent in the overview XRD scan (see Figure  4a ) for the very thin interlayer prepared from a low-concentration BABr solution (2 mg mL -1 ), which nevertheless demonstrates optimal device performance (high V OC and stable PCE as shown in Figure  3 ). In order to confirm that the very thin interlayers also exhibit a 2D-RP perovskite material, extended XRD studies using higher X-ray intensities and long integration times were conducted with the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure prepared from 2 mg mL -1 BABr solution. As shown in Figure  4b , the samples using a thin interlayer indeed show a distinct peak at the same angle (4.5 and 9°) as the thicker 2D-RP perovskite interlayers. The significantly lower intensity and increased width of this XRD peak are attributed to the limited sensitivity of the XRD measurement to very thin superlattices of the 2D-RP perovskites formed on top of the bulk double-cation perovskite. Since the above reported XRD signal of layered 2D-RP perovskites originates from diffraction at superlattices of stacked 2D perovskite layers, these peaks are expected to be weak and broad as the number of stacked 2D perovskite layers is small for interlayers prepared from low-concentration BABr solution (2 mg mL -1 ). In addition to the previous material analyses, it should be noted that there are also further clear indications that the interlayers consist of the 2D-RP perovskite independent on the concentration Adv. Energy Mater. 2019, 9, 1803699  
 (5 of 10) of the BABr solution. For example, a characteristic reflectance maxi mum at ≈500 nm is observed for all samples with 2D-RP interlayer (see Figure  S11 , Supporting Information). This maximum in reflectance is not apparent for the double-cation reference. Top-view SEM images and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images further confirm the substantially modified surface. With increasing the concentration of BABr solution (>2 mg mL -1 ), the surface morphology alters and reveals a disordered appearance which is very different from the characteristic features of the 3D perovskite layer. For the high BABr concentrations of 5 and 7.5 mg mL -1 , flake like features appear as reported for other 2D-RP perovskite layers without obvious changes to the bulk 3D double perovskite layer (see Figures  S4  and S12 , Supporting Information).  [31, 41]  In order to complement the XRD analyses of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure prepared from the low-concentration BABr solution (2 mg mL -1 ) with surface-sensitive characterization techniques, X-ray and UV photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS and UPS) experiments were performed. The XPS survey spectrum (see Figure  S13 , Supporting Information) of the 3D double-cation perovskite reference (Cs 0.17 FA 0.83 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 ) shows emission lines of all expected elements (cesium, nitrogen, carbon, lead, iodine, and bromine). Compared to the 3D perovskite, the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure prepared from the low-concentration BABr (2 mg mL -1 ) exhibits an intensity decrease of the I, Pb, and Cs signals, an intensity increase of the Br lines, and significant changes in the spectral shapes of the C 1s and N 1s signals. To further investigate these changes, the C and N 1s, as well as the Cs 3d 5/2 , I 3d 3/2 , Pb 4f 5/2 , and Br 3d detailed spectra are presented in Figure  5  and Figure  S14  in the Supporting Information, respectively. The C 1s spectrum of the 3D reference exhibits two peaks at 284.3 and 288.0 eV. Upon addition of BABr, the spectral signature changes significantly (see Figure  5a ). The peaks indicative of the 3D double-cation perovskite decrease in intensity and a new feature between 284 and 287 eV is observed, which is attributed to the butylammonium cation on the surface of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure.  [61]  For the N 1s signal, a similar behavior is found: the peak at 400.2 eV, indicative for the 3D perovskite, decreases in intensity for the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure and an additional feature at ≈402 eV appears (see Figure  5b ). This feature is assigned to the amine group in the butylammonium cation of the 2D-RP perovskite layer.  [61]  In contrast to C 1s and N 1s, the spectral changes of the Cs 3d 5/2 , I 3d 3/2 , Pb 4f 5/2 , and Br 3d lines are less prominent (see Figure  S14 , Supporting Information). The detailed evaluation presented in the Supporting Information, reveals peak shifts between 68 meV (Cs 3d 5/2 ) and 175 meV (Br 3d) as well as a peak broadening for I 3d 3/2 , Pb 4f 5/2 , and Br 3d, indicative of a changed chemical environment for these elements. The qualitative XPS analysis thus corroborates the conclusions drawn from XRD analysis, namely, that also the 2D/3D perovskite   
 (6 of 10) heterostructure prepared from the low-concentration BABr solution (2 mg mL -1 ) exhibits a modified chemical surface environment of C, N, Pb, I, and Br, as expected for the 2D-RP perovskite. In addition to the changes in the chemical environment, the UPS measurements demonstrate that also the electronic structure at the surface of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure prepared from the low-concentration BABr (2 mg mL -1 ) differs from the 3D perovskite reference. As shown in Figure  6a , the work function decreases from 4.27 ± 0.05 to 3.94 ± 0.05 eV, i.e., by 0.33 ± 0.07 eV, as determined by a linear extrapolation of the secondary electron cutoff. Moreover, a substantial variation in the spectral shape over the whole energy range indicative for the different valence band/orbital structure of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure is observed (see Figure  6b ). To evaluate the change in valance band maximum (VBM), the corresponding energy region is magnified in Figure  6c  and the linear extrapolation of the leading edge gives 1.84 ± 0.10 eV for the VBM of the 3D perovskite, and 2.08 ± 0.10 eV for the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure.  [62]  It should be noted that the VBM of the reference is slightly larger than the bulk bandgap of 1.72 eV, which is an indication of a possible bandgap widening at the perovskite surface. Surface bandgap widening can be helpful in suppressing interface recombination and is also found in Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se) 2 -based solar cells, where a widened bandgap at the absorber surface is revealed to be a key property to achieve high efficiencies.  [63] [64] [65]  In addition, the VBM of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure shifts down by 0.24 eV as compared to the 3D perovskite reference (see Figure  6d ). This downward shift, in conjunction with the decrease of the work function and the shifts of the XPS signals of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure, suggests a downward band bending (i.e., shift of all energy levels). However, as the average XPS shift of 0.12 eV is smaller than the VBM shift, the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure might feature a further bandgap widening at the 2D/3D surface as also confirmed by further PL measurements (see Figure  S15 , Supporting Information). Such a bandgap widening due to the BABr treatment and, in particular, the additional downward band bending at the surface along with an unchanged bandgap of the bulk 3D perovskite (see Figure  S2 , Supporting Information) are expected to be beneficial for the operation of the solar cells with 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure as they can reduce interface recombination. Reduced interface recombination will, in turn, lead to an increase in V OC , which is also observed in the devices shown in Figures  1  and 2 . This strongly suggests that the band alignment in the wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells presented in this work is improved by the addition of BABr. Having demonstrated that the performance enhancement is due to the existence of a 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure based on the formation of a 2D-RP perovskite interlayer before the HTL, the photophysics of the material is now investigated to determine the causes for the performance increase, in particular Adv. Energy Mater. 2019, 9, 1803699   
 (7 of 10) the enhancement in V OC . Recent literature has established that the V OC is highly sensitive to interfacial recombination at the spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite interface (which in turn is sensitive to the concentration of dopants and additives in spiro-OMeTAD), and to the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH)-type nonradiative recombination in the bulk.  [66, 67]  In a first step, the ideality factor (n id ) of the perovskite solar cells with and without 2D-RP perovskite interlayer is examined by light intensity-dependent V OC measurements, in accordance with established procedures.  [67]  For the reference solar cells without 2D-RP perovskite interlayer, the n id is found to be ≈1. 35 (Figure  S15  and Table  S3 , Supporting Information), representing a low dependence of V OC on the light intensity in the reference device (≈78 mV dec  -1  ). An n id in the range of 1 and 2 indicates that at least two (likely three) dominant recombination mechanisms with n id = 1 and n id = 2 coexist. Among the recombination mechanisms leading to n id = 1, radiative recombination as well as surface recombination are prominent candidates.  [67]  The recombination mechanism that leads to an n id = 2 in perovskite solar cells is typically assigned to bulk SRH recombination.  [66]  The n id decreases to 1.18 for the solar cells using a thin 2D-RP perovskite interlayer prepared by the low concentration BABr solution (2 mg mL -1 ). Given that the solar cell parameters are broadly comparable for both the samples, the decrease in n id indicates that the recombination mechanism that leads to n id = 2 (bulk SRH) is mitigated by the thin 2D-RP perovskite interlayer, which again is consistent with the enhanced V OC in these devices (see Figure  2 ) and the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) discussed below. In order to understand the extent to which the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure can help to reduce nonradiative recombination and enhance the lifetime of the charge carriers in the device, both steady-state and transient PL spectroscopy were performed. For these measurements, the samples were prepared on glass substrates to avoid lifetime quenching due to electron extraction. In Figure  7a , the PL spectra from films of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures that were processed by the deposition of different concentrations of BABr are compared with a reference 3D double-cation perovskite layer. In all cases, the PL intensity is increased by the 2D layer, the peak position of the PL is shifted to higher energy (from 1.70 to 1.72 eV), and the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) is narrowed (from 0.128 to 0.115 eV). This is consistent with a reduction of nonradiative recombination, and also fewer tail states below the absorption edge. In addition to the PL from the low-bandgap material, Figure  7b  confirms that higher energy PL peaks centered around 2.3 eV (540 nm) are observed for the 2D-RP perovskite interlayer prepared from high-concentrated BABr solutions (5 and 7.5 mg mL -1 ) for an excitation with 3.1 eV (400 nm) photons. The PL spectra feature two emission maxima (2.2 and 2.4 eV). This points toward a more complex scenario such as: i) two intermediate phases; ii) the appearance of exciton states; or iii) reabsorption Adv. Energy Mater. 2019, 9, 1803699 Figure  7 . PL spectroscopy. a) PL spectra (excitation wavelength 480 nm) of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures processed by the deposition of different concentrations of BABr (2, 5, and 7.5 mg mL -1 ) on top of the 3D double-cation perovskite. b) Higher energy PL peaks centered around 2.3 eV (540 nm) observed for the 2D-RP perovskite interlayer prepared from high-concentrated BABr solutions (5 and 7.5 mg mL -1 ) for an excitation with 3.1 eV (400 nm). c) TRPL measurements were conducted to compare the lifetimes of the double-cation perovskite reference layer to double-cation perovskite layers with 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures. d) TRPL measurements of the same samples as in (c), but with a spiro-OMeTAD HTL, to examine hole extraction through the 2D-RP perovskite interlayers. 
 (8 of 10) of emitted light.  [68]  Irrespective, these high-energy PL peaks correspond roughly to the bandgap of the 2D-RP perovskite and are absent in the reference sample, and also not apparent in the sample prepared from low concentration BABr solution (2 mg mL -1 ) due to the low thickness of these layers as discussed above. This observation of the additional high-energy PL peaks emerging further confirms the XRD and XPS/UPS results presented previously, which suggest the growth of a 2D-RP perovskite on top of the underlying 3D perovskite, and also with observations of higher-energy luminescence from 2D-RP perovskite structures on top of a 3D perovskites reported in the literature.  [45, 47]  It should also be noted that the PL emission related to the 2D-RP perovskite on top of the underlying 3D perovskite is only apparent for PL measurements excited from the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure side (see Figure  S16 , Supporting Information), which shows that the 2D-RP perovskite is not mixed into the entire 3D perovskite, but is concentrated at the HTL contact. Following this, TRPL measurements were performed in order to ascertain how the deposition of the 2D interlayer before the spiro-OMeTAD layer affects the process of hole extraction. Figure  7c  compares the lifetimes of the doublecation perovskite reference layer to double-cation perovskite layers with 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures. In particular, for the interlayers with the best device performance (2 mg mL -1 ), the enhancement in lifetime is very strong. This indicates that the deposition of the 2D-RP perovskite passivates the 3D double-cation perovskite layer and reduces the nonradiative recombination, but that the 2D-RP perovskite interlayer does not extract a large portion of holes from the 3D layer (which would quench the PL signal). Furthermore, Figure  7d  presents the TRPL series for samples with spiro-OMeTAD layer, to examine the hole extraction through the 2D-RP perovskite interlayers. The TRPL lifetime is substantially reduced upon the addition of the HTL for the reference and for the thin 2D-RP perovskite interlayer sample (2 mg mL -1 BABr solution), whereas for the samples with thicker 2D-RP perovskite interlayers (5 and 7.5 mg mL -1 BABr solution), the lifetime remains similar to the samples without the spiro-OMeTAD. These results demonstrate that hole extraction into the spiro-OMeTAD layer can occur for the thin 2D-RP interlayer, but is significantly hindered by thicker layers. This is consistent with the 2D-RP perovskite interlayer introducing a series resistance to the cells, which has the effect of significantly reducing FF at higher thicknesses, as observed in the device data (see Figure  3c  and Table  S2 , Supporting Information). However, by passivating the double-cation perovskite absorber layer, and improving the known-to-be-problematic perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface, the thin 2D-RP perovskite interlayer can improve all aspects of photovoltaic performance, most drastically the V oc . In summary, this work reports on a novel hybrid 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure that provides passivation while maintaining fast carrier extraction at the hole-extracting side of wide-bandgap hybrid organic-inorganic mixed-halide perovskite solar cells. By coating BABr on the double-cation perovskite absorber layer, a 2D-RP perovskite interlayer of intermediate phase (n = 2) is formed in between the absorber layer and the HTL. Given the limited conductivity of disordered 2D-RP perovskite layers, only very thin interlayers provide the passivation of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure while being compatible with a fast hole extraction. The resulting device performance and high open-circuit voltage, reach an unprecedented 19.4% in PCE for wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells (≈1.72 eV) along with a V OC of up to 1.31 V. This corresponds to the highest observed ratio of V OC over the maximum possible V OC based on the S-Q limit, as well as the highest ratio qV OC /E G (of 0.76) reported for a WBP solar cell. These results inspire a pathway to further raise the V OC for perovskite absorber materials of other bandgaps by engineering the HTL interface. This will become particularly important for the next-generation high-efficiency perovskite-based tandem PV, addressing PCEs above 30% in the near future. 
 Experimental Section Device Fabrication: The devices were fabricated in planar device architecture: glass/ITO/SnO 2 /Cs 0.17 FA 0.83 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 /spiro-OMeTAD/ Au. The glass substrates with 120 nm thick ITO coating (sheet resistance 15 Ω □ -2 , Luminescence Technology, CAS: 50926-11-9) were cleaned in 10 min ultrasonic bath with deionized (DI) water, acetone, and isopropanol followed by 3 min of oxygen plasma treatment. A thin (≈30 nm) SnO 2 ETL was deposited on the ITO substrate by spin coating (4000 rpm for 30 s), followed by an annealing step at 250 °C for 30 min and oxygen plasma treatment for 1 min. The SnO 2 precursor solution was prepared by diluting a 15 wt% aqueous colloidal dispersion of SnO 2 nanoparticles (Alfa Aesar) in DI water to a concentration of 2.04 wt%. The precursor solution of the Cs 0.17 FA 0.83 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 perovskite absorber layer was prepared by dissolving 0.83 mmol formamidinium iodide (Dyesol, CAS: 879643-71-7), 0.17 mmol CsI (Alfa Aesar, CAS: 7789-17-5), 0.4 mmol PbI 2 (Alfa Aesar, CAS: 10101-63-0), and 0.6 mmol PbBr 2 (Alfa Aesar, CAS: 10031-22-8) in a 1 mL solvent mixture of N,Ndimethylformamide (CAS: 68-12-2):dimethylsulfoxide (CAS: 67-68-5) 4:1 (v:v). The double-cation perovskite absorber layer was deposited from solution by a two-step spin coating process: i) 1000 rpm for 10 s, ii) 5000 rpm for 30 s. Chlorobenzene (100 µL) was poured on the spinning substrate 10 s before the end of the second step. The samples were annealed at 100 °C for 30 min in inert atmosphere. The interlayers were processed by spin coating (5000 rpm for 30 s) 100 µL of BABr (Dyesol, CAS: 15567-09-6) dissolved in isopropanol (Sigma-Aldrich, CAS: 67-63-0) (concentration of 2, 5, and 7.5 mg mL -1 ) on top of the perovskite absorber layer and a subsequent annealing at 100 °C for 5 min in inert atmosphere. As an HTL, spiro-OMeTAD was deposited by spin coating (4000 rpm for 30 s). The corresponding precursor solution contained 80 mg spiro-OMeTAD (Luminescence Technology) dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene with the additives 17.5 µL lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (520 mg mL -1 in acetonitrile) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (28.5 µL). The samples coated with spiro-OMeTAD were exposed to dry air for ≈12 h before a 60 nm thick Au electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation through shadow masks to define the active area to 0.105 cm  2  . Device Characterization: Current-Density-Voltage (J-V) Measurements: The J-V characteristics were measured with a Newport solar simulator (Oriel Sol3A) providing an AM 1.5G solar irradiation spectrum in both forward and backward direction. The solar simulator was calibrated with a certified Si photodiode (Fraunhofer ISE) equipped with a KG5 band pass filter. The stable PCE of the perovskite solar cells was determined by the power output at constant voltage close to the maximum power point under continuous AM 1.5G illumination under continuous AM 1.5G illumination. The temperature of the devices (25 °C) was actively controlled by a Peltier element connected to a microcontroller while conducting the J-V analyses and MPP tracking.

 (9 of 10) taken with a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss LEO1530) with an in-lens detector and an aperture size of 20 µm. UV/Vis Spectrophotometry: The absorbtance, transmitance, reflectance, and EQE spectra of the perovskite layers and devices were measured with a Bentham PVE300 Photovoltaic Device Characterization System by illuminating the solar cell with modulated monochromatic light. A chopper frequency in the range of 400 Hz was used. XRD: The crystal structure of perovskite layers with different treatment concentrations were examined by XRD (D2Phaser from Bruker) with Cu K α radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å) in Bragg-Brentano configuration using a LynxEye detector. The XRD data were taken from unfinished devices on the same layer sequence as the perovskite solar cell, but excluding the Au electrode and the spiro-OMeTAD HTL. High-resolution XRD was performed by a Bruker D8 DISCOVER system with Cu-K α radiation in Bragg-Brentano configuration. Steady-State and TRPL) Spectroscopy: Transient PL measurements were performed using a streak camera system (Hamamatsu Universal Streak Camera C10910) coupled to a spectrometer (Acton SpectraPro SP2300). The streak camera was used in single sweep mode to allow for a 1000 ns time window and an FWHM of the instrumental response function of 20 ns. For the excitation, a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser (Coherent, Chameleon Ultra) with a pulse width of 140 fs and a repetition rate of 80 MHz was used. The 960 nm output was frequency doubled by a second harmonic generator (Coherent, Chameleon Compact OPO-Vis) and the repetition rate was reduced to 0.7 MHz using a pulse picker (APE pulseSelect). All transient PL spectra were measured with a pump fluence of 46 nJ cm -2 . The steady-state PL spectra were either measured with a spectrofluorometer (Varian Cary Eclipse) using an excitation wavelength of 480 nm or a fiber-coupled UV/vis spectrometer (Avantes, AvaSpec-2048L) and excitation at 400 nm by the previously described mode-locked laser. XPS and UPS: For XPS and UPS, the samples were sealed under Ar gas and introduced into the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system via an Ar-filled glovebox without air exposure.  [69]  The UHV experimental system in the Materials For Energy (MFE) lab at KIT was equipped with an Omicron Argus CU electron analyzer, a DAR 450 twin anode (Mg K α and Al K α ) X-ray source, and a He gas discharge lamp. The energy scale for XPS was calibrated according to Moulder et al. and for UPS by measuring the energy position of a sputter-cleaned Au foil.  [70]  During all UPS measurements, a bias of -15 V was applied to the sample. In order to avoid beam-induced changes due to X-rays or UV radiation, prior to the reported measurements extensive time-resolved measurements were performed to characterize beam damage. Based on this study, measurement times of 3 min (or less) for UPS and 10 min (or less) for XPS were determined suitable to avoid an influence of beam-induced changes on the spectra. Table  S1 .

The data confirms the gradual change of the surface of the 3D perovskite layer. It is hypothesized that 2D flakes appear on the 3D perovskite layer for the samples treated with higher concentrations of BABr (5 and 7.5mg/mL). The data o fthe height sensor (a), (d), (g), and (j) contains the information on the surface topography of the samples. Amplitude error (b), (e), (h), and (k) is shown for a better illustration of the contrast. The phase images (c), (f), (i), and (l) represent the phase changing while the sensor is scanning the surface morphology. We observe peak shifts between 68 meV (Cs 3d 5/2 ) and 175 meV (Br 3d), which we attribute to changes in band bending. The difference spectra in the lower panel highlight the changes in the chemical environment caused by the addition of BABr. For the Cs 3d 5/2 , the difference shows only noise, which suggests that the chemical environment of Cs is not altered by the addition of BABr. In contrast, the I 3d 3/2 , Pb 4f 5/2 , and Br 3d difference spectra reveal additional spectral weight, and their full-width-at-half-maxima (FWHM) increase. Both findings indicate that some of the Pb, I and Br atoms are present in a modified chemical environment at the surface of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure, compared to the 3D perovskite reference. Note that the additional spectral weight seen in the difference spectra is not a quantitative measure of the number of ""modified"" atoms. (c)

In this study, we calculated the doping formation energy to investigate the formation energy to dope the α-phase perovskite structure with additive. In this calculation, we considered one formation step of α-phase perovskite structure with cationic chloride additive; α-phase perovskite structure incorporated cationic chloride additive before annealing process (pre-annealing step). In the pre-annealing step of α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure, the doping formation energy of cationic chloride additive into the perovskite structure (ΔEd) was calculated by using the following equation (s2), d cation Cl doping non-doping A out A in C out C in ( ) ( ) E E E n m      = - + - + - (s2) where Ecation Cl doping is the total energy of perovskite system incorporated cationic chloride.

In order to investigate the effect of the concentration of cationic chloride additive on the crystallinity of the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure, we have theoretically tested the α-phase perovskite structure, which described the system before (pre-annealing) and after (post-annealing) a thermal annealing, based on the model systems of Figure  s16 . Through these systems, we calculated the formation energy (see Figure  s13 ) and the doping formation energy (see Figure  s18 ). Note that in the preannealing step, the α-phase perovskite is doped with cationic chloride as an additive, and in the postannealing step, the α-phase perovskite is doped with I, which occupies the Cl site through anionic exchange. In Figure  s19 , the doped model systems are described, which are at their most stable states, over the concentration range of 11 % to 44 %. 
 FACl We found that the formation energy decreased as the MACl concentration increased at the preannealing step (Figure  s19 (a)), implying that the performance of materials increased from their increased structural stabilities. But, one can readily expect that there exists a limit of the additive concentration effect to increase the performance since the doping formation energy increases (Figure  s19(a) ). Thus, we examined the formation energy at the post-annealing step, where I was substituted with Cl through the annealing process (Figure  s19(b) ). And, we found that the formation energy was stabilized between 33 % and 44 %, which corresponded to the best performance shown in the experiment (i.e., 40 %).  
 INTRODUCTION Within a short period of time, organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites have demonstrated powerful applications in solar cells as a result of high-power conversion efficiencies now exceeding 23%, 1 unprecedented in the field of photovoltaics. The high-efficiency outputs of perovskite solar cells are attributed to their exceptional material properties, 2-4 which include high optical absorption cross-sections, 5 low exciton binding energies,  6  long-range charge carrier diffusion lengths,  3, 7, 8  and easy tuning of the band gaps 8-10 via simple interchanges of the precursor components. Among the perovskite materials, formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 )-based perovskite materials are also widely used because the band gap, 1.48 eV, is closer to the optimum value of a single-junction solar cell  [11] [12] [13]  and displays a broader light absorption spectrum that extends to 840 nm, although stability can be an issue in these cells. In general, FAPbI 3 has two crystal structures: a non-perovskite yellow d-phase and a 3D perovskite black a-phase. Only the a-phase perovskite is a useful photoactive phase.  12, 14  Black a-phase perovskite readily transforms to the yellow d-phase non-perovskite because of the large size of the FA cation.  15  Studies have shown that substituting some FA + species with MA + or Cs + can inhibit this phase transformation.  12   
 Context & Scale Numerous effective methods have been developed toward achieving high-performance perovskite solar cells. The additives are one of the most effective ways of achieving high performance. Clbased additives are among the most prevalent in literature; however, their exact role is still uncertain. Herein, we systematically researched the effects of methylammonium chloride (MACl) additive using analysis of photo-physical properties and density functional theory. The highest efficiency achieved was 24.02%, certified as 23.48%, and the resultant devices showed better thermal stabilities and photostabilities than the pristine devices. The important factors for achieving high-performance perovskite solar cells include controlling the well-defined morphologies and maintaining the high crystallization of the perovskite film.  16, 17  These features can be controlled through the choice of perovskite precursor,  18  fabrication method,  19  solvent mixing,  17  annealing conditions,  20, 21  manufacturing humidity conditions,  22  surface passivation,  23  and processing additives.  24  Recently, the incorporation of additives into the perovskite precursor solution was widely studied to provide an effective approach to improving the film morphology and crystallinity. Several additives, including polymers,  [25] [26] [27]  fullerene derivatives,  [28] [29] [30]  organic halide salts,  [31] [32] [33] [34] [35]  metal halide salts,  [36] [37] [38] [39]  inorganic acid,  [40] [41] [42] [43]  and others  [44] [45] [46]  can be used to create a uniform perovskite layer with a high crystallinity and improve the device performance. Among these, additives containing iodide ions, such as cesium iodide (CsI),  [47] [48] [49] [50]  rubidium iodide (RbI),  [51] [52] [53]  guanidinium iodide (GuI),  [54] [55] [56]  methylammonium iodide (MAI),  57  and other iodide  [58] [59] [60] [61]  have driven the high-performance efficiencies. Just 5% or 10% CsI addition to perovskite mixtures suppressed non-perovskite yellow phase impurities and induced the formation of uniformly large perovskite grains that extended the electron-to-hole collecting layer, consistent with seed-assisted crystal growth.  50  Recently, alkali iodide (LiI, NaI, and KI) was used for defect engineering and perovskite doping to reduce hysteresis and increase efficiencies using small doping concentrations of 10 mmol.  62  Apart from the cationic iodide additives, chloride-based additives have been studied recently, although few studies have compared the chlorides with the iodides. Wang et al. explored the additions of FACl and MACl in equal molar amounts to the FAPbI 3 precursor solution, demonstrating that they were good additives for increasing the crystallization of a-FAPbI 3 via the formation of intermediate mixtures, which suppressed crystallization of the d-phase FAPbI 3 .  63  A new perovskite growth method was presented using MACl to assist the vertical recrystallization in an FA perovskite film and provide an efficiency of 20.6%.  64  Mu et al. showed that MACl was a transitional ''stabilizer'' that preserved the crystal structure and formed the black FA perovskite.  65  Qing et al. also showed that the synergistic effects of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and MACl additives, which assisted crystallization of the perovskites, lead to a single-crystal-like film with a smooth surface and a low defect density, thereby providing a high-efficiency perovskite solar cell.  66  However, the efficiencies of the perovskite solar cells prepared with cationic chloride additives were lower than those prepared using cationic iodide additives. Furthermore, it is not yet clear why MACl additives would be better than others. This effect requires further investigation of the role and theoretical calculation. In this work, we systematically studied the role of MACl additive in FAPbI 3 -based perovskite solar cells. The grain size in films prepared using various contents was dramatically greater, by a factor of 6, compared to the film prepared without additive. Interestingly, MACl effectively stabilizes an intermediate to the pure FAPbI 3 a-phase without annealing-only through cationic site substitution. From the fabricating high crystallinity of ultra-pure a-phase FAPbI 3 -based perovskite, the photoluminescence lifetimes also increased by a factor of 4.3. Using density functional theory (DFT), we provide a theoretical framework for understanding the interaction of MACl with a perovskite active layer. The formation energy of the resulting perovskite structure is related to the amount of incorporated MACl. Consequently, MACl additive induces intermediate phase stabilization for over 24% efficiency. The highest efficiency achieved was 24.02%, which was obtained with the addition of 40 mol% MACl. These results suggest that the MACl additive is a promising material for high-quality film formation and high-performance device that offers great opportunities for the practical applications. 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The surface morphologies of the different film compositions were evaluated by collecting top-view images using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The interesting results were that the grain sizes of perovskite films are directly related to the amount of incorporated MACl. Figure  1A  shows the photographs of the film surfaces manufactured using the MACl introduced in concentrations of 10 mol%, 20 mol%, 30 mol%, 40 mol%, and 50 mol% (denoted MA-10, MA-20, MA-30, MA-40, and MA-50, respectively). The grain size obtained without the additive (pristine) was approximately 250 nm (average). However, the MA-10 produced a film with a larger grain size of 600 nm (see Figure  1B ). The grain size obtained from the MA-20 was 1,000 nm, and the grain size further increased to 1,500 nm for the MA-40 (see Figures  1C-1F ). The grain size distributions obtained with different additions of MACl contents is shown in Figure  1G . Atomic force microscopy (AFM) phase images (Figure  S1 ) also showed that the grain sizes were increased as a function of the additive amounts. The film roughness was measured by calculating the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness as listed in Table  S1 . The pristine film consisted of small crystals with an RMS roughness of 64.7 nm. The roughness decreased to 45.8 nm, 41.0 nm, 33.6 nm, and 24.7 nm with MA-10, MA-20, MA-30, and MA-40, respectively. These results indicated that the film roughness was reduced when the MACl contents were increased. To check the substitution of the cationic site with MA ion and anionic site with Cl ion, the perovskite films were characterized elementally using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Figure  S2 . The intensity of nitrogen (N) peak decreased with the MACl contents, indicating that the MA ion was substituted for FA in the cationic site because the MA ion included one N atom and the FA ion included two N atoms. Therefore, if the FA ion had been substituted by MA ions, the intensity of N would decrease as the MACl addition increased. In contrast with the N ion, the Cl ion was not substituted into the anionic sites. Some studies have shown that the addition of Cl ions to a perovskite does not facilitate the formation of a continuous perovskite phase because Cl ions readily evaporate away during the annealing process.  63, 65  To evaluate the Cl ion content, XPS measurements of the Cl ions were conducted as a function of the MACl contents from MA-10, MA-30, and MA-50. As shown in Figure  S2B , the signal corresponding to the Cl ion content in the film was not detected in all samples. These results indicated that the Cl ion had evaporated during annealing. MACl easily decomposed into MA ion and FACl, which was easily removed from the film through evaporation with annealing.  65  To support this result, the Cl ion was monitored using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis to observe any changes in the Cl ion concentration during annealing. The results shown in Figure  S3  reveal a large initial amount of Cl present compared to the amount of Pb (Cl/Pb atomic ratio) present in a perovskite film not subjected to annealing. After annealing at 150 C for 5 min, the Cl ion content was reduced to a 0.12 Cl/Pb atomic ratio, and no EDS-detectable Cl ion was observed in the perovskite film after annealing at 150 C for 10 min. These results agree with the XPS analysis. The intensities of the Pb and I ion signals did not change, indicating that the halide mixture composition did not change. Another interesting result is that the crystallinity can be changed with different concentrations of MACl. Figure  2A  shows the diffractograms obtained from pristine, MA-10, MA-20, MA-30, MA-40, and MA-50, respectively. The pristine perovskite film (prepared without additive) showed peaks at 12.7 and 13.9 , corresponding to the PbI 2 and a-phase perovskite peaks. The small PbI 2 peak intensity indicated that the film was not fully converted into a pure a-phase perovskite film during annealing at 150 C for 10 min. The crystallinity with addition of MACl, in MA-10, MA-20, and MA-30, slightly increased the a-phase peak at 13.9 , and the PbI 2 peak at 12.7 disappeared. The a-phase perovskite peak further increased at MA-40. However, the intensity of a-phase peak is slightly decreased at MA-50. The film crystallinities obtained from different MACl contents were compared by plotting the reciprocal full width at half maximum (FWHM) from the XRD spectra as shown in Figure  2B . The FWMH values were compared under the best conditions for each additive: pristine, MA-10, MA-20, MA-30, MA-40, and MA-50. The narrower diffraction peaks were observed in the films prepared with additive as compared to the pristine film. The highest value was obtained from MA-40, which indicated that large crystallites could be obtained. These results agreed with the grain size results, as shown in Figure  1 . The very interesting result is that MACl successfully induces an intermediate to the pure FAPbI 3 a-phase without annealing, effectively stabilizing this structure. The pristine film, for example, prepared without additives and without annealing, displayed numerous unknown diffraction peaks, as shown in Fig-  ure 2C . After annealing at 150 C for 10 min, the peak corresponding to the a-phase perovskite was dominant, but some d-phase and PbI 2 were still present, indicating that it was not easy to obtain only ultra-pure a-phase perovskite film from a pristine perovskite precursor solution. However, the perovskite film, obtained using MA-40, featured only a pure a-phase perovskite peak (no detectable d-phase and PbI 2 ) even without annealing (Figure  2D ). After annealing at 150 C for 10 min, the peak corresponding to the a-phase perovskite was sharply increased with only ultra-pure structure. These results indicate that the MACl additive can influence the formation of a-phase structure even before the annealing step and that the stabilized imtermediate can be induced into the ultra-pure a-phase perovskite after the annealing step. To see the intermediate phase of FAPbI 3 perovskite with MACl addition more clearly, we measured the XRD of FAPbI 3 perovskite included with MA-40 according to the annealing time (Figure  S4 ) and magnified the peak position around 14 (Figure  S5 ). As expected, the peak position was slightly shifted to a smaller degree as the annealing time was increased, which indicated that the Cl ion was substituted by I ion during the annealing process (Figures  S2  and S3 ). The photophysical measurements were conducted from the perovskite films prepared with different additive contents. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay profiles were obtained from the perovskite films. The PL decay curves, measured at the peak emission (800 nm), showed bi-exponential decays with a fast (t 1 ) and a slow (t 2 ) component. The t 1 decay component corresponded to non-radiative recombination from defects (surface traps near the grain boundaries), and the t 2 component corresponded to radiative recombination from the bulk perovskite.  57  Figure  2E  plots the PL decay curves obtained from the different concentrations of the MACl addition. The pristine film provided t 1 (331 ns) and t 2 (68.7 ns), but the highest values were obtained at MA-40: 1,441 ns (t 1 ) and 450 ns (t 2 ), as shown in Table  S2 . The higher decay values indicated that the deposited perovskite films possessed larger numbers of carriers after 1,000 ns, attributed to the strong suppression of non-radiative recombination. Longer components suggest improved Schottky order in the bulk perovskite as a result of additives.  57  Steady-state PL measurements were collected from the perovskite films deposited on glass. The corresponding curves for all compositions are shown in Figure  2F . The intensities of the PL peaks gradually increased with the MACl contents, and a slight blue shift was observed in the emission peak due to the MA ion substitution. As discussed above, the PL was only slightly affected if only the cations were substituted, in agreement with the smaller observed shift in the band gap.  67  The highest PL intensities were found in MA-40, indicating a high crystal quality, in agreement with the XRD results. The solar cell efficiencies with different concentrations were investigated, and the results are summarized in Figure  3A  and Table  S3 . The efficiency prepared with pristine was lower than the MA-10 and MA-20 devices. It was reasonable to assume that lower crystallinity of a-phase perovskite dominated the films prepared with MA-10 and MA-20. The performances of devices prepared with MACl-30 improved, to an efficiency of 22.52%, further increased to 24.02% (MA-40), and slightly decreased to 23.36% with further addition (MA-50). These result trends agreed with the XRD, optical adsorption, and PL measurements discussed above. Larger grain size, better crystallinity, and higher absorption intensities gave rise to better performance efficiencies. The intensity of the absorption band was highest at MA-40, and the PL lifetimes were also maximized. The reliability of the efficiency results was determined by testing the devices at an external institute, as shown in Figure  S6 . The certified efficiency of 23.48% from Newport Corp. was obtained. Figure  3B  shows the J-V curves as a function of the MACl contents. The relative distribution efficiencies of the pristine film, MA-20, and MA-40 are also shown in Figure  3C . The current densities were found to be 24.99 mA cm À2 (MA-10), 25.23 mA cm À2 (MA-20), 25.45 mA cm À2 (MA-30), 25.92 mA cm À2 (MA-40), and 25.38 mA cm À2 (MA-50), better than the current density measured from the pristine perovskite, 24.84 mA cm À2 . It may be postulated that the current densities were also affected by the perovskite crystallinity. The higher crystallinity had the higher current density, which was consistent with UV-absorption spectra as shown in Figure  S7 . The large PbI 2 peak observed in the pristine perovskite film indicated that the pristine perovskite film was not fully converted into a pure a-phase perovskite film. Apart from the current density, V oc significantly differ according to the different additives. The V oc of a pristine device was 1.027 V, but higher values were obtained with the MA-10 (1.034 V), MA-20 (1.083 V), MA-30 (1.101 V), MA-40 (1.130 V), or MA-50 (1.123 V). The V oc depends on the recombination rate in the perovskite film. The efficiencies obtained from the FACl and MAI additives were also measured by fabricating the various devices using the procedures described above, and the resulting J-V curve efficiencies are shown in Figures  S8  and S9 . The cell efficiencies obtained with FACl additive were higher than those of pristine, but the MAI additions were lower than those obtained from the cationic chloride addition at all concentrations. These results suggested that the chloride ion significantly affected the device performance. Figure  3D  showed the J-V curve of reverse and forward scan for the best and pristine devices. A pure perovskite film has a slow recombination rate. The case of MA-40 had a longer lifetime and a strong PL intensity (see Figures  2E  and 2F ) compared to pristine and other additive devices, which was a major contributor to higher V oc values. The FF also has higher value at MA-40, but the difference of FF is smaller compared to the other values (Figure  3B ). Figure  3E  shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) values and its integrated J sc of pristine and best devices. The EQE spectra show that the average EQE is well matched with each current density. Because of substituting MA ion, the EQE spectra also can be slightly shifted with shorter wavelength as shown in Figure  S10 . Figure  3F  shows the stabilized steady-state current measured at the maximum power point (at 0.98 V) over 100 min. Although inorganic-organic hybrid perovskites have displayed dramatic advances in photovoltaic applications, overcoming instabilities against light, heat, and moisture remains a challenge in the development of commercial applications. Device stability tests were conducted under room temperature (RT) and 40 C, and photo stabilities were conducted under constant AM 1.5G illumination at 25% relative humidity (RH) and without encapsulation. The stability at RT showed 90% retaining of its initial performance over 1,200 h as shown in Figure  S11A . The 40 C thermal stability test showed that the pristine device degraded to 60% of its initial performance over 300 h, but the MA-40 were more stable, retaining 90% of its initial performances (Figure  S11B ). The photostabilities of the pristine and MA-40 devices also give higher stability in conditions of continuous illumination, as shown in Figure  S11C . The improved stability against thermal and light illumination was attributed to the large grain size and high crystallinity of the perovskite films. Perovskite degradation appears to initiate at grain boundaries and surface defects upon exposure to moisture or constant light.  68  The grain size in the MA-40 film was almost 1,000 nm (average), 2.7 times the value of the pristine film (370 nm [average]; see Figure  1A ). Therefore, degradation at the grain boundary sites in large-grain films was lower than in smallgrain films. The MA-40 device was more stable than the pristine device. An additional factor supporting the improved thermal and photostability was the high film crystallinity. As shown in the XRD analysis, the film prepared with MA-40 displayed a higher crystallinity in the a-phase perovskite crystal, as shown in Figures  2A  and 2B . The higher crystallinity of the film reduced surface defects capable of reacting and degrading the material. Therefore, the MA-40 device displayed a strong stability against thermal and light illumination. The mechanism by which cationic chloride improved the physical properties and efficiencies of the perovskite films was studied by using the DFT calculations (see Experimental Procedures). In view of the factors and experimental observations, we investigated the role of MACl additive on the perovskite crystal structure from three important points of view: roles of Cl and MA and concentration effect of MACl on the a-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite structure. First, to understand the role of Cl on the perovskite crystal structure, the formation energies of the a-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite structure and that including Cl, MA, or MACl were calculated (Figure  4A ) from model systems (Figures  S12  and S13 ). The formation energies revealed that Cl stabilized the perovskite structure thermodynamically compared to the system without Cl. To better understand the role of Cl in electronic properties, the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) was calculated (Figure  4B ). It has been reported that the FA interacts weakly with the I of perovskite structure with a cubooctahedral structure favored by Pb and I in the a-phase FAPbI 3 , resulting in an unstable perovskite structure.  48  Interestingly, Cl induced p orbital localization of I (red dashed circle in the Figure  4B ), and the projected density of states (PDOS) results revealed that Cl enhanced the intensity of the p orbital of I at the HOMO state (Figures  4C  and S14 ). Accordingly, the interactions of FA and I could be enhanced by the above-mentioned effects of Cl, which contributes to improving the stability of the FAPbI 3 perovskite structure. These results can be supported by the XRD and XPS results (Figures  2D  and S2 ). Second, we investigated the effects of MA cation incorporated into the perovskite structure. Lee et al. reported that the incorporation of the Cs cation at the FA site improved the stability of the perovskite by enhancing interactions between FA and I through shrinkage of the cubo-octahedral volume.  48  Based on this observation, we also confirmed the total volume shrinkage in the MA cation-incorporated system (i.e., $0.57%) compared to the bare a-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite system (Figure  4D ). The main contribution for this volume shrinkage is attributed to the contraction of MA-included cubo-octahedral site compared to the bare system (i.e., $0.89%) (Figure  S15 ). Moreover, we predicted that the dipole effect of the MA cation was another factor of lower formation energy of the MA system (Figure  4A ) because the MA cation had a dipole moment 10 times that of the FA cation.  69  Our calculations indicated that p orbital localization of I in the MA system resulted from the dipole effect of the MA cation (blue dashed circle in Figure  4B ). The PDOS of the MA cation-incorporated system revealed that the intensity of the p orbital of I in the HOMO state was higher than the bare a-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite structure (Figure  4E ). Therefore, we conclude that the effects of the volume shrinkage and the dipole enhance the interactions between FA and I, which improved the stability of the perovskite structure. We additionally investigated the volume shrinkage of perovskite structure in terms of the MA concentration. For this investigation, the four concentration systems were constructed (Figure  S16 ). It was found that the volume shrinkage increased as the concentration of MA increased from calculation and experiment results. The degree of the volume shrinkage from both methods agreed well with each other (Figure  S17 ). Thus, we confirmed that MA induced the volume shrinkage of the perovskite structure and its concentration influenced the degree of volume shrinkage. Third, to elucidate the appropriate concentration of MACl additive for obtaining high crystallinity of a-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite structure, the concentration effect of MACl was investigated. Based on the four concentration systems in Figure  S16 , we predicted that the optimal concentration ranges for high crystallinity of perovskite solar cell could exist and be elucidated by considering formation energy (Figure  S13 ) and doping formation energy (Figure  S18 ). Our theoretical prediction was in good agreement with experimental observation. In Figure  S19 , the optimal concentration of MACl was caused by the doping formation energy of MACl into the a-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite structure in the pre-annealing step and the formation energy of the perovskite structure including MAI in the post-annealing step. Especially, the formation energy was stabilized between 33% and 44%, which corresponded to the best performance shown in the experiment (i.e., 40%). These theoretical predictions were in good agreement with experimental observations of results of the J-V curve (Figure  3B  and Table  S3 ). Overall, from the three points of DFT calculation, we can understand why MACl additive stabilized the perovskite formation and showed high performance. 
 Conclusion In summary, we investigated the MACl effects in the perovskite films, which construct the intermediate-phase into the perovskite film for the high-quality pure a-phase perovskite film. With achieved high-quality pure a-phase perovskite film, the surface morphology, crystallographic properties, optical absorption, and photoluminescence properties were enhanced, which resulted in high-performance perovskite solar cells. We achieved 24.02% perovskite solar cell performance. The mechanism of MACl's effect on the formation of a-phase perovskite structure was elucidated using DFT calculation. We believe that our new finding will help researchers to achieve high performance of perovskite solar cells. 
 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 
 Materials Formamidine acetate salt (99%), hydriodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in water), titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate), 2-propanol (anhydrous, 99.5%), chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous 99.8%,), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, > 99.5%) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Methylamine hydrochloride (MACl, 98%) was procured from Acros Organics. Fluorine-doped tin oxide on glass (FTO glass, 7 U sq -1 ) was obtained from Asahi. Ethanol (absolute, 99.9%) was procured from Changshu Yangyuan Chemicals. Diethyl ether (extra pure grade) was procured form Duksan. TiO 2 paste (SC-HT040) was procured from ShareChem. Lead iodide (PbI 2 , 99.999%) was purchased from TCI. 
 Materials Synthesis Formamidinium iodide (FAI) was synthesized as reported elsewhere.  70  Briefly, 25 g formamidine acetate was directly mixed with 50 mL hydriodic acid in a 500 mL round-bottomed flask with vigorous stirring. A light yellow powder was obtained by evaporating solvent at 80 C for 1 h in a vacuum evaporator. The resulting powders were dissolved in ethanol and precipitated using diethyl ether. This procedure was repeated 3 times until white powders were obtained, and the powders were recrystallized from ethanol and diethyl ether in a refrigerator. After recrystallization, the resulting powders were collected and dried at 60 C for 24 h. Single-crystal FAPbI 3 was fabricated as reported previously.  71, 72  Device Fabrication Asahi FTO glass (FTO glass, 7 U sq -1 ) was used as the substrate for the devices. The substrates were cleaned using the RCA-2 (H 2 O 2 -NCl-H 2 O) procedure  73  for 15 min to remove metal ion impurities. The substrates were then cleaned sequentially with acetone, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in an ultrasonic system for 15 min. To deposit the compact TiO 2 layer, 60 mL of a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)/ethanol (with 1:10 volume ratio) solution was applied by spraying. Prior to spraying, the substrates were placed on a hot plate and the temperature was increased to 450 C rapidly. After completing the spray pyrolysis step, the substrates were stored at 450 C for 1 h to improve the electrical properties,  74  then slowly cooled to room temperature. On top of the c-TiO 2 layer, a mesoporous TiO 2 (mp-TiO 2 ) layer was deposited by spin-coating. The TiO 2 paste, approximately 50 nm in diameter, was purchased from ShareChem. The paste was dispersed in ethanol/terpineol (78:22 w/w). The FTO/c-TiO 2 substrates prepared with mp-TiO 2 were heated at 500 C on a hot plate for 1 h to remove organic compounds and then slowly cooled to 200 C. To fabricate perovskite solar cells, the perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing 1,139 mg mL -1 FAPbI 3 in a mixture of DMF and DMSO in a 4:1 ratio by volume. MACl was added in the range 0$50 mol%. For each sample, 70 mL of the filtered solution was spread over the FTO/c-TiO 2 /mp-TiO 2 substrate at 6,000 rpm for 50 s with 0.1 s ramping. During spin coating, 1 mL diethyl ether was dripped after spinning for 10 s using a pipette. The film was dried on a hot plate at 150 C for 10 min. After cooling the substrate, the perovskite film was spin coated with phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) dissolved with IPA (5 mM) at 3,000 rpm. The hole transfer materials were deposited by preparing a spiro-OMe-TAD (Lumtech) in chlorobenzene (90 mg/mL) and mixing with 35.5 mL 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), 23 mL Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) (520 mg/mL acetonitrile), and 5 mL tris(2-(1h-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III)tris(bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209, Lumtech) (180 mg/mL acetonitrile). Finally, a gold counter electrode was deposited on the substrate using a thermal evaporation system. The back and front contacts were formed from 100 nm thick Au films deposited by vapor deposition at a pressure of 10 À6 torr. 
 Characterization The phases of the perovskite films prepared with different additives were analyzed using X-ray diffractometry (XRD) using a D8 Advance (Bruker) diffractometer equipped with Cu Ka radiation (l = 0.1542 nm). The morphologies of the perovskite films were assessed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi). Steady-state photoluminescence and TRPL measurements were conducted using PicoQuant FluoTime 300 (PicoQuant GmbH, Germany) equipped with a PDL 820 laser pulse driver. A pulsed laser diode (l = 375 nm, pulse FWHM < 70 ps, repetition rate 200 kHz-40 MHz) was used to excite the sample. XPS spectra were collected using a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250XI at a base pressure of 1.0 3 10 À9 torr using a monochromic Al-Ka X-ray source. The solar cells were measured using a solar simulator (McScience, K3000 Lab solar cell I-V measurement system, Class AAA) at 100 mA cm -2 , illumination AM 1.5 G. The light intensity was calibrated using a Si-reference cell certified by NREL before taking measurements. No light soaking was applied before the potential scan. The J-V curves were measured using a reverse scan (from a forward bias [1.2 V] to short circuit [0 V]) and a forward scan (from a forward bias [0 V] to short circuit [1.2 V]). The step voltage was fixed at 100 mV. The cells were masked using a metal mask in order to limit the active cell area to 0.0804 cm 2 . EQE measurements were obtained using a QEX7 system (PV Measurement). The stability test was conducted without encapsulation. The thermal stability test was performed by aging on a hot plate at RT and 40 C, respectively. The performances of the devices were periodically measured under illumination AM 1.5 G after cooling the devices to RT. The photostability test was performed under a maximum power point tracking and continuous light irradiation (AM 1.5G) at 25 C and below 30% RH. 
 Density Functional Theory Calculation All DFT calculations were performed using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) program.  75, 76  The electronic exchange correlation potential was treated using a generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) functional.  77  The interactions of the electron-ion cores were described using a norm-conserving pseudopotential.  78  The van der Waals interactions were corrected using the Tkatchenko and Scheffler (TS) method.  79  Spin polarization was considered in all calculations. The electronic wave functions were expanded using the plane wave basis set with the energy cut-off of 700 eV. The self-consistent field calculations were performed using the convergence criterion of 1 3 10 À6 eV/atom. The convergence criteria for the geometry optimization were set to 1 3 10 À5 eV/atom for the maximum energy change, 0.03 eV/A ˚for the maximum force, 0.05 GPa for the maximum stress, and 1 3 10 À3 A ˚for the maximum displacement. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a 1 3 1 3 3 k-point set with the Monkhorst-Pack scheme  80  for geometry optimization. Note that for calculation of projected density of states (PDOS), 2 3 2 3 6 k-point set was used.      Note that the formation energy (ΔEf) of the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure prepared with chloride, cation, or cationic chloride was calculated using the equation (s1),

The pristine system was taken to be reference for the calculation of the volume shrinkage percent. The lattice parameter was calculated by using the Bragg equation 2 ; 2 sin dn  = , where d is the distance between atomic layers, θ is the diffraction angle, n is the order of reflection, which is an integer (for this case, n is 1), and λ is the wavelength of the radiation (for this case, λ is 1.54056 Å (copper source)). In this study, we calculated the doping formation energy to investigate the formation energy to dope the α-phase perovskite structure with additive. In this calculation, we considered one formation step of α-phase perovskite structure with cationic chloride additive; α-phase perovskite structure incorporated cationic chloride additive before annealing process (pre-annealing step). In the pre-annealing step of α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure, the doping formation energy of cationic chloride additive into the perovskite structure (ΔEd) was calculated by using the following equation (s2),  where Ecation Cl doping is the total energy of perovskite system incorporated cationic chloride. Enon-doping is the total energy of the system that does not incorporate the cationic chloride. μA out (μC out) and μA in (μC in) are the chemical potentials of anions (cations), which are deleted from or inserted to the perovskite structure with cationic iodide and cationic chloride. n and m are the number of anions and cations, respectively. In order to investigate the effect of the concentration of cationic chloride additive on the crystallinity of the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure, we have theoretically tested the α-phase perovskite structure, which described the system before (pre-annealing) and after (post-annealing) a thermal annealing, based on the model systems of Figure  s16 . Through these systems, we calculated the formation energy (see Figure  s13 ) and the doping formation energy (see Figure  s18 ). Note that in the preannealing step, the α-phase perovskite is doped with cationic chloride as an additive, and in the postannealing step, the α-phase perovskite is doped with I, which occupies the Cl site through anionic exchange. In Figure  s19 , the doped model systems are described, which are at their most stable states, over the concentration range of 11 % to 44 %. 
 FACl We found that the formation energy decreased as the MACl concentration increased at the preannealing step (Figure  s19 (a)), implying that the performance of materials increased from their increased structural stabilities. But, one can readily expect that there exists a limit of the additive concentration effect to increase the performance since the doping formation energy increases (Figure  s19 (a)). Thus, we examined the formation energy at the post-annealing step, where I was substituted with Cl through the annealing process (Figure  s19(b) ). And, we found that the formation energy was stabilized between 33 % and 44 %, which corresponded to the best performance shown in the experiment (i.e., 40 %).  • Announce a grant/award • Elevate your company's profile Online job board product options listing your vacancy will be on Cell Career Network for 60 days and it will appear alongside Cell Press journal articles and research relevant to your job advertisement on Cell.com Add a featured job banner ad to one of our top rated journals Banners Banners New for 2018: our banners are now responsive!

Defect passivation in hybrid perovskite solar cells using quaternary ammonium halide anions and cations
Supplementary Figure  2 : SEM images for MAPbI 3 film after quaternary ammonium halides (QAHs) deposition. No obvious damage to the morphology of the film was observed.
The ionic defects at the surfaces and grain boundaries of organic-inorganic halide perovskite films are detrimental to both the e ciency and stability of perovskite solar cells. Here, we show that quaternary ammonium halides can e ectively passivate ionic defects in several di erent types of hybrid perovskite with their negative-and positive-charged components. The e cient defect passivation reduces the charge trap density and elongates the carrier recombination lifetime, which is supported by density-function-theory calculation. The defect passivation reduces the open-circuit-voltage deficit of the p-i-n-structured device to 0.39 V, and boosts the e ciency to a certified value of 20.59 ± 0.45%. Moreover, the defect healing also significantly enhances the stability of films in ambient conditions. Our findings provide an avenue for defect passivation to further improve both the e ciency and stability of solar cells. O rganic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) semiconductors embrace a unique set of intriguing optoelectronics attributes, such as strong light absorption  1  , high charge carrier mobility  2  , and long intrinsic carrier recombination lifetime  3  , achieving impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) with a relatively simple and low-cost route. The history of PCE enhancement for thin-film and polycrystalline photovoltaic cells has witnessed the importance of reducing charge-recombination loss both inside the photoactive layer and at the electrode contacts  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  . Passivation of defects at the film surface becomes critical when the charge recombination inside the OIHP layer is negligible  5, 9  . The insensitivity to point defects and easy crystallization of OHIP materials give rise to negligible charge recombination in perovskite polycrystalline thin films. However, the much shorter measured photoluminescence recombination lifetime of the polycrystalline films than the intrinsic carrier recombination lifetime from a singlecrystal interior indicates that there is still a high density of defects at the surface and grain boundaries of polycrystalline grains that are not benign electronically  [10] [11] [12] [13]  . These defects most likely originate from the low thermal stability, or low formation energy of OHIP materials containing organic components that easily evaporate from the surface during the thermal annealing process  [14] [15] [16] [17]  . These surface and grain boundary (GB) defects may not dramatically reduce device photocurrent output, because some of the trapped charges may still escape over a long time and be collected by the electrodes, as evidenced by the relatively large short circuit current (J SC ) of many non-optimized devices, while they would significantly impact the open circuit voltage (V OC ) of the devices due to their energy disorder and reduced carrier concentration, which pull down the quasi-Fermi level splitting  [18] [19] [20]  . In addition, these defects can cause other device instability issues, including ion migration and associated current hysteresis, and device degradation in ambient environment  17, 21, 22  . Our recent study of moisture-dependent perovskite grain stability clearly showed that the degradation of perovskite grains was initialized by the defective surface and GBs, while some single crystals with low surface defect density and no GBs could be stable in air for several years  23  . The ionic defects (for example, iodine or methylammonium vacancies) in the polycrystalline film have a small migration activation energy (<0.1 eV) under 1 sun illumination  [24] [25] [26]  . The defects could also initialize the permeation of moisture or oxygen into the perovskite films to accelerate the degradation of perovskite devices. Thus, it is highly desirable to electronically passivate the defects at surface and GB to boost the PCE, and to heal these defects to prolong the durability of OIHP solar cells. The ionic nature of OIHP materials imposes different requirements for defect passivation than covalent-bonding semiconductors such as silicon (Si), because the defects in OIHP materials are charged, either positively or negatively. The passivation of Si is mainly achieved by the elimination of the Si dangling bonds by formation of Si-O, Si-N or Si-H covalent bonds  [27] [28] [29]  , which is however not applicable to strong ionic OIHPs. So far, different passivation molecules have been reported to perform as electron donors or electron acceptors that can interact with the charged defects of OIHPs, and thereafter annihilate the relevant defectinduced charge traps  11, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35]  . Lewis acids, such as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), as a good electron transporting material could accept an electron from the negative-charged Pb-I antisite defects PbI 3 -or under-coordinated halide ions and thus passivate the halide-induced deep traps  11, 30, 31  . Lewis base molecules, such as thiophene or pyridine, usually perform as the electron donors, which could bind to the positively charged under-coordinated Pb 2+ ions  [32] [33] [34]  . However, most of these passivation molecules could only passivate one type of defect, either positive or negative charged defects. The passivation of charge defects in OIHP should take the charge neutrality into consideration. In this study, we report that quaternary ammonium halides (QAHs) with a structure of NR + 4 X -, where R is an alkyl or aryl group and X is halide, can efficiently passivate charged defects in OIHP with quaternary ammonium and halide ions. The QAH passivation remarkably reduces the trap density and prolongs the carrier lifetime, which universally enhances the V OC of the OIHP planar heterojunction devices with different bandgaps and consequently increases the PCE by 10%-35% compared with the devices with PCBM passivation. This strategy can also enhance the stability of OIHP devices, with almost no efficiency loss after 800 h of storage in ambient conditions. These results highlight the importance of allround passivation of charged ionic defects for improvement of the efficiency and durability of OIHP devices. 
 Photovoltaic device architecture and performance The planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells in this study were structured as poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA)/CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 /functional layer/fullerene (C 60 )/2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP)/copper (Cu), as shown in Fig.  1a . Here the active layers of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 were formed by the low-temperature two-step interdiffusion of lead iodide (PbI 2 ) and a methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) stacking layer, and then followed by a solvent annealing process  [36] [37] [38]  . In our previous studies, the fullerene derivative PCBM is used as the perovskite passivation material, which is used for the control device here. With an initial objective to enhance their moisture stability, we replaced PCBM by amphiphilic molecules with different functional groups, including L-α-phosphatidylcholine, Tween 20 and polyethyleneblock-poly(ethylene glycol) (PE-PEG) whose chemical structures are shown in Fig.  1c, d . Our parallel studies showed that converting the surface of the electron transport layer to hydrophobic could enhance the water resistance of the perovskite films and device stability in moisture  39  . The application of amphiphilic materials was designed to attach them to the perovskite layer with the hydrophilic side, and expose the hydrophobic side to air  40, 41  . Figure  2a     J-V ) characteristics of two-step-processed MAPbI 3 devices with di erent passivation layers: PCBM (blue), Tween 20 (orange), L-α-phosphatidylcholine (red) and polyethylene-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PE-PEG) (green). b, J-V curves for the two-step-processed MAPbI 3 devices passivated by PCBM (blue), L-α-phosphatidylcholine (green), choline chloride (red) and choline iodide (violet). c, The statistics of V OC distribution for devices with PCBM (blue), L-α-phosphatidylcholine (green), choline iodide (violet) and choline chloride (red).

The control device with the PCBM layer showed typical performance with a short circuit current density (J SC ) of 22.5 ± 0.39 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.04 ± 0.02 V, a fill factor (FF) of 73.0 ± 2.05%, and a PCE of 17.1 ± 1.1%. Compared with the device with PCBM layers, the performances of the MAPbI 3 devices with Tween and PE-PEG buffer layers were even worse with maximum PCE between 13.6% and 15.5%, even after we optimized the concentration of Tween and PE-PEG. This indicates that Tween and PE-PEG cannot passivate the surface defects on MAPbI 3 . In striking contrast, the devices with the L-α-phosphatidylcholine layer showed a significantly improved performance with a J SC of 22.7 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.08 V, a FF of 80.0%, and a PCE of 19.6% for the best device. The average PCE of the devices with L-α-phosphatidylcholine reached 18.7 ± 0.9%. The performance enhancement and hysteresis-free behaviour (Fig.  2a  and Supplementary Fig.  1 ) were tentatively attributed to the passivation effect of L-α-phosphatidylcholine molecules. The distinct performance led us to think about what is unique about the L-α-phosphatidylcholine molecule in passivating MAPbI 3 . In comparison with Tween and PE-PEG, L-α-phosphatidylcholine has the same long alkyl chain, while the difference is that L-α-phosphatidylcholine has a choline phosphate zwitterion structure that is a type of neutral molecule with both positive and negative electrical charges. Thus, we speculate that its zwitterion structure with the choline group passivates MAPbI 3 . To verify this, we used two other choline zwitterion molecules, also known as quaternary ammonium halides, including choline iodide and choline chloride, which have no long alkyl chain, as the interfacial layer. As shown in Fig.  2b , the V OC of the perovskite devices was significantly increased by choline iodide and choline chloride as passivation layers without sacrificing the J SC and FF of the devices, which confirmed our speculation. The devices with choline iodide and choline chloride showed higher V OC of 1.14 and 1.15 V. Consequently, the highest PCEs of the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 Figure  2c  shows the V OC distribution of the devices with different passivation layers. The average V OC values are 1.04, 1.09, 1.13 and 1.13 V for the devices with PCBM, L-α-phosphatidylcholine, choline iodide and choline chloride, respectively. The larger average V OC of the devices passivated by QAHs than by L-α-phosphatidylcholine indicates that there is an additional passivation effect from the halide ions, because both of them have the quaternary ammonium component. Supplementary Fig.  2  shows scanning electron micrographs for MAPbI 3 film after QAH deposition, which reveals no obvious damage to the morphology of the film. There are both positively charged cationic and negatively charged anionic defects in OIHPs, such as I -and MA + vacancies, respectively, while quaternary ammonium ions are expected to passivate only MA + vacancies by occupying cuboctahedral sites to compensate the MA + loss on the film surfaces, as illustrated in Fig.  1b . Loss of halide ions by the evaporation of MAI during the thermal annealing process needs to be compensated by additional halide ions. Therefore, a complete defect passivation is critical in achieving the high-efficiency device reported here. The notable better passivation effect of choline chloride than choline iodide can be explained by the stronger Pb-Cl bonding than Pb-I bonding, and a small amount of Cl addition has been broadly reported  13, 42  to enhance the charge-recombination lifetime in MAPbI 3 . On the basis of the mechanism of passivation presented here, any zwitterion molecular structure should have a good passivation effect, because they have both negative and positive electric charges. A zwitterion molecule may passivate both cationic and anion defects if the spacing of these defects happens to be the same as the size of the zwitterion molecule. However, the defects at the surface of perovskite films may have very complicated distributions and compositions. The positive and negative charge defects may distribute away from each other, and their molar ratio may not be 1:1, because the perovskite film surface does not necessarily reach thermal dynamic stable states right after annealing processing, and the surface defects may pair up with bulk defects. In this context, the QAH molecule with separated positive and negative ions has the advantage of selfadaptive selection of defects with opposite charges for passivation, which is not limited by the complicated surface defect composition or distribution. To test the passivation effect of QAH for perovskite films fabricated by different methods and with different compositions, various perovskite absorbers were fabricated by various approaches including a one-step anti-solvent method  43  and a two-step interdiffusion method  [36] [37] [38]  , and with different compositions of OIHPs whose bandgaps vary from 1.51 to 1.72 eV. The device fabrication method, composition and performance are summarized in Table  1 . For the FA 0.83 MA 0.17 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 perovskite films made by one-step anti-solvent methods, choline chloride passivation can also greatly improve the photovoltaic performance, as shown in Fig.  2d . The best PCE of 21.0 % was achieved by choline-chloridepassivated FA 0.85 MA 0.15 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 with a J SC of 23.7 mA cm -2 , V OC of 1.13-1.14 V, and FF of 78.0 % under forward and reverse scanning with negligible hysteresis, as shown in Fig.  2e . The photovoltaic parameters of the FA 0.85 MA 0.15 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 devices (20 cells) with different passivation treatments are summarized in Supplementary Fig.  4 , indicating significant V OC enhancement and excellent reproducibility for the devices with choline chloride passivation. The average PCE of the devices with choline chloride is 20.1 ± 0.42%. One of the unencapsulated devices was sent to an accredited independent photovoltaic test laboratory (Newport Corporation PV Lab, Montana, USA) for certification. The device with a photomask area of 7.16 mm 2 displayed a certified PCE of 20.59 ± 0.45% and an absence of photocurrent hysteresis (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), which represents a record PCE for p-i-n structured OIHP solar cells. The reported certified PCEs of the planar heterojunction OIHP solar cells reached 19.9% and 20.1% based on SnO 2 and chlorine-capped TiO 2 electron transport layers, respectively  44, 45  . The passivation effect on FA 0.83 MA 0.17 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 with a bandgap of 1.72 eV demonstrated significant improvement with an increased PCE of 17.2% after QAH passivation (Supplementary Fig.  5 ), which is among the highest PCEs for perovskite solar cells with a similar bandgap. The average PCE of the FA 0.83 MA 0.17 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 devices is 16.1 ± 1.1%. Two-step-processed FA x MA 1-x Pb(Br 1-x I x ) 3 perovskites with an optical bandgap of 1.51 eV were also used to test the passivation effect of the QAH. It should be noted that it is difficult to exactly determine the composition of the perovskite films processed by the two-step method, so we write the composition of FA x MA 1-x Pb(Br 1-x I x ) 3 here. The V OC increased from 1.04 to 1.12 V and the highest PCE was boosted from 18.7% to 20.2% after replacing PCBM with choline chloride, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  6 . A smallest V OC deficit of 0.39 V was achieved. The average PCEs of the FA x MA 1-x Pb(Br 1-x I x ) 3 devices with PCBM and choline chloride layers are 17.5 ± 1.2% and 19.3 ± 0.9%, respectively. Furthermore, we incorporated choline chloride into the FA 0.83 MA 0.17 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 perovskite films by blending the choline chloride in the perovskite precursor solution before depositing it on the PTAA layers. The V OC of such devices is comparable to those with only surface treatment by choline chloride (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). It should be noted that we do not expect the choline chloride blended in precursor solution would be incorporated into the perovskite lattice due to its too large molecular size, and thus the choline chloride is expected to stay at the film surface and/or grain boundaries during perovskite film formation. This result basically confirms that the surface charge traps cause the majority of the V OC losses in perovskite solar cells. Nevertheless, the capability of directly blending the choline chloride in the precursor solution for film fabrication does reduce an additional step of coating with choline chloride.  
 Mechanistic study of passivation e ect of QAHs Time-resolved photoluminescence decay measurements (Fig.  1e ) of MAPbI 3 perovskite films with different passivation layers were performed to find the origin of the improved efficiency. The timeresolved photoluminescence decay of perovskite films with different passivation layers showed a bi-exponential decay with a fast and a slow component. Previous studies of charge recombination in perovskite films suggest that the fast decay process is caused by bimolecular recombination of photo-generated free carriers, and the slow decay process is attributed mainly to trap-assisted recombination  5, 20  . Here the choline chloride passivation mainly impacted the slow decay process, agreeing with the proposed mechanism that choline chloride passivates charge traps at the film surface. For the trapassisted recombination, we deduced an increased recombination lifetime from 82.3 ns for the pristine film to 903.4 ns after choline chloride treatment. The steady-state photoluminescence spectrum (Supplementary Fig.  8 ) shows that the choline-chloride-treated OIHP film had a sixfold stronger photoluminescence intensity than the control film. To find out how passivation affects the chargerecombination process in the operating devices, transient photovoltage measurement of the MAPbI 3 perovskite device was conducted. The devices were soaked under AM 1.5 simulated illumination, and laser pulses (337 nm, 4 ns) were applied to disturb the opencircuited devices to trigger a small transient photovoltaic signal. As seen in Fig.  1f , the charge-recombination lifetime of the device with choline chloride passivation was increased to 0.56 µs in comparison with the 0.23 µs of the device with PCBM passivation. The transient photovoltage result also shows that the device with choline chloride passivation had a larger average photovoltage of 1.13 V than the devices with a PCBM layer (1.04 V), which is in accordance with the J -V measurement. For polycrystalline MAPbI 3 perovskite films, the reported trap densities are generally in the order of 10 17 -10 19 m -3 , which are much larger than that of the single crystals (10 10 m -3 ), giving much room for improvement  46  . To further analyse the passivation effect of the QAH, the trap density of states (tDOS) was measured for the devices fabricated by two-step-processed MAPbI 3 perovskite with choline chloride or PCBM passivation. We extracted the trap densities from the thermal admittance spectroscopy analysis, which is a well-established and effective technique to characterize both shallow and deep defects of thin-film and organic solar cells  11, 47  . Figure  3a  shows that the device with choline chloride layers had overall the lowest tDOS over the whole trap depth region. The device with choline chloride layers had low tDOS in the deeper trap region (0.40-0.52 eV), which was assigned to defects at the film surface  11  . In addition, the density of shallower trap states (0.35-0.40 eV), which was assigned to traps at GBs, in the choline-chloride-passivated devices was about three times smaller than in the PCBM-passivated devices. This indicates that choline chloride may also diffuse into grain boundaries to passivate them. The better passivation effect of choline chloride than PCBM verifies that both cationic and anionic defects in OIHPs need to be considered in passivation techniques. As proof of the concept, two typical surface defect sites that have been reported to generate deep charge traps in OIHPs, an anionic Pb-I antisite defect on a PbI 2 -terminated surface and a cationic Pb cluster on a MAI-terminated surface, were investigated to demonstrate the trap passivation effect of the selected molecules  14, 30  . We used a Pb-I antisite defect on a PbI 2 -terminated surface, and uncoordinated Pb clusters on MAI-terminated surface slabs that have a 2 × 2 periodicity in the xy plane, and the representative structure model can be found in Fig.  3b-e  in Supplementary Fig.  12 , the bond distances of d Pb1 -I1 and d Pb1 -I2 are 4.76 Å and 3.14 Å in the unpassivated system, and 3.54 Å and 3.39 Å in the passivated system. In the resulting binding structure of the Pb cluster after the passivation, the Pb cluster on the top of the MAI surface is bonded with Cl -and two I -of the top layer of MAI. The enhanced interaction between Pb and the surface slab resulted in an increase of the overlap between the wavefunction of the Pb cluster and the surface slab. This enhanced interaction between the Pb ion cluster and the MAI-terminated surface causes new hybridized states that bridge the trap states with conduction band edge states of the surface slabs, which prevents the trapping of charges. This enhanced interaction between Pb and the surface slab could also induce a slight shift of the band edge. For the PbI 3 antisite defects, the simulation shows that the gap states are almost eliminated after passivation, which has a better passivation effect as compared with PCBM  30  . Besides, the passivated surface also has a slightly larger bandgap than the unpassivated one. The shifts of trap states and band edges are primary due to the charge transfer between the passivation molecule and perovskite surface. The Bader charge analysis shows that the choline molecule can transfer about 0.8 electrons to the surface in the case of PbI 3 -antisite defects. When adding choline chloride in the system, the defects undergo 
 NATURE ENERGY 
 ARTICLES a migration process (Supplementary Fig.  13 ): the antisite I -moves to the top position of its neighbouring Pb  2+  and bonds with that Pb 2+ , leaving a Pb 2+ vacancy on the surface, and this Pb 2+ vacancy defect is reported to be benign  14  . Since choline chloride contains both positive and negative charges, we expect that it also interacts strongly with other charged defects. The density functional theory calculations indicate that QAHs could passivate trap states induced by both the cationic and anionic defect sites, a special feature for the passivation agents selected. It should be noted that the types of defect present at the perovskite films surface might be sensitive to the film formation process. It is not technically feasible yet to find out what types of defect are present in the perovskite films presented here. Therefore, it is not yet feasible to conclude that QAHs could passivate all types of defect at the film surface. Understanding the nature of surface defects will still be needed to ultimately understand the functions of the QAHs reported here. 
 Stability of the perovskite solar cells with QAHs The stability of OIHP devices in ambient conditions is challenged by their sensitivity to moisture and oxygen due to the hygroscopic nature of the OIHP films. Recent studies revealed that the degradation of perovskite films was generally initialized at the defect sites at the film surface and grain boundaries where the molecules have highest activity and diffusivity and are more susceptible to attack by moisture and oxygen  23, 41  . It should be noted that the defects that cause charge trapping and initialize material degradation might be different. Although surface defects such as MA + vacancies formed by the evaporation of MAI during annealing do not cause deep traps in the perovskite material or impact the device efficiency, they may initialize the film degradation. Nevertheless, QAH ions are expected to have strong interaction with such ionic defects to neutralize the charges. We thus speculate that the interaction of the perovskite films with the choline chloride layer should also enhance the stability of the perovskite films in ambient environment, because covering the defective sites on the film surface with QAH ions should inhibit the permeation of moisture and oxygen through the defects. To verify this, the stability of FA 0.83 MA 0.17 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 devices with choline chloride and L-α-phosphatidylcholine functional layers was monitored by putting the unencapsulated devices in an ambient atmosphere at room temperature and relative humidity of 50-85%, and the device performances are summarized in Fig.  4 . The devices with choline chloride layers retained almost 100% of the initial PCEs after storage in ambient conditions for over one month. Interestingly, the V OC of the devices increased during the first 5 days of storage in both types of device with choline chloride passivation. The L-α-phosphatidylcholine-modified devices showed inferior performance, 30% loss of the initial PCE after 800 h storage in ambient conditions, despite the fact that the long hydrophobic alkane tails could hinder the permeation of moisture. The difference in stability of the devices with two passivation layers highlighted the importance of healing both types of defect. Figure  4e  shows the maximum power point tracking of the devices with choline chloride. The results show that the PCE decreased from 21.1% to 18.1%, and maintained 86% of the initial PCE under 1 sun continuous illumination for 26 h. The humidity stability test for the bare OIHP films (Fig.  4f-k ) shows that the films with QAHs have a much slower degradation rate than the control films without QAHs when they were exposed to humidity of 90 ± 5% for the same time intervals of 2.5 h, and the corresponding X-ray diffraction results are shown in Supplementary Fig.  14 . The much slower reduction of the perovskite (110) plane peak and the slower appearance of the PbI 2 peak in the perovskite films with L-α-phosphatidylcholine and choline chloride treatment demonstrate the better moisture resistance capability enabled by the surface modification. This result conclusively confirmed that the healing of the defect sites by choline chloride could effectively improve the moisture stability of OIHP films. 
 Conclusion In summary, we have demonstrated that the passivation of ionic defects in OIHPs by QAHs is a general passivation approach to remarkably improve the efficiency and stability of OIHP solar cells. This strategy could lead to further increasing the PCE of perovskite solar cells by passivating both types of charged ionic defect in OIHPs. There is still room to further improve the passivation effect, as indicated by the photoluminescence lifetime of the perovskite films, which still have not reached that of the single crystals. Further understanding of the nature of the surface defects in polycrystalline OIHPs, including the defect type, defect concentration and defect distribution, will be very important to guide the design of nextgeneration passivation molecules to fully passivate all of the defects. We anticipate that the precision defect healing will be an important direction to improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells to the theoretical limit, as well as to stabilize perovskite-based materials and devices. 
 Methods Device fabrication. The MAPbI 3 films made by the two-step method were fabricated by the thermal annealing-induced interdiffusion method according to our previous publication  [36] [37] [38]  . The hole transport layer poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) with a concentration of 2 mg ml -1 dissolved in toluene was spin-coated at the speed of 6,000 r.p.m. for 35 s and then annealed at 100 • C for 10 min. PbI 2 beads (99.999% trace metals basis) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. After dissolving in N ,N -dimethylformamide (DMF) at a temperature of 100 • C, around 50 µl of hot (∼90 • C) 630 mg ml -1 PbI 2 DMF precursor solution was quickly dropped onto the substrate and spin-coated at the speed of 6,000 r.p.m. The as-fabricated PbI 2 films were dried and annealed at 90 • C for 10 min. After the PbI 2 films cooled to 70 • C, 60 µl of 63 mg ml -1 methylammonium iodide (MAI) 2-propanol (IPA) precursor solution at the temperature of 70 • C was spun on the PbI 2 films. Subsequently, the sample was annealed at 70 • C for 20 min and 100 • C for 60 min. During the thermal annealing process, around 10 µl of DMF was added to the edge of the Petri dish when the temperature reached 100 • C. Two-step-processed FA x MA 1-x Pb(Br 1-x I x ) 3 perovskites were made by a similar procedure to the MAPbI 3 films made by the two-step method. The main differences are: the concentration of PbI 2 solution used for spin-coating is 680 mg ml -1 ; the mixed halide precursor solution contains 90 wt% of FAI and 10 wt% MABr with a concentration range from 70 mg FAI/7 mg MABr to 75 mg FAI/7 mg MABr per millilitre. One-step-processed narrow-bandgap perovskite FA 0.83 MA 0.17 Pb(Br 0.17 I 0.83 ) 3 and wide-bandgap perovskite FA 0.83 MA 0.17 Pb(Br 0.4 I 0.6 ) 3 were fabricated by the solvent-and interface-engineering method as reported previously  43  . The process for making the hole transport layer PTAA film is exactly the same as the fabrication method mentioned in the two-step method. The perovskite precursor solution composed of mixed cations (lead (Pb), formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA)) and halides (I, Br) was dissolved in mixed solvent (DMF/DMSO = 4:1). To improve the wetting property of the perovskite precursor on the PTAA film, the PTAA-coated ITO substrate was pre-wetted by spinning 50 µl DMF at 4,000 r.p.m. for 8 s. Then 100 µl precursor solution was spun onto PTAA at 2,000 r.p.m. for 2 s and 4,000 r.p.m. for 20 s, and the sample was quickly washed with 130 µl toluene at 13 s of the second-step spin-coating. Subsequently, the sample was annealed at 65 • C for 10 min and 100 • C for 10 min. The passivation material solution was coated onto the perovskite substrate by spin-coating at 4,000 r.p.m. for 35 s, and annealed at 100 • C for 30 min. The PCBM, Tween and PE-PEG were dissolved in DCB, and the choline chloride and choline iodide were dissolved in IPA with a concentration of 1 mg ml -1 . The devices were finished by thermally evaporating C 60 (23 nm), BCP (8 nm) and copper (80 nm) in sequential order. Device characterization. Simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm -2 ) was produced by a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Oriel 67005, 150 W Solar Simulator) for current density-voltage (J-V ) measurements. The light intensity was calibrated by a silicon (Si) diode (Hamamatsu S1133) equipped with a Schott visible-colour glass filter (KG5 colour-filter). A Keithley 2400 Source-Meter was used for J -V measurement. The scanning rate was 0.1 V s -1 . The steady-state V OC and J SC were measured by zero bias current and zero bias voltage versus time, respectively. The steady-state PCE was measured by monitoring current with the largest power output bias voltage and recording the value of the photocurrent. 
 ARTICLES NATURE ENERGY X-ray diffraction measurements were performed with a Rigaku D/Max-B X-ray diffractometer with Bragg-Brentano parafocusing geometry, a diffracted beam monochromator, and a conventional cobalt target X-ray tube set to 40 kV and 30 mA. External quantum efficiency curves were characterized with a Newport QE measurement kit by focusing a monochromatic beam of light onto the devices. The scanning electron micrographs were taken with a Quanta 200 FEG environmental scanning electron microscope. For the transient photovoltage measurements, the device was serially connected to a digital oscilloscope (DOS-X 3104A) and the input impedance of the oscilloscope was set to 1 M to form the open-circuit conditions, respectively, for monitoring the charge density decay. The transient photovoltage was measured under 1 sun illumination. An attenuated UV laser pulse (SRS NL 100 Nitrogen Laser) was used as a small perturbation to the background illumination on the device. The laser-pulse-induced photovoltage variation ( V ) and the V OC is produced by the background illumination. The wavelength of the N 2 laser was 337 nm, the repeating frequency was about 10 Hz, and the pulse width was less than 3.5 ns. First-principles calculation. First-principles calculation was carried out in the framework of density functional theory as implemented in the VASP program. The generalized gradient approximation in the form of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof was used for the exchange-correlation function. The ion-electron interaction is treated with the projector-augmented wave method. Surface slabs were modelled as PbI 2 -terminated or MAI-terminated symmetric (001) slabs of the tetragonal structure, which has 9 layers of MAI and PbI 2 in total. About 30 Å vacuum was added on top of the slab surface to minimize the interaction between the adjacent slabs. Humidity stability test. The perovskite OIHP films were stored at room temperature in a controlled-humidity glass chamber. The relative humidity calibrated by a digital hygrometer was controlled by the speed of nitrogen gas that flowed through the water, and the nitrogen gas eventually carries the moisture into the glass chamber. The relative humidity was maintained at 90 ± 5%.

Optimal Interfacial Engineering with Different Length of Alkylammonium Halide for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells
Inorganic-organic hybrid lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received tremendous attention owing to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE),  [1] [2] [3] [4]  which exceeds that of thin film solar cells  [5]  such as CdTe and CIGS fabricated from expensive equipment. Initially, the rapid improvement in PCE was achieved by optimizing the device architecture, uniform thin film deposition process, and material composition of halide
DOI: 10.1002/aenm.201902740 perovskites. Because perovskite is fabricated as a crystalline thin film by nucleation and growth that occurs as the solvent is evaporated from the precursor solution dissolved in the solvent,  [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]  there may be many defects at the grain boundary or on the thin film surface, which can potentially limit the performance.  [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17]  Thus, subsequent efficiency improvements have been made, which mainly involve defect passivation of the interface and surface of the perovskite layer using various agents such as small molecules, polymers, and alkylammonium halide. To commercialize solar cells, it is important to ensure long-term stability as well as high efficiency. However, PSCs based on 3D perovskites have high efficiency but suffer from low stability.  [18, 19]  On the other hand, there have been many reports that 2D PSCs exhibit much better environmental sustainability than 3D PSCs.  [20] [21] [22] [23]  However, mixed perovskites comprising 3D and 2D PSCs have been actively studied, because PSCs based solely on a 2D structure have relatively low efficiency.  [2, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37]  Several groups have attempted to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs by using a 3D/2D graded structure.  [2, 28, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] 37]  The main advantages of 2D on 3D are defect passivation on the surface of the perovskite and increase in hydrophobicity by alkylammonium cations constituting the 2D layer. PSCs have sandwiched structure with an n-type electron transport layer (ETL) and hole transport layer (HTL).  [38, 39]  Perovskite used as an absorber is close to neutral, but it is usually considered as slightly P-type.  [40] [41] [42]  Silicon solar cells have a PN junction structure. The charge depletion occurring at the PN junction separates hole and electron. Carriers that move by drift have higher mobility and lifetime than those moving by diffusion. In the case of PSCs, the ETL/perovskite/HTL junction is an NIP junction because perovskite behaves as an insulator with low intrinsic carrier concentration. Nevertheless, a high electric field is biased at the ETL/perovskite junction and a low electric field is biased at the HTL/perovskite junction. In this regard, the presence of a highly dielectric 2D layer between HTL and perovskite will affect the bilateral electric field, which can improve charge transport and suppress carrier Recently, two-dimensional (2D) structure on three-dimensional (3D) perovskites (graded 2D/3D) has been reported to be effective in significantly improving both efficiency and stability. However, the electrical properties of the 2D structure as a passivation layer on the 3D perovskite thin film and resistance to the penetration of moisture may vary depending on the length of the alkyl chain. In addition, the surface defects of the 2D itself on the 3D layer may also be affected by the correlation between the 2D structure and the hole conductive material. Therefore, systematic interfacial study with the alkyl chain length of long-chained alkylammonium iodide forming a 2D structure is necessary. Herein, the 2D interfacial layers formed are compared with butylammonium iodide (BAI), octylammonium iodide (OAI), and dodecylammonium iodide (DAI) iodide on a 3D (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 perovskite thin film in terms of the PCE and humidity stability. As the length of the alkyl chain increased from BA to OA to DA, the electron-blocking ability and humidity resistance increase significantly, but the difference between OA and DA is not large. The PSC post-treated with OAI has slightly higher PCE than those treated with BAI and DAI, achieving a certified stabilized efficiency of 22.9%. 
 (2 of 8) recombination. Therefore, although defect passivation of the 3D surface depending on the alkyl type of the alkylammonium cation forming the 2D layer is expected to be similar, it is believed that there will be a change in the electric field through the change in electrical properties caused by the difference in the dipole moment. Eventually, the type of alkylammonium cation constituting the 2D layer on the 3D surface may lead to differences in humidity stability, charge separation and transport in addition to the defect passivation. In this study, power conversion efficiency (PCE) and humidity stability of the 3D perovskite [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MA PbBr 3 ) 0.05 ] post-treated with butylammonium iodide (BAI), octylammonium iodide (OAI), and dodecylammonium iodide (DAI) with alkylammonium of different chain lengths were compared. Moreover, the influence of the electrical properties of the 2D layer on the PCE of the 3D/2D bilateral structure was also compared by device simulation. As the length of the alkyl chain increased from BA to OA to DA, the difference in electron blocking and resistance to humidity increased significantly for BA and OA, but the corresponding difference in the case of DA was not large. The PSC post-treated with OAI showed slightly higher than those with BAI and DAI, achieving a certified stabilized efficiency of 22.9%. 3D perovskite thin films were deposited on a 150 nm thick nanostructured TiO 2 electrode (ns-TiO 2 ) by the solvent engineering process reported by us previously.  [39]  Post-treatment of the as-deposited perovskite layer was performed by pouring the solutions of BAI, OAI, and DAI in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) on the perovskite thin film, followed by heat treatment at 100 °C for 5 min. Figure  1a  shows the electron microscope image of the surface before and after the surface treatment. It can be seen that there is little change in the morphology of the surface even after post-treating the perovskite layer with BAI, OAI, and DAI. This suggests that the surface treatment in this study does not alter the surface morphology of the underlying perovskite or form a secondary phase with a new shape. Therefore, small amounts of BA, OA, and DA may be incorporated into the perovskite 3D structure. Figure  1b  shows the UV-vis absorbance, which demonstrates that the perovskite surface treatment does not change the optical properties of the perovskite except at the shoulder, where the absorbance increases in the region of ≈560 nm. As can be seen from the inset in Figure  1b , the absorbance of the shoulder is more clearly observed in the case of OAI or DAI than BAI. This means that the surface treatment causes the formation of 3D/2D mixture or a 3D/2D bilayer with new light absorption properties on top of or inside the perovskite layer. Organic ammonium cations with alkyl chain lengths longer than the ionic size that can be spatially coordinated with PbI 6 octahedrons, such as methylammonium (MA) or formamidinium (FA) cations, are well known to form 2D perovskite structures. In this regard, BA, OA, and DA will form a 2D perovskite structure, and it is clear that the absorption shoulders shown in the UV-vis spectra are related to this. Perovskite surface treatment with BA, OA, and DA was also studied by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), which confirmed the formation of 2D structures. In Figure  1c , the addition of BA, OA, and DA reveals a new diffraction spot in the inner circle of the GIWAXS, indicating the formation of an out-of-plane 2D structure at low angles, which appears clearer. Some of the already structured 3D perovskite can be easily converted into 2D by post-treatment of long alkylammonium, resulting in higher formation energy of the 2D structure than that of the 3D. In fact, there have been many reports that mixing a certain amount of long alkyl ammonium halides in a perovskite precursor solution easily creates a 3D/2D mixed hybrid structure.  [12] [13] [14]  Similarly, a quasi-2D structure expressed by the general formulae A′ 2 A n-1 B n X 3n+1 (〈n〉 = 1 to ∞) can also be formed.  [23, 43]  The 〈n〉 value represents the number of [BX 6 ] 4-octahedra layers stacked between two organic spacers; the thickness of the inorganic layers can be tuned by carefully adjusting the stoichiometric ratio of A′ and A organic cation in the precursor solution. In contrast, the amount of this 2D structure in the 3D/2D hybrid increases with the amount added, but adding more than the critical amount will cause the 3D perovskite to be oriented in a particular direction. In particular, it is interesting that the smallest amount that cause the 3D perovskite to be oriented depends on the type of alkylammonium added to the precursor solution. It is also known that the 2D perovskite is distributed mainly near the grain boundaries rather than being uniformly distributed in the perovskite films.  [14, 44, 45]  Figure  1d  shows the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images of perovskite post-treated with OA. The 2D structure on the surface of the perovskite shows the diffraction spots from the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) due to the crystalline phase, although the thickness of the 2D layer on 3D is thin that clear indexing is not easy. Thus, although both addition of alkylammonium halides to the precursor solution and post-treatment of the perovskite layers result in a 3D/2D mixed structure, only post-treatment results in an out-of-plane 2D structure. The presence of an out-of-plane 2D structure may be undesirable because the charge generated by the light transfers in a direction perpendicular to the perovskite film. However, it would be desirable if the 2D structure, which is chemically more stable than the 3D structure, exists parallel to the thin film to effectively block the penetration of external corrosion factors. The properties of the 2D structure present on the perovskite surface depend on the type of alkyl ammonium halide, which is expected to affect the performance and stability of the PSCs owing to the differences among BA, OA, and DA as spacers. As several studies have already reported, the post-treatment of long-alkylammonium halide on the perovskite layer reduces the charge recombination owing to the passivation effect of defects on the surface of the perovskite. In this work, we compared the passivation ability of different alkylammonium iodides by surveying the photoexcited charge dynamics using time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). Figure  2a  shows the TRPL decays of the perovskite films before and after  
 (4 of 8) post-treatment with BAI, OAI, and DAI. Typically, the TRPL curves are analyzed by fitting the decay curves of the PL transients using the two exponential functions in Equation (  1 ) and then extracting the associated lifetimes  [2, 4, 11, 30, 32, 33, 36, 46]  = + τ τ - - y A e Ae t t 1 / 2 / 1 2 (1) where τ 1 and τ 2 represent fast and slow decay time constants and are associated with radiative recombination and trap-assisted nonradiative recombination. The long lifetime reflects the high quality of the perovskite film. The lifetimes due to nonradiative recombination in pristine perovskite and perovskites posttreated with BA, OA, and DA are 0.49, 0.92, 1.08, and 1.15 µs, respectively. As expected, the steady-state PL of the posttreated samples also shows a stronger PL intensity (Figure  S1 , Supporting Information). We found in the TRPL that the post-treatment of the pure perovskite layer resulted in a significant improvement in the carrier life, especially with longer alkyl lengths of alkylammonium iodide. This is consistent with the result that post-treatment with alkyl ammonium exceeding the size of the organic cations that make up the 3D perovskite effectively passivates the defects on the 3D surface, creating a 2D structure on the surface. The fact that the post-treatment of perovskite thin films with alkyl ammonium iodide increases carrier life owing to the reduction of defects is also supported by evaluating the space charge limit current (SCLC) region in the I-V measurements. The onset voltage for the trap-filled limit (V TFL ) of SCLC is linearly proportional to the density of the trap states. As shown in Figure  S2  (Supporting Information), the post-treatment of perovskite layers by alkylammonium iodides resulted in slight decrease in V TFL , which indicated a reduction in trap concentration. Thus, posttreatment of the perovskite thin films with alkylammonium iodides is expected to improve the efficiency of the device. Figure  2b  shows the I-V characteristics of devices fabricated by depositing a perovskite thin layer on a ns-TiO 2 ETL, followed by post-treatment with BAI, OAI, and DAI, and coating of the Au metal electrodes. The device with only Au metal electrodes without post-treatment of the perovskite thin layer with alkylammonium iodide works well, as we reported earlier, but it has very low efficiency.  [38]  On the other hand, when perovskite is post-treated with alkyl ammonium iodide, the efficiency of the device is greatly increased to 10.5, 13.4, and 15.1% for BAI, OAI, and DAI, respectively. In particular, it can be seen that the efficiency of the device post-treated with DA is almost three times higher than that (5.9%) of the pristine device. Interestingly, the value of the short-circuit current density (J sc ) is almost constant and the increase in efficiency is only caused by the simultaneous increase in the opencircuit voltage (V oc ) and fill factor (FF). The almost identical J sc indicates that the post-treatment of the perovskite layers by alkyl ammonium iodide has little effect on the extraction and transfer of charges generated by light absorption of the perovskite. This result suggests that 2D perovskites with a wider bandgap than the 3D perovskite have little interference in the hole transfer. More specifically, it can be considered that the 2D structure on the 3D perovskite surface (illustrated in Figure  1 ), obtained after post-treatment of the perovskite layer by alkylammonium iodide, functions as a barrier layer for electrons without disturbing the hole transport. In this respect, the electron-blocking properties of the 2D structure are believed to be more effective with regard to increasing the bandgap of the 2D structure along the length of the alkyl ammonium group. Considering the effective defect passivation observed in the PL testing and the electron-blocking ability, the post-treatment of alkyl ammonium iodide is expected to be most effective in the case of DA, which has relatively long alkyl chains. We compared the I-V characteristics of the full devices fabricated with N2,N2′,N7,N7′-tetrakis(9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-N2,N2′,N7,N7′-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9′-spirobi[fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetraamine) (DM)  [4]  as the HTL on top of the perovskite post-treated with BA, OA, and DA. As shown in Figure  2c  (the inset table), and Figure  S3  (Supporting Information), the PCE values obtained from the average J-V curves for the BA, OA, and DA-treated perovskites reveal that although the difference between the photovoltaic characteristics of the devices is very small, the device post-treated with OAI has the highest PCE. In terms of defect passivation and electron blocking, it is expected that the efficiency of the device will be the highest in the PSC post-treated with DAI, but it is very interesting that the highest efficiency is actually observed in the device treated with OAI. Indeed, the overall PCE is the sum of all the factors affecting the efficiency. To gain a better understanding of the microscopic effect of the 2D structures formed with BAI, OAI, and DAI on the overall performance, we investigated the recombination process electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measured at a bias of 0.9 V under dark condition. To properly interpret or analyze the impedance spectrum of the PSCs, the experimental data must be fitted using a suitable equivalent circuit model based on the continuity equation. However, there is yet to be an agreement on the exact equations governing PSCs owing to their complex electronic and ionic conductivities. The Nyquist (Z′-Z″) plots in Figure  2d  show a semicircle corresponding to a parallel RC circuit against frequency. At low frequencies, the impedance of the capacitor is infinite because the complex impedance of the capacitor C follows the relation ZC = -j/wC. At high frequencies, the capacitor acts as a short circuit, and Z is zero across the origin. At medium frequencies, the RC circuit has a maximum peak point, which generally corresponds to the time constant t during charging and discharging. Therefore, the radii of the impedance semicircle relate to the internal resistance for recombination rate of the PSC.  [10, 17, 47]  As shown in Figure  2d , the semicircle radii of the PSCs post-treated with BAI and OAI are significantly larger and then decreased in DAI. The behavior is consistent with the increase of carrier lifetime observed in TRPL and the V oc of PSCs post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI. Although the highest V oc occurs in the DAI-treated PSC, the corresponding PCE is not the highest, owing to a slight decrease in FF, which is 81.8% for OAI and 81.0% for DAI. This indicates that the internal resistance for recombination rate of the devices containing a HTL is the highest in the case of OAI, which means that the interface between 2D/HTL should be taken into account depending on the type of alkylammonium. Here, note that all devices are fabricated by the same process except for the alkylammonium iodide used in the process, and the interfacial resistance in the charge transfer dynamics of the PSCs is associated with the charge recombination resistance (R rec ). Accordingly, we deduce from time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) and EIS that perovskites post-treated with longer alkylammonium chain lengths have more effective defect passivation, but the interface between the 2D structure and the HTL also affects the charge transfer dynamics. As discussed previously, DA, which has alkyl groups longer than those of OA and BA, enhances the electron-blocking effect by increasing the bandgap of the 2D structure. However, it also increases the series resistance by increasing the distance between the 2D interlayers from the comparison of the series resistance from the high-frequency region (≈1 MHz) of the Nyquist plot, although the difference in values is very small. Furthermore, this may be due to the increasing mismatch of energy levels by 2D located between the 3D perovskite and the HTM, because longer alkyl chains in the alkylammonium iodide on the 3D perovskite resulted in lower HOMO levels, as can be seen from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information). Consequently, PSCs based on perovskite layers post-treated with the alkylammonium iodides have simultaneously higher shunt and series resistances, as the chain length of the alkyl group increases in addition to passivation of the surface defects. This may be related to the wider bandgap of the 2D phase produced by the post-treatment of alkyl ammonium iodide in comparison with the 3D phase; the longer the alkyl chain, the larger is the bandgap. It can be deduced from the above that the energy level of the 2D phase produced by posttreatment with alkylammonium iodide does not significantly interfere with hole transport or block electron leakage, but it can affect the efficiency of full devices containing an HTL. In addition to the changes in the energy levels, attention was paid to the effect of the changes in the dielectric properties of the 2D phase generated over the 3D phase along the length of the alkyl group.  [48] [49] [50]  The 2D structure formed with larger alkylammonium ions will have higher dielectric properties owing to the longer alkyl chain, as longer alkyl groups have higher partial charge and related dipole moments. We simulated the carrier movement using finite element analysis to understand the effect of the dielectric properties of the 2D structure present on top of the 3D structure on the efficiency. SILVACO ATLAS  [51]  was used as the simulation software. The parameters in Table  1  were used as the input data for the simulation. In addition, the lifetime due to Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination and the doping concentration of the HTL (Spiro-OMeTAD) were adjusted by using the V oc and FF of the PSC fabricated with pristine perovskite, and then used for the simulation of PSCs post-treated with alkylammonium iodide. Figure  3a  shows the change in the recombination rate with increasing electron density at perovskite/HTL interface. The x-axis was set according to the thickness of the device. The interface between the ETL and perovskite of the studied device was close to 0.05 µm and the interface between perovskite and HTL was close to 0.4 µm. The red line representing the highest recombination rate corresponds to the negative charge density of 3 × 10 9 cm -2 at the interface. The values toward the bottom are the result of the recombination rate when the electron density is 3 × 10 11 and 3 × 10 12 cm -2 . The more the electrons donated from the 2D layer, the lower is the recombination rate. Perovskite being an insulator, the charge carriers can move out of the constraint of an atom when they receive energy from the outside. Carriers excited by the absorption of light travel by the mechanism of diffusion or drift. At the band-bending ETL/ perovskite interface, electrons move rapidly due to differences in the energy levels as well as diffusion and drift (in addition to diffusion and drift, band bending causes the movement of electrons to move quickly at the ETL/perovskite interface). In a real device, the effect of drift will decrease as the carrier moves away from the ETL/perovskite junction, whereas the diffusion caused by the carrier density difference will increase. In particular, as the dielectric constant of the 2D structure on the 3D structure is increased, the electron density increases, and the diffusion in the ETL direction is more active. At the red line (Figure  3a ), most of the electrons in the HTL interface will recombine without spreading fast enough.  [57]  On the other hand, the recombination rate at the interface decreases when sufficient electrons are supplied to the 2D perovskite. In turn, the overall recombination is reduced if the difference in the electron density increases across the device depths. The resulting J sc , V oc , FF, and final PCE are shown in Figure  3b, c . As can be seen in Figure  3b , J sc showed a slight increase by electron donation, but there was no significant change in its value. As expected from the reduction in the recombination rate, both V oc and FF significantly increased (Figure  3c ). Note that we only assumed an increase in the negative charge density of the interface without considering the increase in the series resistance by the 2D layer because the physical properties of the 2D structure formed with BA, OA, and DA are not yet understood clearly. In this simulation, we believe that if the 2D layer over the 3D layer functions as an electron donor, the FF can be maintained even if the series resistance by the 2D layer increases slightly; this can be used as a strategy for achieving higher FF in the future. Although longer alkyl groups in alkyl ammonium cations act as electron donors to increase the negative charge density, the difference in V oc and FF obtained in the simulation is only possible at high dielectric constants of the 2D/3D layers. In other words, materials with low dielectric properties are not expected to reduce the Electron/hole mobility [cm 2 V -1 s -1 ] 0.02 11.8/12.5  [53] [54] [55]  0.0002 SRH lifetime, τ e = τ h [s] 6 × 10 -10 6.5 × 10 -7  [56, 57]  6.5 × 10 -7 Auger recombination coefficient [cm 6 s -1 ] 0 8.8 × 10 -30  [56, 57]  0 1902740 (6 of 8) recombination even if sufficient carriers are supplied at the interface. To obtain accurate boundary conditions, the relative electrical permittivity of the present perovskite was measured by EIS. As shown in Figure  S5  (Supporting Information), the relative dielectric constant has a value of ≈70 in the range of 100-10 000 Hz, and becomes large at low frequencies.  [58]  This is consistent with the reported results. Therefore, it is expected that the dielectric properties of the alkyl group constituting the 2D layer sensitively affect the efficiency of the device under the DC condition in which the solar cell operates. Figure  3d  shows the I-V curves measured in the reverse and forward modes for one of the best-performing devices fabricated by post-treatment with OAI on perovskite thin film. The PCE is 23.3% with short-circuit current (J sc ) of 24.99 mA cm -2 and V oc of 1.13 V, and the FF is 82.75% in the reverse mode. The equivalent values in the forward mode are efficiency of 22.04% with J sc of 24.87 mA cm -2 and V oc of 1.10 V, and 80.77% FF. As is well known, the two measurement modes have a difference in efficiency, called hysteresis, which is mainly caused by the difference between V oc and FF rather than J sc . Recently, the stabilized method, that is, ≈10-point IV sweep configuration, wherein the bias voltage is held constant until the measured current attains a constant value, has been applied for determining the efficiency with higher accuracy. Thus, one of the efficient devices was certified by an accredited testing laboratory (Newport Corporation Technology and Application Center Photovoltaic Lab). As shown in Figure  S6  (Supporting Information), the efficiency under full sun was 22.91%, which is more close to the value measured in the reverse mode. Finally, the stability of the PSCs under humid conditions was investigated. In our experiments, all PSCs without encapsulation were stored in a humidity control box at room temperature (RT) with 85% relative humidity (RH), and 65 °C with 65% RH. The humidity resistance of perovskite thin films post-treated with different lengths of alkyl ammonium halides can be highly dependent on the length of the alkyl chain. Indeed, the comparison of hydrophobicity of the surface of perovskite post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI shows an increase in hydrophobicity owing to the increase in the length of the alkyl chain, as shown in Figure  S7  (Supporting Information). The surface of the pristine perovskite has a contact angle of 52.91°. On the other hand, the surfaces post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI have contact angles of 56.25°, 61. 5°, and 85.78°, respectively; in particular, the surface treated with DAI exhibits a very high contact angle. Therefore, the humidity stability of devices fabricated with perovskite post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI is expected to show a large difference depending on the length of the alkyl chain. To more accurately understand the dependence of the resistance to moisture on the length of the alkyl chain, the change in PL over time at 65 °C under 65% relative humidity was monitored after post-treating with alkylammonium iodide perovskites deposited on ns-TiO 2 electrode. As expected, it can be seen that with increase in time under the test conditions, the difference in the PL intensity, which was initially small, becomes larger. As shown in Figure  4a , the PL intensities of the perovskite thin films post-treated with BA, OA, and DA are different. Therefore, the PL intensity measured for each thin film was compared with the normalized value. This is consistent with the tendency of increasing hydrophobicity with increasing  chain length of the alkyl ammonium used in post-treatment of the perovskite, which indicates that long alkyl chains are effective in protecting the perovskite. Figure  4b  shows the change in efficiency measured with 100 h of exposure at 65 °C under 65% humidity for devices fabricated with perovskite layers posttreated with BAI, OAI, and DAI. The efficiencies of pristine and BAI-treated perovskite drop to ≈20% of the initial efficiency after 100 h of exposure under the experimental condition; therefore, BA has very low humidity resistance. On the other hand, perovskite devices treated with OAI and DAI showed no significant degradation; especially, DAI maintained 80% of its initial efficiency without encapsulation. At low temperatures under high humidity (Figure  4c ), the degradation behavior along the alkyl chain length is the same, even at 85% relative humidity, and the device post-treated with DAI maintains more than 90% of its initial efficiency after 100 h of exposure. Interestingly, as shown in Figure  4d , the full devices, including organic HTL, which can act as an additional protective layer against moisture, show more severe degradation at 25 °C temperature and 85% humidity. This may be due to the effect of hygroscopic additives such as tert-butylpyridine and Li-salt added to increase the hole conductivity of DM used as the HTL. Therefore, considering the long-term stability of PSCs, especially humidity stability, it is very important that the alkyl group of alkyl ammonium and the HTL should be selected such that they do not significantly impair the efficiency. In summary, we investigated the PCE and humidity stability of PSCs fabricated from 3D perovskite post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI. The performance of the PSCs was compared by device simulation by considering the electrical properties of the 2D layer in the 3D/2D bilateral structure. The electron-blocking ability and moisture resistance increased with increasing length of the alkyl chain, but the highest PCE was obtained in the OAI-treated PSC, which showed a certified stabilized efficiency of 22.9%. 1:1 molar ratio of synthesized MABr and PbBr 2 (Aldrich) in 6 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF). Single crystalized MAPbBr 3 in a sealed solution was filtered and baked at 100 ℃ for 30 min. 
 Solar cell fabrication F-doped SnO 2 (FTO) was etched by zinc powder (Aldrich) and hydrochloric acid (57 wt% in H 2 O, Aldrich). The etched substrate was sonicated in detergent, DI water, and ethanol in the given order. A thin compact TiO 2 layer was deposited onto an F-doped SnO 2 (FTO, Asahi) substrate by spray coater equipment using titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in ethanol (1:20 volume ratio) at 450 ℃. A 150 nm layer of nanostructured (ns)-TiO 2 was spin-coated at 1,500 rpm onto the substrate using commercial TiO 2 paste (SC-HT040, Sharechem) diluted with 2-methoxyethanol, and then heat treated at 500 ℃ for 1 h in air to remove the organic components. FAPbI 3 (1.26 M) containing 5 mol% MAPbBr 3 and 46 mol% MACl was dissolved in a 1 mL mixture of DMF and DMSO (8:2 volume ratio) at 60 ℃. The resulting solution was coated onto the ns-TiO 2 layer by a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1,000 and 5,000 rpm for 10 and 20 s, respectively. During the second step, the substrate was treated with drop casting of diethyl ether. The substrate was dried on a hot plate at 150 ℃ for 10 min and then at 100 ℃ for 10 min to produce (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 mixed halide perovskite thin film. The heat-treated film was coated with 3 mg/1 mL OAI (BAI, DAI)/IPA (11.7 mM) solution. OAI (BAI, DAI) solution (100 µL) was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 5,000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 100 ℃ for 5 min to remove any residual solvent. The annealed film was dried at RT in a vacuum oven for 24 h. The dried film was spin-coated by HTM/chlorobenzene (28.6 mg/1 mL) solution with additives of 20 µL of pure tBP, and 20 µL of Li       Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1. a) Surface scanning electron microscope images of control, and perovskite post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI (scale bars: 1 µm). b) UV-vis absorption spectra of perovskite layers post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI. c) GIWAXS images of perovskite layers post-treated with BAI, OAI, and DAI. d) Cross-section TEM image of perovskite layer post-treated with OAI.

Materials and Methods 
 Device fabrication Patterned ITO glass substrates were first cleaned by ultrasonication with soap, acetone and isopropanol. The hole transport layer poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) with a concentration of 2 mg ml -1 dissolved in toluene was spin-coated at the speed of 4,000 rpm for 35 s and then annealed at 100 o C for 10 min. Before depositing perovskite films, the PTAA film was pre-wetted by spinning 80 µl DMF at 4,000 rpm for 15 s to improve the wetting property of the perovskite precursor solution. The perovskite precursor solution composed of mixed cations (lead (Pb), cesium(Cs), formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA)) and halides (I, Br) was dissolved in mixed solvent (DMF/DMSO = 4:1) with a chemical formula of Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45. Then 80 µl precursor solution was spun onto PTAA at 2,000 rpm for 2 s and 4,000 rpm for 20 s, and the film was quickly washed with 130 µl toluene at 18 s during spin-coating. Subsequently, the sample was annealed at 65 o C for 10 min and 100 o C for 10 min. The ammonium sulfate solution was prepared by dissolving methylamine (Sigma-Aldrich, 33 wt. % in ethanol) or octylamine ((Sigma-Aldrich, 99 %) and sulfuric solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999%) in mixed solvents (toluene/isopropanol = 5:1) with the concentration of 4 mM. The sulfate precursor solutions at different concentrations were prepared by serial dilution method. Specifically, the amines and sulfuric solution were firstly diluted twice to a low concentration by the mixed solvents. Then, the diluted amine and sulfuric solution were mixed with certain amount of solvents to a desired concertation. To treat the surface of perovskite films, 100 µl of precursor solution was loaded on the film for 20 s and was then spun at 6,000 rpm for 30 s. During spin-coating process, extra 130 µl of toluene was dropped to wash the unreacted precursors. The devices were finished by thermally evaporating C60 (30 nm), BCP (8 nm) and copper (140 nm) in sequential order. 
 Encapsulation A thin layer of CYTOP was firstly coated onto the back surface of device by blade coating, followed by annealing at 75 o C for 45 min on a hot plate. Then, a cover glass was attached onto the back surface for further protection by epoxy resin. 
 Surface treatment of single crystals MAPbI3 single crystals were treated by dipping in 4 mM octylammonium sulfate solution, followed by washing with toluene. The dipping time is 5 min and 20 s for the water resistant and temperature-dependent conductivity tests, respectively. The sample was then thermal annealed for 10 min in an oven at 100 °C. 
 Structure characterization Crystallographic information for the as-synthesized crystals was obtained by a Rigaku D/Max-B X-ray diffractometer with Bragg-Brentano parafocusing geometry, a diffracted beam monochromator, and a conventional cobalt target X-ray tube set to 40 kV and 30 mA. Cross-section FIB sample lamellae was prepared on a FEI Quanta 3D FEG instrument, and a low beam current was applied to minimize ion beam damage to the devices. The FIB lamellae were targeted with a final thickness of about 100 nm but this
may vary locally. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning TEM were performed on a FEI Talos F200X analytical scanning transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV, and a low electron dose was applied to minimize the electron beam damage. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured (SPECS XR-MF) by using a monochromatized Al source (hv=1486.6 eV). The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of perovskite powder were collected in the transmittance mode on the PerkinElmer IR spectrometer instrument in the 400 -4,000 cm -1 region. The morphology and structure of the samples were characterized by Quanta 200 FEG environmental scanning electron microscope. 
 Optical characterization Optical absorption spectra were measured by means of an Evolution 201/220 UV/visible Spectrophotometer. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was performed on the perovskite films grown on varied substrates by a Horiba DeltaPro fluorescence lifetime system, which equipped with a DeltaDiode (DD-405) pulse laser diode with wavelength of 404 nm. The laser excitation energy in the measurement was 20 pJ pulse -1 . 
 Ion migration studies Activation energy for ion migration was tested using lateral devices by a Keithley 2400 source meter at different temperatures. The electric field of the lateral device was 0.4 V/μm. The device was set in a Lakeshore Probe Station to obtain desired temperature. 
 Device characterizations The J-V analysis of solar cells was performed using a solar light simulator (Oriel 67005, 150 W Solar Simulator) and the power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 mW cm -2 by a silicon (Si) diode (Hamamatsu S1133) equipped with a Schott visiblecolor glass filter (KG5 color-filter). All cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter with scan rate of 0.1 V s -1 . The steady-state PCE was measured by monitoring current with the largest power output bias voltage and recording the value of the photocurrent. External quantum efficiency curves were characterized with a Newport QE measurement kit by focusing a monochromatic beam of light onto the devices. The tDOS of solar cells were derived from the frequency-dependent capacitance (C-f) and voltagedependent capacitance (C-V), which were obtained from the thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) measurement performed by an LCR meter (Agilent E4980A). The transient photovoltage was measured under 1 sun illumination. An attenuated UV laser pulse (SRS NL 100 Nitrogen Laser) was used as a small perturbation to the background illumination on the device. The laser-pulse-induced photovoltage variation and the VOC is produced by the background illumination. The wavelength of the N2 laser was 337 nm, the repeating frequency was about 10 Hz, and the pulse width was less than 3.5 ns. 
 Device operational stability tests Long-term stability measurements of encapsulated perovskite devices were operated under a plasma lamp with light intensity equivalent to AM 1.5G (Fig.  S9 ), without ultraviolet filter in air (relative humidity ∼60±10 %). The temperature of the devices under illumination was measured to be ~65 °C. All devices were loaded with a resistance so that they worked at maximum power point (MPP) at the beginning of the tests. Since the sulfate-treated device is rather stable during the whole test, the voltage shift of MPP is expected to be small. The J-V curves were automatically recorded with reverse scan rate of 0.1 V s -1 every six hours. 
 CPMD computational details To simulate the perovskite surfaces, we have properly cut 2 × 2 × 3 slabs from the bulk tetragonal MAPbI3 crystal structure, which expose MAI-terminated surface. The employed periodic cell dimension are a = b = 17.71 Å, corresponding to twice the tetragonal experimental a = b cell parameters. A layer of 8 PbSO4 units was deposit on the MAI-terminated perovskite slab and a Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics (32) (CPMD) simulations have been carried out. The 2 × 2 × 1 (a = 13.918, b = 16.964 Å) PbSO4 layer was generated by cutting the Anglesite experimental bulk structure (a = 6.959, b = 8.482, c = 5.398 Å). We use this slab dimension to have 8 PbSO4 units corresponding to the 8 iodide undercoordinated atoms of the surface. By doing so we have a lattice matching of 127% a and 104%, calculated as a percentage ratio between the perovskite slab and the PbSO4 slab employed. Along the c direction, a 10.0 Å of vacuum has been added for the slab calculation. Quantum Espresso package  (33)  along with the GGA-PBE functional was used. Electronion interactions were described by scalar relativistic ultrasoft pseudopotentials with electrons from O, N and C 2s, 2p; H 1s; S 3s, 3p; I 5s, 5p; Pb 6s, 6p, 5d shells explicitly included in the calculations. Plane-wave basis set cutoffs for the smooth part of the wave functions and the augmented density were 25 and 200 Ry, respectively. CPMD simulations have been performed with an integration time step of 10 au, for a total simulation time of ca. 10 ps. The fictitious mass used for the electronic degrees of freedom is 1000 au, and we set the atomic masses to an identical value of 5 amu to enhance the dynamical sampling. Initial ions position randomization has been used to reach temperature in the range of 350-400K, without further applying any thermostat. 
 Geometry optimizations of slabs We also simulate the MAI-and PbI2-terminated interface for a full coverage of PbSO4 layers (12 units). The MAI-terminated perovskite surface is the same adopted for the CPMD simulation as specified above while the PbI2-terminate is a 2 × 2 × 5 slab. On these slabs, we deposited a single layer of 12 PbSO4 units. The 3 × 2 × 1 PbSO4 layer was generated by cutting the Anglesite experimental bulk structure. In this case, we adopt the full coverage to evaluate the energetics of the interface formation with a lattice matching of 85 % along a and 104 % along b. On these systems, we performed geometry optimization using GGA-PBE functional. Electron-ion interactions were described by scalar relativistic ultrasoft pseudopotentials with electrons from O, N and C 2s, 2p; H 1s; S 3s, 3p; I 5s, 5p; Pb 6s, 6p, 5d shells explicitly included in the calculations. Plane-wave basis set cutoffs for the smooth part of the wave functions and the augmented density were 25 and 200 Ry, respectively. Formation energy (ΔEform) has been calculated as follows, see Table  S1 : ΔEform = E(MAPbI3-nPbSO4) -E(MAPbI3) -E(nPbSO4) Where E(MAPbI3-nPbSO4) is the energy of the interface with n PbSO4 units, E(MAPbI3) is the energy of the isolated perovskite slab and E(nPbSO4) is the energy of the optimized 1 × 1 × 1 PbSO4 bulk calculated at the same level of theory starting from the experimental structure and using a k-point sampling grid of 2 × 2 × 2; n represents the number of PbSO4 units involved. In Table  S1  we reported also the ΔEform per molec calculated as ΔEform/n and the ΔEform per molec referred to energy of the isolated PbSO4 molecules. 
 Model for Radial Distribution Function (RDF) analysis To evaluate the RDF of the PbSO4 when interacting with perovskite surface we set up a bulk model involving 2 × 2 × 5 PbI2-terminated perovskite bulk interacting with a 3 × 2 × 7 PbSO4 bulk, see Fig.  S6 . The 3 × 2 × 7 PbSO4 layer was generated from the Anglesite experimental bulk structure. In this case, we adopt the full coverage to evaluate the energetics of the interface formation with a lattice matching of 85% along a and 104% along b. The a and b cell parameters are 17.7112 Å while the c dimension was set as sum of the encumbrance of the separated parts (51 Å). The interface has been optimized using CP2K program, using PBE functional, DZVP basis set, DFT-D3 dispersion interactions and a cutoff of 300 Ry.               S4 . Photovoltaic parameters of the phosphate-treated device with different sweeping rates and directions. All the J-V curves were at a simulated AM 1.5 G solar irradiation with a scan rate of 0.  We show that converting the surfaces of lead halide perovskite to water-insoluble lead (II) oxysalt through reaction with sulfate or phosphate ions can effectively stabilize the perovskite surface and bulk material. These capping lead oxysalt thin layers enhance the water resistance of the perovskite films by forming strong chemical bonds. The wide-bandgap lead oxysalt layers also reduce the defect density on the perovskite surfaces by passivating undercoordinated surface lead centers, which are defect-nucleating sites. Formation of the lead oxysalt layer increases the carrier recombination lifetime and boosts the efficiency of the solar cells to 21.1%. Encapsulated devices stabilized by the lead oxysalt layers maintain 96.8% of their initial efficiency after operation at maximum power point under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 G irradiation for 1200 hours at 65°C. T he power conversion efficiency (PCE) of laboratory-scale metal halide organic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has reached a certified value of 24.2%, exceeding those of cells that are based on cadmium telluride (CdTe) and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) (1). However, PSCs face long-term instability issues under realistic operation conditions, which remains a critical hurdle to be overcome before their commercialization  (2) (3) (4) . Lead halide perovskites generally suffer from instability under stimuli of heat, oxygen, moisture, light irradiation, and electric field (4-6). Tailoring the composition, crystallinity, and internal material strain have been shown to substantially improve the materials' intrinsic stability under different stimuli, but their instability from moisture and oxygen is still an outstanding issue to be solved  (7) (8) (9) (10) .

 III-V Multijunction Cells Perovskite degradation is generally initialized from the defect sites at surfaces and grain boundaries, which are more reactive toward water and oxygen  (11) (12) (13) . Many organic molecules and poly-mers have been applied to chemically passivate the perovskite surface defects, and physical covering of some structural defects with hydrophobic organic materials can also enhance the stability of the perovskites  (14) (15) (16) (17) . For example, C 60 and its derivatives have been reported as passivation layers, enhancing device efficiency and reducing current hysteresis in PSCs  (14) . The surface under-coordinated Pb sites can be passivated by Lewis base electron donors, such as thiophene and pyridine, which saturate the lead coordination sphere  (15) . Zwitterions, bearing both negative and positive components, are shown to have a superior dual-passivation effect, leading to enhanced stability of unencapsulated perovskite films under ambient conditions  (16) . Despite these initial successes, limitations exist in using these passivation agents as postsynthesis perovskite treatment for efficiency and stability enhancement. The secondary bonding between these passivation molecules and the perovskite surface is generally too weak to protect the material from attack from moisture and oxygen. Not all structural defects are electronic defects, so some structural defects that may initialize the film degradation might not be covered by passivation molecules. The passivation strategies reported for halide perovskites are fundamentally different from those effectively used in silicon solar cells, in which passivation mainly involves primary chemical bonding. For silicon technology, surface structural defects are generally passivated by silicon oxide, silicon nitride, or aluminum oxide, which form strong covalent bonds to silicon. Oxides and nitrides are mechanically strong, compact, and chem-ically stable, which protect the underlying silicon from degradation. Wide-bandgap oxides and nitrides passivate the surface defects by eliminating silicon dangling bonds and thus enhance device efficiency. We demonstrate a general passivation strategy for lead halide perovskites by forming a thin, compact inorganic lead oxysalt layer on the perovskite surface through in situ reaction with selected inorganic anions. The surface lead oxysalt layer formed strong chemical bonds with the perovskite and afforded much better resistance to many detrimental stimuli under ambient atmosphere and light irradiation. Its passivation effect enhanced the PSC efficiency. The concept of metal halide perovskite surface passivation by using compact inorganic layers is illustrated in Fig.  1A . Inorganic layers for surface passivation of metal halide perovskite should have a large bandgap to reduce surface recombination velocity and be chemically stable in ambient air, especially under humid conditions. The lead salts that are insoluble in water are ideal candidates for perovskite surface stabilization. For example, the solubility of PbSO 4 , Pb 3 (PO 4 ) 2 , and PbCO 3 in water is merely 0.0443, 0.00014, and 0.0011 g liter -1 at 20°C, respectively  (18) . By contrast, PbI 2 has a much higher solubility of 0.756 g liter -1 in water. Another requirement for the surface inorganic layers is that they must bond strongly to the perovskite surface so that the coating is mechanically strong. We formed PbSO 4 and Pb 3 (PO 4 ) 2 as surface inorganic layers through the facile chemical reaction of perovskite with SO 4 2--and PO 4 3-containing salts dissolved in solvents that do not dissolve halide perovskites, such as isopropanol or toluene-in this case, (C 8 H 17 NH 3 ) 2 SO 4 and (C 8 H 17 NH 3 ) 3 PO 4 . Triple-cation perovskite was used in our study with a chemical composition of Cs 0.05 FA 0.81 MA 0.14 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45 (CsFAMA perovskite, where MA is methylammonium and FA is formamidinium). The oxyacid ions reacted with halide perovskite when perovskite films were dipped into (C 8 H 17 NH 3 ) 2 SO 4 and (C 8 H 17 NH 3 ) 3 PO 4 solutions for 30 to ~60 min followed by thermal annealing, according to the following chemical equations APbX 3 þ SO 2À 4 → A þ þ 3X À þ PbSO 4 ð1Þ 3APbX 3 þ 2PO 3À 4 → 3A þ þ 9X À þ Pb 3 ðPO 4 Þ 2 ð2Þ where A = MA, FA, Cs, or a mixture thereof, and X = Br, I, or mixed halide ions. This reaction yielded stable white-colored PbSO 4 and Pb 3 (PO 4 ) 2 films, as shown in the photographs and verified with x-ray diffraction patterns in figs. S1 and S2. Using the same method, a thin lead sulfate layer can be generated on the surface of the CsFAMA perovskite films by reducing the reaction time. Because PbSO 4 is electrically insulating, the reaction time and precursor concentration were carefully optimized to be 20 s and 4 mM, RESEARCH respectively, which yields a layer thickness of <5 nm that can maintain efficient charge transport (fig.  S3 ). Perovskite films or devices with lead sulfate layers, hereafter referred to as lead sulfate samples, were obtained through octylammonium sulfate treatment if not specified otherwise. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images in figs. S4 and S5, A and B, show that the topography of the perovskite films was well maintained after the surface reaction, indicating a conformal coating of lead sulfate on the perovskites. Cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) (Fig.  1B ) further revealed a uniform and compact lead sulfate layer that was closely stacked between the fullerene (C 60 ) and perovskite films. The lead sulfate layer had a thickness of 3 to 4 nm, whereas the C 60 layer was crystalline. We used scanning TEM characterization to verify the homogeneity of the sulfate layer on the top of perovskite films. We tested various perovskite/ C 60 interface regions (fig.  S5C ) and observed a thin but continuous lead sulfate layer both on the surface and at grain boundaries of the perovskite film, suggesting complete coverage of lead sulfate on the top surface of perovskite films. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) transmission spectra of CsFAMA perovskite powders before and after surface treatment were collected to probe the interactions of sulfate ions with the perovskite. The tetrahedral symmetric sulfate ions typically present one broad peak at ~1100 cm -1 of the triply degenerate v3 band  (19) . The occurrence of v1 band (945 cm -1 ) and split v3 bands (950 to ~1200 cm -1 ) (Fig.  1C ) suggests a distortion of the tetrahedral structure of sulfate ions and formation of strong ionic bonds between Pb 2+ and SO 4 2ions  (20) . The characteristic vibration peaks of the sulfate-treated sample were at the identical frequency (950 to ~1200 cm -1 ) to those of pure PbSO 4 powder (fig.  S6 ), which implies the similar IR vibration behavior of the surface layer on the perovskite surface. We performed x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to further characterize the perovskite surface composition after surface treatment. The Pb 4f spectrum exhibited two contributions, 4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 (Fig.  1D ), located at 138.6 and 143.5 eV for the film without any treatment (control), respectively  (21) . The shift of the Pb peaks toward higher binding energies is evidence for the formation of stronger ionic bonding between Pb 2+ and SO 4 2-ions  (22) . The S/Pb atom ratio was estimated to be 1.03 by the integrated area of corresponding peaks (Fig.  1E ). We performed first-principles density functional theory (DFT) computational analyses of the interaction between MAPbI 3 and PbSO 4 using a slab model of both materials and investigated the nature of their interface by means of ab initio Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics (CPMD). We initially considered a (001) MAI-terminated MAPbI 3 surface covered by eight PbSO 4 units arranged in a network similar to that of the perfect PbSO 4 crystal but matching the lattice of MAPbI 3 . We evolved the system dynamics at 350 K for several picoseconds and observed the structural inter-face rearrangement. Starting from the ordered interface (Fig.  2A ), we observed the progressive replacement of a surface MAI unit with a PbSO 4 unit within a few picoseconds (Fig.  2 , B to D), suggesting a stronger interaction between surface Pb atoms of MAPbI 3 and SO 4 -units to form PbSO 4 . We further monitored whether a stronger interaction could exist between the PbI 2terminated surface and PbSO 4 . We thus compared the energetics of interface interaction between PbSO 4 and the two MAPbI 3 surface terminations considering a more closely packed PbSO 4 slab composed by 12 PbSO 4 units (Fig.  2, E  and F , and table  S1 ). These simulations also suggest that interaction between the PbI 2 -terminated surface and PbSO 4 is significantly favored compared with MAI-terminated surface, and the theoretical studies are consistent with the experimental results that show a strong preferential interaction of sulfate anions with perovskite lead atoms. In all cases, bulk PbSO 4 is more stable compared with the formation of a MAPbI 3 -surface PbSO 4 thin film (table  S1 ), which is consistent with the complete perovskite conversion to PbSO 4 observed upon prolonged exposure to sulfate anions. To further investigate the structure of the PbSO 4 phase at the interface with MAPbI 3 , we built a larger model in which the PbI 2 -terminated MAPbI 3 slab was interfaced with several layers of PbSO 4 (fig.  S7A ). The O-S and O-Pb radial distribution functions showed no substantial changes from pure PbSO 4 to the interface with MAPbI 3 (fig.  S7, B  and C ), which suggests the possibility for retention of a crystalline PbSO 4 phase with good lattice matching. The experimental conditions may not favor the crystalline PbSO 4 formation because of the speed of the reaction, but the amorphous PbSO 4 layer was still effective in protecting perovskite surfaces. Solar cells were fabricated with a p-i-n planar heterojunction configuration structured as indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate/poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA)/CsFAMA perovskite/C 60 /2,9-dimethyl-4, 7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP)/Cu. The solar cell device with a lead sulfate surface layer delivered a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 22.63 mA cm -2 , an open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.16 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.804, yielding a PCE of 21.1% under a reverse scan rate of 0.1 V s -1 (Fig.  3A  and table  S2 ). No notable photocurrent hysteresis was observed under forward and reverse sweeps, which suggests good passivation by the lead sulfate layer. The J SC value obtained from the current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics was also verified by measuring the external quantum efficiency (EQE) obtained through integration of the spectral response (fig.  S8 ). Additionally, the best device was further held at maximum power point (MPP) with a voltage of 0.99 V to track the stabilized power output. The photocurrent stabilized at ~21.2 mA cm -2 (Fig.  3B ), corresponding to a stabilized PCE of 21.0%. We measured J-V characteristics of champion devices with different surface treatment under simulated sunlight of air mass (AM) 1.5 G (Fig.  3C ). The control device had a J SC of 22.51 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.07 V, and a FF of 0.796, yielding a PCE of 19.16%. The photovoltaic parameters of the devices with and without octylammonium sulfate treatment were analyzed, and the statistical distribution is shown in fig.  S9 . The To quantify how much cation passivates the perovskite surface, we fabricated solar cells with different cations and anions, and detailed statistical analysis on the device parameters are summarized in table  S3 . Octylammonium iodide treatment increased the mean V OC of the cells from 1.06 to 1.08 V, implying that there is a small but distinct contribution from alkylammonium cations to the passivation of perovskite surface. However, when anions were changed by replacing octylammonium iodide with octylammonium sulfate, the mean V OC of the cells increased from 1.08 to 1.14 V. Moreover, a high mean V OC of 1.13 V could be maintained if methylammonium sulfate was used instead of long-chain alkylammonium cations, implying that sulfate anions dominated in surface passivation. We infer that the perovskite films are mostly covered by the lead sulfate layer after treatment because of the preferential reaction between Pb cations and sulfate anions, as indicated by the results of DFT simulations, so octylammonium cations have less interaction with the perovskite surface. We further demonstrated the universality of this synthetic strategy of using phosphate ions to form a Pb 3 (PO 4 ) 2 surface layer and examined the device performance. One solar cell device based on phosphated CsFAMA perovskite exhibited a J SC of 22.54 mA cm -2 , V OC of 1.14 V, and FF of 0.813, yielding a PCE of 20.87% without hysteresis (fig.  S10  and table S4 ). Trap density of states (tDOS) of the control and sulfate-treated devices was measured with thermal admittance spectroscopy. A device with sulfate top layers had a lower tDOS almost over the whole trap depth region (Fig.  3D ). The density of shallower trap states (0.35 to 0.42 eV) of the sulfate-treated device was only about 10% that of the control device. Our previous characterizations have revealed that the shallow traps mainly locate at the grain boundaries  (23) . Thus, sulfate ions can effectively reach the grain boundaries during the treatment and passivate them, subsequently increasing the device V OC . The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the control CsFAMA perovskite film show a biexponential decay with a fast and a slow component (Fig.  3E ). The surface layer mainly affected the fast PL decay process. The fast-component of the recombination process from the control and sulfate-treated films were fitted to be 3.2 and 24.7 ns, respectively, which is consistent with the enhanced steady-state PL results (Fig.  3F ). The enhanced PL intensity and PL decay lifetime illustrate that the nonradiative recombination of photo-generated carriers in perovskite films is reduced by the formation of lead sulfate surface layers  (24, 25) . Devices were then irradiated under AM 1.5 G simulated illumination, and weak laser pulses (337 nm, 4 ns) were used to modulate V OC to measure the decay of transient photovoltage signals. As seen in Fig.  3G  and fig.  S11 , the chargerecombination lifetime under 1 Sun illumination was increased from 0.27 ms for the control device to 0.58 and 0.47 ms for sulfate-and phosphatetreated devices, respectively. The lower charge trap density and longer carrier recombination lifetime of samples with lead sulfate top layers indicate that the reaction of sulfate and phosphate ions with defective perovskite surface reduces the surface defect density, in addition to the charge compensation effect of these ions. The widebandgap lead oxysalt layer should also contribute to the reduced surface charge recombination rate, similar to the passivation of silicon by oxides  (26) . We performed long-term stability tests of encapsulated CsFAMA perovskite devices under a plasma lamp with light intensity equivalent to AM 1.5 G (fig.  S12 ), without ultraviolet filter in air (relative humidity ~60 ± 10%). All devices were loaded with a resistance so that they worked at MPP at the beginning of the tests. The J-V curves were automatically recorded with a reverse scan rate of 0.1 V s -1 every 6 hours. We frequently checked the stabilized efficiency during the test and did not find obvious differences between the stabilized efficiency and that from J-V scanning. Most importantly, instead of monitoring device stability at a reduced temperature of 20 to 25°C that may cause the overestimation of solar cell stability, we conducted the stability testing at real operation temperature and used a light source with a substantial ultraviolet component. The temperature of the devices under illumination was measured to be ~65°C, which is typical of the thermal heating effect of light. The PCE of the encapsulated control device degraded rapidly from 18.2 to 8.54% after testing for 474 hours (Fig.  3H ). For the devices with the lead sulfate layer, the PCE slightly improved during the first 120 hours of testing and then degraded linearly with both reduced J SC and FF over time. After 1200 hours of testing, the efficiency slightly dropped to 96.8% of the initial value. This CsFAMA perovskite device is one of the most stable reported when tested at MPP conditions (table  S5 ). In ambient conditions, hydration and oxidization of perovskites are among main paths for the degradation of perovskite films  (13, 27) . We studied the water resistance of perovskites with lead sulfate surface layers on MAPbI 3 single crystals. MAPbI 3 crystals were treated with the sulfate precursor solution followed by thermal annealing at 100°C for 10 min (supplementary materials). When dipped in water, the control MAPbI 3 crystal without any treatment quickly turned yellow within 10 s because of fast decomposition of MAPbI 3 with water, forming PbI 2 or other hydrates, whereas the sample with a sulfate layer remained black after dipping in water for >60 s (Fig.  4A  and movie S1). The much later appearance of yellow PbI 2 from perovskite single crystals showed that the lead sulfate top layer was compact enough to slow down the permeation of water into perovskite. We tested the water resistivity of the lead sulfate layer by dripping water on top of the devices with and without sulfate treatment. A device with the lead sulfate layer remained black for 3 min after dripping water, whereas the control device quickly decomposed to yellow-colored PbI 2 (fig.  S13 ). We also tested the protection effect of lead sulfate layer on polycrystalline films that had the same stacking structure of the devices but without metal electrodes. The perovskite film with lead sulfate layer was sandwiched between PTAA and phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) layers. We recorded the  absorbance changes at 740 nm during the stability test to quantify the material degradation. The control sample lost 84.2% of its absorbance after illumination for 504 hours, whereas the sample with a lead sulfate layer only lost 16.8% (Fig.  4B  and fig.  S14 ). Ammonium cations have also been reported to enhance the stability of perovskites  (28) . We tested another set of perovskite thin films in air under illumination without any charge transport layers to study which species-specifically, ammonium or sulfate ions-play the dominating role in stabilizing perovskite films. The CsFAMA perovskite film treated with octylammonium iodide fully bleached after testing for 4 days, only slightly preventing the decomposition of the perovskite film as compared with the control sample without any treatment (fig.  S15 ), but perovskite films with sulfate treatment remained black after 4 days. About 56 and 64% of the films' absorbance at 740 nm remained for films treated with methylammonium sulfate and octylammonium sulfate, respectively. The result verified that the stabilization was mainly derived from sulfate rather than ammonium ions. Mass transport of ions is another critical issue that limits the stability of the encapsulated perovskite devices. Ion migration is significantly enhanced under illumination  (29) , which may change the composition and morphology of perovskite films by forming pinholes in addition to causing the degradation of charge transport layers and electrodes  (30) . We also showed that ion migration is much easier at extended defects such as film surface and grain boundaries  (31) . We expect that the formation of a layer of lead oxysalt with strong ionic chemical bonding should stabilize the perovskite surface and suppress the ion migration through it. We measured with temperature-dependent electrical conductivity the activation energy (E a ) for ion migration of perovskite films. Lateral structure devices were fabricated by means of thermal evaporation of two Au electrodes on PTAA/ perovskite/PCBM films. The activation energy can be extracted from the Nernst-Einstein relation: s(T) = (s 0 /T)exp(-E a /k B T), where k B is the Boltzmann constant, s 0 is a constant, and T is temperature. The applied electric field was fixed at 0.4 V/mm, which was near the operational electric field in solar cell devices. For the CsFAMA perovskite films, ionic conductivity began to dominate the total conductivity, with an E a of 0.288 eV when the temperature was increased to 314 K in the dark (Fig.  4C ). When illuminated at 0.1 sunlight intensity, the transition temperature was reduced to 273 K, accompanied with a lower E a of 0.104 eV. This observation agrees well with our previous results that light would facilitate the ion migration  (29) . For the sulfate-treated perovskite film, we did not observe such a transition from electronic to ionic conductivity when the temperature was increased to 330 K both in the dark and under illumination (Fig.  4D ). A constant slope was obtained with an E a of 0.036 eV, which we ascribed to electronic conduction. We also measured E a of individual MAPbI 3 single crystals to isolate the influence of untreated grain boundaries in polycrystalline films, which act as the main channel for ion migration  (31) . Similar phenomena were observed for the single crystals (Fig.  4 , E to F). We thus conclude that ion migration is efficiently suppressed by the lead sulfate top layer on the surface of perovskite, possibly because surface defects such as vacancies were immobilized by the strongly bonded lead sulfate layer, which also explains the restrained morphological variation of perovskite films with the presence of the lead sulfate layer (fig.  S16 ). Generally, ion migration through grain boundaries is much slower than at the surface, so the exclusion of ion migration at a film surface should also indicate the absence of ion migration through sulfated grain boundaries.

Interfacial engineering from material to solvent: A mechanistic understanding on stabilizing α-formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite photovoltaics
Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) has recently been considered as the most promising candidate to achieve highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Excitingly, the state-of-the-art highest efficiency of FAPbI 3 based PSCs have reached over 25%. However, their device stability still lags behind other compositions of mixed-cation and mixed-halide perovskites. Interfacial engineering is a very powerful method to address this issue and passivation agents have been intensively developed, however there is a lack of in-depth understanding regarding the solvent selection during post-treatment. Here, we employed cyclohexylmethylammonium iodide (CMAI) as passivation agent, which is investigated using either isopropanol (IPA) or chloroform (CF) as carrier mediator to study the solvent influence on the stabilization of FAPbI 3 . We observed a suppressed-defect perovskite surface toward distinguished composition with 2D CMA 2 PbI 4 domain and CMAI domain induced by IPA and CF, respectively. Remarkably, post-treatment with solution of CMAI in CF creates a strain-free environment on the perovskite surface, leading to an improved efficiency of approaching 24% and concurrently an extraordinarily stable α-phase FAPbI 3 PSCs under operation condition, retaining 95% of its initial efficiency after 1050-hour aging. Our resulting device stability is one of the most stable FAPbI 3 based PSCs reported in literature.
Introduction Hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells have seen a rapid expansion of research since their first report in 2009, driven by their low-cost solution processing and outstanding optoelectronic properties, leading to high power conversion efficiencies with a record value of 25.5%, the highest efficiency for thin-film solar cells  [1] [2] [3] [4] . Among various compositions, α-phase FAPbI 3 has recently emerged as the most promising candidate for highly efficient single-junction PSCs, owing to its optimal bandgap, high absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length and excellent thermal stability  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, its photoactive α-phase (black-phase) is not stable at room temperature and undergoes a phase transition to the undesired wide-bandgap δ-phase (yellow phase)  [5] . Compositional engineering via mixing with methylammonium (MA + ), cesium (Cs + ) or bromide (Br -) ions has been reported as an effective method to stabilize the α-phase FAPbI 3  [6, [11] [12] [13] . However, this causes a trade-off by reducing the thermal stability, narrowing absorption spectrum, and introducing phase segregation issues under operational conditions  [12, 14, 15] . Instead, additive engineering has been reported as an effective approach to improve the stability of α-phase FAPbI 3 , leading to improved device performance as well as a better long-term stability. For example, several groups reported that methylammonium chloride (MACl) can assist the crystallization and preserve the crystal structure of α-phase FAPbI 3 , thereby providing highly efficient PSCs  [8, 16] . By optical management and exploiting the absorption spectrum of FAPbI 3 , a certified PCE of 23.7% has been reported via introducing 3.8 mol% methylenediammonium dichloride (MDACl 2 ). Although the bandgap of FAPbI 3 was slightly enlarged, the additive can structurally stabilize the α-phase of FAPbI 3 , resulting in a superb operational stability, retaining more than 90% of the initial efficiency after 600 h light soaking  [9] . Furthermore, it has been recently found that doping a FAPbI 3 precursor solution with small amount of formamidine formate (FAFo) can further suppress the non-radiative recombination of charge carriers in the perovskite films by occupying iodide vacancy defects at the perovskite surface as well as the grain boundaries; this enabled a PCE of PSC of 25.6% (certified 25.2%)  [10] . In addition to dopant engineering, surface passivation is another important approach for device optimization since non-radiative losses caused by defect states are most commonly located at the perovskite surface  [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Among various passivation agents, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) has become a ubiquitous and default solvent for post-treatment of all kinds of perovskite films, including FAPbI 3 based, mainly due to its ability to dissolve organic ammonium salts and other molecules  [22] [23] [24] [25] . In particular, it was shown to assist in the anchoring process of organic ammonium salts during the post surface reconstruction  [26] . However, exposing the perovskite surface to IPA induces a risk of creating a PbI 2 -rich perovskite surface, which generate defects and facilitate perovskite degradation  [26, 27] . In contrast, low-polarity solvents, such as chloroform (CF), are expected to have less effect on the perovskite surface  [28] , but have received very little attention so far, mainly due to the limited solubility for the commonly used passivation molecules, such as phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI)  [23] , formamidinium halide  [29] [30] [31] , and octylammonium iodide (OAI)  [24] . Thus, in this work, we employed interfacial engineering of FAPbI 3 based perovskites by passivation with cyclohexylmethylammonium iodide (CMAI, shown in Fig.  1a ), which has been recently reported as an efficient passivation material through formation of 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction  [32, 33] . The solubility of CMAI (>30 mg/mL) in a low-polarity solvent, CF, can be significantly improved due to the presence of the cyclohexane group. In addition, we are able to develop an in-depth understanding by comparing the solvent effect of IPA and CF during post-treatment. Importantly, CMAI always has a positive effect on passivating and stabilizing the FAPbI 3 based PSCs regardless which solvent is used. Interestingly, we found the components of both CMAI and 2D perovskite CMA 2 PbI 4 were formed on the perovskite surface upon post-treatment, however, with different domain component for different solvents, which stems from the solubility variations of FAI in IPA and CF. This induces target perovskite with a more released residual tension strain and prolonged carrier lifetime with treatment of CMAI in CF compare to CMAI in IPA, resulting in a better device stability of the PSCs under various conditions. 
 Results and discussion According to the previous work  [8] , a precursor solution containing FAPbI 3 powder and additional 35 mol% methylammonium chloride (MACl) was used to fabricate black α-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite films. CMAI solution dissolved in IPA or CF (5 mg/mL) was spin-coated onto the perovskite film, without further processing. Here, we use CMAI (IPA) and CMAI (CF) to further refer to solution of CMAI dissolving in IPA and CF, respectively. To investigate the effect of post-treatment on the perovskite morphology, high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were carried out. In the SEM images in Fig.  1b-d , a compact pinhole-free polycrystalline film is observed upon treatment of CMAI (IPA), which is quite similar to the control pristine perovskite film; in contrast, a contour-linelike texture appears after post-treating the film with CMAI (CF). Nevertheless, the roughness of CMAI treated films is significantly   , respectively, as illustrated in Fig.  S1b . Interestingly, we found that using IPA, the majority of CMAI molecules become integrated as 2D perovskite, while only a small amount remains unreacted on the surface. In contrary, after treatment with CMAI (CF), the formation of a CMAI dominates, while only a small amount of 2D perovskite is present. We relate this phenomena to the different solubility of the main component, formamidinium iodide (FAI), in the 3D perovskite, which dissolves well in IPA, owing to its high polarity and formation of hydrogen bonding, but shows limited solubility in CF  [26, 28] . As a result, FAI partially dissolves from the perovskite surface upon exposure to IPA, and is removed during the spin-coating process. The resulting vacancies enable a reaction between the remaining PbI 2 and the newly introduced CMAI which form a 2D perovskite layer, as illustrated in Fig.  1i . In case of exposure to CF, CMAI is limited in its possibility to react with PbI 2 due to the insolubility of FAI in CF. Therefore, such post-treated film is prone to form an additional CMAI layer on top of the perovskite film and we attribute the 2D perovskite phase to the ammonium cation exchange between CMA + and FA + . Furthermore, to identify possible solvent effects on our 3D perovskite, we additionally compared grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns of films exposed to pure IPA or CF (Fig.  S2 ). A PbI 2 peak, located at 12.6 • , is detected on the perovskite surface after IPA treatment, as shown in Fig.  S2b . This is consistent with the SEM images shown in Fig.  S3a , where plenty of small bright crystals are observed on the perovskite surface exposed to pure IPA, indicating the formation of PbI 2  [30] . However, in comparison with the untreated film, there is no obvious change on the morphology and crystal structure of the perovskite film treated with neat CF, according to the GIXRD pattern and SEM images shown in Fig.  S2c  and Fig.  S3b , suggesting a negligible effect upon CF treatment. To further distinguish the solvent effect, we added 5 mol% PbI 2 into the perovskite precursor solution to form a PbI 2 -rich FAPbI 3 film, where PbI 2 is mainly located on the top of the perovskite film surface, as determined from the GIXRD pattern (Fig.  S4 ) and SEM image (Fig.  S5 ). In this case, only 2D perovskite CMA 2 PbI 4 was observed form the GIXRD patterns after the treatment of CMAI (IPA) and CMAI (CF), indicating that CMAI can indeed react with excessive PbI 2 at the surface regardless of solvents. Based on the above results, IPA dissolves and removes the FAI on the perovskite surface, which promotes the formation of 2D CMA 2 PbI 4 . This is not the case for CF solution treatment, thus the two solvents lead to different surface compositions on top of the perovskite. The distinguished surface reconstruction processes by CMAI (IPA) and CMAI (CF) resulted in diverse surface composition, which also influenced the residual strain of the perovskite surface and the existence of the intrinsic stress has been recognised as one of critical sources of PSCs instability  [34, 35] . We focused on the 50 nm region depth of the perovskite film, which is mainly affected by post-treatment, for interfacial strain investigation and employed GIXRD technique with 2θ-sin 2 ψ method for residual stress analysis, where ψ is the instrument tilt angle  [36] [37] [38] [39] . Due to the high diffraction angle and multiplicative factor of the (012) crystallographic plane, GIXRD patterns at around 31.6 • was chosen for the strain distribution analysis. The results are shown in Fig.  2a-c . After the linear fitting of 2θ-sin 2 ψ value by varying ψ, the slope of fitted lines reflects the magnitude of residual strain as well as the strain states  [37, 38] . As shown in Fig.  2a , the diffraction peaks of the control film gradually shift to smaller 2θ with the increase of ψ from 0 • to 50 • . The negative slope observed in Fig.  2d  indicates that the surface of the pristine perovskite bears a tensile strain. After post-treatment with CMAI (IPA), a reduced shift of the GIXRD peaks vs. ψ (Fig.  2b ) is observed, indicating a decreased surface tensile strain after the surface reconstruction process. Notably, a completely strain-free film is obtained upon CMAI (CF) treatment, with a linear slope of 2θ-sin 2 ψ approaching to 0, as observed in Fig.  2c . This implies that the post-treatment of CMAI with a slow cation exchange process in CF plays an important role in releasing the residual tension stress of the perovskite film, which creates a strain-free environment. The release of residual strain contributes to the lattice stabilization of α-FAPbI 3 , which can consequently lead to a significant enhancement on the device stability (see discussion below). Moreover, it is well known that the existence of residual strain will also influence defect concentration and non-radiative recombination of perovskite films  [38] [39] [40] . Therefore, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were carried out to further examine the difference induced by the two solvents. As shown in Fig.  2e , compared to the control film, both CMAI-treated perovskite films present slower photoluminescence decay, especially the one exposed to CF shows the longest lifetime. This indicates that the introduction of CMAI could efficiently reduce the defect density and suppress the non-radiative recombination of the perovskite film  [10, 39] . To further evaluate the solvent effect on film trap density, space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) measurements were carried out on electron-only devices with structure of FTO/cp-TiO 2 /mp-TiO 2 /-FAPbI 3 /CMAI/PCBM/Au, as shown in Fig.  S6a . The control device shows a trap-filling limited voltage (V TFL ) of 0.423 V, which reduced to 0.330 V and 0.307 V after post-treatment with CMAI (IPA) and CMAI (CF), respectively (Fig.  S6b-d ). Correspondingly, the calculated trap density (N t ) decreases form 8.08 × 10 15 cm -3 to 6.30 × 10 15 cm -3 and 5.86 × 10 15 cm -3 upon the CMAI treatment, which is estimated by the following equation: V TFL = (eN t L 2 )/(2ε 0 ε), where e is the elementary charge, L is the thickness of FAPbI 3 perovskite film (600 nm), ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, and ε is the relative dielectric constant  [41] . The reduced trap density indicates the formation of an effective passivation layer after surface reconstruction, which could improve the photovoltaic performances  [30, 42] . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to investigate the element composition after the surface reconstruction, as illustrated in Fig.  S7  and Fig.  2f . The Pb 4f7/2 core level signal was located at 138.56 eV in the pristine film, however shifted towards a slightly higher bonding energy in both cases upon CMAI treatment, suggesting the variation of surface chemical environment. From the pristine film, N1s peak of FA + was located at 400.5 eV and no MA + peak (402.1 eV) was found  [43] , which is in agreement with the pure FAPbI 3 film composition  [8] . After passivation treatment with CMAI regardless of the solvent, a new N 1s peak appeared at 402.1 eV and the intensity of FA + peak was significantly reduced, implying that a new layer dominated by CMAI was formed on top of the 3D perovskite film. Notably, the ratios between CMA + and FA + , calculated from the simulative integrated areas of the two N1s peaks were 6.22 and 4.59 via CMAI (IPA) and CMAI (CF) treatment, respectively. Such reduction in cation ratio is another evidence showing that IPA could remove more FAI from the perovskite surface, thus resulting in a lower concentration of FAI during the surface reconstruction process. PSCs based on FTO glass/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/3D perovskite/passivation layer/spiro-MeOTAD/Au were fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic performance upon post-treatment by CMAI. The device architecture is shown in Fig.  3a  and the cross-sectional SEM images of the devices are illustrated in Fig.  S8 . Reverse-scanned (RS) and forwardscanned (FS) J-V curves of the devices were measured under simulated sunlight of air mass (AM) 1.5G. Comparable improvements are observed with CMAI treatment using the two solvents, in comparison to the control device. The average values of photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table  S1 . It is observed that the concentration of 5 mg/ mL CMAI in either IPA or CF delivers the best device performance. The     S1 , both V OC and FF of the post-treated devices show only slight improvement upon formation of pure 2D interlayer by heating the as-prepared passivated perovskite film  [33] . This suggests that in our system, without further annealing, an interlayer with moieties of both 2D perovskite and CMAI play an important role in passivating the 3D perovskite surface. Furthermore, the calculated ideality factor (n id ) of control, CMAI (IPA), and CMAI (CF) treated devices are 1.64, 1.36, and 1.30, respectively. The reduced n id confirms a significantly suppressed trap-assisted recombination via CMAI passivation, which accordingly resulted in an enhancement in V OC  [44] . Encouraged by the excellent results above, large area (1 cm 2 ) devices were fabricated to evaluate the practicability of the passivation strategy. As shown in Fig.  3f , one of the best PCE of the target device is 21.07%, with a Jsc of 25.75 mA/cm 2 , a V OC of 1.154 V and a FF of 0.709. Except for the excellent device performance, solvent effect on device stability has also been assessed. Firstly, the contact angle of water droplets on the perovskite films with and without passivation layer were measured. As shown in Fig.  4a , a dramatic improvement of hydrophobicity after CMAI treatment is observed compared to the pristine perovskite films; the contact angles increase from 57 • to around 90 • . We first exposed the perovskite films in ambient condition with relative humidity of 40 ± 20% for 15 days and monitored the phase stability by GIXRD, as shown in Fig.  S10 . A pronounced δ-phase FAPbI 3 at 11.7 • is clearly observed from the pristine perovskite film, indicating a significant phase transformation. In sharp contrast, both CMAI (IPA) and CMAI (CF) treated perovskite films show negligible δ-phase under the same condition, especially the one treated by CMAI (CF), suggesting an outstanding phase stability upon passivation treatment. To further investigate the device shelf stability, we subjected unencapsulated devices to air with a relative humidity of 20-30% in the dark. As illustrated in Fig.  4b , the PCE of target devices after 100-day storage retain 95% and 91% after post-treatment with CMAI (CF) and CMAI (IPA), respectively. In contrast, the control devices show more than 15% decrease under the same condition. In addition, we also tested the devices under MPPT at a constant one-sun illumination in N 2 atmosphere at room temperature. As shown in Fig.  4c , the PCE of the control device drops by almost 24% of its initial value after 1050 h aging. In sharp contrast, both CMAI passivated devices retain more 90% of the initial PCE value. In particular, the CMAI (CF) treated device shows only 5% normalized PCE loss, and is therefore comparably more stable than the device treated with CMAI (IPA). It is worth noting that our resulting device is one of the most stable PSCs based on FAPbI 3 in current literatures, as summarized in Table  S2 . Furthermore, we subjected the unencapsulated devices to 50 • C with humidity at 40 ± 10% to investigate their stability upon elevated temperature and humidity for 500 h. As excepted, CMAI (CF) treated devices retain 93% of their initial PCE, about 27% PCE loss is observed form the CMAI (IPA) treated devices, whereas the control devices show almost 60% PCE loss. We attribute this further enhanced stability to the more released residual strain induced by CMAI (CF). 
 Conclusion Overall, we successfully stabilized the α-phase of FAPbI 3 based PSCs through interfacial engineering with CMAI. More importantly, our indepth optoelectronic film together with device characterizations unraveled the rules of CMAI as passivation agent on reducing nonradiative recombination and the solvent as mediator on leasing surface residual strains during the post-treatment process. Our work paves a way on optimizing the PSCs more comprehensively and sheds light on the detrimental role of the solvent selection for post-treatment process according to the system of the 3D perovskite and passivation molecule.

Sargent 1,2,7 * Inverted (pin) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) afford improved operating stability in comparison to their nip counterparts but have lagged in power conversion efficiency (PCE). The energetic losses responsible for this PCE deficit in pin PSCs occur primarily at the interfaces between the perovskite and the charge-transport layers. Additive and surface treatments that use passivating ligands usually bind to a single active binding site: This dense packing of electrically resistive passivants perpendicular to the surface may limit the fill factor in pin PSCs. We identified ligands that bind two neighboring lead(II) ion (Pb 2+ ) defect sites in a planar ligand orientation on the perovskite. We fabricated pin PSCs and report a certified quasi-steady state PCE of 26.15 and 24.74% for 0.05-and 1.04-square centimeter illuminated areas, respectively. The devices retain 95% of their initial PCE after 1200 hours of continuous 1 sun maximum power point operation at 65°C. T he certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has reached an impressive 25.7% (1). Nevertheless, the most-efficient PSCs, fabricated in the nip architecture, have yet to achieve the needed operating stability under accelerated aging tests (1, 2). Inverted (pin) PSCs, which do not rely on p-type dopants in their hole-transporting layers (3-7), have seen progress but, until now, still lag behind their nip counterparts: Their stabilized PCE has so far reached only 25.1%  (8) . The interfaces between the perovskite and the chargetransport layers limit the PCE of pin cells (9-11) through band misalignment  (12)  and energylevel pinning  (11) . These problems are aggravated by the presence of surface defects. For example, undercoordinated Pb 2+ ions  (13) (14) (15)  result in nonradiative recombination at the perovskite-charge transport layer interface, which limits photovoltage and fill factor (FF). Surface passivation of the perovskite active layer is used to suppress interface nonradiative recombination  (14, 16) . The efficacy of bulk additives as well as solution-based treatments with ammonium ligands is now well estab-lished  (17, 18) . However, these ligands bind at a single active binding site to the perovskite structure, and this has the potential to produce dense packing of passivants aligned perpendicular to the surface, introducing an unwanted resistive barrier between the perovskite and the electron transport layer (ETL)  (16, (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . We sought routes to passivate undercoordinated Pb 2+ at the surfaces and grain boundaries of the perovskite with passivator ligands aligning parallel to the perovskite surface instead. 
 Theoretical investigations We began by considering candidate molecules that contain a benzene ring because its flat structure is expected to lie parallel to a surface compared with the case of linear-chain ligands  (21) . To enable strong binding with perovskite surfaces, we considered both -PO 3 2-and -SO 3 functional groups, each of which is reported to coordinate strongly with Pb 2+  (14, 26) . Because benzenephosphonates are not readily available, we focused on available sulfonates  (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) . We prioritized end functional groups that have a high number of oxygen atoms, a feature recently reported to correlate positively with strong binding  (26) . We then evaluated steric constraints, seeking a ligand sufficiently long that it could bind at multiple surface Pb sites, these being ~6.3 Å apart in the case of formamidinium (FA)-based perovskites. These considerations pointed to benzenesulfonate (BZS) ligands and their derivatives because these molecules have a length of ~5.7 Å. We used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate how the molecular structure of the ligand affects orientation. We considered three ligands, one with no additional functional group (BZS) and two with methyl or chloride in the para position of the benzene ring opposite to the sulfonate functional group [4-methylbenzenesulfonate (4CH 3 -BZS) and 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (4Cl-BZS)] (Fig.  1A ). 4CH 3 -BZS and 4Cl-BZS have lengths of 6.14 and 6.37 Å, respectively. We compared the formation energies of two configurations, one in which the ligands were oriented perpendicular to the perovskite surface (Conf-perp; Fig.  1B ) and another in which the ligands adopted a parallel orientation with respect to the perovskite surface (Conf-para; Fig.  1C ). Although Conf-perp was more energetically favorable for BZS and 4CH 3 -BZS, Conf-para was energetically more favorable for 4Cl-BZS because of the additional Pb 2+ surface binding afforded by the Cl functional group (Fig.  1D ) that would enable dual-site Pb 2+ passivation. We also investigated the effects of ligand orientation on charge transfer at the perovskite-ETL interface by examining fullerene (C 60 ), which is widely used as an ETL in pin PSCs and is known to induce energetic losses in devices  (11, 12, 34, 35) . Analysis of the calculated charge density difference (Fig.  1E  and fig.  S1 ) provided evidence that 4Cl-BZS, when absorbed on the perovskite layer, established a notably stronger binding strength with the C 60 layer [adsorption energies (E ads ) = -0.85 eV] in contrast to BZS (E ads = -0.46 eV) and 4CH 3 -BZS (E ads = -0.39 eV)  (36) . Fracture energy (G c ) results show that 4Cl-BZS increases the mechanical strength of the perovskite-C 60 interface (fig.  S2 )  (37) . 
 Ligand-perovskite binding characterization To explore interactions between perovskite and BZS ligands, we began by adding each ligand directly into the precursor solutions and spin-coating Cs 0.05 FA 0.85 MA 0.1 PbI 3 perovskite thin films, where FA is formamidinium and MA is methylamine. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) of untreated (control) and treated films showed that BZS, 4CH 3 -BZS, and 4Cl-BZS were all concentrated near the top (ETL-facing) surface of the perovskite film (fig.  S3 ). This result, combined with x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of control and treated perovskite films that showed no discernable peak-shifting after treatment (fig.  S4 ), indicated that the ligands did not enter the lattice but rather diffused toward the top surface during film crystallization. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of perovskite films with additives are presented in fig.  S5  and illustrate that the perovskite films (both additives and controls) exhibit substantially uniform morphology. We used x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to check for possible evidence of interaction between the additives and perovskite. We observed a shift of the Pb 4f XPS peaks to a lower binding energy for each treated film compared with the peaks of controls (Fig.  2A ). We saw evidence of interaction between Cl and Pb in 4Cl-BZS-treated perovskite from both XPS spectra (Fig.  2B ) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (fig.  S6 ). 
 Optoelectronic characterization of perovskite films and device stacks To evaluate the passivation efficacy of each ligand, we studied photoluminescence (PL) of neat control and treated perovskite films. We observed an increase in PL quantum yield (PLQY) for each of the treated films and the full device stack (Fig.  2C ), with 4Cl-BZS exhibiting a twofold increase in PLQY (41%) compared with control films (20%), which corresponded to a projected 20-mV increase in quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS). The PLQY of full-device stacks [FTO/SAMs/perovskite/C 60 , where FTO is fluorinate tin oxide and SAMs (self-assembled monolayers) are mixtures of 2PACz and Me-4PACz] revealed a substantial improvement after 4Cl-BZS treatment-5% for 4Cl-BZS compared with 0.6% for the control, corresponding to 1.17 and 1.1 V in QFLS for 4Cl-BZS and the control device, respectively. This improvement was consistent with reduced interface losses. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) revealed a similar increase in carrier lifetimes after treatment. Specifically, 4Cl-BZS-treated films exhibited a weighted-average lifetime of 3.0 ms compared with 0.6 ms for the control film (Fig.  2D  and table  S1 ). We fabricated partial and full perovskite/ ETL device stacks to probe interface recombination and charge transfer. First, we conducted TRPL measurements of perovskite/C 60 stacks, wherein decay was dictated by nonradiative surface-bulk recombination (monoexponential decay), radiative recombination (second-order decay), and charge extraction effects, which could be distinguished if the time constants for each process differed sufficiently  (38) . The first interval at shorter times was dominated by the transfer of electrons from the bulk into the C 60 , and the second interval at longer delay times was dominated by interfacial recombination  (39) . The sharp drop in emission for 4Cl-BZS/C 60 indicated efficient electron transfer at the interface, and the longer second-order decay time was indicative of a reduced trap density compared with BZS and 4CH 3 -BZS (fig.  S7 ). This effect of this reduction was especially evident in fits to the TRPL traces to compute the differential lifetime as t = -{d ln[f(t)]/dt} -1 (Fig.  2E ), where f(t) is the time-dependent PL photon flux, because the sharpness of the rise implied the speed of the electron transfer from perovskite to C 60 . Transient photocurrent measurements of full device stacks in which we used mixed SAMs as the hole-transport layer (see methods) revealed a similar trend. Both BZS and 4CH 3 -BZS resulted in slower photocurrent decay, whereas 4Cl-BZS treatment led to faster photocurrent decay (Fig.  2F ). This observation suggested that electron extraction became more efficient. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) revealed an increased conduction band offset with C 60 that was caused by a Fermi-level upshift after BZS and 4CH 3 -BZS treatment, whereas 4Cl-BZS caused a Fermi-level downshift and reduced conduction band offset (figs. S8 and S9). This trend was further confirmed by kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements (fig.  S10  and table S2 ) and DFT calculations (fig.  S11 ). 
 Inverted perovskite solar cells Using 4Cl-BZS-treated perovskite, we fabricated inverted PSCs with the structure FTO/SAMs/ perovskite/C 60 /SnO x /Ag (Fig.  3A ). The thickness of the perovskite layer was 900 nm. Con-trol devices had a PCE of 24%, whereas the 4Cl-BZS-treated devices exhibited a PCE of 26.3% (fig.  S12 ). Analysis of device statistics for both control and 4Cl-BZS-treated PSCs revealed a substantial enhancement in PCE, primarily by increased open-circuit voltage (V OC ). Additionally, 4Cl-BZS-treated PSCs showed a much higher FF compared with BZS-and 4CH 3 -BZS-treated PSCs. We attribute this improvement in FF to enhanced charge extraction in 4Cl-BZStreated PSCs (Fig.  3B   
 and figs. S13 and S14). We also evaluated the effectiveness of the additive change with a stronger or weaker donating group, namely 4F-BZS, 4Br-BZS, and 4I-BZS. Notably, 4F-BZS exhibits a more-negative averaged electrostatic potential, whereas 4I-BZS displays a more-positive averaged electrostatic potential (fig.  S15 ). We posit that a stronger donating group, such as Cl or F, is beneficial in providing dual-site defect passivation. Because 4F-BZS, 4Cl-BZS, and 4I-BZS are not readily available, we used the structurally similar molecules 4-fluorobenzenesufonic acid (4F-BZSA) and 4-iodobenzenesufonic acid (4I-BZSA) in our devices (fig.  S16 ). Notably, treatments with 4F-BZSA resulted in comparable PCE as in the case of 4Cl-BZS, and 4I-BZSA also showed an improved PCE compared with controls. We then added the bimolecular surface passivation (BMP) approach, based on 3-(methylthio) propylamine hydroiodide (3MTPAI) and propane-1,3 diammonium iodide (PDAI 2 ), reported in  (8) . This strategy has been reported to provide a combination of chemical and field-effect passivation (see methods). The PLQY of full-device stacks (FTO/SAMs/perovskite/BMP/C 60 ) indicated a further improvement after the BMP treatment (fig.  S17 ). The combined treatment increased the PCE of 4Cl-BZS-treated devices from 26.3 to 26.9% and featured a V OC of 1.18 V, FF of 86.2%, and short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 26.4 mA cm -2 (Fig.  3C ). Statistics of photovoltaic parameters for devices with bimolecular passivation revealed additional improvements in both V OC and PCE (fig.  S18 ). The bandgap of the pin PSCs was taken from external quantum efficiency measurements as 1.53 eV (figs. S19 and S20). We sent devices with active areas of 0.05 and 1.04 cm 2 to a National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)-accredited independent photovoltaic calibration laboratory (Newport) for certification. The devices achieved certified stabilized quasisteady state (QSS) PCEs of 26.15 and 24.74%, respectively (Fig.  3, D  and E , and figs. S21 and S22). These reported pin PSC PCEs surpass the record nip device performance reported in recent years (Fig.  3E  and tables S3 and S4). Next, we sought to test the thermal stability of the 4Cl-BZS-treated PSCs following protocols established by the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocol ISOS-D-2I, in which encapsulated devices were subjected to dark storage at 85°C and tested periodically. 4Cl-BZS-treated PSCs retained 95% of their initial efficiency after 1500 hours of storage at 85°C (Fig.  3G ). To evaluate operating stability further, we then also carried out ISOS-L-3 testing, in which encapsulated devices were subjected to continuous 1-sun equivalent illumination using a ultraviolet-free white light-emitting diode (LED) and held at the maximum power point (MPP) voltage, at 50% relative humidity and a heatsink temperature of 65°C (Fig.  3H ). 4Cl-BZS-treated PSCs achieved a T 95 (the time it takes for the device's PCE to drop to 95% of the initial value) of 1200 hours after continuous MPP tracking at 65°C, whereas control devices dropped from an initial efficiency of 22 to 18.7% after 1200 hours (table  S5 ). Furthermore, 4Cl-BZS-treated PSCs achieved a T 87 of 540 hours after continuous MPP tracking at 85°C (fig.  23 ). 
 Discussion We began this study with the view that dense packing of passivator ligands perpendicular to the perovskite-C 60 interface may increase resistance and that this could potentially be addressed by instead introducing ligands prone to align in a planar orientation relative to the perovskite surface. The interaction of 4Cl-BZS with undercoordinated Pb 2+ ions reduces the surface defect density and minimizes the energetic mismatch between the perovskite and C 60 . Our study indicates that the approach was effective in increasing pin PSC performance, bringing it into the range of that achieved in the nip configuration. Our approach retains the benefits of the 65°C 1-sun MPP operating stability seen in pin PSCs. To test whether our approach worked in a range of perovskite compositions, we fabricated 4Cl-BZS-treated 1.78-eV wide-bandgap mixed halide devices as well as 1.25-eV narrowbandgap mixed Pb-Sn PSCs, which are compositions of interest in all-perovskite tandem solar cells. In each case, we observed an increase in PCE after 4Cl-BZS treatment (fig.  S24 ). (PTFE) membrane before using. 
 Solar cell fabrication Single-junction normal bandgap device. Prepatterned Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses were cleaned using acetone and isopropanol each for 20 min in an ultrasonic bath, followed by ultraviolet ozone treatment for 30 min. The hole transport layer (HTL) was fabricated by using the mixed SAM solution of 2PACz and Me-4PACz in a glovebox. The 2PACz concentration is 0.17 mg ml -1 and Me-4PACz concentration is 0.33 mg ml -1 . The SAM in ethanol solution was spincoated on FTO at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by annealing at 120℃ for 10 min. The perovskite solutions were spin-coated at 1000 r.p.m for 10 s (acceleration rate 500 r.p.m./s) and 5000 r.p.m. for 35 s (acceleration rate 1000 r.p.m./s), respectively. At the last 15 s of the second step, 150 μL anisole was dropped as antisolvent. The films were then annealed at 120°C for 10 min. For the bimolecular passivation (BMP) treatment, 12 mM 3MTPAI and 6 mM PDAI2 was dissolved in 1 mL isopropanol/chlorobenzene (1:1 v/v) solvent and filtered before use, 120 μL mixed solution was spin-coated on the perovskite films at 4000 r.p.m for 25 s, followed by annealing at 100°C for 5 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the substrates were transferred to the evaporation system and a 25 nm C60 film was subsequently deposited on top by thermal evaporation at a rate of 0.2 A s -1 , after finishing the C60 deposition, the substrates were then transferred to the atomic layer deposition (ALD) system (Picosun) to deposit 20 nm SnO2 at 90 º C using precursors of tetrakis(dimethylamino) tin (iv) (99.9999%) and deionized water. Finally, 140 nm Ag electrode was evaporated by thermal evaporation. Single junction wide bandgap perovskite solar cells. NiOx nanocrystal (5 mg ml -1 in H2O and 2-Propanol mixed solvent with volume ratio of 3:1) layers were first spin-coated on ITO substrates at 3,000 rpm for 25 s in air without any post-treatment, then the substrates were immediately transferred to the glovebox. The NiOx nanoparticles were prepared via the hydrolysis reaction of nickel nitrate referring to our previous work  (3) . Me-4PACz (0.5 mg ml -1 ) in ethanol was spincoated on the NiOx film at 3,000 rpm for 25 s and then annealed at 100 o C for 10 min. For the perovskite film fabrication, the substrate was spun at 4000 rpm for 32 s with an acceleration of 1000 rpm, 100 μL Anisole was dropped onto the substrate during the last 8 s of the spinning. The substrates were then transferred onto a hotplate and heated at 100 °C for 15 min. For electron transport layer (ETL), 25 nm C60 was thermally evaporated on the perovskite films at a rate of 0.2 A s -1 under a high vacuum of ~10 -7 Torr, followed by 7 nm BCP evaporation as a hole-blocking layer. Finally, 140 nm Ag electrode was evaporated by thermal evaporation. Single junction Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells. PEDOT: PSS was spin-coated on ITO substrates at 6,000 rpm for 30 s and annealed on a hotplate at 160 °C for 20 min in ambient air. After cooling, we transferred the substrates immediately to a nitrogen-filled glovebox for the deposition of perovskite films. The perovskite films were deposited with a two-step spin-coating procedure: (1) 1,000 rpm for 10 s with an acceleration of 200 rpm s -1 , (2) 3800 rpm for 45s with an acceleration of 1000 rpm s -1 , 300 µl CB was dropped onto the spinning substrate during the second spin-coating step at 20 s before the end of the procedure. The substrates were then treated on hotplate for 10 min at 100 o C. 25 nm C60, 7 nm BCP and 140 nm Ag were sequentially deposited on top of the perovskite layer by thermal evaporation. Device testing. The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination from a solar simulator (Newport, Class A) with a light intensity of 100 mW cm -2 (checked with a calibrated reference solar cell from Newport). The J-V curves were measured in a nitrogen atmosphere with a scanning rate of 100 mV s -1 (voltage step of 10 mV and delay time of 200 ms). The active area was determined by the aperture shade mask (0.049 cm 2 for small-area devices, 1.04 cm 2 for large-area devices) placed in front of the solar cell. A spectral mismatch factor of 1.0 was used for all J-V measurements. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured in ambient air using the solar-cell-spectra-response measurement system (QE-R, EnliTech). Stability testing. Devices were placed in a homemade stability-tracking station. The illumination source is a UV-free white-light LED with its intensity calibrated to match 1-Sun conditions. The spectrum of the white-light LED simulator used in MPP stability tracking is in Supplementary Fig.  33  of our previous work  (26) . For the ISOS-L-3 ageing test, the device chamber was left open in a room with 50 ± 10% relative humidity, and the solar cell was mounted on a metal plate kept at 65 ˚C using a heating element. A thermal couple attached to the metal plate was used to monitor and provide feedback control to the heating element to ensure temperature consistency. For thermal stability tests, the encapsulated cells were heated at 85℃ in nitrogen. The device performance was evaluated periodically. Encapsulation was performed using a capping glass slide, with ultraviolet-adhesive (Lumtec LT-U001) as sealant. Crystallographic characterizations. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were measured on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer at room temperature using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 A) at 40 kV and 40 mA. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) was conducted on perovskite films at the Brockhouse X-ray Diffraction and Scattering Sector Low Energy Wiggler (BXDS-WLE) beamline of the Canadian Light Source (CLS) using a photon energy of 15.12 keV (λ = 0.82 Å). A Rayonix MX300 detector 328.04 mm away from the sample was used for collecting patterns. Other characterizations. NMR spectra were recorded by Bruker Avance III HD500. Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was collected by IONTOF M6 instrument using a primary 30 keV Bi ion source with an analysis area of 50 × 50 μm 2 . SEM images were collected by JEOL JSM-7900FLV microscope using a 5 keV and 10 keV electron beam for surface and cross-section images, respectively. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were carried out using a Horiba Fluorolog time-correlated single photon counting system with photomultiplier tube detectors. A pulsed laser diode (634 nm, 110-140 ps pulse width) was used as the excitation source for steady-state and transient measurements. The luminescence quantum yield was measured by a LuQY Pro System (Quantum Yield Berlin) under the excitation of 532 nm laser (100 mW). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were performed on Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi with an X-ray spot size of 500 μm. The XPS instrument was calibrated using silver metal, with the Ag 3d5/2 peak set at 368.2 eV. The sampling depth is 10 nm, and the spectrum remains unaffected by the underlying substrate. Throughout the XPS analysis, a low-energy electron gun was employed to flood the analysis area, neutralizing surface charges. In the post-processing phase, we standardized the adventitious carbon peak at 284.8 eV to calibrate all spectra and mitigate surface charging effects. We utilized an XPS optical microscope and observed particle aggregation on the substrate. The Xray spot, with a diameter of 400 µm, was precisely focused on an aggregated region with a thickness of several micrometers. The influence of the underlying substrate should be omitted from the analysis. Each sample was connected to the grounded sample holder using copper conductive tape. Additionally, charge compensation was performed prior to each measurement. Transient photocurrent (TPC) was conducted by the Fluxim Paios system. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) images were generated using an Asylum Cypher S atomic force microscope (Oxford Instruments) with a Ti-Ir-coated ASYELEC.01-R2 cantilever and k = 4 ± 0.5 N m -1 (Asylum Research). Scans were performed over 2 µm at 512 pixels and 0.5 Hz in a two-pass nap method, the first pass in tapping mode and the second in KPFM mode with a tip potential of 5 V and surface clearance of 5 nm. NMR analysis. We find (Fig.  S6A ) that C1 connecting the SO3 -unit shows the largest chemical shift. This we attribute to electron-withdrawal from the substituent. C4, located at the para position, shows the second largest chemical shift, which we assign to the conjugating effect. After the introduction of PbI2, the chemical shift of C1 moves to a higher field (-0.4), which we ascribe to the decrease of the electron-withdrawing capability of the substituent following coordination with PbI2. In contrast, the C4 peak shifts to a lower field (+0.22), which we ascribe to the enhancement of the conjugating effect after the coordination of SO3 -and PbI2  (40, 41) . Similar changes are observed for the methyl-substituted molecule (Fig.  S6B ). The change of the chemical shift is indicative of the strong interaction between SO3 -and PbI2. For the molecule with chlorine substituent Cl-BZS-PbI2, the change of the chemical shift of C1 and C4 after the interaction with PbI2 is reduced (-0.36, +0.1), indicating that the chlorine atom influences the electron density of the carbon atoms. To study the effect of the chlorine substituent in particular, we studied the NMR spectrum of chlorine benzene. As shown in Fig.  S6D , the peak of C4 connecting to the chlorine atom moves to a higher field after the addition of PbI2 (-0.09). This can be ascribed to the interaction between chlorine and PbI2 that reduces the electronwithdrawing character. The peak of C1 moves to lower field due to the enhancement of the conjugating effect (+0.03). These shifts indicate interactions between the chlorine and lead, as expected. For the molecule with both chlorine and SO3 -substituents (Fig.  S6C ), the movement of the chemical shift is reduced compared to BZS-PbI2, and the overall movement of the peak position in 4Cl-BZS+PbI2 is almost consistent with the sums of the shifts observed for single SO3 -and Cl substituents  (42) . This indicates the interaction of both SO3 -and Cl with PbI2. First-principles calculations. First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)  (43) . For the exchange-correlation functional, the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional (PBE) (44) was adopted. DFT-D3 method was used for the van der Waals (vdW) correction  (45) . Dipole corrections were taken into consideration in the work function calculations. The plane-wave cutoff energy was 400 eV. The energy and force convergence criteria were set to 10 -5 eV and 0.03 eV• Å -1 , respectively. The adsorption energies (Eads) of C60 with different molecules (BZS, 4CH3-BZS and 4Cl-BZS) adsorbed perovskite surface were calculated as E(C60@perovskite)-E(C60)-E(perovskite). The electrostatic potentials (φ) of the passivators were calculated in the Gaussian 09 package at the B3LYP/def2TZVP level with DFT-D3.

 a) Reverse scan; b) Forward scan; c) HI = (PCE RS -PCE FS )/PCE RS enhanced performance induced by CMAI treatment can be attributed to the dramatic increasement in open-circuit voltage (V OC ) and fill factor (FF), leading to an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the passivated devices of over 23%. The photocurrent density (Jsc) of the target devices show negligible differences to the control devices, which is in agreement with the comparable incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) and integrated photocurrent density shown in Fig.3b. The champion performance with and without CMAI treatment is summarized in Table1and illustrated in Fig.3c. The best PCE with CMAI (IPA) treatment is 23.77% with a Jsc of 25.76 mA/cm 2 , a V OC of 1.145 V, and a FF of 0.806. The CMAI (CF) treated champion device shows a PCE of 23.94%, with a Jsc of 25.75 mA/cm 2 , a V OC of 1.149 V, and a FF of 0.809, with reduced hysteresis. The stabilized power output of the champion devices was analysed by maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under ambient air with relevant humidity of 30%. The stabilized PCE of both passivated devices exhibit over 23.5% after 10 min aging and the control device is at 21.0%. In addition, as shown in Fig.S9, the statistics of photovoltaic parameters distribution (20 devices for each condition) shows good reproducibility upon CMAI treatment. It is worth noticing that as shown in Table

Suppressed Ion Migration in Low-Dimensional Perovskites
Ion migration, which occurs in regular three-dimensional perovskites, is shown to be suppressed in low-dimensional perovskites both in the dark and under illumination, an indication of better stability of these materials for solar cells and light-emitting diodes. O rganic-inorganic hybrid perovskites are gaining increasing attention in the optoelectronic fields for their applications in solar cells, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and radiation detectors. 1 However, the intrinsic stability of regular three-dimensional (3D) perovskites such as CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 is limited by the very small formation enthalpy of -0.05 eV, 2 which hinders their applications in the real world. Low-dimensional perovskite materials have been shown to possess much larger formation energy and exhibit enhanced ambient stability.  3, 4  The efficiencies of two-dimensional (2D) perovskite solar cells were lower than 5% at the earlier stage of research because of the low mobility of charges for transporting between the sheets crossing the thicker organic spacing ligand.  3, 4  Recently, a breakthrough has been made by aligning the crystallographic planes of the inorganic perovskite component to be vertical to the substrates using a hot-casting method, which increased the efficiency of the layered perovskite solar cells to 12.5%. 5 A higher efficiency of 15.3% by increasing the layer (n) values in low-dimensional perovskites has been reported.  2  One issue arising with the quantum confinement effect of the lowdimensional perovskites is that the exciton binding energy is far beyond the thermal activation energy at room temperature. It was proposed that the layer-edge-states (LES) with lower band gap contribute to the dissociation of excitons into free-carriers in Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with n > 2.  6
Recent studies show the improved ambient stability and thermal stability of the low-dimensional perovskite films, while there is no study yet on the ion migration stability in these materials, which represents a big concern for the 3D perovskites for solar cell applications.  7  The low-dimensional perovskites have been employed in field-effect transistors  8  and in light-emitting devices.  9, 10  These devices generally operate under large applied electric field and thus need an even much lower ion migration rate for a reasonable stability. In this Energy Express, we investigate the ion migration stability in the Ruddlesden-Popper type low-dimensional perovskites by measuring the ion conductivity and ion migration activation energy. The crystal structure of 2D perovskites (BA) 2 (MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 (n = 4) used in this study is shown in the Abstract graphic; these perovskites have been reported to yield the highest efficiency among 2D perovskites with the layer (n) values less than six. The anionic inorganic layers are separated from one another by the organic n-butylammonium (BA) spacer cations. These layered structures stack together to form 2D perovskites. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern is shown in Figure  1a . Three diffraction peaks at 14.20°, 28.48°, and 43.28°a re indexed to be (1̅ 11̅ ), (202), and (313) crystallographic planes, respectively.  5  The optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra of perovskite films are shown in Figure  1b . The PL peak position gives an optical band gap of 1.70 eV. No obvious excitonic absorption peak was observed, indicating that the excitons are almost ionized into free carriers at room temperature by the presence of the LES in (BA) 2 (MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 .  6  The top-view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images are shown in Figure  1c . The pinhole-free films formed by regular hot-casting method without antisolvent. The activation energy of ionic conductivity can quantitatively characterize the rate of ion migration, which can be extracted from the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity by the Nernst-Einstein relation: σ(T) = (σ 0 /T) exp(-E a /KT), where k is the Boltzmann constant, σ 0 a constant, and T temperature. The device geometry for conductivity measurement is shown in Figure  1d . The temperature-dependent conductivity was measured in the dark and under 0.25 sun illumination for both 3D CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 and 2D (BA) 2 (MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 films (Figure  1e, f ). The conductivity in the low-temperature region is mainly ascribed to electronic conduction, because ion migration is suppressed. For the 3D CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 film, when temperature is increased to 260 K, ionic conductivity begins to dominate total conductivity. The activation energy for ion conduction was fitted to be 0.19 eV in the dark and reduced to 0.03 eV under 0.25 sun illumination. The large activation of 0.19 eV is assigned to ion migration, and small activation of 0.03 eV agrees well with previous reports.  11  The transition temperature for electronic-to ion migration-dominated conduction was also reduced from 260 K in the dark to 240 K under illumination. It should be noted that the activation energy of ion migration in 3D CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 is sensitive to the grain size and crystallinity of the 3D CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 grains and can vary depending on the fabrication process. For 2D (BA) 2 (MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 films, we did not observe such a transition process from electronic to ionic conductivity when the temperature was increased to 330 K for the films both in the dark and under illumination. A constant slope was observed with an activation energy of 41 ± 7 meV, which should be in the range for electronic conduction. This result well confirms the suppression of ion migration up to 330 K in 2D perovskite films. We believe that organic spacing layers in 2D perovskites should cause the absence of notable ion migration, while it is not clear yet whether there is contribution from the special geometry of grain boundaries in 2D perovskite films. The absence of obvious ion migration in 2D perovskites should impact the device efficiency and stability. The ion migration-related phenomena, including photocurrent hysteresis, such as switchable photovoltaics,  11  photoinduced poling effect,  12  light-induced phase separation,  13  giant dielectric constant,  14  and self-healing, 15 will be unlikely to occur. It will also alleviate the ion migration-related degradation process. The ion migration in 3D perovskite devices can accelerate the decomposition of perovskite films, create defects as nonradiative recombination centers, and cause degradation of charge transport layers and corrosion of metal electrodes. Apart from the enhanced moisture resistance introduced by the hydrophobicity of the long BA cation chain, we speculate that the moisture and oxygen ingression in low-dimensional perovskite films may be also suppressed because of the suppression, which contributes to the enhancement of stability of the devices based on these materials.

High-Performance Flexible All-Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells with Reduced V OC -Deficit in Wide-Bandgap Subcell

Introduction Metal halide perovskite materials have attracted enormous attention from both the academic and industrial communities due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. After a decade of intensive research, the best certified efficiency of a single-junction perovskite solar cell (PSC) has already reached 25.7%.  [1]  In addition, the broadly tunable bandgaps (≈1.17-3.10 eV) of perovskites make them ideal materials for constructing tandem solar cells (TSCs), which is a feasible approach to exceed the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit for single-junction solar cells.  [2]  The past 5 years have witnessed a rapid advance in perovskite-based TSCs, surpassing the highest efficiency of single-junction building blocks.  [3]  For instance, monolithic perovskite/Si TSCs have achieved a certified power conversion Among various types of perovskite-based tandem solar cells (TSCs), all-perovskite TSCs are of particular attractiveness for building-and vehicle-integrated photovoltaics, or space energy areas as they can be fabricated on flexible and lightweight substrates with a very high power-to-weight ratio. However, the efficiency of flexible all-perovskite tandems is lagging far behind their rigid counterparts primarily due to the challenges in developing efficient widebandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells on the flexible substrates as well as their low open-circuit voltage (V OC ). Here, it is reported that the use of self-assembled monolayers as hole-selective contact effectively suppresses the interfacial recombination and allows the subsequent uniform growth of a 1.77 eV WBG perovskite with superior optoelectronic quality. In addition, a postdeposition treatment with 2-thiopheneethylammonium chloride is employed to further suppress the bulk and interfacial recombination, boosting the V OC of the WBG top cell to 1.29 V. Based on this, the first proof-of-concept four-terminal all-perovskite flexible TSC with a power conversion efficiency of 22.6% is presented. When integrating into two-terminal flexible tandems, 23.8% flexible all-perovskite TSCs with a superior V OC of 2.1 V is achieved, which is on par with the V OC reported on the 28% all-perovskite tandems grown on the rigid substrate. 
 (2 of 12) efficiency (PCE) of 31.3%, and perovskite-based thin-film TSCs, such as perovskite/organic, perovskite/copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), and perovskite/perovskite (all-perovskite) tandem solar cells (TSCs) also reached certified efficiencies of 23.4%, 24.2%, and 28%, respectively.  [1, 4]  Among these perovskite-based tandem technologies, all-perovskite TSCs are of particular interest as they could be deposited on flexible and lightweight substrates using low-temperature solution processing methods (such as slot-die coating, inkjet printing, etc.), which are compatible with high throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing, and thus promises very low manufacturing cost and low carbon footprint.  [5]  However, there are two major challenges that need to be overcome to realize efficient all-perovskite solar cells on flexible substrates. First, the uniform deposition of functional layers onto the flexible substrates is more challenging than on the rigid glass due to the generally rougher surface and inferior mechanical robustness of flexible substrates. Up to now, there are only two reports on flexible all-perovskite TSCs which yielded 21.3% and 24.4% (certified) efficiency, respectively, much lower than the best value of an all-perovskite TSC (28%) reported on a rigid glass substrate.  [4, 6, 7]  Another major challenge is the notable loss in open-circuit voltage (V OC ) in the widebandgap (WBG) PSCs, which largely limits the progress of allperovskite TSCs.  [8]  The large V OC -deficit (defined as E g /q-V OC ) in WBG PSCs is commonly attributed to the relatively low initial radiative efficiency of the cells due to the high defect densities within the perovskite absorber layer and at the perovskite/charge selective layer interface. Over the past years, many approaches, including compositional engineering,  [9] [10] [11] [12]  additive engineering,  [13] [14] [15]  interfacial engineering,  [16] [17] [18]  and mixed-dimensional engineering,  [19] [20] [21] [22]  have been explored and the V OC -deficit has been reduced to values as low as 0.37 V in PSCs with bandgap (≈1.72 eV) suitable for perovskite-Si tandems.  [23]  However, extending these strategies to mitigate the V OC -deficit in perovskites with even wider bandgaps (≈1.80 eV) that are required for two-terminal (2T) all-perovskite tandems remains very challenging. This manifests as the relatively large V OC -deficit of ≈550 mV in WBG perovskite subcell used in the recently reported 26.4% monolithic all-perovskite TSCs.  [24]  Here, we report a V OC -deficit of merely 480 mV in nearinfrared (NIR) transparent WBG PSCs grown on flexible polymer foil by simultaneously reducing the V OC losses in perovskite bulk and at charge selective layer/perovskite heterojunctions. By replacing the conventional hole transport layer (HTL) poly-triarylamine (PTAA) with [2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl] phosphonic acid (2PACz),  [25]  the perovskite absorber deposited on a flexible polymer foil shows better optoelectronic quality and uniformity, translating to ≈40 mV gain in V OC for flexible NIR-transparent PSCs. Further passivating the perovskite with a postdeposition treatment (PDT) with 2-thiopheneethylammonium chloride (TEACl), the V OC of the flexible devices was improved by ≈100 mV. With optimized TEACl PDT, we achieved a maximum efficiency of over 15% with a V OC of 1.29 V for a flexible NIR-transparent WBG PSC with a 1.77 eV bandgap, corresponding to a low V OC -deficit of 480 mV. To the best of our knowledge, this is the lowest V OC -deficit that has been achieved with a bandgap of ≈1.80 eV on both rigid and flexible substrates. Combined with a flexible narrow bandgap (NBG) PSC, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept four-terminal (4T) TSC with a best PCE of 22.6%. Furthermore, we also achieved an all-perovskite 2T TSC with a remarkable V OC of 2.1 V and a PCE of 23.8%. We note that this is the highest V OC for 2T flexible allperovskite TSCs reported so far, demonstrating a further step toward achieving high-performance lightweight TSCs with a reduced V OC -deficit. 
 Results and Discussion The reference WBG PSC in our study was based on PTAA as HTL on the rigid substrates as well as flexible substrates, however, the device is clearly limited by its low V OC of ≈1.15 V. To mitigate the severe V OC losses, we first tried to improve the hole-selective contact. To this end, we employed the self-assembled monolayer 2PACz as HTL which has been successfully employed in several recent studies to reduce surface recombination on the rigid indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate.  [25, 26]  A schematic of our final device stack is shown in Figure  1A , where the PDT of the perovskite surface with TEACl is illustrated as well. Figure  1B  shows the photograph of the multilayer flexible NIR-transparent WBG PSC. Consistent with previous studies, we found that 2PACz delivers a higher V OC (≈40 mV) and has better overall device performance than PTAA on the rigid ITO patterned glass substrates (Figure  S1 , Supporting Information). However, when we replace the glass substrates with ITO patterned polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrates, the devices using 2PACz as HTL show a large spread in photovoltaic performance (Figure  S2 , Supporting Information). In contrast, for PTAA-based devices, no difference is observed in terms of the spread of the PV parameters, which indicates the uniform deposition of PTAA on both rigid and flexible substrates. This result suggests that the deposition of 2PACz on PEN/ITO is not as uniform as that on glass/ITO, which might be due to poor anchoring of 2PACz on the relatively rough PEN/ITO surface (Figure  S3 , Supporting Information). To ensure complete coverage of 2PACz 
 (3 of 12) on the ITO surface, we modified the deposition protocol of 2PACz by resting the 2PACz solution on the substrates for 60 s before starting the spinning and repeated this process twice to ensure good uniformity. Quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) maps calculated from photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) measurements for different stack layers (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information), show that the introduction of 2PACz between ITO and perovskite leads to a higher QFLS value, which corresponds to a higher V OC potential and suggests that 2PACz monolayer is more suitable than PTAA for achieving a lower V OC loss in the WBG PSCs.  [27]  We performed the cross-sectional high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging as well as the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping. As shown in Figure  1C , based on these measurements, we can estimate the thickness of the spin-coated WBG perovskite, PCBM and ZnO to be around 500, 35, and 25 nm, respectively, while the 2PACz is not visible   S1  (Supporting Information).

 (4 of 12) at this magnification. The dashed rectangular area highlights the uniform film formation of PCBM and ZnO layers, which can also be distinguished by the signals of C and Zn in the EDX mapping. Here, chloroform (CF) was used as the solvent for the PCBM instead of commonly employed chlorobenzene (CB), as we observed a nonuniform deposition of the PCBM layer with CB. The analogous HAADF-STEM image and EDX mapping results for the cross-section of the device based on CB-processed PCBM are shown in Figure  S5  (Supporting Information). A thick PCBM layer was obtained with CF as a solvent while CB-processed PCBM is mostly thinner with a poor coverage. A possible explanation could be that CF exhibits a much lower boiling point (61.2 °C) than that of the CB (131.0 °C), which contributes to much faster evaporation during the fast spin-coating and forms a thicker and smoother PCBM layer.  [28]  Importantly, the better PV performance in case of the CF-processed PCBM is consistent with the improved morphology of the PCBM layer (Figure  S6 , Supporting Information). After the optimization of both the HTL and the ETL, we now targeted a reduction of interfacial recombination losses between these transport layers and the perovskite by means of surface passivation. In this regard, 2D perovskites are known to be very effective at reducing the interfacial recombination losses and to improve the performance of PSCs.  [29]  To form a 2D perovskite on top of our 1.77 eV perovskite, we implemented the molecule TEACl, which has been previously used to create a 2D perovskite on top of a 1.68 eV perovskite.  [22]  Briefly, the TEACl PDT is performed by directly spin-coating TEACl solution onto the perovskite film, followed by a short annealing to dry the film (100 °C for 3 min). To optimize the performance, we varied the concertation of the molecule in an isopropanol solution and found that the PV performance of the devices was strongly affected, especially the V OC and the short-circuit current density (J SC ). The box charts of the PV parameters extracted from reverse scan of J-V curves are presented in Figure  S7  (Supporting Information). As shown in Figure  S7A  (Supporting Information), an ≈100 mV V OC improvement is observed for all the post-treated devices, indicating that TEACl PDT, regardless of the concentration, can effectively mitigate certain nonradiative pathways. Moreover, the J SC of the device increased significantly with an increasing concentration of TEACl PDT of up to 0.5 mg mL -1 , and then gradually decreased at higher concentrations (>0.5 mg mL -1 , Figure  S7B , Supporting Information). This change of the J SC is confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements, as shown in Figure  S8  (Supporting Information). Overall, 0.5 mg mL -1 of TEACl PDT effectively increases the PCE of the flexible NIR-transparent WBG PSC, mainly due to the largely improved V OC . As the J-V curves shown in Figure  1D , the best PCE from this group (hereafter referred to as PDT) is 15.1%, with a V OC of 1.29 V, a J SC of 15.0 mA cm -2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 77.9%, while the best device without TEACl PDT (hereafter referred to as reference) has an efficiency of 13.1%, with a V OC of 1.191 V, a J SC of 14.6 mA cm -2 , and a FF of 75.4% from the reverse scan. It is worth to note that the device from the PDT group show a negligible hysteresis while for the reference device the hysteresis factor is 4.6%. The relatively large hysteresis for the reference device is mainly due to the large FF difference from the reverse and forward scans (75.4% vs 72.6%). The much reduced FF difference of the PDT device (77.9% vs 77.8%) can be attributed to an improved charge transportation between perovskite and PCBM due to the insert of TEACl. The dark current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics are provided in Figure  S9  (Supporting Information). The superior V OC of 1.29 V for the PDT device is the highest value reported so far for a perovskite bandgap around 1.80 eV. The steady-state power output at the maximum power point (MPP) of the reference and PDT devices, shown in Figure  S10  (Supporting Information), is consistent with the results from J-V scans. With light-intensity dependent V OC measurements (Figure  S11 , Supporting Information), we extracted a smaller diode ideality factor n = 1.25 for the PDT device than that of the reference device (n = 1.45), which suggests a better diode quality and less nonradiative recombination for the device after a TEACl PDT.  [30]  In addition to the enhanced PV performance, the optimized device also shows good NIR-transparency. Figure  1E  shows the transmittance and reflectance spectra of the PDT device. The average visible transmittance of our flexible NIR-transparent device has been calculated to be 4.6%.  [31]  The full device demonstrates a high transmittance in the range of ≈720-880 nm (>80%) and ≈880-1100 nm (>70%), suggesting its great potential in the application of TSCs. Compared with previously reported V OC values of WBG (≈1.80 eV) PSCs used in all-perovskite TSCs, our flexible and NIR-transparent device delivers the highest V OC and the lowest V OC -deficit as shown in Figure  1F ; and Table  S2  (Supporting Information). We also checked the thermal and light-soaking stability of the encapsulated reference and PDT devices (see the Experimental Section for more details) as shown in Figure  S12  (Supporting Information). For the thermal stability test performed at 60 °C in ambient air, the PDT device retained ≈92% of its initial PCE after 265 h of thermal stressing, whereas the reference device only kept ≈82% after same period of testing. With continuous maximum power point tracking (MPPT), we observed that the PDT device could maintain ≈80% of its initial efficiency after ≈195 h, while the reference showed much faster degradation (T80: ≈9 h). These results clearly show that TEACl PDT not only helps to stabilize the device at a relatively high temperature, but also significantly improves the photostability of the device under light-soaking condition. To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of TEACl PDT on the performance of our WBG PSCs, we performed a detailed study on the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite films and devices with various concentration of TEACl. From the absorption spectra and Tauc plots (Figure  S13 , Supporting Information), an identical bandgap (≈1.77 eV) was obtained from perovskite films with and without 0.5 mg mL -1 TEACl PDT due to the negligible contribution of the surface layer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images indicate a negligible effect of the PDT on the perovskite domain sizes. But at high TEACl concentrations (1.5 and 2 mg mL -1 ), some black areas are observed on top of the perovskite films (Figure  S14 , Supporting Information), which indicates that there are regions of different work function. These could be an accumulation of unreacted TEACl molecules on the surface. From atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization, we found that the TEACl PDT tends to result in a rougher perovskite surface (Figure  S15 , Supporting Information). The rougher perovskite surface could 
 (5 of 12) be a result of recrystallization upon the TEACl PDT. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure  S16 , Supporting Information) show the formation of a diffraction peak at ≈5.6° with an increased concentration of TEACl, accompanied by a gradually suppressed PbI 2 peak (12.6°) intensity. The emerging peak at 5.6° could be assigned to 2D phases TEA 2 PbI 4, TEA 2 PbI 2 Br 2 , or TEA 2 PbI 2 Cl 2 according to a previous report.  [22]  Therefore, we anticipate that a low dimensional phase is formed. However, based on XRD we are unable to identify which component(s) of the 3D perovskites is incorporated in that surface layer. Additional information is gained by analyzing the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite films with TEACl PDT. We observe a PL emission peak at around 550 nm in the perovskite film with 3 mg mL -1 TEACl PDT, suggesting that the 2D phase should be TEA 2 PbI 4 (Figure  S17 , Supporting Information).  [22]  It should be noted that the perovskite films with 0.5 or 2 mg mL -1 TEACl PDT show no detectable PL peak at 550 nm, most likely due to the relatively low quantity of the 2D perovskite phase on the surface of the 3D perovskite. To elucidate the effect of the TEACl concentration on the perovskite's surface chemistry and electronic band structure, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements for the reference and TEACl PDT perovskite films. The S 2p and Cl 2p features were only found in perovskite films post-treated with TEACl, suggesting the presence of TEA + and Cl -on the perovskite surface. Interestingly, in addition to the main S 2p signal at 164 eV, a second small signal is observed at a higher binding energy. Similar observations have been previously reported for adsorbed thiophene derivatives on metal surfaces.  [32, 33]  Consequently, it is possible that   A-C ) XPS results for the reference and TEACl PDT perovskite films for the S 2p, Cl 2p, and N 1s energy ranges, respectively.

 (6 of 12) the additional strongly shifted sulfur core level signal originates from different environments of the TEA + molecules in contrast to TEA + molecules interacting with Pb atoms. Due to the expected loss in electron density at the sulfur, the feature at higher binding energies is assigned to the latter chemical state. Moreover, in Figure  2C , in case of the reference sample, we observe a single feature at ≈401 eV for the reference perovskite film, similar to previous reports on the N 1s peak from FA + .  [34]  With the TEACl PDT sample, an additional N 1s signal emerged at higher binding energies, which can be associated with TEA + . Concurrently, the intensity for N 1s signal from FA + is significantly weakened. This could be due to a coexistence of FA + and TEA + as well as the formation of a TEA + rich surface layer, effectively attenuating the underlying FA + signal. Based on the atomic ratios of the N 1s features relative to the Pb 4f features (Figure  S18 , Supporting Information), a semiquantitative analysis of A-site cations relative to Pb located on the perovskite surface was performed. The results are summarized in Figure  2D , and indicate the gradual decrease of the FA + concentration with increasing concentration of TEACl PDT. Most notably, for TEACl concentrations higher than 0.5 mg mL -1 , an excess of A-site cations compared to Pb is observed. This is necessary for the formation of the proposed TEA 2 PbI 4 , and consistent with the emerging peak for the 2D phase in XRD patterns (Figure  S16 , Supporting Information) above the same threshold.  [35]  Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy (REELS) were used to investigate the effect of TEACl PDT on the surface electronic structures of the perovskite films. As shown in Figure  2E , with increased TEACl concentration, the FA-related density of states (DOS) feature is declining; while a new feature emerges that can be associated with the DOS of TEA. Similarly, in the REELS spectra in Figure  2F , a TEA-related feature emerges. The change in the observed DOS is consistent with the findings from XPS that the TEA + is likely accumulating at the surface and the signal from FA + is thus weakened. With the cut-off energies and onsets from UPS and REELS data, the energy level of the valence bands (VBs) of the perovskite films as well as the surface bandgap energies can be extracted, respectively,   S20 , Supporting Information) as determined in the perovskite film with TEACl PDT. These elements serve as markers for the TEA + and Cl -moiety of the TEACl reagent.

Pero, HTL, ETL, and pin-stack refer to neat perovskite, ITO/2PACz/perovskite, perovskite/PCBM, ITO/2PACz/perovskite/PCBM, respectively. V OC values are obtained from J-V measurements of the corresponding devices. 
 (7 of 12) by using linear extrapolation. The determined energy level diagrams of the perovskite film surface are presented in Figure  2G . In particular, we observe a change in surface bandgap by REELS from 1.86 eV (reference) to 2.43 eV (2 mg mL -1 TEACl PDT), whereby the latter value is in good agreement with optical measurements for bulk TEA 2 PbI 4 , which has a reported bandgap of 2.33 eV.  [22]  The modification of the surface band structure of the perovskite with the 2D phase is likely beneficial to suppress the charge recombination at the interface between the perovskite and electron transport layer. To gain a better understanding on whether the TEACl stays only on the perovskite film surface or there is any diffusion to the bulk, we performed XPS depth profiling for the perovskite film with the TEACl PDT. As evident from Figure  3A , the sulfur, which is exclusively found in the TEA + moiety, was only detected within the near surface area of the film and the signal quickly vanished with sputtering, indicating there is no TEA present in the bulk. In contrast to this, the Cl was detected not only at the perovskite surface but also found throughout the perovskite film. To confirm this observation, we further performed time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) depth profiling, which has a higher sensitivity than XPS for small amounts of different elements. As shown in Figure  3B , the S -signal shows again a sharp decay at the surface, while Cl -has diffused into the bulk of the perovskite, fully consistent with the XPS depth profiling results (Figure  3A ; and Figure  S21 , Supporting Information). We therefore can conclude that the TEA + moiety, represented by the S element, is confined to the surface where it likely forms a 2D perovskite phase on top of the perovskite film. While the majority of the Cl seems to stay on the surface as well, some diffuse throughout the perovskite film and might lead to an improvement of the quality of the bulk perovskite.  [36, 37]  Having clarified the effect of the TEACl treatment on the composition and electronic structure of the perovskite film, it is of interest to gain insight into the influence of TEACl PDT on the recombination kinetics of the perovskite films. Therefore, we measured the steady-state PL and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) for the perovskite films with and without 0.5 mg mL -1 TEACl PDT. As shown in Figure  3C , the perovskite film with PDT showed a much stronger PL emission than the reference one, manifesting an effective defect passivation effect with TEACl. The TRPL results in Figure  3D  further confirmed this since the fitted effective carrier lifetime for the PDT film was 474 ns, which presents a significant increase compared to 278 ns for the reference film. This strongly indicates a reduced nonradiative recombination for the perovskite film with TEACl PDT. The improved carrier lifetime indicates that the TEA + moiety at the surface is likely to be effective in suppressing the defective states at the perovskite surface.  [38]  For Cl, both surface and bulk passivation are possible, considering the extended diffusion of Cl into the layer and its well-reported passivation effect.  [39]  In addition, absolute PL measurements for different stack layers were carried out to break down the effect of the TEACl PDT on the V OC improvement. As shown in Figure  3E , we see that TEACl PDT improves the QFLS for all the stacks, both partial and full. The perovskite grown on the PEN foil exhibits a QFLS value of 1.34 V. After the TEACl PDT, the QFLS increases to 1.39 eV, consistent with the suppression of nonradiative recombination on the perovskite surface. However, for the partial cell stacks with both the HTL (2PACz), and the ETL (PCBM) present, the QFLS values are much lower than the bare perovskite layer on glass, indicating that both the interfaces limit the V OC , in particular, the perovskite/PCBM interface imposes the biggest QFLS deficit in both the reference and the PDT sample, which is also consistent with the fact that the QFLS of the pin-stack with both transport layers present is nearly identical to the QFLS of the perovskite/ETL stack. Clearly, the PDT is very effective at reducing the recombination induced by the ETL layer which leads to the enhanced V OC .  [40]  Moreover, Figure  3E  shows that there is a significant difference between the QFLS value of the reference pin sample and the V OC of the complete device. This behavior can for example be explained by an internal bending of the electron quasi-Fermi level, which affects primarily the V OC of the complete device rather than the QFLS in the perovskite layer. Considering that the internal QFLS value is significantly higher than the external V OC in the reference device, an energy misalignment between the perovskite and PCBM layer is suggested. With the application of the TEACl PDT, the QFLS-V OC difference is strongly reduced, which suggests an improved energy alignment between the perovskite and PCBM.  [41]  Finally, to demonstrate the potential of the flexible NIRtransparent WBG PSCs, we integrate them into flexible allperovskite TSCs in both 4T and 2T configurations. Figure  4A  shows the schematics of a 4T tandem device structure. NBG PSC used in 4T tandems is based on an architecture of PEN/ ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(FASnI 3 ) 0.6 (MAPbI 3 ) 0.4 /C 60 /BCP/Cu and it shows a PCE of 18.2%. An overall tandem PCE of 22.6% (15.1% from the top cell plus 7.5% from the filtered bottom cell) has been achieved. The J-V curves of the 4T tandem are shown in Figure  4B  with detailed PV parameters summarized in Table  S3  (Supporting Information), and the MPP tracking efficiency of the 4T tandem is shown in Figure  S22  (Supporting Information). The corresponding EQE spectra are also depicted in Figure  4C  with integrated J SC values inserted. Notably, we report the best efficiencies for both the 1.24 and 1.77 eV bandgap single-junction flexible PSCs as compared in Figure  S23  (Supporting Information). To go one step further, we also fabricated 2T all-perovskite flexible TSCs. Figure  4D  shows a SEM image for the cross-section of our 2T flexible tandem device. The top cell and bottom cell are connected using atomic-layerdeposited SnO 2 and sputtered ITO. Figure  4E  presents the J-V curve of our best-performing 2T flexible TSC (0.09 cm 2 ). Benefiting from the significantly suppressed V OC -deficit with TEACl PDT for the WBG subcell, a high V OC of 2.1 V has been achieved in the 2T all-perovskite flexible TSC with a J SC of 15.1 mA cm -2 , a FF of 75.1% and a PCE of 23.8%. The steady-state power output of the 2T device shown in Figure  S24  (Supporting Information), is consistent with the J-V efficiency. We have also cross-checked the J-V performance of the 2T device at EPFL PV-lab as shown in Figure  S25  (Supporting Information). Notably, the V OC of 2.1 V of our flexible 2T TSC is higher than the V OC of the best performing rigid tandem (2.03 V) and flexible (2.0 V) tandem devices reported to date.  [7, 24]  The corresponding EQE spectra for the 2T tandem device are measured and shown in Figure  4F  with integrated J SC values 
 (8 of 12) of top and bottom cells inserted. The efficiency and V OC progress for all-perovskite TSCs are summarized in Figure  4G, H , with detailed PV parameters summarized in Tables  S4  and S5 , respectively. In conclusion, in this work we presented a multifaceted optimization approach of different device components. First, we used 2PACz as a hole transport layer for a 1.77 eV triple-cation perovskite device to effectively suppress the V OC loss at the HTL/ perovskite interface and to enable the subsequent processing of high-quality uniform perovskite absorber layers on flexible ITOpatterned polymer foils. After that, we optimized the deposition of the PCBM transport layer by changing the solvent to ensure a good morphology. We then employed a TEACl PDT which forms a 2D perovskite on the perovskite surface to mitigate the decisive interfacial recombination loss at the electro-selective interface, optimize the band alignment between the perovskite/ PCBM interface and lead to a reduced nonradiative recombination at the perovskite surface. Combining these optimization strategies, we achieved a high V OC of 1.29 V and 15.1%-efficient NIR-transparent WBG (1.77 eV) PSCs grown on flexible substrates. The high V OC corresponds to a record low V OC -deficit of 480 mV for perovskite with a bandgap around 1.80 eV. In conjunction with flexible NBG (1.24 eV) PSCs, we achieved a PCE of 22.6% and 23.8% for flexible all-perovskite TSCs in 4T and 2T configurations, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated the highest V OC of 2.1 V for flexible 2T all-perovskite tandem cells. As such, this work demonstrates how to achieve highperformance flexible TSCs by overcoming the large V OC -deficit in WBG subcell through a sequential reduction of nonradiative bulk, surface and interface recombination losses. The high efficiency of our flexible tandem devices approaches to the best efficiencies for rigid ones and represents a significant step toward the commercialization of flexible and lightweight allperovskite TSCs.

TEACl was synthesized according to a previous work.  [22]  Films Preparation: 1.2 m Cs 0.12 FA 0.8 MA 0.08 PbI 1.8 Br 1.2 Precursors were prepared by dissolving MABr (21.50 mg), CsI (74.83 mg), FABr (95.98 mg), FAI (198.11 mg), PbBr 2 (352.33 mg), and PbI 2 (663.85 mg) into a mixed solvent of DMF (1600 µL) and DMSO (400 µL). Before perovskite film spin-coating, the precursor solution was filtered with 0.22 um hydrophobic PTFE filters. The samples for top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), photoluminescence (PL), and time-resolved PL (TRPL), photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), time-of-flight secondary ionic mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) were performed with perovskite films on cleaned PEN/ITO substrates followed by different concentration of TEACl PDT. Samples for optical absorption spectrum measurements were performed with perovskite films and corresponding TEACl PDTs on white glasses. Device Fabrication for WBG PSC: Prepatterned PEN/ITO substrates were first fixed onto rigid substrates with UV epoxy and then cleaned with ethanol and dried with N 2 flow. Before device fabrication, the substrates were further cleaned by UV/Ozone treatment (Jelight Company Inc.) for 30 min. 2PACz precursor (0.3 mg mL -1 in ethanol, preheated at 55 °C) was spin-coated onto the cleaned ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s after 1 min resting on the substrate. The same spin-coating step is performed twice to ensure a full coverage of 2PACz on the substrate, followed by an annealing at 100 °C for 5 min to remove the solvent. As a comparison, PTAA (5 mg mL -1 in CB) was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate at 5000 rpm for 30 s, followed by an annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling, perovskite solution was spin-coated onto the substrate by a two-step spin-coating. The first step is 2000 rpm for 10 s with a ramp-up of 200 rpm s -1 . The second step is 6000 rpm for 40 s with a ramp-up of 2000 rpm s -1 . Diethyl ether (300 µL) was dropped onto the spinning substrate at the 20 s of the second step. The substrate was then annealed at 60 °C for 2 min and 100 °C for 7 min. TEACl PDTs were carried out by dissolving TEACl in IPA with varied concentration (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 mg mL -1 ) and spin-coating onto the perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by an annealing at 100 °C for 3 min. After cooling, PCBM in CB or CF was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 50 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Thereafter, ZnO nanoparticles was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 50 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 1 min. The substrates were then transferred to sputter chamber for the deposition of IZO electrode at a pulsed DC power of 200 W. For the comparison of 2PACz and PTAA as hole transport layer, a device configuration of glass/ITO/PTAA or 2PACz/Cs 0.12 FA 0.8 MA 0.08 PbI 1.8 Br 1.2 /C 60 /BCP/Cu was adopted. After the perovskite deposition, the samples were transferred into vacuum chamber for the thermal evaporation of C 60 (20 nm) and BCP (7 nm) layers, finished by evaporation of Cu (100 nm). For each substrate there are four devices. The designed contact area of each device is 0.1024 cm  2  . The illuminated area of the device was defined with a patterned mask (0.09 cm 2 ). All spin-coating was carried out in N 2 -filled glove box. Device Fabrication for NBG PSC: The prepatterned PEN/ITO substrates were first fixed onto rigid substrates with UV epoxy and then cleaned with ethanol and dried with N 2 flow. Before device fabrication, the substrates were further cleaned by UV/Ozone treatment (Jelight Company Inc.) for 30 min. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the cleaned substrate at 4000 rpm for 50s and then annealed at 120 °C for 20 min. Then the substrates were transferred into N 2 -filled glove box. (FASnI 3 ) 0.6 (MAPbI 3 ) 0.4 perovskite precursor was prepared as reported in previous work.  [42]  The FASnI 3 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 372 mg SnI 2 , 172 mg FAI, and 7.84 mg SnF 2 in 424 µL DMF and 212 µL DMSO. The MAPbI 3 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 461 mg PbI 2 and 159 mg MAI, and 11.3 mg Pb(SCN) 2 ) in 630 µL DMF and 70 µL DMSO. Before mixing, the precursors were filtered with 0.22 um hydrophobic PTFE filters. Then stoichiometric amounts of FASnI 3 and MAPbI 3 perovskite precursors were mixed to obtain the (FASnI 3 ) 0.6 (MAPbI 3 ) 0.4 precursor solution. The perovskite solution was spin-coated onto the substrate by a two-step spin-coating. The first step is 1000 rpm for 10 s with a ramp-up of 1000 rpm s -1 . The second step is 5000 rpm for 50 s with a ramp-up of 10 000 rpm s -1 . Diethyl ether (700 µL) was dropped onto the spinning substrate at the 5 s of the second step. The substrate was then annealed at 65°C for 3 min and 105 °C for 7 min. After the perovskite deposition, the samples were transferred into vacuum chamber for the thermal evaporation of C 60 (20 nm) and BCP (7 nm) layers, finished by evaporation of Cu (100 nm). The samples were then encapsulated with cavity glasses and UV epoxy. Device Fabrication for 2T Tandem: All the procedures are the same for the WBG subcell until PCBM deposition is finished. The substrates were then transferred to ALD chamber for SnO 2 deposition (≈20 nm) at relative low temperature (100 °C) by periodic pulse of tetrakis(dimethylamino) tin(IV) (99.9999%, Nanjing Ai Mou Yuan Scientific Equipment Co., Ltd) and deionized water. After ALD-SnO 2 deposition, the substrates were transferred to the magnetron sputtering system to sputter 100 nm ITO at a 30 W power under an Ar pressure of 0.4 Pa. Then, PEDOT:PSS diluted with IPA (volume ratio 1:1) was spincoated onto the sputtered ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 50 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 5 min in air. Next several steps to fabricate 2T tandem devices were consistent with those of fabrication of NBG PSCs. Film Characterization: The SEM images were taken with Hitachi S-4800 Scanning Electron Microscope using 5-10 kV acceleration voltage. The XRD patterns were measured on an X″Pert Pro (PANanalytical) in Bragg-Brentano geometry using Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), scanning from 2° to 60° (2θ) with a step interval of 0.0167°. The AFM images were obtained using an AFM microscope (Bruker ICON3) in air. A silicon nitride tip (ScanAsyst-air) with a radius of 10 nm was used as the probe. The cantilevers″ spring constant and resonant frequency were 0.4 N m -1 and 70 kHz, respectively. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) were measured using FLS980 (Edinburgh Inc.). PL measurements were conducted using a 532 nm Xenon lamp with a monochromator while TRPL measurements 
 (10 of 12) were conducted using a 375 nm picosecond pulsed laser (EPL-375). Absorption of the films were obtained by measuring reflectance and transmittance using a Shimadzu UV/Vis 3600 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. The reflectance data were corrected for the instrumental response stemming from diffuse and specular reflections both on the sample. Films thickness were measured by profilometer (AlphaStep P120). XPS Measurement: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed in a PHI Quantera system. Samples were analyzed at a pressure of 10 -9 10 -8 Torr. The monochromatic Al Kα radiation was generated from an electron beam at a power of 12.6 W and a voltage of 15 kV. To minimize beam damage during measurements, the beam spot with a diameter of 50 µm was continuously scanned over an area of 500 × 1000 µm 2 . Charge neutralization was performed using a low-energy electron source. Short-term measurements (<3 min) of the Pb 4f and C 1s core level before and after each presented measurement were conducted to rule out changes in the chemical state due to X-ray induced beam damage. The binding energy scale was reference to the main component of adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV, resulting in a typical inaccuracy of ±0.2 eV. Peak fitting of photoelectron features was performed in Casa XPS following Shirley-background subtraction using Voigt profile with GL ratios of 60. Atomic ratios were calculated using the instrument specific relative sensitivity factors. To estimate the information depth depending on the observed feature, the inelastic mean free path (IMFP) was calculated from the kinetic energy of the detected electrons based on the Tanuma, Powell, Penn formula.  [43]  For depth profiling, Al Kα radiation generated by an electron beam at a power of 50.6 W and a voltage of 15 kV was utilized. The sample was etched using a beam of 2 kV Ar + ions on an area of 2 × 2 mm 2 between each measurement. UPS Measurement: UPS measurements were performed using monochromatic UV source (VUV 5k, Scienta Omicron) at HeIα excitation (hν = 21.22 eV) in combination with a hemispherical analyzer (Specs, Phoibis 100), set at a pass energy of 2 eV. The samples were transferred under inert atmosphere and were at no point exposed to air. REELS Measurement: REELS measurements were performed with an electron excitation energy of 50 eV and a sample current of around 1 µA, using a cold cathode (BaO based) electron gun (ELG-2, Kimball). The elastically and inelastically scattered electrons were measured with the same hemispherical analyzer as employed for the UPS measurement. The angle between gun and detector is 30° and the pass energy was set to 2 eV. Absolute Photoluminescence Measurements: Excitation for the PL measurements was performed with a 520 nm CW laser (Insaneware) through an optical fiber into an integrating sphere. The intensity of the laser was adjusted to a 1 sun equivalent intensity by illuminating a 1 cm 2 size PSC under short-circuit and matching the current density to the J SC under the sun simulator (≈15 mA cm -2 at 100 mW cm -2 , or 9.4 × 10 20 photons m -2 s -1 ). A second optical fiber was used from the output of the integrating sphere to an Andor SR393iB spectrometer equipped with a silicon CCD camera (DU420A-BR-DD, iDus). The system was calibrated by using a calibrated halogen lamp with specified spectral irradiance, which was shone into to the integrating sphere. A spectral correction factor was established to match the spectral output of the detector to the calibrated spectral irradiance of the lamp. The spectral photon density was obtained from the corrected detector signal (spectral irradiance) by division through the photon energy (hf), and the photon numbers of the excitation and emission obtained from numerical integration using Matlab. PL images for Figure  S4  (Supporting Information) were recorded with Si CCD camera coupled to a liquid crystal tunable filter. The excitation source was 455 nm LED and the excitation photon flux was adjusted to 1.3 × 10 21 m -2 s -1 . The system was calibrated to yield absolute photon flux using a calibrated halogen lamp source. QFLS provides an estimate for the maximum V OC that semiconductor absorber layer can achieve in a photovoltaic cell. QFLS distribution maps are calculated from the equation QFLS qV K Tln PLQY OC SQ b ( ) = + (1) where q is elementary charge, V OC SQ is open-circuit voltage at Shockley-Queisser limit, K b is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, PLQY is photoluminescence quantum yield. The PLQY value is determined by the ratio of emitted photon flux to excited photon flux. The V OC SQ is determined by approximating the bandgap from the measured PL peak emission energy. ToF-SIMS Measurement: Element depth profiles were obtained with a time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (ToF-SIMS V system, ION-TOF). The primary beam was 25 keV Bi 3+ with a total current of 0.38 pA and a raster size of 50 × 50 µm 2 . Cs + ions were used with 1000 eV ion energy, 40 nA pulse current on a 400 × 400 µm 2 raster size to bombard and etch the film. The data were plotted with the intensity for each signal normalized to the total counts of the signal. STEM of WBG Single Junction Cell: The samples were prepared for TEM using the conventional lift-out method using a Zeiss NVision 40 dual beam FIB/SEM. The samples were then quickly transferred (<2 min) to an FEI Tecnai Osiris microscope equipped with 4 silicon drift detectors for fast EDX mapping. STEM was performed at 200 kV with a beam current of 150 pA. FIB-SEM for 2T Tandem Solar Cell: The microstructure of the perovskite device stack was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Helios NanoLab 600 DualBeam). The transfer into the FIB SEM was performed in air and the time in ambient air was <30 s. In a high vacuum (≈10e-6 mbar), a cross-section was roughly milled with an ion beam current of 0.77 nA -followed by a cleaning cut with an ion beam current of 83 pA at 30 kV. Device Characterization for Single Junction Cell: J-V characteristics were measured in four-contact mode at standard test conditions (100 mW cm -2 ) using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A solar simulator (ABA class, LOT-QuantumDesign) was calibrated to AM 1.5 G one sun illumination using a certified monocrystalline silicon solar cell (RS-ID-5, Fraunhofer-ISE, Ser. No. 114-2016). The solar cells were measured with an aperture mask with an active area of 0.09 cm 2 for each pixel. The J-V measurements were performed in reverse direction (from V OC to J SC , 100 mV s -1 ) under 25 °C enabled by a cooling system. The steady-state efficiency as a function of time was recorded using a MPP tracker, which adjusts the applied voltage to reach the maximum power point (perturb and observe algorithm). The external quantum efficiencies of the solar cells were measured with a lock-in amplifier. The probing beam was generated by a chopped white source (900 W, halogen lamp, 280 Hz) and a dual grating monochromator. The beam size was adjusted to ensure an illumination area within the cell area. The same single crystalline silicon solar cell as used in J-V characterization was used as a reference cell. White bias light was applied during the measurement with an intensity of ≈0.1 sun. For the measurement of J-V and EQE characteristics of the filtered bottom cell, flexible NIR-transparent widebandgap top cell with a large active area (1 cm 2 ) was used as a filter on top for easy cell alignment. Light-soaking stability test was done by continuous MPP tracking of the encapsulated solar cells under simulated 1 sun illumination (using white light-emitting diode (LED) solar simulator with intensity equivalent to 100 mW cm -2 ) in 600 mbar N 2 chamber. No active cooling is applied and the device temperature raised to around 38 °C during operation due to the heating effect of light illumination. The thermal stability test was done by continuously heating the encapsulated solar cells on a 60 °C hotplate in ambient atmosphere and measuring the J-V curves regularly. Light-intensity dependent V OC characteristics were measured on the Paios measurement system (Fluxim AG). Device Characterization for 2T Tandem Solar Cell: J-V characteristics were measured using the same setup as that for single junction cell. The solar simulator spectrum was measured and compared with AM1.5G irradiation spectrum in Figure  S26  (Supporting Information). The solar cells were measured with an aperture mask with an area of 0.09 cm 2 for each pixel in reverse direction. The steady-state efficiency as a function of time was recorded by fixing the bias voltage at V pm , which is extracted from J-V measurements. The cross-checking of the J-V performance 
 (11 of 12) was done in EPFL PV-lab, in-house J-V measurements were obtained using a temperature-controlled vacuum chuck at 25 °C, and a two-lamp (halogen and xenon) class AAA WACOM sun simulator with an AM 1.5 G irradiance spectrum at 1000 W m -2 . Independently certified SHJ cells were used to calibrate the solar simulator. Shadow masks were used to define the illuminated area (1.02 cm 2 ). The cells were measured with a scan rate of 100 mV s -1 (using an integration time of 0.1 s and a delay of 0.1 s for each data point, the voltage step was 0.02 V). The EQE characterizations of the 2T tandem solar cells were conducted in ambient air using an EQE setup (QE-R, Enlitech) in a near dark box. The monochromatic light ranging from 300 to 1100 nm was performed with a chopping frequency of 210 Hz, and the bias illumination from a 150 W white lamp was filtered with 550 and 850 nm optical filters for the measurement of bottom and top subcells' responses, respectively.                TEACl PDT, respectively. With > 0.5 mg mL -1 of TEACl PDT, a diffraction peak at 5.6° is emerging, which could corresponds to 2D perovskite phases TEA 2 PbI 4 , TEA 2 PbI 2 Br 2 , or TEA 2 PbI 2 Cl 2 .  [1]  The intensity of the PbI 2 peak at 12.6° gradually declines or even disappears with increasing concentration of the TEACl solution, which shows the evolution process of the reaction between TEACl and PbI 2 .

Vacuum-Deposited 2D/3D Perovskite Heterojunctions
Low-dimensional (quasi-) 2D perovskites are being extensively studied in order to enhance the stability and the open-circuit voltage of perovskite solar cells. Up to now, thin 2D perovskite layers on the surface and/ or at the grain boundaries of 3D perovskites have been deposited solely by solution processing, leading to unavoidable intermixing between the two phases. In this work, we report the fabrication of 2D/3D/2D perovskite heterostructures by dual-source vacuum deposition, with the aim of studying the interaction between the 3D and 2D phases as well as the charge transport properties of 2D perovskites in neat 2D/3D interfaces. Unlike what is normally observed in solution-processed 3D/2D systems, we found a reduced charge transport with no direct evidence of surface passivation, in spite of larger open-circuit voltage. This is likely due to a nonfavorable orientation of the 2D perovskite with respect to methylammonium lead iodide and to the formation of 2D phases with very low dimensionality (pure 2D).
O rganic-inorganic metal halide perovskites are being widely studied because of their exceptional optoelectronics properties, among others a high absorption coefficient, ambipolar charge transport, and easy-to-tune bandgap.  [1] [2] [3]  Importantly, high-quality perovskite films can be deposited through a variety of scalable methods, either from solution or in vacuum, and assembled into optoelectronic thinfilm devices.  4, 5  These properties lead to the demonstration of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25% in only 10 years of development.  6  The most widely studied perovskite compositions, such as methylammonium lead iodide (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 , MAPI), are based on the three-dimensional (3D) AMX 3 structure, where A represents a monovalent organic or inorganic cation, typically methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), or cesium (Cs + ), M is a divalent metal cation (Pb 2+ or Sn 2+ ) and X is a halide (Cl -, Br -, I -).  [7] [8] [9] [10]  Polycrystalline perovskite thin films used in high-efficiency PSCs still contain defects, notably at the surface, which limits the device performance as a consequence of nonradiative charge recombination.  11, 12  Defects on the surface and on the grain boundaries also play an important role in the permeation of moisture or oxygen into the perovskite film, accelerating the film/device degradation. Several methods have been reported to simultaneously passivate and enhance the stability of perovskites,  13  most notably the use of additive, alternative precursors, or altered stoichiometry,  [14] [15] [16]  embedding small alkali metal cations,  [17] [18] [19]  or the use of thin organic buffer layers at the perovskite/ transport material interface.  [20] [21] [22] [23]  More recently, several works reported on mixed-dimensional perovskites, using monoammonium or diammonium cations, which interact with the 3D perovskite, not only passivating surface defects but also improving the device stability, thanks to the hydrophobic character of the alkylammonium chains.  24, 25  The structural analysis of modified 3D perovskite films suggested the coexistence of two distinct phases: a 3D perovskite layer and a 2D (layered) perovskite. 2D perovskites form when the inorganic lead halide framework cannot accommodate the large organic cations into a 3D structure and collapses into a low-dimensional material with inorganic sheets separated by the organic cations. The general formula for pure 2D perovskites is (R-NH 3 ) 2 MX 4 , where R is an aliphatic or aromatic group. The layered perovskite family is not restricted solely to this structure, and thicker inorganic sheets can be incorporated as well. In the Ruddlesden-Popper layered perovskites with formula (RNH 3 ) 2 (A) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 , the thickness of the inorganic layers increases with increasing n.  26  The properties of this last class of materials, also known as quasi-2D perovskites, have been widely studied.  27, 28  It was shown that solar cells with n < 40 show inferior performance as a consequence of a reduced charge carrier mobility.  29, 30  Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites have been applied to lightemitting diodes and solar cells, showing good charge transport properties and enhanced photovoltage and stability.  29, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40]  A complementary approach involves the use of 2D-3D bilayers. The underlying concept is to combine the high efficiency of the 3D absorber with the stabilization and passivation properties of 2D perovskites.  41  These bilayers can be prepared by functionalization of the 3D perovskite surface with large ammonium cations, resulting in the formation of thin low-dimensional perovskite layers.  [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49]  Alternatively, the direct processing of a 2D perovskite film on top of a preformed 3D material can also be beneficial for the bottom perovskite film.  50, 51  Up to now, the introduction of thin 2D perovskite layers on the surface and/or at the grain boundaries of 3D perovskite has been carried out solely by solution processing, leading to unavoidable intermixing between the 2D and 3D perovskites, with the formation of an intermediate, lowdimensional quasi-2D layer.  52  Vacuum deposition is an alternative solvent-free technique suited to develop multilayer perovskite structures.  53  Vacuum processing of perovskites is intrinsically additive, eliminating issues such as the solubility limitation of precursors or the need for orthogonal solvents in order to process multilayer devices.  54, 55  At the same time, it allows a fine control over the film thickness and the deposition of high-purity semiconductors.  56, 57  Recently, a 3D/2D heterojunction produced exclusively by vacuum methods has been reported.  58  The heterojunction consists of a MAPI film (formed by conversion of a sublimed PbI 2 layer converted with MAI vapors), subsequently exposed to butylammonium iodide vapors, forming a surface layer of the quasi-2D perovskite (BA) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 , with n ≈ 3. While an increase in stability was found for the surface-modified solar cells, the performance and especially the photovoltage were not found to improve as compared to the reference MAPI devices. In this work, we report the fabrication of 2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions by dual-source vacuum deposition, with the aim of studying the interaction between the 3D and 2D phases as well as the charge transport properties of 2D perovskites in neat 2D/3D interfaces. We prepared 2D/MAPI/2D perovskite heterostructures by employing pure MAPI (3D) and pure phenethylammonium lead iodide (PEA 2 PbI 4 , 2D). These structures were integrated into vacuum-deposited PSCs. In order to rationalize the role of each interface, we also separately studied the two possible bilayer configurations, 2D/MAPI and MAPI/2D. Unlike what was observed in solution-processed 3D/2D films, we observed generally hindered charge transport with no direct evidence of surface passivation. These phenomena are likely due to a nonfavorable orientation of the 2D perovskite with respect to the MAPI (growth parallel to the substrate and impeding charge transport) and to the formation of 2D phases with very low dimensionality (n virtually equal to 1). Despite the lower mobility and unfavorable orientation of the 2D perovskite, we identified a trade-off between the open-circuit voltage (V oc , which was found to increase up to 1.1 V) and fill factor (FF, related to charge transport) as a function of the 2D layer thickness. The 2D PEA 2 PbI 4 perovskite thin films were prepared by cosublimation of the precursor compounds, phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) and lead iodide, upon calibration of the deposition rate for each material. The calibration factor was obtained by comparing the thickness of the thin film detected from the quartz crystal microbalance sensors with that measured with a mechanical profilometer. PEAI can be sublimed with a stable and controlled deposition rate; however, it must be properly outgassed in high vacuum before deposition. Details of the thin-film and device fabrication are  
 ACS Energy Letters Letter provided in the Supporting Information. Estimation of layered PEA 2 PbI 4 perovskite stoichiometry was performed offline with X-ray diffraction (XRD). The diffractograms (Figure  1a ) were collected for both the pristine samples and low-temperature annealed films (5 min at 100 °C in an inert atmosphere). The as-prepared materials already show the expected XRD pattern for a 2D perovskite, meaning that crystallization occurs already at room temperature, as for vacuum-deposited MAPI films. However, after the short low-temperature annealing, we observed more intense diffraction peaks, indicating a wellcrystallized perovskite. The c-axis diffraction signals strongly dominate the diffraction pattern, with six observed [00l] peaks (5.4°, 10.8°, 16.3°, 21.7°, 27.2°, 32.8°) corresponding to the (002), (004), (006), (008), (0010), and (0012) crystal planes, respectively. The preferential orientation along the [00l] direction suggests that the 2D perovskite film grows with the alternating organic and inorganic sheets parallel to the substrate's plane. Such an orientation is not a priori favorable for device operation as the insulating organic sheets would be perpendicular to the direction of charge transport. The optical absorption spectrum of the PEA 2 PbI 4 film (Figure  1b ) exhibits the characteristic components of 2D perovskites: a band in the UV-blue range, corresponding to the interband transitions leading to free carrier generation, and a red-shifted intense peak at 508 nm due to exciton absorption.  59  The corresponding photoluminescence (PL, measured upon excitation with a continuous-wave laser at 375 nm) spectrum shows the expected sharp emission peak with a very small Stokes shift at 521 nm, with a full width at halfmaximum (FWHM) of only 22 nm. Taken together, the XRD and the optical characteristics indicate the formation of a pure 2D (n = 1) perovskite compound. The morphology of the layers was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Figure  1c ) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Figure  1d ). SEM shows a distinct morphology with well-defined, randomly distributed platelets (size up to 500 nm) composed of grains in the <100 nm range. These vacuum-deposited 2D materials were found to be very reproducible and could maintain stable structural properties for more than 6 months (Figure  S1 ). We then used these 2D films to fabricate perovskite heterostructures. Initially, we deposited 10 nm thick PEA 2 PbI 4 films below and on top of a 500 nm thick MAPI film in order to investigate the influence of the 2D layers on the morphology and crystallinity of the 3D perovskite. The XRD patterns of a 3D sample on glass and sandwiched between 2D layers are presented in Figure  S2 . As can be observed for the reference sample (MAPI on glass), a preferential orientation occurs along the [110] direction, as commonly observed for both solution-processed and vacuum-deposited MAPI.  60, 61  However, when the MAPI layer is sandwiched between two PEA 2 PbI 4 films, we observe a decrease in the intensity of the (  110 ) and (  220 ) peaks along with an increase of the (  022 ) and (134) reflections. These observations suggest a change in the orientation of the MAPI film when deposited between 2D perovskites. The change of the diffraction profiles together with their enlarged FWHM also indicates a reduction of the crystal size for the MAPI film. We also noted a weak diffraction signal at low angle (2θ = 12.7°), ascribed to the presence of unreacted PbI 2 , both in the pure MAPI and in the 2D/MAPI/ 2D heterostructure. The role of a small PbI 2 excess in MAPI films has been widely studied, but its effect has not been fully rationalized yet. Specifically, in vacuum-deposited MAPI films and solar cells, the presence of resilient PbI 2 has been often identified, and it seems not to interfere with charge generation and transport.  62, 63  Interestingly, in several solution-processed 3D/2D perovskite systems, excess PbI 2 is intentionally used as a platform to then form a low-dimensional perovskite by simply spin-coating the corresponding organic ammonium halide.  41  In our case, the excess PbI 2 in the MAPI film is maintained even after deposition of the 2D PEA 2 PbI 4 film. Considering that no PbI 2 diffraction could be observed in pure PEA 2 PbI 4 films (meaning that the PbI 2 signal comes only from the underlying MAPI layer), these observations suggest that no intermixing takes place between the two materials, resulting in a neat 3D/2D perovskite interface. The formation of a pure PEA 2 PbI 4 film at the interface with MAPI is also supported by the PL of a 2D/3D bilayer, where the signals correspond to those of the pure separated materials (Figure  S7 ). While no changes were observed in the optical absorption of the 2D/MAPI/2D heterostructure (Figure  S3 ) as compared to the bare MAPI (the contribution of the very thin PEA 2 PbI 4 films is not noticeable because the 3D absorption saturates in the green-blue region of the spectrum), we did observe differences in their morphology. The morphology of the 3D  
 ACS Energy Letters Letter layer with and without the 2D perovskite interlayers was investigated by SEM. The surface of the MAPI film appears homogeneous and compact (Figure  2a ), composed of grains with an average size of approximately 100 nm. In the 2D/MAPI/2D heterostructure (Figure  2b ), we can already observe how the PEA 2 PbI 4 layer affects the film growth and morphology as the grain size is reduced, and the surface seems more textured as compared to the bare MAPI film.  64, 65  These effects correlate with the XRD discussed before (Figure  S2 ). The surface of the samples was further analyzed by AFM. While homogeneous on a large scale (Figure  2c ), the MAPI film surface was found to be rather rough, with a root-meansquare roughness R RMS of 13 nm and average height z AVG as high as 50 nm (Figures  2e  and S4 ). The grain size reduction observed by SEM for the 2D/MAPI/2D heterostructure was also confirmed by AFM (Figure  2d ), where the topography was characterized by R RMS = 8 nm and a strongly diminished z AVG of 27 nm (Figure  2f ). At the same time, the height distribution was found also to be narrower, indicating a more homogeneous surface. Grain size reduction as a result of the interaction of a 3D perovskite with large cations has also been observed previously.  42, 66  To evaluate the potential of a 2D/MAPI/2D perovskite heterostructure in photovoltaics, we incorporated it in fully vacuum-deposited PSCs using a p-i-n device layout (Figure  3a ). The diodes were prepared on indium tin oxide (ITO), using molybdenum oxide (MoO 3 , 5 nm) and N4,N4,N4″,N4″tetra([1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)-[1,1′:4′,1″-terphenyl]-4,4″-diamine (TaTm, 10 nm) as the hole transport layer (HTL) and a 500 nm thick MAPI film, fullerene (C60, 25 nm), and bathocuproine (BCP, 8 nm) as the electron transport layers (ETLs). The devices were completed with the deposition of a silver electrode (100 nm). The low-dimensional PEA 2 PbI 4 films were vacuum-deposited in between the HTL/MAPI or the MAPI/ETL interfaces, varying the thickness between 2.5 and 10 nm. All layers were thermally deposited in high vacuum with a base pressure of 10 -6 mbar. The current densityvoltage (J-V) curves of PSCs were recorded under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm -2 , Figure  3 ), and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table  1  (only for devices with 2.5 nm thick 2D films). We initially fabricated and tested the triple layer heterojunctions of the type 2D/MAPI/2D. The heterojunction device with 2.5 nm thick 2D films showed a short-circuit current density (J sc ) exceeding 20 mA cm -2 , only slightly lower than that of the reference MAPI solar cell (Table  1  and Figure  S5 ). While the open-circuit voltage (V oc ) was found to decrease only approximately 6-7 meV compared to the reference, we observed a strongly reduced FF (65.5%) even though the two 2D films were only 2.5 nm thick (Figure  3b ). With increasing thickness of the low-dimensional perovskite films, the FF further decreased to 49.7%, accompanied by a drastic reduction in the current density, being as low as 8 mA cm -2 for 10 nm thick 2D films. Clearly, the 2D/MAPI/2D heterojunction solar cells suffer from hindered charge extraction, a situation that becomes more severe for thicker 2D films. This is in agreement with the formation of PEA 2 PbI 4 films with insulating sheets perpendic-  
 ACS Energy Letters Letter ular to the current flow, as described above. All solar cells based on the 2D/MAPI/2D heterostructure showed also hysteresis in the J-V curve when scanning in forward (from short-to open-circuit) or reverse (from open-to short-circuit) bias. However, the V oc for the devices employing 5 and 10 nm thick PEA 2 PbI 4 films was found to increase up to >1080 mV, meaning that the 2D films are indeed capable of reducing nonradiative recombination of the MAPI layer. In order to rationalize the properties of the 2D/MAPI/2D heterostructure devices, we fabricated and characterized analogous solar cells based on either 2D/3D or 3D/2D bilayers as the active materials, with increasing thickness of the PEA 2 PbI 4 films. The heterojunction device with the 2.5 nm thick 2D film at the front contact (2D/MAPI, Figure  3c ), shows high short-circuit current density (J sc , 22.1 mA cm -2 ) and very good rectification, with a FF as high as 78.6% and negligible hysteresis. The V oc is approximately 1.05 V, leading to a PCE of 18.3%, comparable to that of the reference MAPI solar cells. Increasing the thickness of PEA 2 PbI 4 to 5 and 10 nm results in lower photocurrent (18 and 16.5 mA cm -2 , respectively) and causes again a drastic reduction of the FF, which is below 55% for both thicknesses. The cells with thicker 2D films show also hysteresis in the J-V curve. However, when compared to bare MAPI, the solar cell photovoltage is also found to increase to about 1070 mV for thicker 2D perovskite films. A similar behavior was observed for the solar cells based on the MAPI/2D heterojunction (Figure  3d ), where the PEA 2 PbI 4 is now deposited on top of MAPI, below the C60 ETL. The current density decreases with increasing thickness of the 2D perovskite films, from 21.8 mA cm -2 (2.5 nm) to approximately 14 mA cm -2 (10 nm). The J-V curves for devices including thicker (5 and 10 nm) 2D films show hysteresis, with slightly larger current densities (approximately 1 mA cm -2 ) in reverse bias. Also for MAPI/2D heterojunction, the FF was observed to scale inversely with the thickness of PEA 2 PbI 4 but not as drastically as in the case of 2D/MAPI structures. The FF decreases from 73.5% to 63.9% when the 2D layer thickness is increased from 2.5 nm to 10 nm. Importantly, with this device configuration, we do observe a substantial increase in the photovoltage, with the MAPI/2D solar cells having a V oc exceeding 1.1 V for 5 nm thick PEA 2 PbI 4 layers. This observation indicates that the 2D perovskite layer is indeed capable of reducing the nonradiative recombination within the MAPI film. Interestingly, the fact that no changes in photovoltage were observed with the 2D/ MAPI heterojunction (as compared to bare MAPI) might indicate that the interface chemistry of the 2D/3D interface differs from that of the MAPI/2D one. Figure  4  summarizes the thickness-dependent photovoltage and FF measured on the different heterojunction solar cells. In general, we observe a trend where 2.5 nm thick films of PEA 2 PbI 4 , independent of the side where the MAPI's are deposited, do not lead to an appreciable increase in the photovoltage (for MAPI cells it is 1055 mV), while they already undermine the charge extraction as the FF diminishes (Figure  3b ). One exception is the 2D/3D heterojunction, where the V oc and FF are essentially unchanged with respect to the reference MAPI solar cells, leading to similar PCE exceeding 18%. Increasing the 2D layer thickness to 5 nm leads to a general enhancement of the V oc , with the devices based on the 2D/3D and 2D/3D/2D structures reaching 1070 and 1084 mV, respectively, and a peak for the 3D/2D heterojunction solar cells at 1104 mV. While such a 50 mV increase in V oc might appear moderate, it corresponds to a 7-fold enhancement of the external PL quantum yield.  67, 68  We note that devices with different thicknesses of the 2D films show comparable dark leakage currents, indicating that the observed changes of voltage have no direct electrical origin (Figure  S8 ). Hence, the   
 ACS Energy Letters Letter vacuum-deposited PEA 2 PbI 4 films on top of MAPI are indeed capable of reducing nonradiative charge recombination, although at the expense of the FF (70%). For thicker (10 nm) 2D films, we observed a reduction of the V oc , which is more prominent for the 3D/2D heterojunction with a 10 nm thick film. Although the incorporation of 2D perovskites at the interface with MAPI is beneficial in terms of photovoltage, it leads to a drop in FF, which became more important once the PEA 2 PbI 4 thickness increased from to 5 and 10 nm (Figure  3b ). The loss in FF can be attributed to the unfavorable orientation of the insulating sheets formed by the bulky organic cations within the 2D perovskite films (Figure  1 ), perpendicularly oriented to the direction of the charge transport. Besides the orientation of the 2D perovskite with respect to the substrate, another factor that can contribute to the loss in FF is the presence of an energy barrier for the charge extraction (either hole or electron, or both) at the 3D/2D heterojunction or at the perovskite/organic interfaces. Such an energy barrier is related to misalignment of the energy levels, which is likely to exist at least in one case (either 2D/3D or 3D/2D) as a consequence of the larger bandgap of PEA 2 PbI 4 as compared to that of MAPI. The ionization energy (IE) can be used to estimate the valence band maximum (VBM) in an intrinsic semiconductor. We measured via air photoemission spectroscopy the IE of both 3D and 2D perovskites (Figure  S6 ). We found an IE for MAPI of 5.0 eV, only slightly smaller as compared to recently reported ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy measurements,  69  while a larger IE of 5.5 eV was measured for PEA 2 PbI 4 films. This implies the presence of an energy barrier for the hole extraction of approximately 0.5 eV, which supports the severe drop in FF observed when PEA 2 PbI 4 is deposited in between the HTL and the MAPI (Figure  3b ). Estimating the bandgap of PEA 2 PbI 4 from the absorption spectrum (2.4 eV) and considering a MAPI bandgap of 1.6 eV,  69  the barrier for the electron extraction at the 3D/2D interface would be 0.3 eV (Figure  S6 ). The lower energy difference among the electronic affinities at the 3D/2D interface agrees with the smaller FF losses associated with using the 2D perovskite on top of the MAPI surface and below the ETL. The vacuum-deposited 2D/3D heterostructures were further studied by means of time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC). Figure  5a  depicts the normalized time-dependent conductance traces for bare MAPI and 2D/MAPI bilayers, obtained by selectively and homogeneously exciting the 3D MAPI film at 600 nm from both sides. Due to the lack of optical absorption at this wavelength, we did not observe any appreciable signal from the 2D layer. After a fast initial rise limited by the response time of the microwave cavity, the signals decayed due to charge recombination or trapping. Interestingly, the decay kinetics of the MAPI and 2D/MAPI are very similar and independent of the excitation side and the presence of the 2D layer. Hence, from this measurement, we cannot conclude that the MAPI film is effectively passivated by the 2D layer. From the maximum change in photoconductance, ΔG max , the product of charge carrier generation efficiency per incident photon, η, and the sum of electron and hole mobility, ∑ μ is calculated using ∑ η μ β = ΔG I e max 0 (1) where I 0 is the incident intensity, e is the elementary charge, and β is a geometrical factor. For both the 3D film as well as the 3D/2D bilayer, the η ∑ μ values increase slightly with light intensity, reaching values close to 10 cm 2 /(Vs), which is comparable to values previously reported and discussed on evaporated 3D perovskite layers.  70, 71  The slight difference in maximum mobility can be related to the different substrate on which the 3D MAPI layer has been deposited. Importantly, the dependence of the MAPI film with intensity is larger than that of the 2D/MAPI bilayers, which is almost constant (Figure  5b ). Such dependence can be explained by the fact that the 3D film contains a substantial amount of deep traps, which become saturated at higher intensities.  72  This observation agrees with the higher V oc values observed for the heterostructure devices (Figure  4a ). Finally, we excited the samples at 510 nm, which corresponds with the maximum absorption of the excitonic band of the 2D perovskite (see  
 ACS Energy Letters Letter Figure  5c ). The 2D layer exhibited very low signal, which can be explained by the high exciton binding energy preventing dissociation of the excitons into mobile carriers.  73  The MAPI films as well as the 3D/2D bilayer gave signal intensities comparable to that of excitation at 600 nm, implying that the charge carrier yield is independent of the used wavelengths. Interestingly, exciting the 2D/MAPI sample through the 2D layer leads to a substantial decrease of the signal intensity. This can be explained by the fact that a substantial part of the incident light is absorbed by the 2D perovskite itself, and the excited states generated in the 2D layer do not lead to mobile carriers in the MAPI film by either charge or energy transfer. This inefficient charge carrier generation might partially explain the photocurrent losses observed in the heterostructure devices (Figure  3 ). In summary, we show for the first time the fabrication of perovskite heterostructures by dual-source vacuum deposition. This was achieved by vacuum processing thin layers of the 2D perovskite phenethylammonium lead iodide (PEA 2 PbI 4 ) below and on top of a vacuum-deposited methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) film. We investigated the morphology, structure, and optical properties of the 2D and 3D separately, as well as of the 2D/3D/2D heterostructure, and observed that vacuum-deposited PEA 2 PbI 4 films tend to grow with the alternating inorganic and organic sheets parallel to the substrate. For this reason, when incorporated into devices, the 2D/3D/2D perovskite heterostructure shows a strongly hindered charge extraction, a result of an interplay of parameters among the preferential in-plane orientation of the 2D film, the low carrier mobility, and the mismatch in the transport energy levels. By separately studying the 2D/3D and 3D/2D bilayers, we identified a trade-off between the solar cell photovoltage and FF, with 3D/2D heterojunction solar cells having open-circuit voltage as high as 1.1 V. By TRMC, we observed that the density of deep traps in the MAPI active layers is reduced in the presence of the 2D perovskite; however, the latter leads to a reduced photocurrent as we did not observe any charge or energy transfer from the 2D film to the MAPI. In general, our results show a marked difference between vacuum-deposited and solution-processed 3D/2D architectures, with unfavorable orientation but high phase purity obtained by dual-source vapor deposition. Future work will address the vacuum deposition of vertically oriented 2D perovskite films in order to promote charge transport and will focus on their role on the overall device stability.

 Synthesis of the polymer Materials: 5,5'-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2'-bithiophene was purchased from SunaTech Inc., and the other reagents and solvents were from Aladdin, J&K Scientific Ltd., or Sigma-Aldrich. Scheme S1. Synthetic route to the monomer Ph(DEG). 
 1-bromo-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethane (Br-DEG): Into a 500 mL flask were charged with 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethanol (DEG-OH, 12.02 g) and anhydrous dichloromethane (125 mL). The mixture was cooled to 0 o C, and then PPh 3 (31.50 g)   was introduced. Afterwards, N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS, 19.58 g) was slowly added, and the mixture was allowed to gradually be warmed to room temperature, kept at this temperature overnight, and finally concentrated with a rotary evaporator to yield a solid. Subsequently, hexane was added to rinse the solid, which was then filtered. The filtrate was concentrated and distilled at 55 o C to obtain a colorless liquid. 12.3 g, yield: 67.1%. 
 Ph(DEG): Into a pre-dried 250 mL flask were charged with 2,5-dibromobenzene-1,4diol (1.5 g) and K 2 CO 3 (3.1 g). The flask was successively evacuated and refilled with argon for 3 cycles. Then DMF (56 mL) was added, and Br-DEG (2.87 g) was introduced in one portion with a syringe after the completely dissolution of the mixture. The flask was subsequently stirred at 100 o C for 20 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was concentrated with a rotary evaporator and the organic layer was extracted with chloroform and rinsed with water. Further purification was performed by column chromatography with dichloromethane/methanol (v/v: 99/1 to 96/4) as the eluent. The final product was obtained by recrystallization from ethanol. 2.31 g, yield: 87.4%.  1  H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl 3 , δ): 7.13 (s, 2H), 4.11 (m, 4H), 3.85 (m, 4H), 3.74 (m, 4H), 3.55 (m, 4H), 3.37 (s, 6H). 
 Polymer DTB(xDEG): The polymer was synthesized with the same procedure as reported in our previous work  [1]  except that a certain percentage of 1,4-dibromo-2,5bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)benzene (Ph(EH)) was replaced by Ph(DEG). 
 2. General characterization  1  H NMR spectrum in CDCl 3 was measured on a Bruker Ascend 500M magnet equipped with BBFO SmartProbe. The absorption spectrum was measured with a PerkinElmer Lambda 650 S UV/VIS spectrometer. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed on Polymer Laboratories GPC-PL220 high temperature GPC/SEC system at 150 °C using polystyrene as the standard and trichlorobenzene as the eluent. Grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIWAXS) was performed at BL16B1 beamline of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The sample-to-detector distance is 300 mm and the wavelength of incident X-ray is 0.124 nm. The incidence angle of X ray is 0.10°. Then the data were collected by a mar165CCD. The samples used for GIWAXS measurements were prepared by spin-coating the blend solutions onto Si wafers. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was conducted on a Bruker Multimode 8 system in a tapping mode and ZEISS Merlin system, respectively. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were checked on Edinburgh FLS920 spectroscopy system with a pulsed laser and an excitation wavelength of 405 nm.

 Thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) TAS was carried out on a CHI660e electrochemical workstation at 0 V bias in dark, and a tuned frequency from 10 Hz to 1 MHz and an AC amplitude of 10 mV were employed. The static permittivity and the attempt-to-escape frequency were chosen to be 25 and 5.0×10 10 rad/s due to the limited experimental conditions.  yielded the highest PCE so far of 24.2%,  [1]  however, it requires doping treatment by oxidants to enhance its hole conductivity, which always inevitably leads to the consequences of long fabrication duration and poor long-term stability for the PSC devices.  [3] [4] [5]  As a result, numerous dopant-free organic substitutes including small molecules  and polymers  [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44]  have been developed, and reports of PCE values of over 19%  [29, 31, 45, 46]  have been frequently issued. Although PCEs of 20.5  [47]  and 23.3%  [48]  were also released, this high efficiency was obtained through optimizing the ETM layer  [47]  or the perovskite layer,  [48]  while the HTM itself was earlier designed/ employed and reported with a PCE of only 18.3  [49]  or 0.52%  [50]  at its first appearance. Therefore, strictly speaking there are no dopant-free organic HTMs reported yet to present a PCE of over 20%. Previously, designing of HTMs was mainly focused on the bulky properties of the HTM layer, especially the hole mobilities, and consequently the well-known face-on molecular orientation where the plane of polymer's main chain is parallel or intermolecular π-π stacking direction is perpendicular to the substrate was widely adopted as a criterion when one designs an HTM.  [29, [31] [32] [33] 49]  Later, the interfaces between the perovskite and HTM layer were paid attention to be modified by small molecules  [51] [52] [53]  and polymers,  [54, 55]  so that the defects on the surface and/or in the bulk of the perovskite layer could be passivated, leading to an enhanced photovoltaic performance. 
 Introduction Perovskite solar cells (PSCs), as one of the most promising alternatives to the conventional silicon-based solar cells, have achieved tremendous progress in the last decade since their advent, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 23.0% has been realized based on the n-i-p type device configuration where n is composed of an electron-transporting material (ETM), i is the perovskite layer, and p stands for a hole-transporting material (HTM) layer.  [1, 2]  As a classic and standard HTM, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,Ndi-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) 
 Side-Chain Engineering on Dopant-Free Hole-Transporting Polymers toward Highly Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells (20.19%) Nowadays, researchers have gradually recognized that the interaction between the perovskite layer and the HTM is also very crucial, and this interaction now turns to be an important designing factor for the HTMs. Wang and co-workers  [31]  constructed a copolymer with carbazole and benzothiadiazole (BT), where the oxygen atoms in the side chain attached on BT units were believed to bring about a defect-passivation effect, leading to a PCE of 19.1%. Park and co-workers  [29]  replaced the alkyl side chain with tetraethylene glycol (TEG) group on the BT units, and the resulting polymer yielded a higher hole mobility due to the increased π-π stacking and an improved contact with the perovskite layer owing to the lifted surface energy, giving a PCE of 19.8%. Besides this side-chain modification, very recently we designed a simple structured copolymer DTB with 2,5-dialkoxyl-1,4-phenylene unit and bithiophene unit, where an intensive exposure of its main chain to the perovskite layer was acquired, resulting in a superior passivation effect to the defects on the surface of the perovskite, a higher extraction efficiency of photogenerated holes, and a comparable PCE of 19.68% compared with the typical spiro-OMeTAD (19.81%).  [45]  Although the HTM/ perovskite interface was optimized, the polymer itself owned a relatively low hole mobility, limiting its further improvement. Therefore, it would be of great interest and a further advance in PCE could be expected if the bulky properties, especially the hole mobility, are simultaneously increased for our copolymers. To this end, we tune the polarity of DTB polymer in this work through the side-chain engineering and introduce diethylene glycol (DEG) groups to replace part of the alkyl groups in the side chains. Contrary to the previous reports,  [29, [56] [57] [58] [59]  here the π-π stacking is unexpectedly weakened while the lamellar packing is strengthened after the introduction of DEG groups. The properties of DTB polymers (noted as DTB(xDEG), Scheme 1) do not monotonically vary with the percentage of the DEG group. When 3% of the alkyl side chains are substituted, a synergistic effect between the bulky properties of the HTM layer and the interfacial interaction of perovskite/HTM is realized. Consequently, a nearly doubled hole mobility is achieved, and a champion PCE of 20.19% with a certified value of 20.10% is accomplished, which is the first one of over 20% reported for dopant-free organic HTMs including small molecules and polymers. The champion device also holds a superior long-term stability to the rest where the PCE remains its initial 92.25% after being kept in air for 30 d without any encapsulation. 
 Results and Discussions The molecular structures of DTB(xDEG) polymers are shown in Scheme 1. The synthetic procedures for monomers of Ph(EH) and Ph(DEG) and polymers are similar to those in our previous work (Scheme S1, Supporting Information),  [45]  and the polymers with x values of 0, 3, and 10% were synthesized. The absorption spectra of polymers in Figure  1a  demonstrate that the absorption band edges are almost the same and the optical bandgap energies are calculated to be 2.14 eV for the three polymers. The absorption shoulder at around 542 nm which can be assigned to the intermolecular π-π stacking is moderated after the introduction of DEG groups, indicating that the DEG group forces the polymer turn to be a random packed copolymer and weaken the interchain π-π interaction. As presented in Figure  S3  (Supporting Information), the light absorption coefficient monotonically increases with the DEG amount, probably caused by the increased crystallinity of the films. Through the cyclic voltammetry (CV) test (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information), the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of the polymers are determined to be -4.99, -4.97, and -4.94 eV when x increases from 0% to Adv. Funct. Mater. 2019, 29, 1904856   Scheme 1. Synthetic route to the polymers DTB(xDEG) (x is the feed percentage of Ph(DEG)). 3% and 10%. Combined with the bandgap values, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are obtained and schematically illustrated in Figure  1b . As for the variation of HOMO levels, the DEG group is an electron-donating group, thus the electrons in the HOMO of polymers with DEG groups would be of higher energy than the ones for the pristine DTB(0%DEG), and as a result the HOMO level would rise after the introduction of DEG. The more DEG groups introduced, the higher the HOMO level of polymers goes. As suggested by Figure  1b , all the three polymers could not only effectively block the photogenerated electrons in the perovskite from reaching the positive electrode (here is Au electrode) but also fluently extract the photogenerated holes due to their large HOMO offsets with the perovskite layer and freely pass these holes to the Au electrode due to the ohmic contact. The molecular packing was examined by the grazingincidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). As shown in Figure  2  and Figure  S5  (Supporting Information), when 3% of DEG groups are introduced to the polymer, the molecular packing does not change apparently, but the diffraction intensity is improved, further demonstrating the increased crystallinity. If the content of DEG groups further increases to 10%, the π-π stackings in both the edge-on and the faceon arranging modes (as illustrated in Figure  S6 , Supporting Information) are remarkably weakened, whereas the lamellar packing patterns in the edge-on mode are obviously strengthened. As observed from Figure  S5a  (Supporting Information), the diffraction peak for lamellar packing at around 4.6° shifts to a higher degree, indicating the decreased lamellar distance. On the contrary, the peak for the π-π stacking at around 15.7° in Figure  S5b  (Supporting Information) moves to a lower degree, indicative of a larger π-π stacking spacing (summarized in Table  S1 , Supporting Information). This loosened π-π stacking interaction is opposite to the previous reports where the incorporation of ethylene glycol oligomers generally led to a closer π-π stacking,  [56] [57] [58] [59] [60]  and the tightened lamellar packing has seldom been reported. We suspect that the weakened π-π stacking is caused by the lowered symmetry of the random DTB(xDEG) copolymer in comparison to the previous alternating copolymers, and the lamellar distance is shortened due to the interdigitation of the side chains in neighboring layers (Figure  S6a , Supporting Information) or stacks (Figure  S6b , Supporting Information) stemming from the higher flexibility of oligo(ethylene glycol) chains compared with the alkyl chains.  [58]  It should be noticed that the lamellar packing patterns only exist in the edge-on mode for all the three samples, suggesting that the majority of these polymers adopt an edge-on arrangement in the solid state, which is consistent with our previous observation.  [45]  The hole mobility was measured through the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (Figure  S7 , Supporting Information), and the values for DTB(xDEG) are extracted to be 1.74 × 10 -4 , 3.22 × 10 -4 , and 2.02 × 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 s -1 for x is 0, 3, and 10%, respectively. Although the gradually weakened π-π stackings, especially those in the face-on mode, decrease the hole transportation, the lamellar packing interaction increases as the DEG percentage rises, which could engender the enhancement of hole mobility. As a consequence, the mobility touches its maximum around x = 3%, which is nearly as twice as that of without DEG groups. To guarantee the long-term stability of PSC devices, the thermal stability of the polymers is of great importance and was tested by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Figure  S8 , Supporting Information). The polymers could stay stable up to over 375 °C and undergo no obvious phase transitions in the tested temperature  range (up to 300 °C), showing their high tolerance to temperature variation. The contact angles against water were also measured, which are 97.5°, 99.7°, and 95.7° when x turns from 0% to 3% and 10%. Although introducing DEG groups could lift the hydrophilicity of the polymer, the simultaneously improved intermolecular interaction, which is reflected by the increased crystallinity, let the adjacent polymer chains hold tight with each other and protect the film against the invasion of water, leading to a nonlinear changing trend for the contact angle. The photovoltaic performance of the three polymers is characterized on the PSC devices with a configuration of FTO/c-TiO 2 /m-TiO 2 /Cs 0.05 FA 0.81 MA 0.14 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45 /HTM/Au, where FTO stands for a layer of fluorine-doped tin oxide and c-TiO 2 /m-TiO 2 are the compact and mesoporous TiO 2 layers. Figure  3a  shows the current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of the three optimized devices for the polymers. As summarized in Table  1 , when x comes to 3%, a champion PCE of 20.19% is attained with an open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.14 V, a shortcircuit current density (J SC ) of 23.64 mA cm -2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 75.08% (the certified PCE is 20.10%, Figure  S9 , Supporting Information). The distribution of all the four photovoltaic parameters can be found in Figure  3b,c  and Table 1 , where almost all of them catch its maximum at x = 3%. The stabilized PCE values measured at the biases of the maximum power points (MPPs) are 19.09, 19.90, and 16.71%, respectively (the biases are 0.85, 0.96, and 0.82 V, respectively), which are very close to these extracted from J-V characterization (Figure  3d ). External quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the devices were also recorded to verify the photovoltaic properties. As can be seen in Figure  3e , the polymers exhibit strong photoresponses across the range of 350-750 nm, revealing their high effectivity of being HTMs. The integrated current densities from these EQE charts are 24.81, 24.32, and 23.01 mA cm -2 , respectively, and thus relative deviations of as low as 0.8, 2.9, and 2.2% in comparison to the corresponding J SC values are obtained, which are much lower than the generally acceptable deviation limit of 5% and demonstrate the validity of our J-V measurement. The stability of PSCs at ambient atmosphere (room temperature and 20-30% relative humidity) was also tested. As described in Figure  3f , all the polymers could render their devices remain over 87% of the initial PCEs, and DTB(3%DEG) holds the best long-term stability, which may be ascribed to its better hydrophobicity. The PCE evolution under continuous 100 mW cm -2 illumination also suggests that the PSCs based on DTB(xDEG) polymers own a good long-term stability (Figure  S11 , Supporting Information). As stated before, the DTB(3%DEG) presents the champion PCE value, which should be mainly because of its highest hole  The average values with a standard deviation are calculated from 15 devices; b) In the parenthesis are the values of the champion devices. mobility. The corresponding J SC of its device is also much higher than those for the reported dopant-free organic HTMs (Table  S2 , Supporting Information); however, it is still a little smaller than that of the control polymer without DEG groups, contradictory to the expectation of a larger J SC value from a higher hole mobility. In order to unveil the underlying mechanism and provide a strategy for the future improvement, investigation on the HTM/perovskite interface beside the HTM bulk is needed, and to this end, we conducted further experiments based on photoluminescence (PL). The PL spectra were recorded on the sample of FTO/c-TiO 2 /m-TiO 2 /perovskite/HTM. As shown by the steady-state PL (SSPL) spectra in Figure  4a , the DTB(3%DEG) sample owns the highest PL intensity, revealing the charge transfer at its HTM/perovskite interface is the poorest. The locations of PL peaks for the three samples are also different, which are 766, 768, and 763 nm, respectively. The redshift of PL peak signifies there are more defects existing in the perovskite layer for the DTB(3%DEG) sample, whereas the blueshift for DTB(10%DEG) is just the opposite when compared with the DTB(0%DEG) one.  [61]  Fitting the time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra (Figure  4b ) with the bicomponent decay model, we obtained the time constants for the two decaying processes (Table  S3 , Supporting Information). The fast decay, which is believed to arise from the chargetransfer at the HTM/perovskite interface, has a constant of 1.44, 1.61, or 1.38 ns for the sample with x of 0, 3, or 10%, respectively. The biggest value for the 3% sample suggests free carriers in the sample cannot be taken away timely to quench the PL, consistent with the inference from SSRL. To know the exact quantity and distribution of these defects in the perovskite layer, we turned to thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS, Figure  4c ). According to the literature,  [61, 62]  the region with energy lower than 0.40 eV is the shallow trap state that can be assigned to the defects in the bulk of the perovskite layer, while the one over 0.40 eV belongs to the deep trap state that stems from the defects on the surface of the perovskite layer. The specific concentrations of these defects are consequently calculated by integrating the TAS spectra. As summarized in Table  S4  (Supporting Information), the defects in the device of DTB(3%DEG) touch the maximum concentrations on all the three indexes, including shallow trap state, deep trap state, and the sum, whereas those for DTB(10%DEG) are the lowest. As mentioned before, with the increased DEG content, the crystallinity of HTM film and the concentration of hydrophilic groups increase, leading to a maximum hydrophobicity when x = 3%. The perovskite layer is hydrophilic, and its interaction with HTM layer should be quite similar to that of water. In such condition, the DTB(3%DEG) is supposed to interact poorly with the perovskite layer, and the DTB(10%DEG) film interacts strongly. Accordingly, the defects of the perovskite layer could then be passivated by DTB(xDEG) to different extent, and it is also reasonable for DTB(3%DEG) to present the strongest PL intensity, the longest time for the PL decay, and the moderate J SC value. Combining the results from PL and TAS analyses, we can infer that a better hydrophilicity would be ideal if the HTMs want to passivate the defects more effectively in and extract the holes more efficiently from the perovskite layer, which could be another important factor for designing HTMs. 
 Conclusion In summary, a highly efficient polymeric HTM was develo ped through the incorporation of DEG polar group. With the increased DEG content, crystallinity of the polymer gradually increased, while the hydrophilicity, hole mobility, defect passivation ability, and photovoltaic performance varied nonmonotonically and achieved their extreme values when 3% DEG were introduced, mainly due to the linearly and unexpectedly weakened π-π stacking and strengthened lamellar packing interactions. A PCE of 20.19% with a certified value of 20.10% was realized based on the DTB(3%DEG) polymer, which is the first report of over 20% values for the dopant-free organic HTMs. The champion device also possessed a superior longterm stability of keeping its initial 92.25% PCE after storing in air for 30 d due to its enhanced hydrophobicity. Our results further demonstrate that both the interface of HTM/perovskite and the bulk of HTM layer are of great significance, and a better ability of defect passivation and/or hole extraction for the HTMs may be realized if possessing a higher hydrophilicity. Moreover, the intermolecular interaction including the π-π stacking and lamellar packing ones should be delicately tailored when one designs HTMs, not just the π-π stacking interaction as regarded previously. 
 Experimental Section Fabrication of PSC Devices: A PSC device having the structure of FTO/ c-TiO 2 /m-TiO 2 /Cs 0.05 FA 0.81 MA 0.14 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45 /HTL/Au was fabricated, wherein the FTO was the bottom layer. The process for fabricating the optoelectronic device is summarized as follows. FTO glasses (Nippon Sheet Glass) were cleaned with detergent, deionized water, and acetone and sonicated with ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. After that, FTO glasses were treated in a UV cleaner for 30 min. The cleaned FTO glasses were coated with titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (0.15 m) in 1-butanol solution by the spin-coating method at 2000 rpm for 60 s, followed by heating at 125 °C for 5 min. The films were cooled to room temperature and a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (0.15 m) in 1-butanol was spin-coated again to ensure a pinholefree dense TiO 2 film is obtained. Then the substrates were calcinated in a box furnace at 450 °C for 30 min. Mesoporous TiO 2 (m-TiO 2 ) layer was deposited on the compact TiO 2 (c-TiO 2 ) layer by spin-coating the TiO 2 ethanol solution containing TiO 2 (14.3 wt%) paste at 4000 rpm for 20 s, which was then calcinated at 500 °C for 0.5 h. The precursor solution of mixed perovskite consists of FAI (172 mg), PbI 2 (507 mg), MABr (22.4 mg), and PbBr 2 (73.4 mg) dissolved in 1 mL mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO with a volume ratio of 9:1. Then, a stock solution of 1.5 m CsI in DMSO was added to the mixed perovskite precursor to obtain the Cs 0.05 FA 0.81 MA 0.14 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45 precursor solution. The perovskite films were deposited onto the TiO 2 substrates using a two-step spin-coating procedure. The first step was 1000 rpm for 10 s with an acceleration of 500 rpm s -1 . The second step was 4000 rpm for 35 s with a ramp-up of 2000 rpm s -1 . Chlorobenzene (around 100 µL) was quickly dropped on the spinning substrate during the second spin-coating step at 15 s before the end of the procedure. Afterward, the as-prepared films were heated at 100 °C for ≈2 h until the color changed to dark red. The HTL was prepared by spin-coating the dissolved polymer in chlorobenzene (30 mg mL -1 ) which was preheated at 60 °C. The HTM solution was spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s with a ramp-up of 2000 rpm s -1 . Finally, a 100 nm thick Au layer was thermally evaporated under vacuum of 4 × 10 -5 Torr at a rate of ≈0.05 nm s -1 to finish the device fabrication. The effective area of the obtained device was 0.10 cm 2 . Characterization of Perovskite Solar Cells: The J-V measurements of the devices under AM1.5G solar 100 mW cm -2 simulator illumination (Enlitech Solar Simulator SS-F7-3A) were performed on a computercontrolled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit in air (60% humidity) at room temperature without encapsulation, with a sweep delay time 100 ms. The light intensity was calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell 91150. The EQE was measured under ambient atmosphere at room temperature using a DSR100UV-B spectrometer with a SR830 lock-in amplifier. The steady-state PCE was measured by monitoring photocurrent with a bias voltage at the maximum power point. A xenon lamp was used as the light source.

 A variety of dopant-free hole-transporting materials (HTMs) is developed to serve as alternatives to the typical dopant-treated ones; however, their photovoltaic performance still falls far behind. In this work, the side chain of a polymeric HTM is engineered by partially introducing diethylene glycol (DEG) groups in order to simultaneously optimize the properties of both the bulk of the HTM layer and the HTM/perovskite interface. The intermolecular π-π stacking interaction in the HTM layer is unexpectedly weakened after the incorporation of DEG groups, whereas the lamellar packing interaction is strengthened. A doubled hole mobility is obtained when 3% of the DEG groups replace the original alkyl side chains, and a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.19% (certified: 20.10%) is then achieved, which is the first report of values over 20% for dopant-free organic HTMs. The device maintains 92.25% of its initial PCE after storing at ambient atmosphere for 30 d, which should be due to the enhanced hydrophobicity of the HTM film.

Devices which were still surviving at this point were exposed for a second week outdoor before the last IV measurement.

 INTRODUCTION Over the past decade, tremendous progress has been made on improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which has now reached 25.5%.  1  With lowcost and easily up-scalable fabrication methods, this photovoltaic (PV) technology is likely to play a key role in the future of solar energy.  2  PSCs suffer from both intrinsic and extrinsic instabilities, which need to be rectified for their further development and commercialization. The intrinsic instability of metal-halide perovskite absorber materials, found to be mostly due to dissociation of molecular cations and ion migration, can be decreased by tuning the composition of the perovskite, transport layers, and electrodes.  3, 4  Chemical and physical changes in PSCs can be triggered by various environmental factors such as light, oxygen, temperature, and moisture.  5  In particular, water is known to irreversibly catalyze the decomposition of the perovskite absorber.  6  Several strategies, such as compositional engineering and surface passivation, have been developed to enhance the moisture stability of the devices.  3  As for most thin-film photovoltaic devices, to prevent moisture and oxygen ingress into perovskite devices, and thus improve their extrinsic stability, specifically adapted encapsulation strategies are required compared to the standard procedures developed for crystalline silicon PV. Requirements for materials chosen for the encapsulation of (perovskite) devices are: chemical inertness and no degradation of active devices layers upon deposition, resistance to ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced degradation, >90% transmittance for the incident light, as well as a low water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) and oxygen transmission rate (OTR). A high electrical resistivity is also desirable to mitigate potential-induced degradation since it prevents leakage current which could degrade the cell. Mechanical properties such as flexibility, a high mechanical strength, adhesion to the contact surfaces within the module, and a thermal expansion coefficient matching that of PSC components are required to withstand long-term outdoor exposure in various climates.  4, 7  Moreover, the maximal thermal budget allowed to avoid damaging the cell during encapsulation depends on the materials used in the perovskite solar cell stack. Temperatures typically used for encapsulation of commercial c-Si PV modules exceed 150 °C,  8  which might be too high for encapsulation of PSCs. Indeed, current standard perovskitebased devices often contain organic cations and organic contact layer materials exhibiting thermal degradation when heated to above 150 °C for extensive periods. Glass-glass encapsulation, where the device is sandwiched between two glass sheets, is a common method reported for PSCs when flexible applications are not targeted.  7  Note that encapsulation strategies for flexible PV application are beyond the scope of this paper. Recent achievements in this area are reported elsewhere.  [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17]  The symmetrical glass-glass config-uration optimizes the mechanical stability of the packaging and reduces moisture penetration compared to the configuration with a polymer back-sheet, as it is often used for crystalline silicon PV modules.  18  In PV modules using moisture-sensitive materials, such as various thin-film PV modules, an edge sealant, usually based on butyl rubber, is added. For laboratory test devices, several groups reported on using a UV curing epoxy glue as an edge sealant,  19, 20  sometimes in combination with Kapton tape over the active area  21  or a piece of desiccant.  22, 23  However, due to their mechanical rigidity, epoxies are prone to cracking  24  and their curing process, which is exothermic, may damage the cell.  25  Other encapsulation strategies have been extensively reviewed and can be found elsewhere.  4, 5, 7, [25] [26] [27]  Provided that the PSC stack is sufficiently thermally stable, the most promising route for its encapsulation implies the use of hot-melt polymer films, which avoids the usage of solvents.  3, 28  Such films typically need to be processed at a temperature between 100 and 150 °C to achieve their final stable properties, which can be detrimental to the PSC. Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), which is the most popular and cost-effective encapsulant for commercial silicon PV,  29  has also been used for the encapsulation of PSCs.  [30] [31] [32]  Nonetheless, devices encapsulated with this polymer show a tendency to yellowing, browning, and delamination  33  and the acetic acid released during its aging can harm active layers in PSCs.  25  Therefore, alternatives to EVA, such as ionomers,  21, 34  polyurethane,  32  or polyolefins (POE)  32, 35  have been investigated. Due to the lack of common standard testing conditions, it is not possible to compare results published for all of these different encapsulation materials. Commercial PV modules presently offer a performance warranty period of >25 years, at the end of which their specified power output rating should not have decreased to less than typically 80% of the initial performance.  36  This is a very tough durability requirement for any emerging PV technology to match, especially if the technology would be combined with silicon to multijunction devices. Accelerated aging tests have been developed by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) to assess whether a PV technology has sufficient stability to meet these requirements. Among them, the IEC 61215 standard includes a damp heat (DH) test carried out for 1000 h at 85 °C and 85% relative humidity (RH), which is an accelerated test condition to evaluate the device resistance to high temperature and humidity on a long time scale.  37, 38  The ability of PSCs to pass the damp heat test was already demonstrated.  35, 39, 40  To the best of our knowledge, there are no demonstrations that passing this crucial IEC test in fact results in the long operational stability under outdoor conditions; therefore, further verification is required. In addition to the need to develop strategies that enable PSCs to demonstrate long-term stability requirements making this technology suitable/feasible for the PV market, encapsulation is also often required as a short-term measure in research laboratories for, e.g., sample storage, transport, or characterization outside the inert environment of gloveboxes. Complex lamination equipment, however, is rarely available in research groups and needs space and investment to be integrated inside glovebox environments where devices are most often manufactured. Thus, it is of high value for the research to develop and utilize encapsulation procedures that can be realized with small footprint and negligible investment cost inside gloveboxes. In this work, we therefore compare two different complementary encapsulation approaches for PSCs: a glue-based encapsulation method that can be easily implemented manually enabling simple encapsulation of samples even inside gloveboxes, which we refer to as the LAB method, and a lamination-based encapsulation procedure enabling prototype manufacturing for pre-commercialization validation, here referred to as the COM method. We compared the effectiveness of these two encapsulation strategies for PSCs by carrying out on-shelf storage, damp heat testing, and outdoor operation. 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 2.1. Encapsulation Techniques. To be able to accurately compare the two aforementioned encapsulation styles, the same solar cell stack was used for both. To prevent temperature degradation from lamination, a formamidinium/cesium (FACs)-based perovskite absorber was chosen as the absorber, which exhibits signs of degradation first at temperatures >150 °C.  41  The other layers and fabrication of the p-i-n cell stack used in this study are described in the Experimental Section and represented in Figure  1a . 2.1.1. Glue-Based ""LAB"" Encapsulation. For the glue-based encapsulation technique, which we will refer to below as LAB encapsulation, a thin glass coverslip was glued on top of the cell with a UV light curing acrylate adhesive (Figure  1b, d ). In the Supporting Information, the optimization of this encapsulation method comparing different UV glues, UV curing durations, and cover glass geometries (cavity glass with glue applied on the edges only or flat coverslip with glue applied all over the active area) are described (Figures  S1  and S2 ). As one of the results of these preliminary investigations, we found that when the size of the cover glass was smaller than the substrate area of the lab test devices and did not fully cover the metal contacts to the top and bottom electrodes, rapid degradation upon exposure to humidity was observed (Figure  S3 ), as also previously reported by Weerasinghe et al.  12  Therefore, glass coverslips of 24 × 24 mm 2 almost matching the substrate size were utilized for the LAB-type encapsulation in this work. To make contact with the solar cell pixels of the test device, tinned copper ribbons (PV ribbons) were glued to the top and bottom electrodes enabling to cover the whole device with glue as illustrated in Figure  1b, d . Extra care should be taken during encapsulation to minimize the pressure applied on the coverslip during the UV curing of the glue. Indeed, we suspect that applying too much force on the substrate can directly damage the perovskite underneath (Figure  S4 ). After encapsulation, a slight drop in the short-circuit current density (J sc ) of the cells was observed (Figure  S5 ). We speculate that this is due to a too long air exposure of the cells before their encapsulation because most of the time, the J sc value of the cells was not affected by encapsulation in our preliminary study (Figures  S1  and S2 ). 2.1.2. Lamination-Based ""COM"" Encapsulation. The second encapsulation technique that we will herein refer to as COM encapsulation consists of a butyl rubber edge sealant and a polyolefin (POE) film as an encapsulant (Figure  1c ,e), as often used for commercial thin-film modules such as CIGS. This set of materials has already been reported as promising to enable the commercial viability of PSCs.  35  The butyl rubber edge sealant with added desiccant is the main component to prevent moisture and oxygen ingress into the device.  42  Indeed, it is chosen for its low WVTR, a parameter used to measure the barrier properties of a material rather than OTR since water vapor molecules are smaller than oxygen molecules and, therefore, harder to be blocked.  25  The butyl rubber edge sealant also has a low glass-transition temperature (below -50 °C),  35  which is compliant with mechanical stress implied by extreme weather conditions.  24  It is supplied in the form of a tape and therefore very convenient to apply. The polyolefin used presents a low Young's modulus (8 MPa), which contributes to the mechanical stability of the packaging,  34  and a high volumetric resistivity (≥10  17  Ω cm at 23 °C) so that potential-induced degradation is less likely to occur.  25  This encapsulation type is carried out inside a vacuum laminator, which enables to avoid air trapping inside the package and to evenly melt and cure the POE foil and the edge seal. The final thickness of the package needs to be as homogeneous as possible to allow it to retain its mechanical stability. In contrast to what is usually done for commercial thin-film modules, we encapsulated the cell stack, including the thin glass superstrate, between two glass sheets. This was done to allow for enough space for edge sealing (at least 10 mm) around the active cell area, but can be avoided in the future by processing PSCs on larger glasses. We speculate that this does not affect the DH or outdoor stability of the device. However, additional reflection and parasitic absorption losses reduce the photocurrent (Figure  S5 ). In optimized devices and modules for commercial applications, the device and encapsulation geometry need to be further optimized to minimize optical and electrical losses. 2.2. On-Shelf and Damp Heat Stability Testing. Encapsulated solar cells of each encapsulation technique, i.e., LAB and COM, were divided into three subsets which were respectively submitted to different storage conditions. We here employed ""on-shelf"" storage in the dark at 21 ± 2 °C, 30 ± 3% relative humidity (RH). The second test condition was exposing samples to 85 °C and 85% RH damp heat (DH) test according to the IEC 61215 standard. The third test condition was an outdoor operation in a roof-top test installation in Berlin, Germany (November 2020 to September 2021). These experiments correspond to ISOS-D1, ISOS-D3, and ISOS-O3 research protocols for solar cell aging, respectively.  43, 44  A descriptive table of the cells used in this study is provided in Table  S1 . Figure  2  shows the evolution of the I-V parameters of cells with on-shelf and damp heat aging over 1566 h. LAB encapsulation allows cell to retain more than 93% of their efficiency after 1566 h on-shelf (see Figure  S6  for the normalized efficiency). Therefore, we speculate that this encapsulation would be suitable for sample exchange or characterization outside of the glovebox where the RH is usually between 30 and 50%. Already after the first step in time in the DH experiment (160 h of aging in the chamber), the perovskite of each of the three LAB test-cells had changed color from dark brown to yellow (Figure  3 ), which is likely due to perovskite decomposition  45  and their efficiency dropped to zero (Figure  2 ). An additional DH experiment that resolves with much smaller time steps the degradation of COM cells is shown in Figure  S7 . The experiment shows that after 8 h of damp heat exposure, LAB cells retain over 98% of their initial efficiency but it has quickly dropped to 45 and 32% after 24 and 48 h, respectively. Furthermore, after 24 h, edges of the cells switch from a dark color to yellow (Figure  S8 ). This degradation also translates into a homogeneous drop in the external quantum  efficiency (EQE) signal over the entire measured wavelength range (Figure  S9 ). Laminated COM cells, on the contrary, passed the DH test and their efficiency was even improved after 1000 h in DH treatment. After 1566 h, the cells retained on average more than 95% of their initial efficiency. The performance of glued and laminated cells, which were stored on-shelf, slightly improved in the first 1000 h and, in particular, in the first 200 h. Several explanations have been hypothesized in the literature to explain this initial enhancement. It could be attributed to the release of residual stress and lattice distortion,  46  the coalescence of small crystallites into larger ones in the perovskite thin-film,  46, 47  or the passivation of perovskite by sodium-ion diffusion from the indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate.  48  Interestingly, it appears that this performance enhancement is even more pronounced for cells that were exposed to DH, between 450 and 960 h, possibly due to the elevated temperatures (Figure  S10 ). It seems that damp heat treatment results in two opposite phenomena on laminated cells, which are respectively beneficial and detrimental to the cells. To determine if damp heat treatment modified the composition of the perovskite, and therefore its band gap, external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were taken on laminated cells after 1140 h of damp heat or on-shelf aging (Figure  S11 ). The EQE response of laminated cells exposed to 85 °C, 85% RH is similar to the one of those aged in 21 °C at 30% RH in the longwavelength region, which shows that at this stage of the experiment, the optical band gap and spectral response of these cells were similar. This is consistent with a fairly constant shortcircuit current (J sc ) throughout the experiment. Instead, the fill factor (FF) is the main parameter that differs between laminated (COM) cells exposed to damp heat and cells stored on-shelf. We hypothesize that exposing samples to damp heat might initially lead to a slight degradation of Cs 0.15 FA 0.85 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45 to form some PbI 2 , acting as a passivation center, as it has been reported for short-time exposure of triple cation perovskite thin films to 85 °C.  49  Follow-up studies to this work are needed to investigate specific changes in the absorber layer composition and microstructure as well as interfacial properties within the device stack to explain the intermittent performance enhancement upon DH test condition exposure. 
 Outdoor Stability Testing. To examine the durability of both encapsulation types under outdoor operational conditions, six devices were exposed and tested in an outdoor testing setup in Berlin, Germany. In the period of November 2020 to September 2021, the cells were placed on an open rack (tilted 35°facing south) and connected to a maximum power point (MPP) tracking system. Periodically, the cells were disconnected for indoor J-V and electroluminescence (EL) measurements. Fall and winter months in Berlin are not particularly sunny but have a lot of precipitation and RH between 60 and 100%. Thus, the conditions present a significant challenge for the role of encapsulation. Figure  4  shows 10 months of outdoor exposure for the PSCs of both encapsulation approaches. Device power output and PCE at a particular point of time depend on weather conditions (mostly irradiance and temperature, Figure  4b ) and the accumulated light soaking (see Figure  S15  for two examples of diurnal variations on sunny and cloudy days). Typically in the morning, we observe an improvement in the conversion efficiency over several hours due to the light soaking effect, which is especially noticeable on cloudy days. The particular shape of diurnal dependence varies from day to day (Figure  S16a ). As a metric to quantify the device stability, we use the performance ratio (PR) for each day. The PR is the ratio between measured and expected power output of the device (see the Experimental Section and Figure  S17  for details and the applied filtering procedure for very dark days). As immediately visible in Figure  4 , one sample with LAB encapsulation retained its initial performance for 3 months of continuous testing outdoors. While outdoor measurements under MPP tracking show a sharp drop in its performance during the fourth month outdoor, indoor control measurements (Figure  S12 ) show that the cell retained 78% of its initial efficiency after 4 months and 49% after 6 months outdoors. We think that this difference between outdoor and indoor measurements could be explained by a contacting issue during the fourth month of outdoor MPP tracking of the cell. The two other LAB-encapsulated cells, however, failed after 6 weeks and only 4 days, respectively. The very fast failure of the latter is likely due to mechanical stress created by an uneven encapsulation processing (Figure  S4 ). We believe that such a huge difference in the outdoor lifetimes of LAB samples is due to the manual application of the glue, experience, and a large degree of automation of the encapsulation step that will help to produce more consistent encapsulations. Even though we considered the LAB encapsulation strategy to be merely a short-term measure to enable experiments outside a glovebox environment, this encapsulation has prospects of enabling at least several weeks of outdoor lifetime. EL images, which were also periodically taken on encapsulated samples, allow for spatially resolved performance analysis (Figure  S13 ). The uniformity of EL images of LABencapsulated samples changed more dramatically over time than the uniformity of images of COM-encapsulated samples. Darker regions, likely due to increased local series resistance,  50  evolve randomly around local defects of the cells and also seem to appear and progress from the edge of the device, which we think could be due to humidity ingress. In contrast, COM encapsulation, which had also passed the DH test, shows excellent stability barely losing performance after 10 months outdoors. This observation is supported by control J-V measurements under the sun simulator (Figure  S12 ). Moreover, the uniformity of EL images of COM-encapsulated samples is relatively constant over the duration of outdoor exposure. Table  1  highlights the complementarity between the two encapsulation approaches compared in this study. The LAB encapsulation can provide on-shelf stability to materials that are vulnerable to air or heat, without requiring complex equipment, while the COM encapsulation appears to be very promising for industrial applications where long-term stability of the cells is required in outdoor environment. Similar to the indoor aging (Figure  2 ), PSCs investigated in this study show a pronounced improvement in the beginning of the outdoor exposure. Indoor control measurements show a gradual increase in the V oc , which is responsible for this performance gain (Figure  S12 ). The origin of this improvement is likely to be the same in all experiments; however, in fall-winter, in Berlin, it takes about 1 month to saturate the effect. After the improvement is saturated, the PR of laminated PSCs slowly declines. Gray lines in Figure  4a  represent single days when devices were taken down for indoor measurements. They mostly spent time in the dark during those days. Almost every time after such a day, we observed significant improvement in the PR. Note that the encapsulation glasses were cleaned before each indoor measurement, which could explain this improvement. However, we believe that the reason is a different one, see Figure  S16b, c , i.e., the improvement is due to the recovery effects previously reported in PSCs.  51  Certainly, the recovery present in the normal operation of the device during every night is only more pronounced after measurement days due to a longer period of recovery. It is likely that night-time recovery contributes to the encouraging long measured outdoor lifetimes in this work. 
 CONCLUSIONS We presented two complementary encapsulation strategies for perovskite solar devices. One of them, a glue-based encapsulation (LAB), provides satisfying protection of PSCs against ambient conditions and can be employed using very simple equipment. This encapsulation is therefore particularly suitable for air-or temperature-sensitive devices as the process can be carried out at room temperature and inside a glovebox. Simple ""glue-based"" encapsulation methods are enabling short-term sample protection for, e.g., shipment or some tests outside glovebox atmospheres. We here show that such encapsulation can last up to 3 months and can probably even be improved using other types of glues. However, for long-term device operation, this encapsulation is likely less suitable as our damp heat tests demonstrate: barriers and mechanical properties of the glues are not sufficient to sustain harsh testing conditions. The lamination-based COM encapsulation method investigated here, using POE + butyl lamination in a glass-glass stack, is more difficult to implement technically but provides excellent stability even under damp heat and outdoor test conditions. Lamination restricts the type of devices that can be encapsulated as it requires samples to be exposed to ambient air for a short period of time and, even more demanding, heating samples to 150 °C for 20 min for the lamination process. However, it was found to provide excellent long-term stability in DH and outdoor testing, a prerequisite for the commercialization of The patterned ITO substrates were cleaned sequentially in Mucasol soap solution, deionized (DI), water, acetone, and isopropanol via ultrasonication for 15 min of each and followed by UV-ozone treatment (UVOH150 LAB from FHR) for 15 min. Next, all substrates were transferred in a N 2 -filled glovebox (MBraun) where 1 mmol/L 2PACz solution was spin-coated on cleaned ITO substrate at the speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s. The substrates were annealed at a temperature of 100 °C for 10 min. The perovskite solution was spin-coated on ITO + self-assembled monolayer (SAM) substrates with a speed of 3500 rpm with 5 s acceleration for 40 s (MBraun MB SC-210). Anisole (250 μL) was dropped on the wet perovskite after 30 s. The films were then annealed at 100 °C for 30 min on a hot plate. Afterward, the substrates were transferred into an evaporation chamber (MBraun ProVap 3G) where 23 nm of C 60 was thermally evaporated on the perovskite layer at a rate of 0.04-0.10 Å/s at a base pressure of 1 × 10 -6 mbar. Next, a 20 nm of SnO 2 layer was deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD) in an Arradiance GEMStar reactor according to the same procedure as described previously.  52  Finally, 100 nm of Cu was deposited by thermal evaporation at a rate of 0.03-1.2 Å/s at a base pressure of 1 × 10 -6 mbar (Mbraun ProVap 3G). 4.4. Solar Cell Encapsulation. To access the contacts of the cells after encapsulation, tinned copper solar ribbons (Ulbrich, part#7746-9062) were glued with a polyurethane conductive adhesive (Polytec PU1000) to the cathodes and anodes on the 25 × 25 × 1.1 mm 3 substrates. The glue was cured at 100 °C for 10 min. 4.4.1. Glue (""LAB"") Encapsulation. Inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox, a UV-light curing adhesive (Polytec UV2137 DC) was deposited all over the surface of the substrate and a 24 × 24 mm 2 flat coverslip was laid on top. The glue was cured by gently pressing over the coverslip and applying about 15 s of UV irradiation (395 nm). 4.4.2. Lamination (""COM""). Each substrate was sandwiched between two pieces of 60 mm × 60 mm × 2.1 mm glass (Planiclear, Saint-Gobain) with two 25 mm × 25 mm pieces of polyolefin encapsulant (Mitsui, Solar ASCE TR02BA, 500 μm) between the substrate and the top glass and two pieces of encapsulant between the substrate and the bottom glass. A butyl rubber edge seal with added desiccant (Quanex SET LP03, 3948) was applied as a frame on the glass, 0.5 cm from its edges. The solar ribbons were laid between the top and bottom butyl edge seal, which were, respectively, 1.2 and 2.4 mm thick. The package was laminated in a vacuum laminator (Meier Solar Solution, ICOLAM 10/08) at 150 °C. The vacuum of the chamber was pulled down to the minimum during 4 min. Then, the pressure applied on the package was gradually increased for 2 min up to 900 mbar and maintained at 900 mbar for 14 min before the pressure was released and the chamber was brought back to atmospheric pressure. The samples were finally allowed to air cool outside the laminator. 4.5. Photovoltaic Characterization. Cells with an active area of 1 cm 2 were measured without shadow masks. Current-voltage (J-V) measurements were performed under AM1.5G (1 sun) equivalent illumination with a calibrated Wavelabs Sinus-70 LED class AAA sun simulator. A Keithley 2400 source-measure unit and a LabView control program were used. Samples were placed on a cooling stage at a temperature of 25 °C. The light intensity was calibrated with a KG3 silicon reference solar cell. The voltage was scanned in both directions between 1.25 and -0.2 V with a step size of 0.02 V, an integration time of 20 ms, and a settling time of 40 ms. The value of each parameter (PCE, FF, V oc , and J sc ) retained for each data point was the one related to the best PCE obtained over 40-60 consecutive J-V measurements, which corresponds to about 30 min of light soaking. The J sc value of the cells typically decreased with light soaking (and thus, consecutive measurements), while V oc and FF increased. This generally led to an increase in the PCE of the cells during the first J-V measurements until it started to decrease. After encapsulation, the average variation between the PCE measured in forward and reverse scan directions was 5.2%. A representative J-V curve of fresh encapsulated cells is shown in Figure  S18 . EQE measurements were obtained with a home-built setup using chopped (78 Hz) monochromatic light from a xenon lamp and a halogen lamp and equipped with a source meter (Agilent 34401A) and a digital lock-in amplifier (SRS 810). 4.6. Stability Testing. 4.6.1. On-Shelf Stability and Damp Heat Testing. Glued and laminated cells were aged in a cabinet with a monitored temperature of 21 ± 2 °C and relative humidity of 30 ± 3% for on-shelf stability testing and in an environmental chamber (Weiss WK11-600/40) at 85 °C, 85% RH for damp heat stability testing. Samples were periodically taken out of the chamber and cabinet for I-V and EL measurements. Samples coming out of the damp heat chamber were cooled in air for 1 h prior to any measurement. 4.6.2. Outdoor Testing. Outdoor exposure experiments were carried out on the roof-top setup located in Berlin, Germany (52°25′53.5″N, 13°31′27.7″E). Encapsulated PSCs were fixed on a 35°tilted stand facing south. Each cell was connected to maximum power point tracking system (MP2005M6, LPVO), which utilizes a perturb and observe algorithm. Irradiance in the plane of solar cells was measured every 2 s with an EKO ML-02 Si-pyranometer. The cell temperature was measured with the DS18B20 temperature sensors attached to the rear side of the encapsulated cells. Ambient temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation were measured with a meteo station (CLIMA SENSOR US 4.920x.00.00x) located at the test field. To trace device degradation, we used performance ratio (PR), calculated as where PCE is the initial cell efficiency, measured under sun simulator. In the calculation of PR, only days with insolation P in greater than 0.17 kWh/m 2 were included (see Figure  S17 ). 4.7. EL Measurements. EL images on encapsulated samples exposed outdoor were periodically taken after J-V measurements with a LumiSolarMobile System from GreatEyes. The maximal current was set to 50 mA, and the maximal voltage to 1.5 V. Unless specified otherwise, consistent integration times (between 300 and 500 ms) throughout outdoor exposure duration were chosen for each sample and 10 s of current soaking was applied prior to each measurement.

Sample 1 was encapsulated with the best conditions according to Figure S1, i.e. with a flat cover slip of 18 x 18 mm and Glue A applied all over the active areas and UV-cured for 10 seconds. Sample 2 was encapsulated with Glue C applied on the edges only of a cavity glass of 18 x 18 mm. Cells were submitted to the same stability testing as described in Figure S1. Full encapsulation with Glue A provides the cell a better stability than edge encapsulation with Glue C. One of the reasons why the performance of sample 1 dropped quicker than the performance of the sample encapsulated with the same conditions in Figure S1 is assumed to be due to a different perovskite solution used (with PEACl additive).

Most highly efficient PSCs utilize an n-type layer of mesoporous TiO 2 and a p-type layer of spiro-OMeTAD (or PTAA) in the n-i-p device configuration, where formamidinium (FA)-cation-based perovskite materials are widely used as light absorbers. We previously reported a mixed perovskite of (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 via composition engineering to stabilize the 'black' phase of the FAPbI 3based perovskite with a bandgap of ~1.54 eV from the 'yellow' phase of a non-photoactive isomer  7  . Recently, Cs or Rb was incorporated into FA/methylammonium (MA) mixtures to improve the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs  [12] [13] [14] [15]  . For the Rb/Cs/FA/ MA-containing perovskite, a high open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.24 V at a bandgap (E g ) of 1.63 eV was obtained to yield a PCE of 21.6%, leading to a loss-in-potential (difference between V OC and E g ) of 0.39 V, comparable to that (~0.4 V) of silicon solar cells  15  . Nevertheless, better performance in PSCs requires greater light harvesting to enhance the photocurrent. Very recently, we prepared a mixed perovskite of (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 with a bandgap of 1.51 eV and successfully reduced the trap concentration of bulk perovskite film by the addition of triiodide ions (I 3 -)  9  . This approach to eliminate the deep-level traps responsible for non-radiative recombinations within the bulk perovskite film is crucial for reducing the open-circuit voltage loss. The resultant device exhibited a PCE of 22.1% with a high V OC of 1.11 V and a high current density (J SC ) of 25 mA cm -2 . This current can be nearly identical to the maximum value converted from a light absorber with a bandgap of 1.51 eV into current. In addition, a wide range of attempts to achieve a defect-free perovskite film have been made to date. These include passivating the surface, increasing the grain size, reducing the grain boundaries and adjusting the crystal dimensions of the perovskite film  [16] [17] [18] [19]  . In addition to perovskite layers, interface-material-dependent losses can also be a determining factor that limits the V OC of devices rather than nonradiative bulk recombination losses, even if a defectless perovskite film is suitably prepared to reach the maximal values of J SC and fill factor (FF) beyond the theoretical limits. Thus, for further improvements of device performance capabilities, more efforts to maximize the built-in-potential and enhance V OC in PSCs are necessary by utilizing selective charge-transporting materials with a suitable energy level and balanced charge transport efficacy. Recent research systematically studied the relationship between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of hole-transporting materials (HTMs) and the photovoltaic parameters, especially V OC , for spirobifluorene-based derivatives, fluorenedithiophene derivatives and tetraphenyl-arylamine derivatives, respectively  [20] [21] [22]  . A higher V OC is observed with a higher oxidation potential for HTMs when the driving force for hole injection is satisfactory. However, multiple aspects of HTMs, such as the intrinsic charge mobility, dopant-additive optimization for high conductivity, and specific interaction with the surface of the perovskite can cause complicated effects with regard to the ionization potentials (IPs) of HTMs on the V OC values of PSCs. For this reason, the top level of performance from a device utilizing a new HTM has rarely been reported, despite the fact that a tremendous number of HTMs have been developed and applied to PSCs in recent years  [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30]  . Thus, only a few new HTMs can be found to exhibit higher V OC and higher PCE values than the best device using spiro-OMeTAD. More importantly, enhanced thermal stability of solar cells is also necessary for the commercialization of PSCs. As reported in the literature, most devices employing spiro-OMeTAD as a HTM are associated with severe degradation against thermal stress because the additives resulted in a significant drop in T g of the HTM  31, 32  . This highlights A fluorene-terminated hole-transporting material for highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells Nam Joong Jeon 1,4 , Hyejin Na 1,4 , Eui Hyuk Jung 1,4 , Tae-Youl Yang 1 , Yong Guk Lee 1 , Geunjin Kim 1 , Hee-Won Shin 2 , Sang Il Seok 1,3 , Jaemin Lee 1 * and Jangwon Seo 1 * Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) require both high efficiency and good long-term stability if they are to be commercialized. It is crucial to finely optimize the energy level matching between the perovskites and hole-transporting materials to achieve better performance. Here, we synthesize a fluorene-terminated hole-transporting material with a fine-tuned energy level and a high glass transition temperature to ensure highly efficient and thermally stable PSCs. We use this material to fabricate photovoltaic devices with 23.2% efficiency (under reverse scanning) with a steady-state efficiency of 22.85% for small-area (~0.094 cm 2 ) cells and 21.7% efficiency (under reverse scanning) for large-area (~1 cm 2 ) cells. We also achieve certified efficiencies of 22.6% (small-area cells, ~0.094 cm 2 ) and 20.9% (large-area, ~1 cm 2 ). The resultant device shows better thermal stability than the device with spiro-OMeTAD, maintaining almost 95% of its initial performance for more than 500 h after thermal annealing at 60 °C. the need for the development of thermally stable alternative HTMs capable of high-performance outcomes in the presence of additives. In this work, we synthesize a fluorene-terminated HTM (N 2 ,N 2′ , N  7  ,N 7′ -tetrakis(9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-N 2 ,N 2′ ,N  7  ,N 7′tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9′ -spirobi[fluorene]-2,2′ ,7,7′tetraamine) (which we abbreviate to DM) as a model system with a fine-tuned HOMO level in an effort to enhance the V OC value and realize a high glass transition temperature T g (~160 °C) for thermally stable PCSs. We also prepare a high-quality film sample consisting of a mixed perovskite based on (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 which has a grain size of 300~1,000 nm. The DM-based device exhibits a large degree of variation in the PCE according to the amount of additive used. The optimized condition led to a higher PCE owing to the higher V OC relative to that of a device made with spiro-OMeTAD. The champion device with DM as a HTM shows a PCE of 23.2% with a J SC of 24.9 mA cm -2 , FF equal to 81% and a V OC of 1.14 V (under reverse scanning). We achieve a certified PCE of 22.6% from the resultant device. We also show a large device with an aperture area of ~1 cm 2 which reached a PCE of 21.7% (under reverse scanning) and a certified PCE of 20.9%. Furthermore, the device with DM shows good long-term stability for 500 h after annealing at 60 °C, whereas the device with spiro-OMeTAD degraded rapidly after only 50 h. 
 Material characteristics Figure  1a ,b depicts the chemical structures of spiro-OMeTAD and DM. The synthetic details are given in Supplementary Figs.  1 2 3 4 5 . Though most of the recent development of high-performance HTMs has been mainly focused on the development of new central core structures  [23] [24] [25] [26]  , what determines the physical and optoelectronic properties of the HTMs is the conjugated structure of such core and peripheral units  33, 34  . The peripheral structure is therefore of equal importance to finely tune the properties of the HTMs. With respect to the molecular design of the HTM, we maintained the well-established spirobifluorene core and introduced a fluorene unit as a new peripheral group instead of p-anisole for spiro-OMeTAD. DM was simply synthesized via two consecutive Buchwald-Hartwig amination reactions using commercially available 2,2′ ,7,7′ -tetrabromo-9,9′ -spirobifluorene, p-anisidine and 2-bromo-9,9-dimethylfluorene. Figure  1c  shows the absorption spectra of the HTMs; a slight shift to a longer wavelength with regard to the absorption onset for the DM sample probably stemmed from an extended π -conjugation through the fluorene unit compared to the simple p-anisole of spiro-OMeTAD. This is supported by the molecular simulation results (see Supplementary Fig.  6 ), which show that the electron density of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of DM is more widely distributed in the fluorene part. An additional electrochemical analysis by cyclic voltammetry (CV) was also conducted, as shown in Fig.  1d . Interestingly, the change of the peripheral unit of the HTM from p-anisole to dimethylfluorene resulted in a slightly increased oxidation potential. Regarding the HOMO level of spiro-OMeTAD as -5.22 eV, the HOMO level of DM was calculated to be -5.27 eV (ref.  33  ). The LUMO levels of the HTMs were also estimated by combining the HOMO level and the optical bandgap values. Thus, the LUMO levels for DM and spiro-OMeTAD corresponded to -2.36 and -2.24 eV, respectively. Next, Fig.  1e  shows the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of the DM and spiro-OMeTAD; the T g clearly increases for DM, reaching 161 °C, which is nearly 40 °C higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD. The increased T g of the HTM is beneficial with regard to the stability of the resultant devices. In addition to the DSC results, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results also clearly show that the introduction of the fluorene unit into DM improved the thermal stability of the HTM itself (see Supplementary Fig.  7 ). The physical characteristics of DM and spiro-OMeTAD are summarized in Table  1 . 
 Photovoltaic performance To evaluate DM as a HTM for PSCs, we fabricated a FAPbI 3based PSC based on the typical bilayered device configuration consisting of a fluorine-doped tin-oxide (FTO) substrate/blocking layer bl-TiO 2 /mp-TiO 2 /(FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 /HTM/Au. Following our solvent-engineering process, we prepared a dense and flat perovskite-absorbing layer on the mp-TiO 2 scaffold and subsequently deposited DM on top of the perovskite film via spin-coating. Figure  2a  shows a cross-sectional SEM image of the perovskite film. Grain sizes ranging from 300 to 1,000 nm were observed, together with a dense film morphology and full surface coverage in the absence of voids (see Supplementary Fig.  8 ). The film thickness of the perovskite is in the range 500-600 nm. Thus, the average grain sizes are comparable to the film thickness, which is favourable for charge extraction. That is, the photoinduced charges can move in the out-of-plane direction across the HTM towards the electrode without crossing the grain boundaries. The fabricated film using MACl exhibited two typical perovskite XRD peaks at 14˚ and 28˚, indicating the successful formation of the perovskite based on the composition of (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 (see Supplementary Fig.  8 ). In contrast, no use of MACl resulted in a poor performance of the device, as reported in our previous literature  7  .  The best-performing cell with a small area of 0.0939 cm 2 exhibited a high PCE of 23.2% (J SC = 24.91 mA cm -2 , V OC = 1.144 V, FF = 81.29%) with slight hysteresis behaviour, as displayed in Fig.  2b . The steady-state PCE corresponded to 22.85% (see Supplementary Fig.  9 ). This device produced a certified PCE of 22.6% owing to the enhanced V OC (see Supplementary Fig.  10 ). We also prepared a large-area cell (0.991 cm 2 ), demonstrating a PCE of 21.7% (J SC = 24.93 mA cm -2 , V OC = 1.136 V, FF = 76.68%) and a certified PCE of 20.9 %, as shown in Fig.  2c  and Supplementary Fig.  11 . The statistical distribution of the PCE for small-area devices is shown in Fig.  2d . To the best of our knowledge, the certified PCEs of 20.9% for large cells (1 × 1 cm 2 ) represent the highest efficiency among PSCs reported thus far. Such high efficiencies of PCE are achieved by the careful optimization of the HTL composition. We investigated the effect of different amounts of additives (Li-TFSI and tBP) on the device performance outcomes with the DM-containing HTL and summarized the corresponding photovoltaic results, as shown in Fig.  2e  and Table  2 . Without additives, or with only small amounts of additives, the PCE of the device is very low because the conductivity of DM is not high enough to transport the injected holes through ~150-nm-thick HTL to the Au electrode, causing severe charge recombination and a very low FF, together with reductions in J SC and V OC . By increasing the amount of the additive to 10 μ l, the PCE increases as the FF increases, but past an addition of additives of 14 μ l, the efficiency drops abruptly due to the large decreases in FF and V OC . Such a decrease in the PCE is associated with the morphology of the HTM; with a high amount of additives, many more voids in the film are clearly observed (see Supplementary Fig.  12 ). This is probably the main cause of the migration of the metal into the HTM or the diffusion of the additives into the perovskite layer. By carefully adjusting the amount of additives inside the HTL, we could find the optimization condition that maximized hole extraction in the device. The optimized device exhibited a PCE of 22.3% with a J SC value of 24.8 mA cm -2 , a V OC value of 1.11 V and a FF equal to 81%, as shown in Fig.  3a . The statistical distribution of the PCE as displayed in Fig.  2d  revealed high repeatability of the device performance. Li-TFSI + tBP means the sum amount of Li-TFSI solution (340 mg ml -1 ) and pure tBP with a 1:1 volume ratio. J SC (mA cm -2 ) It also showed that the PCE of the best cell exceeded 23%, as mentioned above. V OC (V) FF (%) PCE (%) R sh (kΩ) The device using DM as a HTM showed better performance due to a higher V OC as compared to the device using spiro-OMeTAD, as shown in Fig.  3a . With respect to J SC and FF, the two devices showed nearly identical values. This outcome is related to the similar order of the mobility for DM and spiro-OMeTAD according to space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements (see Supplementary Fig.  13 ). Time-resolved photoluminescence measurement was carried out to elucidate the dynamics of charge transfer occurring at the perovskite/HTM interfaces. As shown in Supplementary Fig.  14  and Supplementary Table  1 , the pristine perovskite film showed a relatively long PL lifetime of 407.5 ns. In case of HTM-coated perovskite films, PL lifetimes decreased greatly, with values of 31.2 and 16.7 ns for the spiro-OMeTAD and DM-coated film, respectively. In general, a shorter lifetime is attributed to a better charge extraction by a hole-accepting layer contacting the perovskite film. Thus, we consider that DM has a comparable charge-extracting ability to spiro-OMeTAD. In addition, we found that the shunt and the series resistance values are similar in the two devices. It is important to note that we used perovskite films fabricated via an identical process and that both HTMs had comparable charge transport properties with respect to the mobility. The condition under which the additives were added was optimized for each HTM in the PSCs. With respect to the band alignment, the HOMO energy levels of each HTM are given in Fig.  3b , implying that DM has a slightly lower HOMO energy level by 0.05 eV than that of spiro-OMeTAD. From photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, a similar trend was also found in Supplementary Fig. 15. This may be related to the histogram of the V OC distribution shown in Fig.  3c , which clearly indicated that a higher built-in voltage was established when spiro-OMeTAD was replaced with DM. To gain more insight into the recombination behaviour of a full device, we carried out transient photovoltage decay measurements under the open-circuit voltage, as shown in Fig.  3d . As a 8 mA cm -2 , V OC = 1.12 V, FF = 80.3% and PCE = 22.3%; device after 500 h: J SC = 24.5 mA cm -2 , V OC = 1.11 V, FF = 78.0%, and PCE = 21.2%. d, Evolution of normalized power conversion efficiency obtained from DM-based device with encapsulation under maximum power point tracking and continuous light irradiation (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm -2 , white LED) at 25 °C. Initial efficiency is 20.8% with a J SC of 24.3 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.11 V and a FF of 76.8%, which were measured from J-V curves. function of the light intensity, the recombination lifetimes (τ) for each device with spiro-OMeTAD and DM are nearly identical. No evidence of any change in the defect states related to the bulk or the interfacial recombinations is likely to be found when the light-absorbing perovskite film comes into contact with the HTM in each case. That is, photogenerated holes can be injected into the HTM without significant interfacial recombinations and travel towards Au with no considerable trapping across the HTM layer that would cause reductions in the J SC and FF values. For this reason, both devices exhibited excellent behaviour with regard to J SC and FF, as high as ~24.8 mA cm -2 and ~0.80, respectively. In contrast, the distinguished difference among the photovoltaic parameters was only V OC , which is the main factor determining the PCE of the device, as shown in Fig.  3c  and Supplementary Fig.  16 . As noted above, this is associated with the replacement of the methoxyphenyl moiety by its dimethylfluorene counterpart, which would weaken the electron-donating power considering the molecular design. Compared to spiro-OMeTAD, the HOMO energy level of DM is closer to the valence band of the perovskite, which can favourably increase the built-in voltage at the junction of the device. In consequence, it is reasonable for DM to have a fine-tuned oxidation potential, leading to better energy-level matching with the perovskite and a higher V OC value in the device. As a part of our efforts to realize costeffective HTM, we also introduced spiro[fluorene-9,9′ -xanthene] as a recently reported low-cost core into DM, instead of spirobifluorene (see Supplementary Figs.  17 18 19 )  24  . The synthesized spiro[fluorene-9,9′ -xanthene]-based HTM with a peripheral dimethylfluorene moiety also exhibited a satisfying efficiency of 21.5% (see Supplementary Fig.  20 ). 
 Thermal and operational stability To examine the thermal stability of the device prepared with DM, we investigated the thermal behaviour of a pristine HTM and an additive-doped HTM in a powder state using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in a simulation, as shown in Fig.  1e  and Fig.  4a . The observed T g of ~161 °C for the pristine DM powder is considerably reduced to ~90 °C after doping with the additives. This is most likely due to the role of liquid-type tBP as a plasticizer. A similar trend for spiro-OMeTAD can be found in the literature; doping with an additive into a pristine powder led to a significant drop in T g from ~120 to ~50 °C (ref.  32  ). Moreover, it was reported that the T g values of organic semiconductors can be reduced in the thin-film state as compared to the bulk state  35  . It is known that deformation of spiro-OMeTAD film arises from crystallization after thermal annealing at a high temperature. For this reason, the device made with additivedoped spiro-OMeTAD exhibited apparent degradation when thermal annealing was applied from 60 °C to 80 °C in air (~25% relative humidity, RH) (Fig.  4b ). In contrast, though slight degradation of the device was observed after thermal stress at 80 °C, the device with DM exhibited much better stability under an identical condition than the device with spiro-OMeTAD. Even after thermal stress at 60 °C for 500 h, the device performance was maintained at ~95% of the original value (see Fig.  4c ). This is good evidence that our strategy of using a HTM with a high T g value is feasible in PSCs, even if a higher T g value of the HTM is still required for better thermal stability of the device. Furthermore, the encapsulated device using DM is also highly stable, with PCE maintaining 92.6% of its initial value after 310 h under continuous illumination condition (see Fig.  4d  and Supplementary Fig.  21 ). In conclusion, we have demonstrated highly efficient and thermally stable PSCs by employing a fluorene-terminated DM that has a HOMO energy level well matched to perovskite along with a high glass transition temperature (T g ). We fabricated a DM-based device and achieved high PCE values of 23.2% and 21.7% for small-(~0.094 cm 2 ) and large-area (~1 cm 2 ) cells, respectively, due to the significant reduction of the voltage loss of the device. The outcomes here were certified at 22.6% and 20.9% for small-and large-area cells, respectively. Furthermore, the device with DM showed better thermal stability than the device with spiro-OMeTAD, maintaining almost ~95% of its initial performance for more than 500 h after thermal annealing at 60 °C. We firmly believe that our fluorene-terminated DM created via molecular engineering is a promising HTM candidate for the fabrication of highly efficient and thermally stable PSCs and that our strategy in this work will offer a new direction for the fabrication of highly efficient and stable PSCs.

 Device fabrication. A dense blocking layer of TiO 2 (bl-TiO 2 ) was deposited onto a FTO (Pilkington, TEC8) substrate by spray pyrolysis deposition carried out using a 20 mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (Sigma-Aldrich) at 450 °C. Subsequently, mesoporous TiO 2 (mp-TiO 2 ) films were spin-coated onto the bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrate using diluted commercial paste (SC-HT040, ShareChem) and were calcined at 500 °C for 1 h in air to remove the organic portion. To fabricate perovskite solar cells based on (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 , the perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving 889 mg ml -1 of FAPbI 3 , 33 mg ml -1 of MAPbBr 3 and 33 mg ml -1 of MACl in DMF/DMSO (8:1 v/v) mixed solvent. Then, the solution was coated onto the mp-TiO 2 /bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrate by two consecutive spin-coating steps, at 1,000 and 5,000 r.p.m. for 5 s and 20 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating (5,000 r.p.m.) step, 1 ml of ethyl ether was poured onto the substrate after 15 s. The intermediate phase substrate was then put on a hot plate at 150 °C for 10 min. For deposition of hole-transport materials, a spiro-OMeTAD solution in chlorobenzene (CB) (90.9 mg ml -1 ) was prepared, and 23 μ l of lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI) solution in acetonitrile (ACN) (540 mg ml -1 ) and 39 μ l of pure 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) were added in 1.1 ml of the solution. The spiro-OMeTAD solution including additives was spin-coated onto the perovskite surface at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. In the case of DM, a DM solution in CB (28.6 mg ml -1 ) was prepared, and 0-9 μ l of Li-TFSI solution in ACN (340 mg ml -1 ) and 0-9 μ l of pure tBP (no dilution) were added in 0.35 ml of the solution. The added volume ratio of Li-TFSI solution and pure tBP is 1:1. The DM solution including additives was spin-coated onto the perovskite surface at 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, a Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. Characterizations and measurements. The J-V curves were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195 A) with a source meter (Keithley 2420) at a size of 100 mA cm -2 under illumination at AM 1.5 G and a calibrated Si-reference cell certified by NREL. The J-V curves were measured along the reverse scan direction from 1.5 V to -0.2 V or the forward scan direction from -0.2 V to 1.5 V. The step voltage and scan speed were fixed at 10 mV and 150 mV s -1 , respectively. The J-V curves for all devices were measured by metal masks with active areas of 0.0939 cm 2 (small-area device) and 0.991 cm 2 (large-area device) in size. Electrochemical properties of the HTMs were investigated by three-electrode cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a BAS 100B electrochemical analyser. DM or spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in 0.1 M methylene chloride solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate. Two platinum electrodes were used as working electrode and counter electrode, respectively, and Ag/Ag + was used as reference electrode. The scanning rate was 50 mV s -1 , and the measured potentials were calibrated using ferrocene as an internal standard. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay profiles were measured at 800 nm with the 532 nm excitation of an OPO laser system (NT 342A-10-AW, EKSPLA). The pulse energy was strongly attenuated to less than 1 μ J, to avoid nonlinear effects such as exciton-exciton annihilation. Emissions from samples were collected by a monochromator (SP2150, Princeton Instruments) equipped with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) (Hamamatsu, H10721-20). The output signal from a PMT was recorded with a 500 MHz digital oscilloscope (DSO-X 3054 A, Agilent). For estimating the valence band maxima of the perovskites and the ionization potentials of the HTMs, photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) measurements were performed using a Riken Keiki AC-2 photoelectron spectrometer in air. SEM images were obtained using a Tescan Mira 3 LMU FEG field-emission scanning electron microscope. The XRD was measured by the Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation. Transient photovoltage decay measurements were taken using a nanosecond laser (EKSPLA, NT342A-10) as a small perturbation light source and a Xe lamp (Zolix, 150 W) as a bias light source. The device was directly connected to a digital oscilloscope (Agilent, DSO-X 3054 A) with the input impedance of the oscilloscope set to 1 MΩ for an open-circuit condition. The bias light intensity was controlled by a neutral density filter set for various open-circuit voltages (V oc ) and a strongly attenuated laser pulse of 550 nm was used to generate a voltage transient (Δ V) of less than 20 mV. Device stability test. Thermal stability tests were performed by aging an encapsulated device with increasing temperature (at 60 °C, 70 °C and 80 °C for 50 h, respectively) on a hot plate in ambient air (~25% RH). PCE of the device was periodically measured under AM1.5 G simulated sun light after cooling the device down to room temperature. Long-term thermal stability tests were carried out at 60 °C for 500 h on a hot plate in ambient air, and PCE was periodically recorded under AM1.5 G simulated sun light at room temperature. All of devices for thermal stability test were stored in dark conditions. Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) was also carried out to verify the long-term photostability. The maximum power point of the encapsulated device under AM1.5 G simulated LED light (LSH-7320, Newport, USA) was measured by using a source meter (Keithley 2420, USA) operated by self-written software using a perturb-observe algorithm. The environmental conditions were maintained at a temperature of 25 °C and a relative humidity of 25% RH. The temperature of the devices was maintained between 30 and 40 °C by air cooling. The devices were encapsulated using a getter-dispersed polymer barrier under a nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, those were covered with thermally curable epoxy resin and cover glass.

Arylammonium-Assisted Reduction of the Open-Circuit Voltage Deficit in Wide-Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells: The Role of Suppressed Ion Migration
Surface treatment using large alkyl/aryl ammonium cations has demonstrated reduced open-circuit voltage (V OC ) deficits in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the origin of the improvements has been vaguely attributed to defect passivation. Here, we combine microscopic probing of the local electrical properties, thermal admittance spectroscopic analysis, and firstprinciples calculations to elucidate the critical role of arylammonium interface layers in suppressing ion migration in wide-bandgap (WBG) PSCs. Our results reveal that arylammonium surface treatment using phenethylammonium iodide increases the activation energy barrier for ion migration on the surface, which suppresses the accumulation of charge defects at surface and grain boundaries, leading to a reduced dark saturation current density in WBG PSCs. With device optimization, our champion 1.73 eV PSC delivers a power conversion efficiency of 19.07% with a V OC of 1.25 V, achieving a V OC deficit of 0.48 V.
P erovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted a tremen- dous amount of attention in the past decade because of the superb photovoltaic properties of metal halide perovskites and the high certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction devices that has already reached 25.2%.  1  Beyond single-junction PSCs, the bandgap tunability of perovskite materials ranging from ∼1.2 to 3 eV enables the realization of perovskite-based tandem solar cells, which have the potential to surpass the Shockley-Queisser (S-Q) thermodynamic limit of single absorber solar cells.  [2] [3] [4] [5]  Perovskite-based tandem solar cells have made considerable progress in recent years.  [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]  Impressively, a variety of perovskitesilicon (Si),  6, [15] [16] [17]  perovskite-copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS),  9, 11  and perovskite-perovskite tandem solar cells have demonstrated PCEs of ∼25% or higher.  13, 14  These achievements show the enormous potential of perovskite-based tandem solar cells in the future.  5  Notably, all of the tandem cells share a common component that is a top cell based on a wide-bandgap (WBG) (∼1.7-1.9 eV) perovskite absorber layer,  [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27]  which plays a critical role in highly efficient tandem solar cells. The performance of WBG PSCs has always been limited by a high open-circuit voltage (V OC ) deficit, which is defined as -V E q OC g , where E g is the bandgap of the absorber layer and q is the unit charge. PSCs based on WBG perovskites with a bandgap of >1.72 eV typically exhibit V OC deficits (>0.5 V) that are larger than those of their lower-bandgap counterparts (Figure  S1  and Table  S1 ). While the origins of the large V OC deficit in WBG PSCs are still under debate, it is certain that the shortfall is related to the composition of perovskites with a relatively high content of Br and Cs, which typically results in phase segregation and a relatively high defect density.  28, 29  In particular, the aggregation of I-rich and Br-rich domains lowers the optical bandgap of WBG perovskites (that is primarily determined by the lower bandgap of the domains in the material),  [30] [31] [32]  severely limiting the V OC and thus the PCE of WBG PSCs. Therefore, strategies for mitigating large V OC deficits in WBG PSCs are urgently needed to advance perovskite tandem solar cells. Over the past few years, many approaches, such as compositional, additive, solvent, processing, and interface engineering techniques, have been employed to fabricate high-quality WBG perovskite films and devices.  [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [33] [34] [35] [36]  Among them, bulk incorporation or surface treatment using large alkyl/aryl ammonium cations has been demonstrated to be most effective in reducing V OC deficits of PSCs regardless of the perovskite composition. Despite the advances, the underlying mechanism of the alkyl/aryl ammonium treatment has always been attributed vaguely to a reduced defect density and increased carrier lifetime. In particular, little is known about the subtle differences in how the alkyl/aryl ammonium surface passivation affects WBG (>1.7 eV) and mediumbandgap (1.5-1.7 eV) iodine-based perovskites differently. Further efforts are needed to understand the origins and mechanisms of the large V OC deficit in WBG PSCs and to explore effective strategies for mitigating this issue. Very recently, we demonstrated an approach for probing the activation energy of ion migration in the perovskite absorber using a capacitance-based measurement,  37  which enables the PSC device performance analysis from the perspective of the ionic behavior in the perovskite absorber. Here, we combine the microscopic probing of localized electrical properties, thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) measurements, and first-principles calculations of defect migration to elucidate the primary factors limiting the V OC in WBG PSCs. Our results reveal that, in contrast to the passivated grain boundaries (GBs) in the pure iodine-based perovskite, the nature of the relatively more conductive GBs than grain interiors (GIs) in WBG perovskite films fundamentally limits the V OC of WBG PSCs. Our measurements and calculation consistently show that an arylammonium surface formed by phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) increases the activation energy barrier for ion diffusion and suppresses the accumulation of ionic defects on the perovskite surface and at GBs. Consequently, inverted 1.73 eV WBG PSCs show the V OC improved from 1.16 to 1.25 V, yielding a V OC deficit of <0.5 V. Using the arylammonium surface treatment, we obtained champion PCEs of 19.1% and 24.1% for single-junction WBG PSCs and four-terminal (4-T) all-perovskite tandem solar cells. Our work provides a better understanding of how arylammonium cations suppress ion migration in WBG perovskites and its importance in reducing large V OC deficits and improving the performance of WBG PSCs. To identify the primary limiting factors for the large V OC deficit in WBG PSCs, conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) was employed to analyze the microscopic electrical properties of our benchmark FA 0.8 Cs 0.2 Pb(I 0.7 Br 0.3 ) 3 WBG perovskite films deposited on poly(triarylamine) (PTAA)/ indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass substrates. Note that Pb(SCN) 2 was incorporated into our WBG perovskite films as an additive to promote perovskite grain growth, as reported previously.  20  Figure  1a  shows a c-AFM map of a control WBG perovskite film, which exhibits nonuniform grain sizes with a heterogeneous current distribution over different grains, indicating the formation of polycrystalline domains with different chemical phases and electrical conductivities. All of the c-AFM images in Figure  1  and the Supporting Information were taken with the same sample bias voltage (V S ) of +0.6 V to enable a reliable comparison. The segregation of I-rich and Br-rich (with respect to the 7:3 I:Br stoichiometry) domains leads to a distinct difference in the local electrical properties. The AFM tip (Pt-coated Si probe) forms primarily a junctionlike structure with the underlaying perovskite film. Dark saturation current J 0 of the structure is affected mainly by the perovskite bandgap. A larger current under the V S indicates a larger J 0 caused by a smaller bandgap. The large grains, corresponding to the higher-contrast (brighter) grains in the c-AFM image (Figure  1a ), are expected to be more conductive because their bandgaps are narrower than those with higher Br:I ratios and, therefore, allow higher local current flow (J GI, H ) through GIs. In contrast, the perovskite grains with a higher Br content tend to form smaller grains because Br accelerates the nucleation process, leading to a large number of small grains.  19  The Brrich small grains, corresponding to the lower-contrast (darker) grains, are more electrically resistive, demonstrating lower current flow (J GI, L ) through GIs. Therefore, the I-rich perovskite grains contribute larger dark currents (Figure  1b ). A remarkable heterogeneity in microscopic electrical behavior is discerned at the GBs of the WBG perovskite film in Figure  1a . The current signals at GBs (J GB ) are much higher than the current flows through GIs (J GI ), making GBs contribute to the increase in the leakage current in the WBG perovskites, as illustrated in Figure  1b . For comparison, we measured a conventional 1.55 eV MAPbI 3 perovskite film prepared using the same approach. In contrast to the WBG perovskite, the MAPbI 3 film (Figure  S2 ) exhibits mostly resistive GBs, which indicates passivated GBs because of the PbI 2 passivation introduced by the addition of Pb(SCN) 2 .  38  However, incorporating Pb(SCN) 2 into the WBG perovskites shows no efficacy in passivating GBs. For the FA/Cs-based WBG perovskite films, the dynamic of perovskite formation is greatly accelerated due to the presence of significant amounts of Cs and Br (20 and 30 mol % with respect to the monovalent cations and halide anions, respectively) in the precursor solution, leading to a higher density of defects.  19  The aggregation of the active ionic defects at GBs increases not only the electrical conductivity but also the extent of ion migration at the GBs.  [39] [40] [41] [42]  Because Br has a higher vapor pressure and escapes more easily from GBs of perovskite, it is likely that mostly positively charged ions, such as halide vacancies and lead interstitials, accumulate on the surface and at GBs, introducing detrimental defect states and making GBs more electrically conductive.  43, 44  The ambiguity of the impact of conductive GBs or regions near GBs has been discussed in the literature  39, [45] [46] [47] [48]  but deserves to be discussed further. The local current probed by c-AFM should be determined by two factors: the equivalent resistance of the probe-sample contact and the material resistivity of the local volume underneath the probe. If the contact resistance over the sample surface is uniform, the current contrast is determined by the local resistivity of the sample. A high J GB is sometimes attributed to improved charge transport properties at the GBs, which can be beneficial for series resistance in a solar cell.  47, 48  However, a current contrast in a c-AFM image is often dominated by the nonuniform electrical characteristics of the probe-sample contact. A substantially high J GB value is typically detrimental because of the likelihood of concomitant high reverse leakage current in finished devices. The defective GB and defective surface and subsurface material would cause a higher current flow because of the increased J 0 of the probe-sample contact, which also results in an inferior leaking junction when the device is completed. Moreover, highly conductive GBs may indicate defective GBs without proper passivation, behaving as nonradiative recombination centers, significantly increasing the level of Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination. Therefore, the high current flows through the defective GBs, as probed by c-AFM, can substantially increase the macroscopic dark saturation current in a solar cell device, fundamentally limiting the photovoltaic performance of a device, particularly the V OC . It is worth noting that some defective GBs show conductivities that are higher than those of the relatively conductive GIs that are formed due to the I-Br phase segregation, indicating that the defective GBs are likely to be the most critical factor contributing to the J 0 of a device. To reduce the detrimental defects at the GBs of WBG perovskite films, we applied an arylammonium surface treatment using PEAI, which is known to be an effective two-dimensional perovskite passivation agent that has been demonstrated in some state-of-the-art PSCs.  33, 49, 50  We spincoated 2 mg/mL PEAI in an isopropanol solution on asprepared WBG perovskite films and performed the c-AFM measurement to identify the impact of PEAI on the microscopic electrical properties of the film (Figure  1c ). Compared with the control film, the current flow through the perovskite grains is reduced by almost 1 order of magnitude, and the spatial distribution of microscopic conductivity becomes more uniform. Furthermore, there is an insignificant conductivity contrast between the GBs and GIs of the PEAItreated film, indicating that J GB is significantly reduced and comparable to J GI (Figure  1d ). Therefore, current flow through the perovskite film can be uniformly distributed across the GIs and GBs. The impacts of PEAI passivation on GIs and GBs are clearly displayed in the c-AFM line profile comparison in Figure  1e , where the PEAI treatment shows a marked effect in reducing the leakage current through both GBs (J GB ) and the grain interior (J GI ). Figure  1f  compares the histograms of the microscopic current distribution in the control and PEAItreated WBG perovskite films. The control WBG perovskite film exhibits two distinct local conductivity behaviors, including highly conductive GBs and GIs (J GB and J GI, H ) and less conductive GIs (J GI, L ). In marked contrast to the control film, the film with the PEAI treatment shows a narrow distribution with a greatly suppressed average current of 26 pA, almost 1 order of magnitude lower than the average c-AFM current of 135 pA for the control film. Because the probeperovskite contact in the c-AFM imaging qualitatively reflects the electrical aspect of the electron transport layer (ETL)perovskite contact in a real solar cell, the microscopic current distribution in WBG perovskite films determines the macroscopic current flow in the corresponding devices. Suppressed local leaking current at GBs and the defective subsurface region of GIs is beneficial for reducing the overall dark saturation current density in the devices. To reveal the influence of microscopic electrical properties on the macroscopic device performance of WBG PSCs, we fabricated solar cells with a glass/ITO/PTAA/FA 0.8 Cs 0.2 Pb-(I 0.7 Br 0.3 ) 3 /C 60 /bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag structure (Figure  S3 ). Figure  1g  shows representative current density-voltage (J-V) curves of PSCs based on the control and PEAI-treated perovskite absorbers. With the PEAI treatment, V OC increases significantly from 1.16 to 1.25 V, leading to an improvement in the PCE from 17.5% to 18.6%. To further understand the V OC enhancement as a result of the PEAI treatment, in Figure  1f , we plot a V OC contour of a general solar cell using the diode equation = + ( ) V ln 1 nkT q J J OC L 0 , where n is the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature of a solar cell, and J L and J 0 are the light and dark saturation current densities, respectively. On the basis of the contour plot, for a solar cell with a given absorber layer bandgap and device operational temperature, V OC is determined only by the combination of n and J 0 . Note that n is not an independent variable but is strongly influenced by J 0 . In reality, a small increase in n would typically lead to a significant increase in J 0 and, thus, a decreased V OC . Therefore, from the perspective of device analysis, J 0 is an extremely critical parameter that determines the V OC of a solar cell. A lower J 0 is desired to achieve a higher V OC of a solar cell. The light intensity-dependent device analysis shows the ideality factor n decreases from 1.69 for the control to 1.45 for the device with the PEAI treatment (Figure  S4 ). As discussed above, a lower n value is typically accompanied by a reduced J 0 , which in turn increases the V OC of a solar cell. In a good agreement, the detailed J-V analysis confirms that J 0 is reduced from ∼10 -10 to 10 -13 mA/cm 2 with the PEAI treatment (Figure  S5 ). The decreases in J 0 and n contribute to the improvement in V OC , consistent with the prediction (the triangle to star route) in Figure  1h . This decrease in the J 0 and n of the devices after the PEAI treatment is ascribed to the reduction in the microscopic leaking current in GIs and GBs of the WBG perovskite films. The defective GB and defective subsurface region without the PEAI passivation form a poor junction, causing the photoexcited carriers to be transported over the junction via these defects to some degree instead of the desired diffusion process, which subsequently causes energy loss of the charge carriers and reduces the voltage output of the device. It is worth noting that the reduced microscopic leaking current also leads to increased shunt resistance and series resistance (Table  S2 ). However, the change in series resistance has a stronger impact on fill factor (FF) than shunt resistance, leading to a reduced FF. Therefore, the decreased J 0 is the primary reason for the improved performance of PSCs with PEAI treatment. To further elucidate the interplay between the microscopic and macroscopic currents in the perovskite films and devices, we conducted TAS measurements on the WBG PSCs without and with the PEAI treatment. We have demonstrated in our recent work that the low-frequency capacitance measured by the TAS technique can be used to estimate the activation energy (E a ) of ionic movement in perovskite absorber layers.  37  Panels a and b of Figure  2  display the TAS spectra of PSCs without and with the PEAI treatment, respectively, measured from 250 to 300 K in the dark. The characteristic transition frequency values (ω peak ) were obtained from the derivative of the capacitance-frequency spectra, as shown in panels c and d of Figure  2 . Figure  2e  shows E a values calculated by fitting the corresponding Arrhenius plots using the relation ω β = - ( ) T exp E kT peak 2 a , where β is a temperature-related prefactor.  51  The device with the PEAI treatment exhibits an E a of 0.905 eV, higher than that of 0.680 eV for the control device. The substantially higher E a indicates that the ion migration in the perovskite layer is suppressed significantly after the PEAI treatment (Figure  2f ). The suppression of mobile ionic defects is also expected to reduce the extent of formation of charge defects that can act as nonradiative recombination centers. We measured the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of WBG perovskite films without and with the PEAI treatment (Figure  S6 ). The film with the PEAI treatment exhibits a more intense PL emission and a longer carrier lifetime compared to those of the control film, demonstrating that PEAI can effectively decrease the rate of nonradiative recombination in WBG perovskite films. To understand how PEAI can suppress ion migration in perovskites, we performed first-principles calculations to study the behaviors of mobile ionic defects on the surface of perovskite films. It is known that the diffusion and exchange of mobile ions at GBs and on the surface are detrimental to the device performance. Compared to the diffusion in bulk, ions have smaller diffusion barriers on the surface due to smaller steric hindrance. Panels a and b of Figure  3  illustrate the diffusion path of an I interstitial defect loosely bound on the pristine surface. The diffusion of the I interstitial is  accompanied by relatively small geometric distortions, and hance the diffusion barrier. The ion diffusion barrier is calculated to be 0.68 eV (Figure  3c ). On the PEA-modified surface, due to the hindrance of PEA, the I interstitial is forced to squeeze into the surface, forming a Pb-I-Pb-I loop (Figure  3d ,e), which is similar to the defect structure of an I interstitial in a bulk perovskite (Figure  S7 ). The diffusion barrier of an I interstitial on the PEA-modified surface is increased to 0.96 eV (Figure  3f ), suggesting that PEA may help mitigate halide ion migration on the surface. It is worth noting that the finding from the theoretical calculation is in good agreement with the results of TAS measurement. Although the atomic model for the calculation is based on the surfaces of perovskite films, the agreement with the measured diffusion barrier heights indicates that the ETL layer on top of the perovskite film in the devices may have a negligible or minor effect on ion diffusion. Furthermore, the molecular orbital diagram and partial density of states (PDOS) calculations of a PEAI-treated perovskite film (Figure  S8 ) show that an I interstitial introduces a shallow defect level above the valence band maximum, which is similar to the same defect structure on the pristine surface. Therefore, the PEAI treatment does not affect the I interstitial being an innocuous defect. The aforementioned results combining microscopic conductivity analysis, TAS device analysis, and theoretical calculations indicate that the PEAI surface treatment can suppress ion migration on the surface of perovskite films and prevent the accumulation of ionic defects at GBs. The suppressed ion migration and reduced defective GBs in the near junction region lead to a reduction in the macroscopic J 0 . Consequently, the V OC of WBG PSCs increases after the PEAI surface treatment. Once we understood the effect of PEAI on reducing ion migration and improving the V OC of WBG PSCs, we further analyzed the impact of PEAI concentration on the structural and optical properties of perovskite films and the performance of PSCs. Details are summarized in the Supporting Information (the optimization of PEAI concentration and Figures  S9-S15 ). The optimized PEAI concentration was found to be 2 mg/mL. To further improve the PCE of WBG PSCs, we deposited an antireflection coating (ARC) of MgF 2 to reduce the reflectance of the glass substrate and improve the J SC . Figure  4a  shows the J-V curves of the best-performing device with a MgF 2 ARC. The cells show negligible hysteresis and a stabilized efficiency of 18.78%. The J SC gain of ∼0.5 mA cm -2 due to the MgF 2 ARC is confirmed by the EQE spectra shown in Figure  4b . The increased J SC leads to an improvement in PCE in WBG PSCs from 18.64% to 19.07% (Table  S3 ). To the best of our knowledge, a PCE exceeding 19% is among the highest reported PCEs for inverted WBG PSCs with a bandgap of >1.72 eV (Table  S1 ). The V OC of 1.25 V is remarkable for inverted WBG PSCs. We also fabricated WBG PSCs using a transparent ITO back electrode, yielding a PCE of 16.3% (Figure  S16a  and Table  S4 ). In addition, the high transmittance beyond 720 nm (Figure  S16b ) makes it feasible to fabricate efficient perovskite tandem solar cells. As a proof of concept, we combined semitransparent WBG PSCs with a typical 1.25 eV low-bandgap mixed Sn-Pb PSC  46  to construct a 4-T all-perovskite tandem solar cell following a reported approach,  52  demonstrating a PCE of 24.1% (Figure  4c ) with complementary spectral responses in both subcells (Figure  4d ). This advance shows the promise of high-efficiency all-perovskite tandem solar cells. In summary, we examined the microscopic and macroscopic origins for the large V OC deficit in the WBG perovskite films and devices and identified that the leaking current of the junction caused by the accumulation of charge defects is one of the major factors limiting the photovoltaic performance of WBG PSCs. We applied an arylammonium surface treatment to suppress ion diffusion to reduce the extent of formation of charge defects on the surface and at GBs. This surface passivation strategy leads to an improvement in the V OC and PCE of WBG PSCs. With electrical and optical optimizations, we demonstrated WBG PSCs with a PCE of 19.07% and a V OC of ∼1.25 V, corresponding to a V OC deficit of <0.5 V for a 1.73 eV WBG perovskite absorber layer. Semitransparent WBG cells using an ITO back electrode enabled the creation of 4-T all-perovskite tandem solar cells with PCEs of >24%. This advance in understanding the importance and control of ion migration in WBG perovskites will benefit the development of perovskite tandem solar cells.

 Experimental Section Perovskite Precursor Preparation: The FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.7Br0.3)3 WBG perovskite precursor was prepared according to our previous work.  1  148.6 mg of formamidinium iodide (FAI, Greatcell Solar Company), 273.8 mg of lead iodide (PbI2, TCI), 178.4 mg of lead bromide (PbBr2, TCI), and 56.2 mg of cesium iodide (CsI, Alfa Aesar) were dissolved in 1 mL mixed solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma-Aldrich) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich) with a ratio of 3 : 1. An additional 5.2 mg of lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2, Sigma-Aldrich) was introduced to promote grain growth. The MAPbI3 perovskite precursor was prepared by dissolving 190.8 mg of methylammonium iodide (MAI, Greatcell Solar Company), 553.2 mg of PbI2, and 9.7 mg of Pb(SCN)2 in 900 μL DMF and 100 μL DMSO. The mixed Pb-Sn perovskite precursor was prepared according to our previous report.  2  All the precursor solutions were stirred for 3 h before use. Film and Device Fabrication: The ITO substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication with diluted Micro-90 detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 20 min, respectively. Before depositing PTAA (4 mg/mL, Sigma) hole transport layer (HTL), the ITO substrates were treated with ultraviolet-ozone for 15 min. The ITO substrates were then transferred to the nitrogen-filled glovebox. The PTAA solution dissolved in chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich) with F4-TCNQ (1wt %) doping was spin-coated on the ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and the substrates were annealed at 100 ℃ for 10 min. To improve the surface wettability of PTAA HTL, 70 μL DMF was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 10 s without annealing. To obtain the WBG perovskite film, 100 μL of the perovskite precursor solution was dropped on the pre-wetted substrate and then spin-coated at 500 rpm for 2 s and at 4000 rpm for 60 s with 750 μL diethyl ether (Sigma-Aldrich) dripping at the 25 s of the second step. Then the as-prepared films were annealed at 65 ℃ for 2 min and 100 ℃ for 10 min. The MAPbI3 perovskite film was obtained by the same process. Only diethyl ether was dripped at the 8 s of the second step. For the devices with the PEAI treatment, the PEAI isopropanol solution at various concentrations of 1, 2, 4, and 6 mg/mL was spin-coated on the as-prepared perovskite substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s without annealing. To complete the device fabrication, all the substrates were transferred to the thermal evaporation chamber. 20 nm of C60, 5 nm of bathocuproine (BCP), and 75 nm of silver were evaporated successively at 6 ×10  -7  Torr. For the antireflection coating, 110 nm magnesium fluoride (MgF2) was deposited on the glass side of the ITO substrate by e-beam evaporation. For semitransparent cells, 180 nm ITO was sputtered from a 3″ target (Lesker) at an 80 W power under Ar pressure of 2 mTorr. The active area of devices is 0.12 cm 2 , as defined by the overlapped region between the back electrode and the patterned ITO substrate. The low-bandgap mixed Sn-Pb perovskite solar cells were fabricated following the previously reported methods.  3, 4  Film and Device Characterization: SEM images were taken with a Hitachi S-4800 high-resolution field-emission microscope. The crystal structure of WBG perovskite films treated with various concentrations of PEAI solution was examined by XRD (RigakuUltima III) with Cu Kα radiation under operation conditions of 40 kV and 44 mA excitation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were taken on a Veeco Nanoscope IIIA instrument running in the tapping mode. Reflectance, transmittance, and absorbance spectra of WBG perovskite films and devices were measured by adopting an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 1050). PL and TRPL were performed, as we reported earlier.  1  J-V curves were measured by adopting a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM1.5G (100 mW/cm 2 ) illumination (PV Measurements Inc.). External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra from 300 nm to 800 nm were obtained with a QE system (PV Measurements Inc.). TAS measurements were performed using a Solartron Modulab potentiostat equipped with a frequency response analyzer (Ametek Inc.), a liquid-nitrogen cryo-system (Janis VPF-100 system), and a temperature controller (Lakeshore 330). Computational details: All the first principle calculations are performed with semi-local PBE functional implemented in CP2K.  5, 6  We use double zeta valence polarization basis set optimized on molecular geometries (shorter range),  7  the energy cutoff is set to be 600 Ry. The diffusion barrier is calculated with the nudged elastic band method. We use a 2 * 2 * 2 orthorhombic γ-phase perovskite slab model for the simulation, which is adapted from the measurement of Zhao et al. 8 30% I atoms of the model are then substituted with Br atoms. In order to accelerate the calculation, all A site organic cations are substituted with Cs except for the surface layer. The models and energy profiles of ion diffusion can be found in the supporting information. c-AFM and KPFM: The c-AFM measurements were performed in an Ar-filled glovebox with H2O and O2 concentration less than 0.1 ppm. C-AFM scans in contact mode used a Pt-Ir coated tip (nanosensor PPP-EFM). The scan size is 2 2 µm 2 , and the image contains 1024 pixels in the fast scan axis, 256 lines in the slow scan axis with 0.3 Hz/line scan rate. In C-AFM scans, the tip was virtually grounded, and the samples were connected to the AFM stage with an applied bias voltage of 0.6 V. The scans were done on three random locations to ensure reliable results. 
 Optimization of PEAI Concentration We conducted the following experiments to analyze the impact of PEAI concentration on the structural and optical properties of perovskite films Surface scanning electron microscope (SEM) images (Figure  S9 ) show that the PEAI-induced nanostructures aggregated at GBs and on the surface of the perovskite films when the concentration of PEAI solution is increased from 1 to 6 mg/mL. Atomic force microscopic (AFM) topography measurements (Figure  S10 ) reveal that the reaction between perovskite and PEAI results in the smoothest surface topography when the concentration is 2 mg/mL. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results (Figure  S11 ) confirm the formation of PEA2PbI4 2D perovskite after the PEAI treatment at a relatively high concentration of 6 mg/mL, consistent with the previous report.  9  The existence of 2D perovskite can passivate the GBs of perovskite films and decrease the density of defect states, which is beneficial for improving the VOC of PSCs. Additionally, an unreacted PEAI layer was also revealed at the concentration of 6 mg/mL, as identified by the diffraction peak located at 27.9°. Consistent with the XRD results, a thin surface layer on the top of the perovskite was identified at a high concentration of PEAI in the cross-sectional SEM images (Figure  S12 ). The presence of a PEAI interface layer can adversely influence the transport and collection of charge carriers, decreasing the device performance. Moreover, the overreaction with PEAI slightly decreases light absorption above the bandgap of WBG perovskite films (Figure  S13 ), further reducing the photocurrent generation. Hence, the concentration of the PEAI solution needs to be optimized to improve solar cell performance. To optimize the concentration of the PEAI solution, we fabricated a series of PSCs. The typical J-V and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are shown in Figure  S14 . The statistical results of photovoltaic parameters of WBG PSCs treated with PEAI solutions at different concentrations are plotted in Figure  S15 . As shown in Figure  S15 , the VOC increases obviously with the concentration of the PEAI solution, which confirms that the PEAI treatment effectively reduces J0 of the PSCs. However, both JSC and FF decrease at high PEAI concentrations (> 2 mg/mL), which is attributed to the impeded charge transport and inferior light absorption due to the presence of thick and resistive 2D PEA2PbI4 perovskites and PEAI residues, as confirmed in Figures  S10-S12 , Supporting Information. The trade-off between VOC and JSC-FF determines the optimal concentration of 2 mg/mL. The highest PCE of 18.64%, with a VOC of 1.249 V, a JSC of 19.03 mA•cm -2 , and a FF of 78.4%, was achieved at a PEAI concentration of 2 mg/mL. The integrated JSC from EQE is 18.39 mA cm -2 (Figure  S14 ), which is consistent with the JSC deduced from the J-V measurement.

An Interlayer with Strong Pb-Cl Bond Delivers Ultraviolet-Filter-Free, Efficient, and Photostable Perovskite Solar Cells
The inorganic metal oxides (IMOs), including titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) and tin dioxide (SnO 2 ), inevitably induce decomposition of perovskite under UV illumination owing to their photocatalytic activity, and the use of a UV filter will add extra cost and reduce the effective power output. Here, we first reveal that the weak Pb-I bond in I-based perovskite is prone to breakage under UV photocatalysis, leading to serious degradation of the SnO 2 /perovskite interface. We introduced a chlorine-rich mixed-halide perovskite interlayer (ClMPI), which possesses an excellent tolerance to photocatalysis owing to the strong Pb-Cl bond, between the SnO 2 and I-based perovskite. The ClMPI-based device achieves an enhanced efficiency of up to 21.01% (certified 20.17%). Most importantly, the resultant devices can maintain >94% of their initial performance after 180 h under outdoor solar irradiation, >80% after 500 h under UV irradiation, and 500 h under continuous full spectrum illumination at their maximum power points.
INTRODUCTION Organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites have attracted extensive attention as solution-processed and lowcost photovoltaic materials owing to their excellent properties, such as strong light absorption, high charge carrier mobility, long intrinsic carrier lifetime, and low-temperature processability  (Kojima et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2014; Bi et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2019) . The highest certification efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been achieved up to 25.2% (National Renewable Energy  Laboratory, n.d.) , which can keep up with that of present commercial solar cells, such as silicon solar panels, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS). Unfortunately, the device stability is still far from industrial standards, which generally require that the solar cell can deliver greater than 25 years of outdoor operation  (Wang et al., 2017b) . The elements in organic-inorganic halide perovskite materials, such as halogen (I, Br, Cl), methylammonium (MA + ), and Pb 2+ , are mostly mobile, polarized, and unstable  (Wang et al., 2019) ; thus the PSCs are vulnerable under various aging stresses such as oxygen  (Aristidou et al., 2015; Pearson et al., 2016) , moisture  (Pearson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017c; Xie et al., 2016) , and high temperature  (Misra et al., 2015) . By encapsulation, the device lifetime can be prolonged by excluding most of these external environmental factors  (Han et al., 2015) . At present, the inorganic metal oxides (IMOs), including titanium dioxide (TiO 2 )  (Yang et al., 2017; Jeon et al., 2018)  and tin dioxide (SnO 2 )  (Jiang et al., 2017a; Turren-Cruz et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2019) , are generally used as electron transport layers (ETLs) in the conventional device architecture PSCs to achieve high performance and stability. However, the PSCs stability suffers accelerating degradation owing to the wellknown intrinsic photocatalysis of IMOs under the exposure of UV light  (Leijtens et al., 2013; Ito et al., 2014) . Such instability cannot be avoided during device operation, even if they are well encapsulated. Previous reports have shown that the degradation is most prone to occur at the interface between IMOs and perovskite  (Lira-Cantu ´, 2017; Li et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2019) . For example, the MAPbI 3 layer can be decomposed to PbI 2 with losing CH 3 NH 2 and HI at the TiO 2 /MAPbI 3 interface  (Ito et al., 2014) . To eliminate the UV effect, various methods have been reported to improve the photo-stability, such as inserting an interfacial layers  (Ito et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016a Zhang et al., , 2016b)) , using inferior UV photocatalysis materials as ETLs  (Luo et al., 2017; Shin et al., 2017) , and introducing a down-converting layer  (Bella et al., 2016; Q. Wang et al., 2017; S. H. Wang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017d) . It is worthy to note that most of the reported top-level photo-stability of PSCs is always carried out by completely eliminating the UV light using a UV filter or adopting a white LED illumination light without UV range  (Jeon et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2017) . These additional processes either damage the device performance or increase the cost, which hinders the commercialization of PSCs  (Leijtens et al., 2013) . Thus, improving the intrinsic stability of perovskite active layer against UV photocatalysis is an essential approach to achieve low-cost and photo-stable PSCs. Here, we first demonstrate that the serious degradation of I-based perovskite under UV photocatalysis is mainly caused by the breakage of weak Pb-I bonds, whereas the Cl-based perovskite possesses the best tolerance for the photocatalysis compared with the Br-based and I-based perovskite owing to the strong Pb-Cl bonds. We introduced a chlorine-rich mixed-halide perovskite (MAPbI X Cl 3-X ) interlayer (ClMPI) between the SnO 2 and I-based perovskite layer through halide exchange to improve the interfacial contact and protect the I-based perovskite layer from damage by the SnO 2 photocatalysis. Such ClMPI could largely mitigate the interfacial recombination, and thus our device achieves an enhanced efficiency of up to 21.01% (certified 20.17%) with reduced hysteresis phenomenon. More importantly, without using any UV filter, the ClMPI-based PSCs show greatly enhanced photo-stability compared with the control ones under different conditions, including outdoor solar irradiation, high-intensity UV irradiation, and 1-sun full spectrum illumination (including UV light). Our work reveals the intrinsic mechanism for the performance degradation in I-based PSCs under UV photocatalysis and provides a fundamental approach for achieving UV-filter-free, photostable, and low-cost PSCs. 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In this work, the planar N-I-P PSCs with a structure of ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au were adopted; the SnO 2 was used as an ETL owing to its high electron mobility, wide band gap, and low-temperature preparation  (Xie et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017a; Baena et al., 2015) . Although the SnO 2 is considered as a material with less photocatalytic activity compared with conventional TiO 2 , it indeed seriously degrades the perovskite under the UV illumination (see later discussion)  (Roose et al., 2016) . To investigate the tolerance of perovskite for photocatalysis generated by SnO 2 , we grew three types of high-quality perovskite single crystals, including MAPbI 3 , MAPbBr 3 , and MAPbCl 3 , as shown in Figure  1A . After grinding the perovskite single crystals into powder, we uniformly mixed these powder and SnO 2 nanoparticles with a molar ratio of 1:1 together and then exposed these mixtures to continuous UV illumination for several days. All the operations were carried out in a N 2 glove box, ruling out the effects of moisture and O 2 . As shown in Figure  1A , the MAPbI 3 :SnO 2 mixtures gradually turned from black to yellow in 48 h and finally became gray within 120 h, whereas the bare perovskite powder remained black at the same condition (Figure  S1 ). It illustrates that SnO 2 indeed induces the accelerated degradation of MAPbI 3 under UV illumination. In comparison, the MAPbBr 3 :SnO 2 mixtures remained red with little gray products and the MAPbCl 3 :SnO 2 mixtures showed no obvious change at the same UV illumination time. The components of these samples were traced by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, as shown in Figures 1B-1D and S2. In the MAP-bI 3 :SnO 2 case, the perovskite peak was largely reduced and a strong PbI 2 (12.7 ) characteristic peak appeared in the spectrum after 120 h UV illumination, whereas there was no PbI 2 peak in the case of pure MAPbI 3 (Figure  S2 )  (Jo et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016a Zhang et al., , 2016b)) . In comparison, the MAPbBr 3 :SnO 2 showed a weak PbBr 2 characteristic peak after 72 h UV exposure and it further increased after 120 h aging (Figures  1C  and S2 ), whereas the PbCl 2 characteristic peak appeared until UV aging for 120 h (Figures  1D  and S2 ). Furthermore, we performed the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis to elucidate the effect of photocatalysis for the stability of different type perovskite. As shown in Figure  S3 , the binding energy (BE) at around 142.8 and 137.9 eV is assigned to 4f 5/2 , 4f 7/2 of divalent Pb 2+ , respectively, and another two peaks at around 141.3 and 136.4 eV are associated with metallic Pb 0  (Wang et al., 2019; Raga et al., 2015) . It was observed that the Pb 0 peak in MAPbI 3 :SnO 2 case increased much faster than those in MAPbBr 3 :SnO 2 and MAPbCl 3 :SnO 2 cases. We calculated the intensity ratio of DPb 0 /Pb sum (Pb sum = Pb 0 + Pb 2+ ) for three mixture samples based on different type perovskite after exposure to 0, 24, 48, 72, and 120 h UV illumination, as shown in Figure  1E . The DPb 0 /Pb sum in the MAPbI 3 /SnO 2 showed a rapid increase and reached 5.42% after exposure to 120 h UV illumination. The gray one we observed corresponds to the color of Pb metal as a decomposition product of MAPbI 3 . At the same condition, the DPb 0 /Pb sum in MAPbBr 3 /SnO 2 and MAPbCl 3 /SnO 2 reached 2.86% and 0.98%, respectively. Based on these findings, we propose the degradation procedure of MAPbI 3 under SnO 2 photocatalysis expressed as the following:  1 ) CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 / CH 3 NH 3 I + PbI 2 (Equation PbI 2 / Pb 0 + I 2 (Equation 2) In the first stage of degradation (Equation  1 ), the moderate PbI 2 product might not be harmful for the stability and efficiency of solar cells. Instead, many reports show that excess PbI 2 at the grain boundary or ETL/perovskite interface can be beneficial to the PSCs performance  (Jiang et al., 2017b; Matsui et al., 2017; Jacobsson et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2019) . However, as the decomposed products of PbI 2 , both Pb 0 and I 2 severely degrade the performance of PSCs, as well as their long-term photo-stability  (Wang et al., 2017a (Wang et al., , 2019;; Adinolfi et al., 2016) . As the decomposed product of MAPbI 3 , PbI 2 is thermodynamically stable since it has a negative standard molar Gibbs formation energy (D f G ɵ ) of À173.6 kJ/mol  (Macdonald and Lide, 2003) , as shown in Figure  1F . However, actually, the PbI 2 can be decomposed through interfacial redox reactions of electron-hole pairs, which are generated upon band gap excitation when SnO 2 is exposed to UV light. The schematic diagram of a possible reaction process is shown in Figure  1F . Owing to the stronger bond strength of Pb-Cl (301 kJ/mol) and Pb-Br (248 kJ/mol) than that of Pb-I (194 kJ/mol)  (Luo, 2017) , the D f G ɵ of PbCl 2 and PbBr 2 are À314.1 and À261.9 kJ/mol  (Macdonald and Lide, 2003) , respectively, both much more negative than that of PbI 2 (À173.6 kJ/mol). The standard redox potentials of the decomposition reactions of PbI 2 , PbBr 2 , and PbCl 2 are À1.8, À2.7, and À3.3 V, respectively, according to the Nernst equation  (Rubi and Kjelstrup, 2003) . It means that much bigger thermodynamic barriers need to be overcome for decomposing the PbCl 2 compared with PbBr 2 and PbI 2 . Thus, we systematically studied the tolerance of PbX 2 (I, Br, Cl) for photocatalysis and the operations were similar to the pervious MAPbX 3 :SnO 2 cases (Figure  S4 ). As shown in Figure  1G , it was observed that the Pb 0 peak in the PbI 2 :SnO 2 case was more notable than those in the PbBr 2 :SnO 2 and PbCl 2 :SnO 2 cases after UV illumination. Furthermore, combining the color change and XRD measurements of the samples, we confirmed that the PbCl 2 is much more stable than PbBr 2 and PbI 2 under photocatalysis, which is consistent with the thermodynamic analysis (Figures  S4  and S5 ). The above-mentioned results illustrate that the strong Pb-Cl bond leads to the suppression of the decomposition of MAPbCl 3 and PbCl 2 under SnO 2 photocatalysis. DG ɵ = ÀnFE ɵ (DG ɵ = ÀD f G ɵ ) Although the MAPbCl 3 shows the best tolerance for the photocatalysis, it is not suitable to be used as a light absorption layer for the efficient PSCs owing to its broad band gap. Then, we devised a means to achieve efficient and UV-stable I-based PSC through preparing a ClMPI between the MAPbI 3 and SnO 2 against the photocatalysis. The procedure includes two steps: (1) the preparation of a uniform NH 4 Cl film on the SnO 2 through precipitation and (2) the formation of a ClMPI at the MAPbI 3 /SnO 2 interface through halide exchange between MAPbI 3 and NH 4 Cl, as shown in Figure  2A . We give the detailed process as following. First, we added a small amount of ammonium hydroxide (NH 4 OH) into SnCl 2 precursor solution and then spin coated the prepared precursor on the ITO substrate. After treating the films at a temperature of 180 C in air, it is expected that the NH 4 Cl can be separated out during the annealing and homogeneously distributed on the surface of the SnO 2 . The NH 4 Cl can be generated according to reaction (3):  3 ) 2SnCl 2 + 4NH 4 OH = 4NH 4 Cl + SnO 2 + 2H 2 O (Equation From the surface top view atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Figure  2B ), we found that the modified SnO 2 (M-SnO 2 ) surface was covered by a uniform NH 4 Cl layer. Thus, the root-mean-square roughness of the M-SnO 2 surface is 3.3 nm, which is much smaller than that of bare SnO 2 (26.1 nm). As shown in Figure  2C , it was found that a spectral peak of N 1s appears at around 401.8 eV for the M-SnO 2 film, whereas the peak of N 1s is lacked for the bare SnO 2 film. The strong spectral peaks of Cl 2p can be also found in the M-SnO 2 film, whereas a very weak signal of Cl 2p that appeared in the bare SnO 2 film might be due to the incomplete oxidation of SnCl 2 (Figure  2D ). Figure  S6  gives the surface top view EDS mappings of the M-SnO 2 , showing that the NH 4 Cl was uniformly distributed on the surface of M-SnO 2 . To clarify the existence of NH 4 Cl, Raman spectra of pure NH 4 Cl, SnO 2 , M-SnO 2 films were conducted. As shown in Figure  2E , the sharpest peak at around 3,051 cm À1 corresponding to the characteristic peak of ammonium chloride can be observed in the M-SnO 2 but cannot be found in the bare SnO 2 . Furthermore, another Raman spectra measurement shows that the NH 4 Cl on the surface of SnO 2 can be well retained after treatment by the DMF/DMSO mixed solvent (Figure  2E ). The MAPbI 3 film was deposited on the M-SnO 2 surface through spin coating and then annealed at 100 C for 10 min. During the annealing, it is expected that the ClMPI will be formed through halide exchange between MAPbI 3 and NH 4 Cl, which can be described as:  4 ) MAPbI 3 + 3NH 4 Cl / MAPbCl 3 + 3NH 4 I (Equation However, as shown in Figure  2F , it is hard to detect the MAPbCl 3 phase by XRD measurement in ClMPIbased sample mostly because of the trace amounts of Cl and the weakened signal by the thick MAPbI 3 films. Thus, we spin-coated the diluted perovskite solution on a thicker NH 4 Cl film; after annealing, an obvious peak at around 15.6 corresponding to MAPbCl 3 perovskite (100) appeared in the XRD spectra (Figure  S7 ) of perovskite film (for detailed information see the experimental section). In a double-checked test, we mixed the single-crystal MAPbI 3 and NH 4 Cl powder uniformly and then treated the mixtures at 100 C for 1 h in inert atmosphere. The color of the MAPbI 3 /NH 4 Cl mixture turned from black to a bit gray after annealing, whereas the color of bare MAPbI 3 showed no obvious change under the same conditions, as shown in Figure  S8 . The XRD results show that the diffraction peaks at 15.6 ascribed to the MAPbCl 3 perovskite also appeared after annealing, confirming that the halide exchange between MAPbI 3 and NH 4 Cl indeed exists (Figure  S9 ). To investigate the distribution of ClMPI in the device, we performed time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) to probe the chemical composition throughout the ITO/M-SnO 2 /perovskite film, as shown in Figure  2G . The result shows that the Cl is mainly accumulated at the perovskite/SnO 2 interface in ClMPI-based sample. In addition, the distribution of I and Cl at the SnO 2 side indicates that the ClMPI could be considered a mixed component of MAPbI X Cl 3-X (X = 0-3); we suggest that the concentration of Cl will gradually decrease from the SnO 2 surface toward the MAPbI 3 active layer. As shown in Figures  2F  and S10 , the ClMPI perovskite film achieves an enhanced crystal quality and increased grain size, which will be beneficial to improve the performance of the device. It could be related to the facilitation effect of the trace amounts of product NH 4 I on perovskite crystallization, which can be supported by previous reports  (Si et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018) .  
 Performance of Devices The cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the optimized device is displayed in Figure  3A , which determined the thickness of $500 nm for the ClMPI-based perovskite layer. Although it is hard to distinguish the ClMPI in SEM, its thickness can be estimated at 10 nm according to the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of Sn_O 2À and Cl À in ToF-SIMS (Figure  2G ) and the thickness of SnO 2 (around 25 nm, Figure  3A ). We systematically optimized the processing parameters for the ClMPI-based devices, and the best photovoltaic performance was attained with a molar ratio of 1:4 for NH 4 OH:SnCl 2, as shown in Figure  S11 . Figure  3B  gives the J-V curves of the champion devices with and without ClMPI. It can be found that overall photovoltaic parameters have been improved for the ClMPI-based devices and the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices increases from 18.08% to 21.01%, with obvious reduction of hysteresis. This is consistent with a rapid increase in stabilized power efficiency to a value of 20.9%, compared with a slower increase to 18% for the control one (Figure  3C  and Table  1 ). As presented in Figure  3D , the histogram with GaussAmp fitting of over 20 devices exhibits an average PCE of 20.2% for the ClMPI-based devices compared with 16.45% for the control devices. The integrated current densities extracted from the typical EQE spectra of ClMPI-based and control devices (Figure  S12 ) are 21.15 and 22.35 mA.cm À2 , respectively, which are closed to the measured values. To verify our device efficiency measurements, we sent one of our unsealed devices to the National Institute of Metrology, China, for independent certification and obtained a PCE of 20.17% (V OC = 1.13 V, J SC = 23.2 mA cm À2 , and FF = 77%), as shown in Figure  S13 . The perovskite layer based on M-SnO 2 exhibits stronger photoluminescence (PL) quenching and faster time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) compared with that based on SnO 2 , indicating the better charge extraction from perovskite to ETLs (Figure  S14  and Table  S1 ). In addition, the lower R S in the ClMPI device also indicates better charge transfer through the ClMPI layer under operation conditions and accounts for the enhanced fill factor, as shown in Figure  S15 . We attribute the better charge extraction at interface to the improved crystal quality and higher carrier concentration of M-SnO 2 (Figures  S16  and S17 ), which are beneficial to the improvement of conductivity. Previous reports demonstrated that the weak alkaline solution is more favorable to the crystallization of SnO 2  (Hiratsuka et al., 1990; Jin et al., 2015; Lupan et al., 2009) . The band alignment between M-SnO 2 (or SnO 2 ) and ClMPI-based perovskite (or perovskite) was determined from UV photoelectron spectroscopy and absorption measurements (Figures  S18  and S19 ). The better match in conduction band between M-SnO 2 and perovskite allowed larger quasi-Fermi level splitting, which is helpful to improve the V OC of the device (Figure  S20 ). The trap density (n t ) is evaluated through space-charge-limited current measurement based on a device structure of ITO/SnO 2 /MAPbI 3 or ClMPIbased MAPbI 3 /PCBM/Ag. As shown in Figure  3E , it can be attained that n t decreases from 3.98310 15 to 3.29310 15 cm À3 after the introduction of ClMPI according to Equation S1. Figure  3F  gives the Mott-Schottky plots 1/C 2 versus voltage attained by EIS measurements for the control and ClMPI-based device. By fitting the voltage dependence of the 1/C 2 curves, we found that the slope of the ClMPI-based device is larger than that of the control device, indicating the reduced interfacial charge density. In addition, these details also demonstrate the higher flat-band potential of the ClMPI-based device compared with the control device, which is related to an improvement in V OC . Owing to the easy breakage of weak Pb-I bond at interface, the undercoordinated Pb and I vacancies will generate in perovskite materials during the device preparation and aging process  (Wang et al., 2019) . Encouragingly, in the ClMPI device, Cl at the interface can result in a stronger binding at the SnO 2 /perovskite interface for PbCl 2 -terminated perovskite. Thus, we attribute the improved interface contact (or reduced interface defects) at SnO 2 /perovskite to the introduction of ClMPI, which possesses a strong Pb-Cl bond and results in the suppression of formation of defects. 
 Photo-Stability Test To explore the effect of UV filters on the efficiency, we give the J-V of an efficient ClMPI-based device before and after using a UV filter, as shown in Figure  4A . The results show that the PCE is reduced from 20.03% to 16.01% mainly owing to the serious decrease of J SC (from 23.23 to 19.02 mA/cm 2 ). It can be confirmed by the stabilized power efficiency of 19.88% for the device without eliminating UV, compared with just 16.26% when a 420-nm UV filter is added, showing around 20% efficiency loss (Figure  4B ). The image in the inset is the transmittances of ITO/M-SnO 2 with and without a UV filter, showing that the UV filter not only absorbs all the light of UV region (<420 nm), but also leads to $10% transmittances loss of visible light from 420 nm to 800 nm. These results show that the application of UV filter not only increases the additional cost, but also seriously reduces the effective output when the device is in operation. We tested the devices stabilities under different conditions without using any UV filter. The first test was designed to verify the stability of the devices under real outdoor atmospheric conditions, where the UV light was really encountered. It is known that UV radiation is present in sunlight and contributes about 3% of the total light output of the Sun at ground level. Several encapsulated devices (to exclude the damage of moisture and oxygen) were exposed on the roof of our laboratory building in Zhejiang University, Hangzhou city, China. These PSCs were subjected to sunlight without UV filters; we provided the statistics of solar irradiation hours during 2 months from November to December 2018, and the stabilities of devices are shown in Figure  4C . The ClMPI-based devices remarkably retained 94% of their initial PCE after 180 h. However, the control device was almost completely degraded within 168 h. In the second test, we exposed the control and ClMPI-based devices to 365-nm UV light with a high power of 100 mW/cm 2 for 500 h (Figure  4D ). The results show that the PCE of the control device showed a constant drop during the UV-induced aging test and reduced to <10% of its original value within 100 h. Encouragingly, the ClMPI-based device still retained over 82% of the original highest value after 500 h. In actual applications, the PSCs should continuously be operated at their maximum power point (MPP) for a long time. Thus, in our last test, the unencapsulated device stability was measured under AM1.5 G Sun illumination at MPP tracking in a N 2 glove box (Figure  4E ). Here, we confirm that our simulator of solar  To better exhibit the effect of UV light on the stability of PSCs, a 420-nm UV filter was used within the initial 200 h illumination (the first test stage) and then we removed the UV filter in the next 500 h illumination (the second test stage). We found that the control and ClMPI-based devices had a similar stability in the first test stage: the control and ClMPI-based device can maintain 90% and 95% of their initial photovoltaic performances, respectively. Such stabilities can be comparable with those of previous works under UVfree test condition  (Turren-Cruz et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2017; Jung et al., 2019) . However, after removing the UV filter, the stability of the control device showed a rapid drop and the PCE decreases to <50% of its original value within only 10 h. In comparison, the ClMPI-based device can maintain >90% of the original PCE after 200 h continuous 1-sun illumination and >80% after 500 h. By calculation, the SPO t 80 lifetime of the ClMPI-based device was 500 h, showing two orders of magnitude improvement compared with the control devices with an SPO t 80 lifetime of only 4 h. The resultant stability of our devices is among the best results reported so far in IMOs-based PSCs under similar test conditions (without a UV filter)  (Bai et al., 2019; Shin et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017c; Li et al., 2018) . We measured the elements distribution of the aged ClMPI device by ToF-SIMS (Figure  S22 ), confirming that the ClMPI still presented. In addition, we directly compared the stability of the control device using a UV filter with that of ClMPI device without UV filter (Figure  S23 ). The ClMPI and control devices showed near linear loss of PCE with relative À0.31% per 10 h and À0.29% per 10 h, respectively, illustrating that our strategy can prevent the PSCs degradation well under UV light. 
 Conclusion In summary, we reveal that the weak Pb-I bond in I-based perovskite is prone to breakage under photocatalysis, leading to serious degradation of the SnO 2 /perovskite interface. It has been demonstrated that the chlorine-based perovskite possesses the best tolerance for photocatalysis compared with the brominebased and iodine-based perovskite owing to the strong Pb-Cl bond. We introduced a ClMPI between the SnO 2 and I-based perovskite, which not only improved the interface contact but also protected the I-based perovskite light absorption layer from damage by photocatalysis. As a result, the device with an enhanced PCE of up to 21.01% (certified 20.17%) with reduced hysteresis phenomenon is achieved. Most importantly, the ClMPI-based device shows enormous enhancement for the photo-stability compared with the control one under different conditions, including outdoor solar irradiation, high-intensity UV irradiation, and 1-sun full spectrum illumination (including UV light). Our work provides a simple and effective method for achieving UV-filter-free, efficient, and photo-stable PSCs. 
 Limitations of the Study In this study, we proposed the degradation procedure of MAPbI 3 under SnO 2 photocatalysis, as expressed in Equations 1 and 2. However, we did not detect the MAI phase through XRD measurements. We are not sure whether the MAI will be decomposed further. More studies are needed to reveal the exact final product of MAPbI 3 under photocatalysis.

In Situ Observation of Vapor-Assisted 2D-3D Heterostructure Formation for Stable and Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells
The heterogeneous stacking of a thin two-dimensional (2D) perovskite layer over the three-dimensional (3D) perovskite film creates a sophisticated architecture for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). It combines the remarkable thermal and environmental stabilities of 2D perovskites with the superior optoelectronic properties of 3D materials which resolves the chronic stability issue with no compromise on efficiency. Herein, we propose the vapor-assisted growth strategy to fabricate highquality 2D/3D heterostructured perovskite films by introducing long-chain organoamine gases in which the 2D layers have a uniform and tunable thickness. The 3D to 2D transformation of the widely adopted MAPbI 3 (MA = methylammonium) film is initiated by the butylamine vapor and monitored through the in situ grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction technique. A variety of 2D species are observed and rationalized by the different collapsing and reconstruction models of the Pb-I octahedra. The PSC devices based on the optimized 2D/3D heterostructures show significant improvements in photovoltaic performances, owing to better energy level alignments, longer carrier lifetimes, and less defects as compared to their 3D analogues. In addition, both the butylamine vapor-treated perovskite films and the derived PSC devices demonstrate exceptional long-term stabilities.
T he stunning progresses made in the development of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention in the photovoltaic community, witnessed by the remarkable advancement of device power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the past decade.  [1] [2] [3] [4]  The main obstacle hindering their commercialization is rooted in the intrinsic instability against heat, light, moisture, and oxygen of the APbI 3 (A = methylammonium, MA; formamidinium, FA; Cs) perovskite materials under device operating conditions. Long-chain organic molecules are thus cast into three-dimensional (3D) perovskite lattices to form twodimensional (2D) or quasi-2D structures, serving as interlayer spacers, passivation agents to reduce defects, and barriers to resist moisture exploiting their hydrophobic nature.  [5] [6] [7] [8]  Longchain alkyl or phenyl-ammonium halides, such as n-butylammonium (BA) iodide or phenylethylammonium iodide, were blended into perovskite precursors to prepare 2D Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with significantly improved long-term stability.  9, 10  Despite all of the intense efforts on film quality optimizations including morphology control and crystal orientation manipulation, the efficiencies of 2D perovskitebased devices still lack far behind their 3D counterparts, mainly due to their inferior optoelectronic properties, such as higher exciton binding energy and shorter charge diffusion length.  [11] [12] [13]  Recently, the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure is proposed in which a thin 2D perovskite capping layer is deposited onto the 3D perovskite film.  [14] [15] [16] [17]  This unique structure combines the merits of the remarkable thermal and humidity stabilities of 2D perovskites and the superior optoelectronic properties (such as strong light absorption and long charge carrier lifetime) of 3D perovskite materials.  [18] [19] [20] [21]  To date, the 2D/3D heterostructures are usually fabricated through wet-chemical approaches by spincoating long-chain organic amine or organoammonium halide salt solutions onto 3D perovskite films.  [22] [23] [24]  The applied solvents (e.g., isopropanol, IPA) will inevitably affect the quality of the underlying perovskite film and the spin-coating process hardly produces a uniform layer which prevents large-scale deployment.  14  New strategies are thus imperative for preparing high-quality 2D/3D heterostructured perovskite films. Organoamine vapors have been successfully employed to aid the fabrication of high-quality 3D perovskite films.  [25] [26] [27] [28] [29]  The organoamine molecules can interact with the 3D perovskite lattices through the dative bonds between N and Pb ions or they can induce cation replacements through redox reactions. Zong et al. exposed MAPbI 3 films to the methylamine vapor and found that the reversible adsorption and desorption of methylamine molecules could significantly improve the morphology of perovskite films.  25  Zhou et al. introduced the formamidine vapor to convert MAPbI 3 films, which led to rapid replacement of MA + by FA + cations in perovskite lattices. The resultant FAPbI 3 film retained the morphology of the original MAPbI 3 film and exhibited remarkable optoelectronic properties.  26  Herein, we propose the vapor-assisted growth strategy to fabricate high-quality 2D/3D heterostructured perovskite films by introducing long-chain organoamine gases. Upon exposure to the butylamine vapor (BAV), the 3D MAPbI 3 films undergo a progressive phase transition from 3D perovskite to 2D/3D heterostructure and finally to 2D structures. To unravel the underlying reaction mechanism, synchrotron-based in situ grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) technique is employed to monitor the entire phase transition process. Both the ionic redox exchange and the coordination reaction between BAV molecules and perovskites are visualized, where the previously reported 2D structures of (BA) 2 PbI 4 and BAPbI 2 and the new 2D species of (BA) 2 Pb 2 I 6 are all encountered. The production of different 2D species is rationalized by various collapsing and reconstruction models of the Pb-I octahedra. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy further reveals that the 3D to 2D transition occurs from the surface to the bottom of the 3D film in a layer-by-layer manner. This enables a uniform 2D capping layer forming on top of the 3D perovskite film with a controllable thickness. Guided by the in situ observations, the optimal 2D/3D heterostructure is constructed for solar cell applications. The devices based on the optimized 2D/3D heterostructured perovskite films show higher PCEs than their 3D analogues. The efficiency enhancement is mainly ascribed to better energy level alignments, longer charge carrier lifetimes, and less defects in the 2D/3D heterostructure films. Remarkably, the 2D/3D perovskite-based devices also demonstrate significantly improved thermal and environmental stabilities. In Situ GI-XRD Studies. The widely adopted ""solvent engineering"" method is applied to prepare the polycrystalline 3D MAPbI 3 films which are subsequently exposed to BAV to initiate the 3D to 2D transition process. As the reaction proceeds, the color of the film gradually changes from dark brown to light brown, and then to yellow (see Figure  S1 ). We expect that BAV molecules will diffuse into and react with the MAPbI 3 film and induce 2D species formation. To uncover the underlying mechanism, the synchrotronbased GI-XRD technique is employed to monitor the entire vapor-assisted reaction process. The MAPbI 3 film is installed in a specially designed characterization cell with Kapton windows to allow the transmission of X-rays and a gas-circulating system to generate the BAV atmosphere and discharge the possible gaseous product.  30  The 2D GI-XRD patterns are collected at an interval of 10 s and selectively presented in Figure  S2 . By integrating the 2D GI-XRD patterns and plotting along the time domain, the 2D intensity-time color mapping can be obtained as shown in Figure  1a , which reveals the crystal structure evolution of the film. Figure  1b  presents the typical horizontal line cuts taken at the specific time points denoted as I, II, III in Figure  1a . Clearly, three distinct states of the sample are encountered during the reaction process. Initially, in the first 2 min of reaction, there are five dominant diffraction peaks at 14.1°, 20.0°, 23.5°, 24.5°and 28.4°, ascribing to the tetragonal MAPbI 3 .  30  Notably, the absence of other diffraction peaks could not preclude the commencing of the reaction. We propose that at this stage of the reaction, BAV molecules start to interact with MAPbI 3 , but there is no large coherent crystalline domain formed to give X-ray diffraction signals. From 2 to 6 min, the film shows the 2D/3D composite features. Besides the diffraction peaks of the 3D perovskite (represented by A in Figure  1b ), new peaks in the lower diffraction angle (2θ) range at 5.7°, 6.4°and 7.8°(denoted as C, B and D respectively at point II in Figure  1b ) emerge. The peak B at 6.4°and the minor peak at 14.6°could be well indexed to the 2D perovskite BA 2 PbI 4 with n = 1 in the general formula of (BA) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 (n represents the number of Pb-I layers in each inorganic slab).  31  However, the peaks C and D could not be indexed to any of the previously reported 2D (BA) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 perovskite species. It was found that the formation of BA 2 PbI 4 from MAPbI 3 degradation was accompanied by the production of PbI 2 .  32  We thus assign peak C to the adduct of BA 2 PbI 4 and PbI 2 and peak D to a PbI 2 related 2D species which we will verify in the following section. As the reaction goes beyond 6 min, a new feature at 5.2°( denoted as E at point III in Figure  1b ) appears while peak C and the 3D peak A disappear. At this stage, the film shows the pure 2D characters, indicating the completion of the 3D to 2D transition. The 2D intensity-time color mapping also enables exclusive visualization of the intensity evolution of each species. Figure  1c  shows the areal intensities of peaks A-E as a function of reaction time (along the vertical direction in Figure  1a ). There are apparently three phase stages (3D, 2D/3D, and 2D) and two transitions for the whole reaction process. During the 3D stage, there is only a slight decrease in the intensity of peak A,  indicating the slow reaction rate. The 3D to 2D transition is further witnessed by the gradual decrease of the peak A intensity and the emergence of peaks B, C, and D. This indicates that BAV molecules first react with MAPbI 3 to form BA 2 PbI 4 (species B) and two other 2D species C and D. After the depletion of the 3D perovskite, the intensity of peak C sharply decreases accompanied by the increase of peaks B and D and the emergence of peak E. We propose that species C further reacts with BAV to form species B, D, and E. The GI-XRD patterns taken at points II and III and the intensity distributions of the Bragg peaks for species B-E plotted along the azimuthal direction are shown in Figure  1d . Evidently, there is a preferential orientation with a single peak centered at 90°for all the 2D species, indicating the horizontal growth of the 2D crystal planes. The pronounced growth tendency of 2D species is related to their formation energy.  33  We propose a Pb-I octahedron collapsing and reconstruction model to rationalize the complex reaction products formed in the 3D to 2D transition process. Upon exposing MAPbI 3 to BAV, redox reactions start with the oxidization of BA to BA + and the reduction of MA + to MA. The subsequent replacement of MA + ions by the larger BA + cations causes the destruction of the 3D tetragonal perovskite lattices by slicing along the (110) planes.  31  In this process, as schematically illustrated in Figure  2 , a layer of iodine atoms shared by two adjacent layers of Pb-I octahedra would redistribute to form two kinds of Pb-I slabs: one is iodine sufficient (denoted as IS) which consists of cornersharing [PbI 6 ] 2-octahedra and electrostatically anchored BA + cations, and the other is iodine deficient (denoted as ID) which consists of corner-sharing [PbI 4 ] octahedra with iodine vacancies. The two different Pb-I slabs are expected to reconstruct in three ways to form distinct 2D products which we assign to species B, C, and D as observed in the in situ GI-XRD study. The stacking of ISs directly forms BA 2 PbI 4 corresponding to species B in the XRD pattern. The collapsing and rearrangement of IDs generate edge-shared PbI 2 which would further interact with BAV via the coordination of the Pb 2+ ion and the lone-pair electrons on N in the BAV molecule to form the Lewis acid-base adduct of BAPbI 2 .  34  It has the smallest lattice spacing (d) along the out-of-plane direction in all three possible products, which we assign to species D with 2θ of 7.8°and d of 11.2 Å. Moreover, the equimolar mixing of IDs and ISs would likely lead to the alternative stacking of BA 2 PbI 4 and the edge-shared PbI 2 to form the 2D product of BA 2 Pb 2 I 6 . The thick BA 2 Pb 2 I 6 is assigned to species C in view that simply adding the thicknesses of BA 2 PbI 4 (13.7 Å) and the edge-shared PbI 2 (1.8 Å) will result in a d-spacing of ∼15.5 Å which is in good accordance with that of species C (2θ of 5.7°and d of 15.5 Å). To verify our hypotheses and confirm the structures of reaction products, two experiments are designed and conducted, namely, (1) exposing the PbI 2 film to BAV and (2) preparing a film with equimolar of BA 2 PbI 4 and PbI 2 and then exposing it to BAV. The in situ GI-XRD results of experiment (1) is presented in Figure  3a . The as-prepared hexagonal PbI 2 film shows the characteristic diffraction peak at 12.6°. After being treated with BAV, a new peak centered at 7.8°emerges which is identical to that of species D. This confirms PbI 2 interacts with BAV to form the adduct of BAPbI 2 . Notably, BAPbI 2 is not stable in the excess BAV and could form a liquidlike film as indicated by a scattering halo in the XRD pattern at the end of experiment (1). The dissolution of PbI 2 in amines was also observed elsewhere.  35  The film prepared in experiment (2) by mixing equimolar of BA 2 PbI 4 and PbI 2 in the precursor solution exhibits intense diffraction peaks at 5.7°, which is in high accordance with that of species C (Figure  3b ). This affirms that species C has the crystal structure of the alternative stacking of BA 2 PbI 4 and edge-shared PbI 2 with the chemical formula of BA 2 Pb 2 I 6 . By further exposing the BA 2 Pb 2 I 6 film to BAV, the intensity of the peak at 5.7°gradually decreases, while the main peaks at 5.2°, 6.4°, and 7.8°emerge, corresponding to species E, B, and D, respectively. This reveals that (BA) 2 Pb 2 I 6 would further interact with BAV to form (BA) 2 Pb 2 I 6 •xBA, BA 2 PbI 4 , and BAPbI 2 . The assignment of the species B-E is further confirmed by the well matching of the large-angle diffraction peaks shown in Figure  S3 . Ex Situ PL and SEM Studies. While the in situ GI-XRD studies can provide a wealth of information about the crystalline contents in the 3D to 2D transition process, the PL technique is more sensitive to substances of low crystallinity and could gain additional information on the reaction. We perform ex situ PL measurements on the MAPbI 3 films treated by BAV for various time durations. As shown in Figure  3c , the PL spectra are taken by illuminating the samples from both the perovskite and substrate (quartz) sides. In accordance with the GI-XRD data, the 3D to 2D transition is observed as the PL peak shifts from 780 nm originating from the 3D MAPbI 3 to 525 nm corresponding to the 2D species (we note that both BA 2 PbI 4 and BA 2 Pb 2 I 6 exhibit the PL peak at 525 nm while BAPbI 2 shows no PL signal). The discrepancy between the PL spectra taken from two illumination directions indicates that the 3D to 2D transition initiates from the top of the 3D film and progresses toward the substrate, which results in the heterogeneous stacking of a 2D layer over the 3D perovskite. Interestingly, the PL peaks centered at 572, 608, and 665 nm, ascribable to the (BA) 2 (MA) n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 perovskites for n = 2, 3 and 4, respectively, are also observed during the 3D to 2D transition.  36  We attribute the 2D perovskites with large n values to the intermediate states where BAV molecules penetrate and slice the 3D perovskite lattice to first form discrete multilayer Pb-I slabs followed by thinning down the Pb-I slabs. The small quantity and discrete nature of the n = 2, 3, and 4 perovskites restrain their observation in the in situ GI-XRD experiments.  33  SEM measurements are further carried out to verify the reaction direction and obtain additional morphological information. Figure  3d  presents the cross-sectional SEM images of the initial 3D, intermediate 2D/3D, and final 2D films. The initial 3D film (top image of Figure  3d ) shows the typical features of polycrystalline perovskite films with the grain size of several hundred nanometers and the film thickness of around 300 nm. After the BAV treatment, the intermediate film (middle image of Figure  3d ) shows a clear phase separation with the 2D capping layer on top of the 3D film. A uniform and seamless interface is formed between the 2D and 3D layers, which could benefit the charge carrier shuttling in the 2D/3D film. The final 2D film (bottom image of Figure  3d ) has ∼3 times larger thickness as compared to the initial 3D film which further confirms the insertion of BAV molecules into the 3D perovskite lattices to form 2D species. Photovoltaic Performance. Through the BAV treatment, a uniform and seamlessly connected 2D capping layer forms directly onto the 3D perovskite film. Previously, various solution-processing approaches have been followed to realize the surface modification of 3D perovskite films.  24, 37  The 2D perovskite layers could effectively eliminate defects and improve humidity and thermal stabilities of perovskite films.  18, 22  We subsequently employ the BAV-treated perovskite films to fabricate PSC devices and optimize the 2D/3D heterostructure by tuning the BAV exposure time. The BAV treatment for the device application follows the similar procedure as for the in situ experiment, which is described in Methods. The devices feature a typical n-i-p structure consisting of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ SnO 2 /perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. The photovoltaic analyses ascertain the BAV treatment could effectively enhance device performances. As given in Table  S1 , the PSC devices based on the 2D/3D heterostucture films with 1 min of the BAV treatment show the best PCE, while the extended treatment adversely affects device performances. The SEM images in Figure  4a ,b show the surface morphology of the 3D and 1 min BAV treated 2D/3D heterostructured perovskite films. Apparently, a thin 2D layer is formed on the 3D perovskite film following the BAV treatment. The minute thickness of the 2D capping layer allows efficient charge carrier shuttling within the heterostructure film and to the hole transport layer (HTL).  4  As shown by the atomic force microscope (AFM) images of the 3D and 2D/3D heterostructured films in Figure  S4 , the film becomes smoother following the BAV treatment, which is beneficial for device applications.  38  The cross-sectional SEM image of the optimized device is shown in Figure  4c . The statistical photovoltaic performances of the devices based on the 2D/3D heterostructure films with the optimal BAV treatment are summarized in Figure  4d -g, taking the 3D perovskite-based devices as references. The devices with the BAV treatment exhibit a narrower efficiency distribution and a 10% increase in the average PCE, mainly ascribed to the higher open circuit voltage (V oc ) and fill factor (FF). The increases in V oc and FF are related to the suppression of nonradiative charge recombination in the devices, demonstrating the defect-passivation effect of the BAV-induced 2D capping layer.  39  Meanwhile, the average short circuit current density (J sc ) also increases slightly, indicating the undisturbed charge carrier transporting in the 2D/3D heterostructure film. Moreover, the improved hysteresis behavior and the elevated stabilized power output of the devices with the BAV treatment further demonstrate the outstanding photovoltaic performances of the 2D/3D heterostructured perovskite films (Figure  S5 ). Optical and Electrical Characterizations. In order to rationalize the superior performances of the BAV treated films, we first investigate the energy level alignments in the devices based on the 2D/3D heterostructure films. The optical bandgaps of the 3D and 2D/3D heterostructured perovskite films are obtained from the Tauc plots (Figure  5a ) taken by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) reflectance spectroscopy.  16  Both the 3D and 2D/3D perovskite films have the absorption edge at 1.55 eV ascribed to MAPbI 3 . However, an additional bandgap at 2.35 eV is found in the 2D/3D perovskite film, originating from the BAV-induced 2D species. The much larger bandgap of the 2D species is mainly due to the quantum confinement effect.  40  The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) results in Figure  5b  show that the 3D and 2D/3D perovskite films have the valence band maxima at -5.6 and -5.48 eV, respectively. As shown in Figure  5c , the energy level diagram is constructed schematically based on the measured bandgap and valence band maximum values. Notably, introducing a 2D capping layer   between the 3D perovskite and HTL is beneficial to photovoltaic application. The higher conduction band of the 2D capping layer could effectively block the back transfer of the photoexcited electrons from the 3D perovskite to HTL, while its well-aligned valence bands ensure efficient hole transporting.  14  We further conduct the steady-state and time-resolved PL measurements to examine the optical properties of the BAVtreated perovskite films. As shown in Figure  5d , compared to the 3D film, the BAV-treated 2D/3D heterostructure film shows 5 times higher peak intensity and a slight blueshift from 776 to 769 nm of the PL peak, which is ascribed to the reduction of trap/ defect states in the film.  41, 42  The time-resolved PL spectra (Figure  5e ) further demonstrate the outstanding defect passivation capability of the BAV treatment. The fitting parameters for the time-resolved PL spectra from the 3D and 2D/3D perovskite films are listed in Table  S2 .  16  The average PL lifetime increases from 129.0 ns for the 3D film to 165.5 ns for the 2D/3D heterostructure film. We subsequently conduct electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements to probe the charge transporting processes in the PSC devices. As shown in Figure  5f , the Nyquist plots show two distinguishable arcs in the high and low frequency ranges. The highfrequency arc is related to the charge transfer resistance (R ct ) at the perovskite and charge transport layer interfaces, while the low-frequency arc is related to the charge recombination resistance (R rec ) in the device. The 3D and 2D/3D perovskite film-based devices show the similar R ct values, indicating the 2D capping layer has a negligible effect on the charge transfer from the perovskite layer to HTL. The R rec value of the 2D/3D heterostructure film-based device is much higher than that of its 3D counterpart (Table  S3 ), which further confirms the suppressed recombination and lower defect density in the BAV-treated films.  43  The recombination lifetime can be determined by τ rec = R rec × C rec and the calculated τ rec of the 2D/3D film-based device (536 μs) is much longer than that of its 3D counterpart (240.8 μs), which further affirms the lower defect density in the 2D/3D heterostructured film-based device.  44  The PL and EIS results clearly demonstrate the passivation effect of the BAV treatment for perovskite films which rationalizes the superior photovoltaic performances (higher V oc and FF) of the corresponding devices. Stability Tests. In addition to photovoltaic performance enhancement, the BAV-induced 2D capping layer is expected to act as an effective barrier to protect perovskite films from moisture and heat. We first investigate the film thermal and environmental stabilities by aging the 3D and 2D/3D heterostructure films at 85 °C in nitrogen atmosphere and in air at room temperature (relative humidity of 30-40%), respectively. We trace the XRD pattern evolutions of the films under different aging conditions, where the degradation of perovskite is signified by the emergence of the PbI 2 diffraction peak (2θ = 12.6°). As shown in Figure  6a  and Figure  S6 , the 2D/ 3D heterostructure film exhibits better heat resistance as the PbI 2 diffraction peak intensity and its relative ratio to the (110) Bragg peak (2θ = 14.1°) intensity of MAPbI 3 are smaller than those of the 3D film. The 2D/3D heterostructure film also demonstrates better environmental stability because there is no discernible sign of degradation after 60 days, whereas there is a strong PbI 2 peak for the 3D film (Figure  6b ). The significant improvements in stabilities of the 2D/3D heterostructure films are ascribed to the 2D capping layers induced by the BAV treatment that could form potential barriers against the escape of volatile species from the perovskite films and the invasion of water molecules into the perovskite films.  45, 46  We also investigate the stabilities of solar cell devices based on the 3D and 2D/3D perovskite films under the same aging conditions. The devices retain 60% of the initial PCE after aging at 85 °C for 125 h (Figure  6c ) and 92% of the initial PCE in air for 600 h (Figure  6d ), outperforming the PSC devices based on the 3D films. Compared to the protective approaches containing insulating polymers or reactive organic halide salts, the BAVinduced 2D layer is effective in charge transport and immune to heat and moisture.  2, 47  Discussion. We have developed an effective vapor-assisted growth strategy to fabricate high-quality 2D/3D heterostructured perovskite films in which the 2D layers have a uniform and tunable thickness. In situ GI-XRD technique is employed to monitor the entire 3D to 2D transition process, where a variety of 2D species are observed and rationalized by the different collapsing and reconstruction models of the Pb-I octahedra. In situ GI-XRD and ex situ PL and SEM studies further reveal that BAV converts the 3D MAPbI 3 into a series of 2D species from the surface down to the bottom of the perovskite film in a layerby-layer manner. The PSC devices based on the optimized 2D/ 3D heterostructure films show significant enhancements in photovoltaic performances, owing to better energy level alignments, longer carrier lifetimes, and less defects as compared to their 3D analogs. In addition, both the BAV-treated perovskite films and the derived PSC devices demonstrate remarkable thermal and environmental stabilities. This work represents a significant step toward highly efficient and stable PSCs that are commensurate with real-world applications. In light of the viable choices of organoamines for 2D perovskites, the current study also paves a new avenue to create novel 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures for high-performance optoelectronic devices with technologically relevant long-term stability. Methods. Materials. All reagents were used without any purification. MAI, PbI 2 , and BAI were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) was purchased from Borun. Chlorobenzene, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 4-tertbutylpyridine (tBP), acetonitrile (ACN), Li-TFSI, and butylamine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. γ-butyrolactone (GBL) was purchased from Acros. BA 2 PbI 4 crystal powders were synthesized following the reported procedure.  31  Film Preparation for the in Situ Experiments. For the MAPbI 3 film, the 1.3 M precursor solution was prepared by dissolving equimolar of CH 3 NH 3 I and PbI 2 in a mixed solvent of GBL and DMSO (7:3 (v/v)). The solution was spun at 2000 rpm for 20 s and 4000 rpm for 40 s on a glass substrate in a N 2 filled glovebox. Two hundred microliters of chlorobenzene was dripped onto the rotating film at 20 s before the end of the spinning process. The film was then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. For the PbI 2 film, the 1 M precursor solution was prepared by dissolving PbI 2 in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO with the volume ratio of 9:1. The solution was spin-coated onto a glass substrate at 5000 rpm for 20 s. The film was then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. For the BA 2 Pb 2 I 6 film, the BA 2 Pb 2 I 6 films were obtained by spin-coating the precursor solution containing 0.225 M PbI 2 and 0.225 M BA 2 PbI 4 crystal powders in DMF at 7000 rpm, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Device Fabrication. Characterizations. The GI-XRD measurements were carried out at beamline BL14B1 of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The incident photon energy was 10 keV (wavelength = 1.2398 Å) at an incident angle of 0.4°and the diffracted X-rays were collected at an interval of 10 s using the 2D Mar225 CCD detector. The sealed cell for the GI-XRD characterization contained a Kapton window allowing the transmission of X-rays and a gas-circulating system to provide and maintain inert atmosphere. During the in situ experiments, BAV was generated by placing an open bottle filled with butylamine liquid in the sealed cell at room temperature. Nitrogen was purged at the rate of 200 mL/min during the experiments to maintain the BAV/N 2 atmosphere. PL measurements were conducted using a HORIBA Scientific Fluorolog-3 photoluminescence spectrometer with an excitation light wavelength of 350 nm. The reflection spectra were obtained using an Agilent Technologies Cary Series UV-vis-NIR Spectrophotometer. Quartz substrates were employed for the PL and UV-vis measurements. The morphology of perovskite films and devices was characterized by the Joel 7800 SEM. UPS measurements were carried out using ThermoFisher ESCA-LANTM 250Xi and the He I (21.22 eV) emission line was employed for excitation. The UPS data were acquired at a bias of -10 V. The J-V measurements for solar cell devices were performed using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter under the illumination of a solar simulator (SS-F5-3A, Enlitech) whose intensity was calibrated by the certified standard silicon solar cell (SRC-2020, Enlitech) at 100 mW/cm 2 . The J-V behaviors were recorded at the reverse scan direction at a rate of 30 mV/s. The active area of the cells was 0.059 cm 2 defined by a metallic shadow mask. The EQE spectra were obtained by employing the solar cell spectral-response measurement system (QE-R, Enlitech) under the direct current mode.

 To fabricate solar cells, ITO substrates were cleaned by successively sonicating in detergent solution, , and isopropanol. The SnO 2 layer was then deposited by spin-coating the 2.5 wt % SnO 2 nanoparticle solution precursor at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 30 min in ambient air. The SnO 2 coated substrate was then transferred into a glovebox where the MAPbI 3 film is further deposited employing the method described above. To conduct the BAV treatment for device application, the MAPbI 3 films were placed in a sealed box which contained an open bottle filled with butylamine liquid (it is noted that the glovebox can provide N 2 atmosphere to protect perovskite films, which avoids N 2 purge used in the in situ GI-XRD experiments). The different 2D/3D stacking films were then prepared by varying the BAV treatment time. The spiro-OMeTAD HTL layer was deposited on top of the perovskite films by spin-coating the precursor solution at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The precursor solution of the HTL contains 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD and 9.1 mg of Li-TFSI in 17.5 μL of ACN and 28.8 μL of tBP in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. The 60 nm Ag layer was then deposited using a thermal evaporator at the rate of 0.5 Å/s. Nano Letters pubs.acs.org/NanoLett Letter acetone

High-performance photovoltaic perovskite layers fabricated through intramolecular exchange
The band gap of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskites allows broader absorption of the solar spectrum compared to conventional methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3). The optoelectronic properties of perovskite films are closely related to the film-quality, so depositing dense and uniform films is crucial for fabricating high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We report an approach for depositing high-quality FAPbI3 films, involving FAPbI3 crystallization by the direct intramolecular exchange of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) molecules intercalated in PbI2 with formamidinium iodide. This process produces FAPbI3 films with (111)preferred crystallographic orientation, large-grained dense microstructures, and flat surfaces without residual PbI2. Using films prepared by this technique, FAPbI3-based PSCs with maximum power conversion efficiency of over 20% were fabricated.
The tremendous improvements in device architecture (1-3), high-quality film formation methodologies  (4) (5) (6) , and compositional engineering of perovskite materials (7-9) over the last 3 years have led to rapid improvements in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Although solar-to-electric PCE of up to 18% has been reported for PSCs  (10) , developing technologies further to achieve PCEs near theoretical values continues to be among the most important challenges in the solar cell industry to achieve economic feasibility. Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) is a perovskite material that can potentially provide better performance than methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) because of its broad absorption of the solar spectrum. In addition, FAPbI3 with the n-i-p architecture (the n-side is illuminated with solar radiation) exhibits negligible hysteresis with sweep direction during current-voltage measurements  (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . However, compared to MAPbI3, it is more difficult to form stable perovskite phases and high-quality films of FAPbI3. Various methodologies such as sequential deposition (4), solventengineering  (5) , vapor-assisted deposition  (14) , additiveassisted deposition  (15, 16) , and vacuum evaporation  (6)  can now produce high-quality films of MAPbI3 with flat surfaces and complete surface coverage by controlling its rapid crystallization behavior and have led to substantial improve-ments in the PCE of MAPbI3based PSCs. Among these methodologies, two-step sequential deposition and solvent-engineering are representative wet processes that can yield perovskite films for high-performance PSCs. In the sequential deposition process, a thin layer of PbI2 is deposited on the substrate. methylammonium iodide (MAI) or formamidinium iodide (FAI) is then applied to the pre-deposited PbI2 to enable conversion to the perovskite phase. This process involves crystal nucleation and growth of the perovskite phase because of solution-phase or solid-state reaction between PbI2 and an organic iodide such as MAI or FAI  (4, 13, 17) . However, the sequential reaction of organic iodides with PbI2 that occurs from the surface to the inner crystalline regions of PbI2 has been ineffective in producing highperformance perovskite films that are > 500 nm in thickness because of incomplete conversion of PbI2, peeling-off of the perovskite film in solution, and uncontrolled surface roughness. In contrast, the solvent-engineering process utilizes the formation of intermediate phases to retard the rapid reaction between PbI2 and organic iodide in the solution. While this process has been successfully used to form dense and uniform MAPbI3 layers, it has not been explored for FAPbI3  (5) . To deposit a uniform and dense FAPbI3 layer, Snaith et al. added a small amount of aqueous HI to a solution mixture containing PbI2, FAI, and dimethylformamide (DMF)  (11) . Very recently, Zhao et al. reported the deposition of highly uniform and fully covered FAPbI3 films using FAI and HPbI3, which is formed by the reaction of PbI2 and HI in DMF  (18) . The HI in the PbI2 layers retards the rapid reaction between FAI and PbI2. In addition, the release of HI from PbI2 at high temperatures allows the formation of a FAPbI3 layer by solid-state reaction with the neighboring FAI molecules. Stated differently, this process can be regarded as the transformation of PbI2-HI-FAI into FAPbI3, similar to the formation of MAPbI3 via the PbI2dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-MAI phase in the solventengineering process  (5) . However, we observed that the solvent-engineering process, which is effective for depositing dense and uniform MAPbI3 layers, yields FAPbI3 layers with pin-holes and a rough surface. Although the FAPbI3 film-quality including coverage and uniformity on the substrate have been improved, the performance of FAPbI3-solar cells still lag behind those of MAPbI3-based PSC  (8) , implying that more sophisticated deposition techniques are necessary for fabricating high-quality, thick FAPbI3 films (> 500 nm), for achieving sufficient absorption up to a wavelength of 840 nm. As expected from the conversion of PbI2-DMSO-MAI to MAPbI3  (5) , the DMSO molecules intercalated in PbI2 can be easily replaced by external FAIs because of its higher affinity toward PbI2 compared to DMSO; the FAI molecules experience ionic interactions, whereas DMSO participates in van der Waals interactions  (5, 19) . Highly uniform and dense pre-deposited PbI2-(DMSO) layers could be directly converted to FAPbI3 because the inorganic PbI2 framework would be retained. FAPbI3 crystallization by the intramolecular exchange process (IEP) of DMSO intercalated in PbI2 with FAI was schematically shown in Fig.  1A . The intramolecular exchange between DMSO and FAI can be described as PbI2-DMSO + FAI → PbI2-FAI + DMSO ↑ (removal)  (1)  and does not induce volume expansion, unlike the FAP-bI3 formed with FAI intercalating into pristine PbI2 (discussed below) because the molecular sizes of DMSO and FAI are similar. In this work, we report on the synthesis of a PbI2-(DMSO) precursor with excellent capabilities for molecular exchange with FAI at low temperatures during the spinning process, as well as the fabrication of highly efficient FAPbI3based PSCs with certified PCEs exceeding 20%. To synthesize the PbI2-(DMSO) precursors, precipitates were obtained by pouring toluene as a non-solvent into 1.0 M PbI2 solution dissolved in DMSO. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the resulting complex (Fig.  1Ba ) matched that of the PbI2(DMSO)2 phase  (5, 19) . The as-prepared PbI2(DMSO)2 was then annealed at 60°C for 24 hours in vacuum to obtain PbI2(DMSO) by removal of 1 mol DMSO. The XRD pattern of the vacuum-annealed powder (Fig.  1Bb ) did not match that of PbI2(DMSO)2, implying that the PbI2(DMSO)2 transformed into a different phase by releasing some DMSO molecules. The content of DMSO in the as-annealed powder was estimated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA was suitable for this purpose because the only volatile species in the powder was DMSO. The TGA results of the PbI2(DMSO)2 and PbI2(DMSO) complexes are shown in Fig.  1C . The PbI2(DMSO)2 complex exhibited a two-step decomposition process with weight-loss of 12.6% at each step, whereas the vacuum-annealed PbI2(DMSO) complex showed a singlestep decomposition. The decomposition of both the complexes was completed at the same temperature (138. 6°C). The powders obtained by vacuum-annealing PbI2(DMSO)2 complex at 60°C can be regarded as one of the most thermodynamically stable forms among the various crystalline PbI2-(DMSO)-based complexes, which are similar with PbBr2(DMSO) and PbCl2(DMSO)  (20) . The DMSO content of the vacuum-annealed PbI2(DMSO) complex was also checked by elemental analysis (EA), which yielded H = 1.0% (1.1%); and C = 4.1% (4.4%), where the values expressed in parenthesis indicate the theoretical mass percent for a given element for C2H6SOPbI2. To fabricate FAPbI3-based PSCs through IEP between DMSO and FAI (MABr) using pre-deposited PbI2-DMSO layers and a FAI (MABr) solution, we first confirmed that the PbI2(DMSO) phase was retained even after spin-coating with the PbI2(DMSO) precursor dissolved in DMF. The XRD pattern for film coated on a fused silica substrate was compared with that of the initial precursor. As seen in Fig.  1Bc , the XRD pattern for the as-coated film was in consistent with that of the PbI2(DMSO) complex powder, although its crystallinity is lowered. The as-coated PbI2(DMSO) film also had a flat and dense surface, as shown in the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image in fig.  S1    (21) . Next, we investigated the formation of mixed FAP-bI3/MAPbBr3 by IEP. We recently reported that the coexistence of MA/FA/I/Br in the PbI2 skeleton improved the phase-stability of FAPbI3  (10) . The formation of mixed FAP-bI3/MAPbBr3 layers via IEP was controlled by coating solution mixture with different mole ratios of MABr to FAI dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (IPA), on the pre-deposited PbI2(DMSO) layers (discussed below). It is evident from Fig.  1Da  that well-crystallized FAPbI3-based films were formed by IEP. The XRD pattern for the FAPbI3 film derived from the PbI2(DMSO) complex film exhibits dominant (-111) and (-222) diffraction peaks at 13.9° and 28.1°, respectively, corresponding to the FAPbI3 trigonal perovskite phase (P3m1), in contrast with the XRD patterns of the FAPbI3 powder (Fig.  1Db )  (13) . The intensity ratio of (-123) peak at 31.5 ° to the (-222) peak at 28.1° was 0.05. This value was much smaller than the corresponding intensity ratios (= 0.8) for the FAPbI3 power. Thus, IEP leads to high-quality pure FAPbI3-based films with preferred orientation along the [111] axis. Fig. S2  (21)  presents the current density-voltage (J-V) curves measured under standard air-mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) illumination, and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the fabricated cells with FAPbI3-based layers fabricated with various amounts of MABr (0 to 20 mol%). The onset wavelength in the EQE spectra near 830 nm showed a non-linear blue shift with increasing amounts of MABr, indicating that there is unsymmetrical competition between FAI and MABr in forming the FAPbI3-MAPbBr3 perovskite phase through an intramolecular exchange reaction. Nevertheless, the highest PCE of 19.2% was achieved for the film fabricated from a FAI solution containing 15 mol% MABr. To accurately determine the composition of the FAPbI3-based layer, we investigated the lattice parameter using XRD and the band gap using the EQE for the film showing the best performance. Fig.  S3  (21) shows the pseudocubic lattice parameter for (FAPbI3)1-x(MAPbBr3)x as a function of x, in which the composition was controlled by a previously reported method  (10) . In this study, the pseudocubic lattice parameter of the FAPbI3/MAPbBr3 film fabricated by IEP with a FAI solution containing 15 mol% MABr is 6.348 Å. As indicated in fig.  S4    (21) , the lattice parameter can be assigned as x = ~ 5, corresponding to (FAP-bI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05. This result is in agreement with the value estimated using the band gap (1.49 eV) from EQE [fig. S3  (21) ], because pure FAPbI3 has a band gap of 1.47 eV and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, 1.55 eV  (10) . Fortunately, the simultaneous introduction of both MA + cations and Br -anions in FAPbI3 even after incorporating 5 mol% of MAPbBr3 serves to stabilize the perovskite phase  (10) . After comparing the absorption coefficients of FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 at wavelengths beyond 800 nm, we noted that the thickness of a FAPbI3 layer needed to be higher than the optimal thickness of a typical perovskite layer with a band gap of ~1.55 eV (300 to 400 nm) to guarantee fully lightharvesting around 800 nm  (20, 22) . We deposited FAPbI3based layers with thickness of ~ 500 nm, and fabricated devices consisting of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)glass/barrier layer (bl)-TiO2/mesoporous (mp)-TiO2/perovskite/poly-triarylamine (PTAA)/Au (n-i-p architecture), as shown in the cross-sectional FESEM image of Fig.  2A . FESEM plane-view images of the device with film derived from PbI2(DMSO) complex and PbI2 films are shown in Fig.  2B . The FAPbI3 film derived from PbI2(DMSO) exhibited a dense and well-developed grain structure with larger grains than the FAPbI3 film derived from PbI2. Figure  2Ca  shows the J-V curves measured via reverse and forward bias sweep for one of the best-performing solar cell. The devices we fabricated also showed no hysteresis. Here, we believe that the hysteresis is highly dependent on the perovskite materials (FAPbI3 or MAPbI3) and cell architecture (n-i-p or p-i-n), although the ferroelectric properties of the perovskite itself are more likely to be the origin of the hysteresis in PSCs  (23, 24) . Thus, FAPbI3-based PSCs with n-i-p architecture show negligible hysteresis between the reverse and the forward scan in the I-V characteristics. In contrast, FAPbI3based cells consisting of FTO/NIO/ perovskite/PCBM/LiF/Al (p-i-n architecture) showed very strong hysteresis [fig.  S4 (21) ]. JSC, VOC, and FF determined from the J-V curves were 24.7 mA cm -2 , 1.06 V, and 77.5%, respectively, and correspond to a PCE of 20.2% under standard AM 1.5G illumination. Figure  2Cb  shows the EQE spectrum and integrated JSC for one of the best-performing solar cell. The high JSC is attributed to a very broad EQE plateau of >85% in the illumination wavelength range of 400 to 780 nm and broad lightharvesting up to a long wavelength of 840 nm, owing to the relatively low band gap (1.47 eV) of FAPbI3. The JSC value (24.4 mA cm -2 ) obtained by integrating EQE spectrum agreed well with that derived from the J-V measurement. The PCE of the best-performing cell (20.2%) was certified by the standardized method in the PV calibration laboratory, which confirmed a PCE of 20.1% under AM 1.5 G full-sun illuminations [fig.  S5 (21) ]. To gain more insight into the enhanced performance of the FAPbI3-based PSCs, we compared the properties of the films fabricated by IEP with those obtained from a conventional sequential process. A sequential reaction such as inter-diffusion between FAI/MAI and PbI2 through thermal annealing in organic iodide/PbI2 multilayer films has been used to form perovskite FAPbI3/MAPbI3 films from inorganic PbI2 films in the conventional process  (17) . Thus, considerable volume expansion occurs in the sequential deposition process based on PbI2 because of the growth of perovskite crystals with the insertion of organic iodides into PbI2 skeleton  (14, 22) . As expected, an initial PbI2 film with thickness of ~ 290 nm was doubled to 570 nm for the film formed by the reaction of PbI2 with FAI [Table  1  and fig.  S6 (21) ]. In contrast, the change in thickness observed by the application of the FAI (MABr) solution to the pre-deposited PbI2-(DMSO) film was negligible. In fact, the reaction between FAI (MABr) and PbI2(DMSO) was completed within 1 min during spin-coating and the FAPbI3 perovskite phase was formed without sequential annealing. However, in a conventional process using PbI2 films, annealing at high temperature is required to achieve interdiffusion. Figure  3A  compares XRD patterns for as-formed and annealed films by IEP and conventional process from PbI2(DMSO) complex film and PbI2 film, respectively; there is no appreciable difference in XRD patterns between as-formed and annealed film. This result confirms that the FAPbI3-based layer is formed by the IEP of DMSO and FAI (MABr) without additional annealing process. In addition, such an exchange can considerably favor crystallization into perovskite, compared to conventional interdiffusion from PbI2, and led to an increase in the XRD peaks intensity after annealing at 150°C for 20 min. However, the as-formed film with PbI2 showed XRD patterns assigned to PbI2, FAI, and FAPbI3, and a (002) peak at 12.5° corresponding to the PbI2 still remains after annealing at same temperature and time with IEP. In particular, the FAPbI3 film prepared by IEP is remarkably preferred (111)-oriented compared to FAPbI3 film annealed after preparing it by conventional process. The advantages of IEP become further apparent upon comparing the J-V curves and PCEs of FAPbI3-based devices derived from PbI2(DMSO) complex films and conventional PbI2 films (Fig.  3, B  and C ). The devices based on FAPbI3 fabricated from PbI2(DMSO) showed superior PCEs with smaller deviations in the value, compared to those prepared from conventional PbI2 films. High-efficiency solar cells with average PCEs of over 19% could be produced with a high degree of reproducibility by using the IEP. This study provides an effective protocol for fabricating efficient and cost-effective inorganic-organic hybrid heterojunction solar cells.    The tremendous improvements in device architecture (1-3), high-quality film formation methodologies (4-6), and compositional engineering of perovskite materials (7-9) over the last 3 years have led to rapid improvements in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Although solar-to-electric PCE of up to 18% has been reported for PSCs  (10) , developing technologies further to achieve PCEs near theoretical values continues to be among the most important challenges in the solar cell industry to achieve economic feasibility. Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) is a perovskite material that can potentially provide better performance than methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) because of its broad absorption of the solar spectrum. In addition, FAPbI3 with the n-i-p architecture (the n-side is illuminated with solar radiation) exhibits negligible hysteresis with sweep direction during current-voltage measurements  (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . However, compared to MAPbI3, it is more difficult to form stable perovskite phases and high-quality films of FAPbI3. Various methodologies such as sequential deposition (4), solventengineering (5), vapor-assisted deposition (  14 ), additiveassisted deposition  (15, 16) , and vacuum evaporation (  6 ) can now produce high-quality films of MAPbI3 with flat surfaces and complete surface coverage by controlling its rapid crystallization behavior and have led to substantial improve-ments in the PCE of MAPbI3based PSCs.

Highly uniform and dense pre-deposited PbI2-(DMSO) layers could be directly converted to FAPbI3 because the inorganic PbI2 framework would be retained. FAPbI3 crystallization by the intramolecular exchange process (IEP) of DMSO intercalated in PbI2 with FAI was schematically shown in Fig.  1A . The intramolecular exchange between DMSO and FAI can be described as PbI2-DMSO + FAI → PbI2-FAI + DMSO ↑ (removal) (1) and does not induce volume expansion, unlike the FAP-bI3 formed with FAI intercalating into pristine PbI2 (discussed below) because the molecular sizes of DMSO and FAI are similar. In this work, we report on the synthesis of a PbI2-(DMSO) precursor with excellent capabilities for molecular exchange with FAI at low temperatures during the spinning process, as well as the fabrication of highly efficient FAPbI3based PSCs with certified PCEs exceeding 20%. To synthesize the PbI2-(DMSO) precursors, precipitates were obtained by pouring toluene as a non-solvent into 1.0 M PbI2 solution dissolved in DMSO. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the resulting complex (Fig.  1Ba ) matched that of the PbI2(DMSO)2 phase  (5, 19) . The as-prepared PbI2(DMSO)2 was then annealed at 60°C for 24 hours in vacuum to obtain PbI2(DMSO) by removal of 1 mol DMSO. The XRD pattern of the vacuum-annealed powder (Fig.  1Bb ) did not match that of PbI2(DMSO)2, implying that the PbI2(DMSO)2 transformed into a different phase by releasing some DMSO molecules. The content of DMSO in the as-annealed powder was estimated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA was suitable for this purpose because the only volatile species in the powder was DMSO. The TGA results of the PbI2(DMSO)2 and PbI2(DMSO) complexes are shown in Fig.  1C . The PbI2(DMSO)2 complex exhibited a two-step decomposition process with weight-loss of 12.6% at each step, whereas the vacuum-annealed PbI2(DMSO) complex showed a singlestep decomposition. The decomposition of both the complexes was completed at the same temperature (138. 6°C). The powders obtained by vacuum-annealing PbI2(DMSO)2 complex at 60°C can be regarded as one of the most thermodynamically stable forms among the various crystalline PbI2-(DMSO)-based complexes, which are similar with PbBr2(DMSO) and PbCl2(DMSO)  (20) . The DMSO content of the vacuum-annealed PbI2(DMSO) complex was also checked by elemental analysis (EA), which yielded H = 1.0% (1.1%); and C = 4.1% (4.4%), where the values expressed in parenthesis indicate the theoretical mass percent for a given element for C2H6SOPbI2. To fabricate FAPbI3-based PSCs through IEP between DMSO and FAI (MABr) using pre-deposited PbI2-DMSO layers and a FAI (MABr) solution, we first confirmed that the PbI2(DMSO) phase was retained even after spin-coating with the PbI2(DMSO) precursor dissolved in DMF. The XRD pattern for film coated on a fused silica substrate was compared with that of the initial precursor. As seen in Fig.  1Bc , the XRD pattern for the as-coated film was in consistent with that of the PbI2(DMSO) complex powder, although its crystallinity is lowered. The as-coated PbI2(DMSO) film also had a flat and dense surface, as shown in the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image in fig.  S1 (21) . Next, we investigated the formation of mixed FAP-bI3/MAPbBr3 by IEP. We recently reported that the coexistence of MA/FA/I/Br in the PbI2 skeleton improved the phase-stability of FAPbI3  (10) . The formation of mixed FAP-bI3/MAPbBr3 layers via IEP was controlled by coating solution mixture with different weight ratios of MABr to FAI dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (IPA), on the pre-deposited PbI2(DMSO) layers (discussed below). It is evident from Fig.  1Da  that well-crystallized FAPbI3-based films were formed by IEP. The XRD pattern for the FAPbI3 film derived from the PbI2(DMSO) complex film exhibits dominant (-111) and (-222) diffraction peaks at 13.9° and 28.1°, respectively, corresponding to the FAPbI3 trigonal perovskite phase (P3m1), in contrast with the XRD patterns of the FAPbI3 powder (Fig.  1Db )  (13) . The intensity ratio of (-123) peak at 31.5 ° to the (-222) peak at 28.1° was 0.05. This value was much smaller than the corresponding intensity ratios (= 0.8) for the FAPbI3 power. Thus, IEP leads to high-quality pure FAPbI3-based films with preferred orientation along the [111] axis.   (10) . Fortunately, the simultaneous introduction of both MA + cations and Br -anions in FAPbI3 even after incorporating 5 mol% of MAPbBr3 serves to stabilize the perovskite phase  (10) . After comparing the absorption coefficients of FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 at wavelengths beyond 800 nm, we noted that the thickness of a FAPbI3 layer needed to be higher than the optimal thickness of a typical perovskite layer with a band gap of ~1.55 eV (300 to 400 nm) to guarantee fully lightharvesting around 800 nm  (20, 22) . We deposited FAPbI3based layers with thickness of ~ 500 nm, and fabricated devices consisting of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)glass/barrier layer (bl)-TiO2/mesoporous (mp)-TiO2/perovskite/poly-triarylamine (PTAA)/Au (n-i-p architecture), as shown in the cross-sectional FESEM image of Fig.  2A . FESEM plane-view images of the device with film derived from PbI2(DMSO) complex and PbI2 films are shown in Fig.  2B . The FAPbI3 film derived from PbI2(DMSO) exhibited a dense and well-developed grain structure with larger grains than the FAPbI3 film derived from PbI2. Figure  2Ca  shows the J-V curves measured via reverse and forward bias sweep for one of the best-performing solar cell. The devices we fabricated also showed no hysteresis. Here, we believe that the hysteresis is highly dependent on the perovskite materials (FAPbI3 or MAPbI3) and cell architecture (n-i-p or p-i-n), although the ferroelectric properties of the perovskite itself are more likely to be the origin of the hysteresis in PSCs  (23, 24) . Thus, FAPbI3-based PSCs with n-i-p architecture show negligible hysteresis between the reverse and the forward scan in the I-V characteristics. In contrast, FAPbI3based cells consisting of FTO/NiO/ perovskite/PCBM/LiF/Al (p-i-n architecture) showed very strong hysteresis [fig.  S4  (21) ]. JSC, VOC, and FF determined from the J-V curves were 24.7 mA cm -2 , 1.06 V, and 77.5%, respectively, and correspond to a PCE of 20.2% under standard AM 1.5G illumination. Figure  2Cb  shows the EQE spectrum and integrated JSC for one of the best-performing solar cell. The high JSC is attributed to a very broad EQE plateau of >85% in the illumination wavelength range of 400 to 780 nm and broad lightharvesting up to a long wavelength of 840 nm, owing to the relatively low band gap (1.47 eV) of FAPbI3. The JSC value (24.4 mA cm -2 ) obtained by integrating EQE spectrum agreed well with that derived from the J-V measurement. The PCE of the best-performing cell (20.2%) was certified by the standardized method in the PV calibration laboratory, which confirmed a PCE of 20.1% under AM 1.5 G full-sun illuminations [fig.  S5 (21) ]. To gain more insight into the enhanced performance of the FAPbI3-based PSCs, we compared the properties of the films fabricated by IEP with those obtained from a conventional sequential process. A sequential reaction such as inter-diffusion between FAI/MAI and PbI2 through thermal annealing in organic iodide/PbI2 multilayer films has been used to form perovskite FAPbI3/MAPbI3 films from inorganic PbI2 films in the conventional process  (17) . Thus, considerable volume expansion occurs in the sequential deposition process based on PbI2 because of the growth of perovskite crystals with the insertion of organic iodides into PbI2 skeleton  (14, 22) . As expected, an initial PbI2 film with thickness of ~ 290 nm was doubled to 570 nm for the film formed by the reaction of PbI2 with FAI [Table  1  and fig.  S6 (21) ]. In contrast, the change in thickness observed by the application of the FAI (MABr) solution to the pre-deposited PbI2-(DMSO) film was negligible. In fact, the reaction between FAI (MABr) and PbI2(DMSO) was completed within 1 min during spin-coating and the FAPbI3 perovskite phase was formed without sequential annealing. However, in a conventional process using PbI2 films, annealing at high temperature is required to achieve interdiffusion. Figure  3A  compares XRD patterns for as-formed and annealed films by IEP and conventional process from PbI2(DMSO) complex film and PbI2 film, respectively; there is no appreciable difference in XRD patterns between as-formed and annealed film. This result confirms that the FAPbI3-based layer is formed by the IEP of DMSO and FAI (MABr) without additional annealing process. In addition, such an exchange can considerably favor crystallization into perovskite, compared to conventional interdiffusion from PbI2, and led to an increase in the XRD peaks intensity after annealing at 150°C for 20 min. However, the as-formed film with PbI2 showed XRD patterns assigned to PbI2, FAI, and FAPbI3, and a (002) peak at 12.5° corresponding to the PbI2 still remains after annealing at same temperature and time with IEP. In particular, the FAPbI3 film prepared by IEP is remarkably preferred (111)-oriented compared to FAPbI3 film annealed after preparing it by conventional process. The advantages of IEP become further apparent upon comparing the J-V curves and PCEs of FAPbI3-based devices derived from PbI2(DMSO) complex films and conventional PbI2 films (Fig.  3, B  and C ). The devices based on FAPbI3 fabricated from PbI2(DMSO) showed superior PCEs with smaller deviations in the value, compared to those prepared from conventional PbI2 films. High-efficiency solar cells with average PCEs of over 19% could be produced with a high degree of reproducibility by using the IEP. This study provides an effective protocol for fabricating efficient and cost-effective inorganic-organic hybrid heterojunction solar cells.    T he tremendous improvements in device architecture (1-3), high-quality film formation methodologies (4-6), and compositional engineering of perovskite materials (7-9) over the past 3 years have led to rapid improvements in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Although solarto-electric PCEs of up to 18% have been reported for PSCs  (10) , developing technologies further to achieve PCEs near theoretical values (>30%) continues to be an important challenge in making the solar cell industry economically competitive. Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) is a perovskite material that can potentially provide better performance than methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ) because of its broad absorption of the solar spectrum. In addition, FAPbI 3 with the n-i-p architecture (the n-side is illuminated with solar radiation) exhibits negligible hysteresis with sweep direction during current-voltage measurements  (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . However, it is more difficult to form stable perovskite phases and highquality films with FAPbI 3 than with MAPbI 3 . Various methodologies such as sequential deposition (4), solvent engineering (  5 ), vapor-assisted deposition (  14 ), additive-assisted deposition  (15, 16) , and vacuum evaporation (  6 ) can now produce high-quality films of MAPbI 3 with flat surfaces and complete surface coverage by controlling its rapid crystallization behavior and have led to substantial improvements in the PCE of MAPbI 3based PSCs. Among these methodologies, two-step sequential deposition and solvent engineering are representative wet processes that can yield perovskite films for high-performance PSCs. In the sequential deposition process, a thin layer of PbI 2 is deposited on the substrate; methylammonium iodide (MAI) or formamidinium iodide (FAI) is then applied to the predeposited PbI 2 to enable conversion to the perovskite phase. This process involves crystal nucleation and growth of the perovskite phase because of solution-phase or solidstate reaction between PbI 2 and an organic iodide such as MAI or FAI  (4, 13, 17, 18) . However, the sequential reaction of organic iodides with PbI 2 that occurs from the surface to the inner crystalline regions of PbI 2 has been ineffective in producing high-performance perovskite films that are >500 nm in thickness because of incomplete conversion of PbI 2 , peeling off of the perovskite film in solution, and uncontrolled surface roughness. In contrast, the solvent-engineering process uses the formation of intermediate phases to *These authors contributed equally to this work. †Corresponding author. E-mail: seoksi@krict.re.kr Table  1 . Comparison of layer thickness before and after FAPbI 3 phase is formed by conventional and intramolecular exchange process (IEP). The thin PbI 2 and PbI 2 (DMSO) layers were deposited on a fused quartz glass, and their layer thickness was measured by alpha-step IQ surface profiler. retard the rapid reaction between PbI 2 and organic iodide in the solution. Although this process has been successfully used to form dense and uniform MAPbI 3 layers, it has not been explored for FAPbI 3  (5) . 
 Method To deposit a uniform and dense FAPbI 3 layer, Snaith et al. added a small amount of aqueous hydrogen iodide (HI) to a solution mixture containing PbI 2 , FAI, and dimethylformamide (DMF)  (11) . Very recently, Zhao et al. reported the deposition of highly uniform and fully covered FAPbI 3 films using FAI and HPbI 3 , which is formed by the reaction of PbI 2 and HI in DMF  (19) . The HI in the PbI 2 layers retards the rapid reaction between FAI and PbI 2 . In addition, the release of HI from PbI 2 at high temperatures allows the formation of a FAPbI 3 layer by solid-state reaction with the neighboring FAI molecules. Stated differently, this process can be regarded as the transformation of PbI 2 -HI-FAI into FAPbI 3 , similar to the formation of MAPbI 3 via the PbI 2 -dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-MAI phase in the solvent-engineering process  (5) . However, we observed that the solventengineering process, which is effective for depositing dense and uniform MAPbI 3 layers, yields FAPbI 3 layers with pinholes and a rough surface. Although aspects of FAPbI 3 film quality, including coverage and uniformity on the substrate, have   SCIENCE sciencemag.org 
 RESEARCH | REPORTS Downloaded from  https://www.science.org  at University of California San Diego on November 07, 2024 been improved, the performance of FAPbI 3 solar cells still lags behind that of MAPbI 3 -based PSCs  (8) , implying that more sophisticated deposition techniques are necessary for fabricating highquality, thick FAPbI 3 films (>500 nm) that would enable sufficient absorption up to a wavelength of 840 nm. As expected from the conversion of PbI 2 (DMSO)-MAI to MAPbI 3  (5) , the DMSO molecules intercalated in PbI 2 can be easily replaced by external FAIs because of their higher affinity toward PbI 2 relative to DMSO; the FAI molecules experience ionic interactions, whereas DMSO participates in van der Waals interactions  (5, 20) . Highly uniform and dense predeposited PbI 2 -DMSO layers could be directly converted to FAPbI 3 because the inorganic PbI 2 framework would be retained. FAPbI 3 crystallization by the intramolecular exchange process (IEP) of DMSO intercalated in PbI 2 with FAI was schematically shown in Fig.  1A . The intramolecular exchange between DMSO and FAI can be described as PbI 2 -DMSO þ FAI → PbI 2 -FAI þ DMSO ↑ ðremovalÞ ð1Þ and does not induce volume expansion, unlike the FAPbI 3 formed with FAI intercalating into pristine PbI 2 (discussed below), because the molecular sizes of DMSO and FAI are similar. In this work, we report on the synthesis of a PbI 2 (DMSO) precursor with excellent capabilities for molecular exchange with FAI at low temperatures during the spinning process, as well as the fabrication of highly efficient FAPbI 3based PSCs with certified PCEs exceeding 20%. To synthesize the PbI 2 (DMSO) precursors, we obtained precipitates by pouring toluene as a nonsolvent into 1.0 M PbI 2 solution dissolved in DMSO. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the resulting complex [Fig.  1B(a) ] matched that of the PbI 2 (DMSO) 2 phase  (5, 20) . The as-prepared PbI 2 (DMSO) 2 was then annealed at 60°C for 24 hours in vacuum to obtain PbI 2 (DMSO) by removal of 1 mol DMSO. The XRD pattern of the vacuum-annealed powder [Fig.  1B(b) ] did not match that of PbI 2 (DMSO) 2 , implying that the PbI 2 (DMSO) 2 transformed into a different phase by releasing some DMSO molecules. The content of DMSO in the as-annealed powder was estimated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA was suitable for this purpose because the only volatile species in the powder was DMSO. The TGA results of the PbI 2 (DMSO) 2 and PbI 2 (DMSO) complexes are shown in Fig.  1C . The PbI 2 (DMSO) 2 complex exhibited a two-step decomposition process with weight loss of 12.6% at each step, whereas the vacuumannealed PbI 2 (DMSO) complex showed a singlestep decomposition. The decomposition of both the complexes was completed at the same temperature (138.6°C). The powders obtained by vacuum-annealing PbI 2 (DMSO) 2 complex at 60°C can be regarded as one of the most thermodynamically stable forms among the various crystalline PbI 2 (DMSO)-based complexes, which are similar to those of PbBr 2 (DMSO) and PbCl 2 (DMSO)  (21) . The DMSO content of the vacuum-annealed PbI 2 (DMSO) complex was also checked by elemental analysis, which yielded H = 1.0% (1.1%); and C = 4.1% (4.4%), where the values expressed in parentheses indicate the theoretical mass percent for a given element in C 2 H 6 SOPbI 2 . To fabricate FAPbI 3 -based PSCs through IEP between DMSO and FAI (MABr) using predeposited PbI 2 (DMSO) layers and a FAI (MABr) solution, we first confirmed that the PbI 2 (DMSO) phase was retained even after spin-coating with the PbI 2 (DMSO) precursor dissolved in DMF. The XRD pattern for film coated on a fused silica substrate was compared with that of the initial precursor. As seen in Fig.  1B(c ), the XRD pattern for the as-coated film was consistent with that of the PbI 2 (DMSO) complex powder, although its crystallinity was lower. The as-coated PbI 2 (DMSO) film also had a flat and dense surface, as shown in the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image in fig.  S1    (22) . Next, we investigated the formation of mixed FAPbI 3 /MAPbBr 3 by IEP. We recently reported that the coexistence of MA/FA/I/Br in the PbI 2 skeleton improved the phase stability of FAPbI 3  (10) . The formation of mixed FAPbI 3 /MAPbBr 3 layers via IEP was controlled by coating the solution mixture with different weight ratios of MABr to FAI, dissolved in isopropyl alcohol, on the predeposited PbI 2 (DMSO) layers (see below). It is evident from   the FAPbI 3 -MAPbBr 3 perovskite phase through an intramolecular exchange reaction. Nonetheless, the highest PCE of 19.2% was achieved for the film fabricated from a FAI solution containing 15 wt% MABr. To accurately determine the composition of the FAPbI 3 -based layer, we investigated the lattice parameter using XRD and the band gap using the EQE for the film showing the best performance. Figure S3  (22)  shows the pseudocubic lattice parameter for (FAPbI 3 ) 1-x (MAPbBr 3 ) x as a function of x, in which the composition was controlled by a previously reported method  (10) . In this study, the pseudocubic lattice parameter of the FAPbI 3 / MAPbBr 3 film fabricated by IEP with a FAI solution containing 15 wt% MABr is 6.348 Å. As indicated in fig.  S4    (22) , the lattice parameter can be assigned as x = ~5, corresponding to (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 . This result is in agreement with the value estimated using the band gap (1.49 eV) from EQE [fig.  S3 (22) ], because pure FAPbI 3 has a band gap of 1.47 eV and (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 has a band gap of 1.55 eV  (10) . Fortunately, the simultaneous introduction of both MA + cations and Br -anions in FAPbI 3 even after incorporating 5 mol% of MAPbBr 3 serves to stabilize the perovskite phase  (10) . After comparing the absorption coefficients of FAPbI 3 and MAPbI 3 at wavelengths beyond 800 nm, we noted that the thickness of a FAPbI 3 layer needed to be higher than the optimal thickness of a typical perovskite layer with a band gap of ~1.55 eV (300 to 400 nm) to guarantee full light harvesting around 800 nm  (21, 23) . We deposited FAPbI 3 -based layers with thickness of ~500 nm, and fabricated consisting of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-glass/barrier layer (bl)-TiO 2 /mesoporous (mp)-TiO 2 /perovskite/ polytriarylamine (PTAA)/Au (n-i-p architecture), as shown in the cross-sectional FESEM image of Fig.  2A . FESEM plane-view images of the device with film derived from PbI 2 (DMSO) complex and PbI 2 films are shown in Fig.  2B . The FAPbI 3 film derived from PbI 2 (DMSO) exhibited a dense and well-developed grain structure with larger grains than the FAPbI 3 film derived from PbI 2 . Figure  2C(a)  shows the J-V curves measured via reverse and forward bias sweep for one of the best-performing solar cells. The devices we fabricated also showed no hysteresis. Here, we believe that the hysteresis is highly dependent on the perovskite materials (FAPbI 3 or MAPbI 3 ) and cell architecture (n-i-p or p-i-n), although the ferroelectric properties of the perovskite itself are more likely to be the origin of the hysteresis in PSCs  (24, 25) . Thus, FAPbI 3 -based PSCs with n-i-p architecture show negligible hysteresis between the reverse and the forward scan in the I-V characteristics. In contrast, FAPbI 3based cells consisting of FTO/NiO/perovskite/ PCBM/LiF/Al (p-i-n architecture) showed very strong hysteresis [fig.  S4 (22) ]. Values of shortcircuit current density (J SC ), open-circuit voltage (V OC ), and fill factor (FF) determined from the J-V curves were 24.7 mA cm -2 , 1.06 V, and 77.5%, respectively, and correspond to a PCE of 20.2% under standard AM 1.5G illumination. Figure  2C(b)  shows the EQE spectrum and integrated J SC for one of the best-performing solar cell. The high J SC is attributed to a very broad EQE plateau of >85% in the illumination wavelength range of 400 to 780 nm and broad lightharvesting up to a long wavelength of 840 nm, owing to the relatively low band gap (1.47 eV) of FAPbI 3 . The J SC value (24.4 mA cm -2 ) obtained by integrating EQE spectrum agreed well with that derived from the J-V measurement. The PCE of the best-performing cell (20.2%) was certified by the standardized method in the PV calibration laboratory, which confirmed a PCE of 20.1% under AM 1.5 G full-Sun illuminations [fig.  S5 (22) ]. To gain more insight into the enhanced performance of the FAPbI 3 -based PSCs, we compared the properties of the films fabricated by IEP with those obtained from a conventional sequential process. A sequential reaction such as interdiffusion between FAI/MAI and PbI 2 through thermal annealing in organic iodide/PbI 2 multilayer films has been used to form perovskite FAPbI 3 / MAPbI 3 films from inorganic PbI 2 films in the conventional process  (17, 18) . Thus, considerable volume expansion occurs in the sequential deposition process based on PbI 2 because of the growth of perovskite crystals with the insertion of organic iodides into PbI 2 skeleton  (14, 23) . As expected, an initial PbI 2 film with thickness of ~290 nm was doubled to 570 nm for the film formed by the reaction of PbI 2 with FAI [Table  1  and fig.  S6 (22) ]. In contrast, the change in thickness observed by the application of the FAI (MABr) solution to the predeposited PbI 2 (DMSO) film was negligible. In fact, the reaction between FAI (MABr) and PbI 2 (DMSO) was completed within 1 min during spin-coating and the FAPbI 3 perovskite phase was formed without sequential annealing. However, in a conventional process using PbI 2 films, annealing at high temperature is required to achieve interdiffusion. Figure  3A  compares XRD patterns for as-formed and annealed films by IEP and conventional process from PbI 2 (DMSO) complex film and PbI 2 film, respectively; there is no appreciable difference in XRD patterns between as-formed and annealed film. This result confirms that the FAPbI 3 -based layer is formed by the IEP of DMSO and FAI (MABr) without additional annealing process. In addition, such an exchange can considerably favor crystallization into perovskite, compared to conventional interdiffusion from PbI 2 , and led to an increase in the XRD peaks intensity after annealing at 150°C for 20 min. However, the asformed film with PbI 2 showed XRD patterns assigned to PbI 2 , FAI, and FAPbI 3 , and a (002) peak at 12.5°corresponding to the PbI 2 still remained after annealing at same temperature and time with IEP. In particular, the FAPbI 3 film prepared by IEP shows preferred orientation in the (111) direction compared to FAPbI 3 film annealed after preparing it by conventional process. The advantages of IEP become further apparent upon comparing the J-V curves and PCEs of FAPbI 3 -based devices derived from PbI 2 (DMSO) complex films and conventional PbI 2 films (Fig.  3, B  and C ). The devices based on FAPbI 3 fabricated from PbI 2 (DMSO) showed superior PCEs with smaller deviations in the value, compared to those prepared from conventional PbI 2 films. High-efficiency solar cells with average PCEs of >19% could be produced with a high degree of reproducibility by using the IEP.

Finally, an Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation; the active area of this electrode was fixed at 0.16 cm 2 . 
 Characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the prepared films were measured using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with an X-ray tube (Cu Kα, λ=1.5406Å). The morphology of the films was observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (MIRA3 LMU, Tescan). The elemental analysis (C, H, N and S) of the complex was performed using a FISONS EA_1108 CHN analyser. Thermal gravity (TG) analyses of the asprepare PbI 2 -(DMSO) complex powders were performed with a heating rate of 2 ºC/min from RT up to 300 ºC under nitrogen atmosphere using TA Instruments SDT 2960. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by a power source (Newport 300W Xenon lamp, 66920) with a monochromator (Newport Cornerstone 260) and a multimeter (Keithley2001). The J-V curves were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) with a source meter (Keithley 2420) at 100 mA/cm 2 illumination AM 1.5 G and a calibrated Sireference cell certificated by NREL. The J-V curves were measured by reverse (forward bias (1.2 V)  short circuit (0 V)) or forward (short circuit (0 V)  forward bias (1.2 V)) scan. The step voltage and the delay time were fixed at 10 mV and 40 msec, respectively. The delay time is a delay set at each voltage step before measuring each current. The J-V curves for all devices were measured by masking the active area with a metal mask (area of 0.096 cm 2 ).       Fig. 1 . 1 Fig. 1. PbI2-complex formation and X-ray diffraction.

 Fig. S2 (21) presents the current density-voltage (J-V) curves measured under standard air-mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) illumination, and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the fabricated cells with FAPbI3-based layers fabricated with various amounts of MABr (0 to 20 wt%).The onset wavelength in the EQE spectra near 830 nm showed a non-linear blue shift with increasing amounts of MABr, indicating that there is unsymmetrical competition between FAI and MABr in forming the FAPbI3-MAPbBr3 perovskite phase through an intramolecular exchange reaction. Nevertheless, the highest PCE of 19.2% was achieved for the film fabricated from a FAI solution containing 15 wt% MABr. To accurately determine the composition of the FAPbI3-based layer, we investigated the lattice parameter using XRD and the band gap using the EQE for the film showing the best performance. Fig.S3(21) shows the pseudocubic lattice parameter for (FAPbI3)1-x(MAPbBr3)x as a function of x, in which the composition was controlled by a previously reported method(10). In this study, the pseudocubic lattice parameter of the FAPbI3/MAPbBr3 film fabricated by IEP with a FAI solution containing 15 mol% MABr is 6.348 Å. As indicated in fig.S4(21), the lattice parameter can be assigned as x = ~ 5, corresponding to (FAP-bI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05. This result is in agreement with the value estimated using the band gap (1.49 eV) from EQE [fig. S3 (21)], because pure FAPbI3 has a band gap of 1.47 eV and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, 1.55 eV

The intensity ratio of the (-123) peak at 31.5°to the (-222) peak at 28.1°was 0.05. This value was much smaller than the corresponding intensity ratios (0.8) for the FAPbI 3 powder.

Because the optoelectronic properties of perovskite films are closely related to film quality, deposition of dense and uniform films is crucial for fabricating high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We report an approach for depositing high-quality FAPbI 3 films, involving FAPbI 3 crystallization by the direct intramolecular exchange of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) molecules intercalated in PbI 2 with formamidinium iodide. This process produces FAPbI 3 films with (111)-preferred crystallographic orientation, large-grained dense microstructures, and flat surfaces without residual PbI 2 . Using films prepared by this technique, we fabricated FAPbI 3 -based PSCs with maximum power conversion efficiency greater than 20%.

The film stress can be calculated according to the relationship between 2θ and sin 2 φ as the following equation  [8]  ： σ = - E 2(1+υ) π 180 cot θ 0 ∂ (2θ ) ∂ sin 2 φ (1) where E and υ are Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the perovskite film, respectively. θ0 is the diffraction peak for strain-free perovskite crystal plane and θ is the diffraction peak for the measured perovskite films. φ is the angle of diffraction vector with respect to the sample normal direction. Here, the values of E and υ are 10200 MPa and 0.3, respectively. By fitting the 2θ as a function of sin 2 φ, we can calculate perovskite film strain from formula (1), and the slope of the fitted line stands for the scale of the residual strain, the negative slope indicates the films bear tension strain. It is found that the δ-phase formed in the 0% DBSO sample was completely transformed into α-phase perovskite within approximately 30 s, but after annealing, the formed α-phase perovskite possesses lower diffraction peak intensity and larger halfpeak width (Supplementary Figure  11 ). By contrast, the intermediate phase in the 10% DBSO sample disappeared within approximately 10 s, while the fully annealed film shows much stronger α-phase diffraction peaks with smaller half-peak widths. This comparison highlights the important role of DBSO additive in promoting perovskite αphase crystal growth. For XRD measurement, we prepared perovskite precursor film samples in N2 glove box and put it into a sealed chamber. Then, the samples were quickly transferred for XRD testing (The XRD instrument is in the lab on the next floor of the device fabrication lab). When annealing, the perovskite film was kept in a N2 filled small chamber and placed on a temperature controlled hotplate for different time. The annealing hotplate was placed nearby the XRD instrument. When testing, the annealed sample was quickly taken out for XRD measurement. nature energy  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01288-7   
 Article Reduction of bulk and surface defects in inverted methylammonium-and bromide-free formamidinium perovskite solar cells Rui Chen 1 , Jianan Wang      Power conversion efficiencies of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on methylammonium-and bromide-free formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) perovskites still lag behind PSCs with a regular configuration. Here we improve the quality of both the bulk and surface of FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 perovskite films to reduce the efficiency gap. First, we use dibutyl sulfoxide, a Lewis base additive, to improve the crystallinity and reduce the defect density and internal residual stress of the perovskite bulk. Then, we treat the surface of the perovskite film with trifluorocarbon-modified phenethylammonium iodide to optimize the energy levels, passivate defects and protect the film against moisture. The inverted PSCs simultaneously achieve 25.1% efficiency (24.5% from the reverse current-voltage scan measured by a third-party institution) and improved stability. The devices maintained 97.4% and 98.2% of their initial power conversion efficiencies after operating under continuous 1-sun air mass 1.5 G illumination for 1,800 h and under damp heat conditions (85 °C and 85% relative humidity) for 1,000 h, respectively.  
 Modulation of perovskite films crystal growth First, we optimized the preparation process of FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 -based perovskite films; a small amount of caesium is introduced to stabilize the black phase of FAPbI 3 -based perovskite  11  . We found that it is easier to prepare pin-hole free FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 -based films with DMF/NMP solvent mixture rather not the commonly used DMF/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in a N 2 -filled glove box (Supplementary Fig.  1 ), which is similar to the results reported in ref. 22. Starting from the DMF/NMP solvent, we further modified it by adding DBSO (longer-chain analogue of DMSO) as a coordination agent to modulate the perovskite growth (Supplementary Tables  2  and 3 ). The longer alkyl chains incorporated in DBSO result in its higher boiling point (250 °C versus 189 °C) and stronger electron donating power (Gutmann donor number, 31.0 versus 29.8) as compared with DMSO, which enables more stable coordination with PbI 2 than the DMSO case and also NMP case (donor number of 27.3) as demonstrated below. Such properties play an important role in control of perovskite crystal growth and defects concentration in the resultant FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 films. The effects of different DBSO additive contents (0%, 5%, 10% and 20%, molar ratio to PbI 2 ) on the morphology and crystal size of perovskite films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig.  1a , the average grain size in the perovskite films gradually increases from 260 to 378 and 466 nm following the increase in the DBSO content from 0% to 5% and then to 10%. When the DBSO content further increases to 20%, the average crystal size slightly decreases to 432 nm (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). When the amount of DBSO further increases to 40%, many micron-level cracks are observed in the resultant perovskite films (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), which may be due to DBSO residue caused by excessive addition (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). Therefore, using an appropriate amount of DBSO is the key factor to improving the film quality. Figure  1b ,c shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite films before and after annealing with different DBSO content. As can be seen, the non-annealed precursor film with 0% DBSO exhibits a δ-phase diffraction peak at 11.8°, while the addition of DBSO inhibits the formation of δ-phase in the non-annealed films thus leading to the increased amount of α-phase perovskite with the main peak at 14.0° and a new phase with the main peak at 6.3°. Furthermore, increase in the content of DBSO from 5% to 10% and then to 20% is accompanied by the gradual increase in the XRD peak intensity of the new phase, while the peaks of α-phase perovskite gradually decay. These findings indicate that DBSO induces the formation of a new crystalline intermediate phase facilitating the formation of α-phase perovskite. The diffraction peak at 6.3° is attributed to the formation of DBSO•PbI 2 intermediate phase similar to other Lewis base-PbI 2 intermediate phases  10, 23  (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). The interactions between DBSO, PbI 2 and formamidinium iodide (FAI) are confirmed by comparing the Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectra of the DBSO, DBSO•PbI 2 , FAI and FAI•PbI 2 •DBSO samples (Fig.  1d , Supplementary Fig.  6  and Supplementary Table  4 ). The sulfoxide S=O bond stretching vibration peak of DBSO located at 1,028 cm -1 shifted to 968 cm -1 in the DBSO•PbI 2 sample, which is owing to the formation of dative bond by sharing the lone pair electrons in oxygen with Pb 2+ . And the C=N double bond stretching vibration peak of FAI at 1,697 cm -1 shifted to 1,712 cm -1 in the FAI•PbI 2 •DBSO sample. This phenomenon is similar to the peak shift induced by coordination between other Lewis bases to PbI 2 and FAI  22, 24  . Although it has been widely reported that many Lewis bases can lead to the formation of intermediate phases (for example, DMSO•PbI 2 and NMP•PbI 2 ) in the perovskite precursor films, it is noteworthy that the specific DBSO•PbI 2 intermediate phase is much more stable than NMP•PbI 2 , so it could resist the instantaneous anti-solvent extraction process (Supplementary Figs.  7 8 9 ). Note that the amount of NMP in our solvent system is large, but the amount of the NMP•PbI 2 intermediate phase in the obtained non-annealed films is negligibly low after the anti-solvent washing process. Based Therefore, it is particularly urgent to improve the efficiency of inverted PSCs at the current stage. Screening the performance optimization strategies reported for high-efficiency (>25%) regular PSCs 2-6 reveals that methylammonium (MA + )-and bromide (Br -)-free formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 )-based perovskites are commonly employed because of their ideal bandgap close to the Shockley-Queisser optimum. The resultant devices typically simultaneously demonstrate high short-circuit current density (J SC ) of ~26 mA cm  -2  , and high open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.17-1.19 V (Supplementary Table  1 ). The high-efficiency (>24%) inverted PSCs  [11] [12] [13] [14]  usually incorporated FAPbI 3 as the main component with small amounts of MA + and Br -as additives, which may be beneficial for achieving higher V OC , but also lead to a slight sacrifice of J SC (Supplementary Table  1 ) due to the optical loss caused by blue-shifted absorbance. Li  with a lower V OC of 1.095 V. In addition, the introduction of MA + and Br -to FAPbI 3 could raise risk to induce problems such as low thermal stability caused by the existence of MA, phase separation caused by the presence of mixed halides, and reduced photon absorption and current density cause by Br -incorporation  [15] [16] [17]  . Although some recent literature reported controversal results that the incorporation of small portions of MA + , Br -in hybrid perovskites is benefit for stability improvement  18, 19  . FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 has been widely recognized as the most attractive material for PSCs exhibiting both high efficiencies and good thermal stability  20  . Until now, the highest certified efficiency of inverted PSCs based on MA + -and Br --free formamidinium cesium perovskite is only 23.5% with V OC of 1.14 V (ref. 11). Thus, it is desirable to further optimize inverted PSCs based on the MA + -and Br --free formamidinium cesium perovskites. So far, key strategies implemented in those high-efficiency inverted PSCs mainly focused on optimizing interfacial materials and surface passivation of perovskite absorber films  [11] [12] [13] [14] 21  . Beyond these strategies, the management of the bulk and surface defects in perovskite films is of equal importance to achieve an efficient and stable inverted PSCs. In this Article, we report an optimization strategy to simultaneously manage the bulk and surface defects in FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 perovskite films to enable high-performance inverted PSCs. Firstly, a low-volatile dibutyl sulfoxide (DBSO) Lewis base additive with a strong coordination ability was introduced into the N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent system, thus leading to the formation of a stable intermediate phase of DBSO•PbI 2 in the precursor film even after anti-solvent extraction. Such intermediate phase can suppress the formation of undesirable δ-phase FA-perovskite and modulate perovskite crystal growth. The proposed improved film fabrication strategy leads to perovskite films with larger grain size and reduced internal film stress and bulk defects. In addition, 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) phenethylammonium iodide (denoted as 2CF 3 -PEAI) was introduced as an interface passivator designed to simultaneously adjust interfacial energy levels, passivate surface defects of the perovskite films and stabilize the films against moisture with help from the presence of hydrophobic CF 3 groups. As a result, the devices demonstrated impressive PCEs of up to 25.1% (24.5% from reverse scan was measured by a third-party institution) owing to the use of the high-quality FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 films. Moreover, the encapsulated devices showed stable operation in air under continuous 1-sun air mass (AM) 1.5 G illumination for up to 1,800 h without notable efficiency decay and also pass the damp heat test (85 °C and 85% relative humidity (RH)) according to the international standards for mature photovoltaics (IEC61215). on the molecular structures of NMP, DBSO and PbI 2 octahedral, we used density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the interaction energy between PbI 2 and the two coordination molecules (Fig.  1e, f ). The interaction energy between PbI 2 and DBSO (-1.42 eV) is much higher than that between PbI 2 and NMP (-1.03 eV), and also higher than the interaction energy between PbI 2 and DMSO (-1.01 eV; Supplementary Fig.  10 ) due to the stronger electron donating of DBSO than the other two Lewis bases. This difference could explain why the   
 Characterization of the perovskite film's quality XRD patterns of the annealed perovskite films made from different precursor solutions show that all the films transform into α-phase FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 perovskite after annealing at 150 °C for 20 min (Fig.  1c ). With the increasing content of DBSO loading from 0% to 5% and then to 10%, the XRD peak intensity gradually increases, thus indicating the enhancement of the perovskite crystallinity. This is consistent with the increased grain size upon DBSO addition as observed by SEM. The perovskite crystal growth mechanisms can be explained by two different pathways as described in Fig.  1g . In the case of 0% DBSO sample, the δ-phase transition to α-phase occurs directly during annealing; while in the 10% DBSO sample a molecular exchange between DBSO•PbI 2 intermediate phase and FAI is controlling the α-phase crystal growth upon annealing. It has been widely reported that the intermediate phase or molecular exchange dominated crystal growth could reduce the activation energy of the perovskite crystal formation, which normally leads to larger crystalline grain size in the as-fabricated perovskite films  23, 25  . We also conducted XRD characterization to monitor the crystal structure evolution from the as-coated films to fully crystallized perovskite films during annealing (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). The obtained results further confirm the important role of the DBSO•PbI 2 intermediate phase in promoting the crystallinity of the obtained α-phase FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 films. When the DBSO content further increases to 20%, the XRD diffraction peak intensity becomes slightly lower, which is also consistent with the SEM data discussed above. It is well known that the internal residual stress in perovskite films can promote the formation of atomic vacancies, increase non-radiative recombination, reduce carrier mobility and structural stability, and thus deteriorate the photovoltaic performance of devices  [26] [27] [28] [29]  . We employed grazing incident XRD to test the residual stress at the 50 nm and 200 nm depth regions of the perovskite films obtained using different DBSO content (Supplementary Tables  5  and 6 ). The results show that the tensile stress at 200 nm (Fig.  2a  and Supplementary Fig.  12 ) and 50 nm (Fig.  2b  and Supplementary Fig.  13 ) gradually release with the increasing DBSO content from 0% to 5% and then to 10%. In addition, Williamson-Hall analysis also confirmed that the introduction of DBSO can relax the lattice strain (Supplementary Fig.  14 ). This phenomenon may be related to the following two reasons  30  : first, when DBSO•PbI 2 reacts with FAI to form perovskite, the formation energy of α-phase perovskite can be significantly reduced, thereby avoiding the formation of δ-phase nuclei in the precursor film. Thus, the tensile stress caused by cell volume shrinkage during the transformation of δ-phase to α-phase in the case of the 0% DBSO samples could be avoided (Supplementary Fig.  15a, b ). Second, the tensile stress remaining at the grain boundaries due to the lattice expansion during high-temperature annealing of perovskite could be further released by reducing the number of grain boundaries when using optimal concentrations of DBSO additive (Supplementary Fig.  15c ). Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) (Fig.  2c ) and transient PL spectroscopy (Fig.  2d  and Supplementary Fig.  16 ) were used to evaluate the non-radiative carrier recombination behaviour of the perovskite films made from different DBSO additive content. The results show that the addition of DBSO, especially for 10% content, could effectively suppress the fast non-radiative decay component. As can be seen, benefitted from strain relaxation, the fitted carrier lifetime increases from 423 ns (0% DBSO) to 613 ns (5% DBSO) and finally to 708 ns (10% DBSO). The 20% DBSO sample has a shorter PL lifetime (525 ns), which is consistent with its reduced crystallinity (Fig.  1c ). Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy was further used to analyse the carrier dynamics in the perovskite films with and without DBSO addition (Fig.  2e, f ). It can be seen that the attenuation rate of ground-state bleaching of perovskite film decreases significantly when DBSO is added, and the single exponential kinetic model delivered the lifetimes of 9.89 ns (0% DBSO) and 32.56 ns (10% DBSO) (Supplementary Fig.  17 )  31, 32  , which again verified the decrease in defect density within the DBSO-based films. The above results consistently show that using appropriate DBSO loading can effectively release residual stress within the film and reduce defect density due to the ability of this additive to modulate the perovskite crystal growth. These effects inhibit the non-radiative recombination of charge carriers and improve the carrier lifetime. To optimize the content of DBSO, we prepared inverted PSCs with the ITO/p-PY/FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 /PCBM/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag configuration; the typical cross-sectional SEM image of the device is shown in Supplementary Fig.  18 . p-PY is an efficient and stable hole transport material incorporating pyridine core functionalized with poly(triarylamine) units as we reported recently  33, 34  . Supplementary Fig.  19  shows the current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the devices based on the perovskite films with different DBSO content. It can be seen that PCE reaches the highest values when DBSO content is close to 10% (Supplementary Fig.  20 ). As compared with the reference 0% DBSO samples, J SC of the 10% DBSO device increases from 24.88 mA cm -2 to 25.68 mA cm -2 , V OC increases from 1.024 V to 1.091 V, fill factor (FF) increases from 0.792 to 0.805, and PCE increases from 20.2% to 22.6% (Supplementary Table  7 ). The improved device performance is assigned to the reduced defect density and improved carrier lifetimes caused by the use of DBSO additive. 
 Effect of the surface passivation In addition to the reduction of bulk defects within the perovskite films by using DBSO additive engineering, we designed phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) derivatives containing different fluorocarbon (CF 3 ) functional groups as surface modification reagents to further passivate the defects in the perovskite films. Molecular structures of the PEAI derivatives CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI are shown in Fig.  3a . Top-view SEM images revealed that the surface morphology of the perovskite films after modifications with PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI did not change significantly (Supplementary Fig.  21 ), which is consistent with the recent report  35  . To further identify the states of above passivators on the perovskite, we performed TA spectroscopy of the perovskite films treated with PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI to accurately identify whether 2D phase perovskites were formed in the corresponding perovskite films (Supplementary Fig.  22 ). Both perovskite films showed the characteristic peaks at about 580 nm belonging to n = 2 low-dimensional perovskites  21  , which could block minority carriers from the interface/surface  36  . From the viewpoint of molecular engineering, the CF 3 electron-withdrawing groups could adjust the passivators' molecular dipole moment and hydrophobicity, whereas the size difference among the PEA + , CF 3 -PEA + and 2CF 3 -PEA + cations may also influence their diffusion depths into the bulk of perovskite films. To study this point, we conducted time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurements on the films (based on F signals; Fig.  3e ). We also used F-PEA + to substitute PEA + by deliberately introducing F element but not significantly affect the size of organic cation. It is found that 2CF 3 -PEA + cations show the shallowest diffusion depth and F-PEA + cations show the deepest diffusion depth. This observation is due to the 2CF 3 -PEA + cation having the largest steric hindrance effect, impeding its inward diffusion. This was also confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiles (Supplementary Fig.  23 ). The distribution of passivator is considered to affect the surface electrical properties and chemical stability of the films. To study the surface electrical properties of perovskite films with different passivator, the electrostatic potentials (φ max ) of PEA, CF 3 -PEA and 2CF 3 -PEA were characterized, which were determined to be 183.39, 187.19 and 189.42 kcal mol -1 , respectively. 2CF 3 -PEA has the largest electrostatic potential, that is, the highest dipole moment Article  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01288-7   among the three molecules due to the presence of two CF 3 groups with strong electron-withdrawing ability. The electric field generated by the interfacial dipole can change the vacuum energy level and work function of the adjacent material  [37] [38] [39]  . We further studied this issue by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Supplementary Fig.  24 ) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig.  25 ) measurements. Work functions of the pristine perovskite films and the films treated with PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI or 2CF 3 -PEAI are estimated as 4.83, 4.69, 4.61 and 4.58 eV, respectively (Fig.  3b ). This is almost consistent with the evolution of the film surface potentials measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) for the above four conditions (Supplementary Fig.  26 ). The energy level of PCBM was obtained according to previous report  40  . The introduction of an extra back-surface field is an effective way to improve device's V OC , which is widely applied in crystalline silicon solar cells and has recently been demonstrated in high-efficiency PSCs  11, 37  . The extra back electric field caused by the stronger dipole moment of the surface modifiers may be an important factor enabling the device's higher V OC in this work. According to previous reports  41, 42  , the terminal group of CF 3 has a strong electron-withdrawing ability, making CF 3 capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the amino group in FA + and reducing the generation of A-site vacancies, thus improving the performance of the device. In addition, the surface passivation of the perovskite absorber films with PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI can bring additional functions such as compensation of the loss of I -ions during the annealing process and chelation of the exposed undercoordinated Pb 2+ ions  43, 44  . The effect of passivators on the carrier dynamic of perovskite films was further studied. Transient PL (Fig.  3c  and Supplementary Fig.  27 ) and steady-state PL (Supplementary Fig.  28 ) spectra show that the non-radiative recombination becomes further inhibited and the fitted PL lifetime is increased from 0.7 (pristine) to 1.1 (PEAI), 1.4 (CF 3 -PEAI) and 1.6 µs (2CF 3 -PEAI), respectively, after the corresponding surface  passivation. This tendency indicates that 2CF 3 -PEAI enables the best surface passivation effect among the three studied passivators. The transient PL lifetime (Fig.  3d  and Supplementary Fig.  29 ) of the perovskite/PCBM stacks reflects the difference in interfacial charge transfer rate after the surface passivation. In principle, the Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime as extracted from the slower decay (τ 2 ) is related to the important interfacial recombination  45  . The 2CF 3 -PEAI-treated perovskite films show longer lifetime at the same excitation condition, which indicates that 2CF 3 -PEAI enables the best surface passivation effect among the three studied passivators. The obtained results show that the PL lifetime is increased from 21.3 (pristine) to 38.9 (PEAI), 34.6 (CF 3 -PEAI) and finally to 23.5 ns (2CF 3 -PEAI). In comparison with their strongly positive effect on carrier lifetimes within the perovskite absorber films, the modification has negligible impact on the resultant devices' J SC 37 . The lowest 2D perovskite signals in 2CF 3 -PEAI sample indicates that the introduction of two CF 3 groups could suppress the formation of 2D perovskite, which may be helpful for defect passivation. The above results confirm that 2CF 3 -PEAI possesses the best surface defects passivation capability, which might be related to its shallowest diffusion depth as compared with other studied organic cations  46  . The loss of iodine caused by thermal annealing mainly happens at the surface of the perovskite film. Thus, 2CF 3 -PEAI with its low diffusion depth could enrich the perovskite surface with iodide thus leading to efficient defect passivation. The large size of 2CF 3 -PEAI also prevents its deep diffusion into the interior of the film, which could destroy the ideal three-dimensional (3D) perovskite lattice.  
 Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01288-7   Figure  3f  shows the external quantum efficiencies of electroluminescence (EQE-EL) of PSCs based on the perovskite films with different passivators. It is well known that V OC of a solar cell is directly related to its internal luminescence efficiency  44  . In this case, when the injection current density is set to the value equal to J SC under solar illumination, EQE-EL of the pristine device is 0.2%. EQE-EL of the PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI surface passivated devices were shown to be 0.8%, 1.5% and 5.2%, respectively. Based on the formula ΔV OC = k B T/qln(EQE passivation / EQE pristine )  44  , it can be estimated that the V OC improvement after surface passivation with PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI are 36, 52 and 84 mV, respectively. The tendency is well consistent with the experimentally observed V OC variation in the devices discussed below. To quantify the V OC potential for every individual stack, we calculated the internal electron-hole quasi-Fermi level splitting from PLQY results (Supplementary Figs.  30  and 31 ) according to previous method  47, 48  , which indicated effectively suppressing non-radiative recombination by interface passivation. 
 Performance and stability of PSCs Figure  4a  shows the J-V curves of the p-i-n PSCs without and with different surface passivation. It was observed that J SC does not change significantly and the enhancement of PCE associated with the surface passivation is mainly due to the increase in V OC and FF (Supplementary Table  8 ). The champion PCE reached for the 2CF 3 -PEAI passivated device was 25.1%, with a J SC of 25.88 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.176 V and an FF of 0.825, while the hysteresis effect was negligible (Supplementary Fig.  32 ). The steady-state PCE of the device was 25.0% (Supplementary Fig.  33 ), which is very close to the PCE obtained from the reverse voltage sweep J-V curve. EQE spectrum of the corresponding device is shown in Supplementary Fig.  34 . The integral short circuit current density calculated from the EQE spectrum is 25.74 mA cm -2 , which is nearly identical to the J SC value extracted from J-V measurements. We also sent one of the best devices to a credible third-party organization and got a certified efficiency of 24.5%, with J SC of 25.75 mA cm -2 , V OC of 1.167 V and FF of 0.815 (Supplementary Fig.  35 ). Furthermore, the device performance was very well reproducible (Fig.  4b  and Supplementary Fig.  36 ). Although the efficiency of the fabricated devices is still a little bit lower than that of the best regular PSCs, the measured operation lifetime of our inverted PSCs is much longer. This indicates the potential advantage of inverted PSCs in simultaneously achieving high efficiency and long-term operational stability. Besides the impact on photovoltaic performance, defects also considerably affect device operational stability because defect sites disrupt the original lattice arrangement and thus change the thermodynamic energy of the perovskite decomposition and phase change  49  . To study the influence of our defects management strategy on the device stability, we monitored the long-term ageing behaviour of the encapsulated devices based on different passivators using maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under continuous AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm -2 illumination in ambient air (cell temperature 50 ± 5 °C, 50 ± 5% RH) (Fig.  4c ). The device based on pristine perovskite films (initial PCE 21.4%) degraded to 67.2% of its initial PCE after 780 h. The PEAI and CF 3 -PEAI passivated devices (initial PCEs of 22.3% and 23.6%, respectively) degraded correspondingly to 72.3% and 82.1% of their initial PCEs after 1,800 h. The 2CF 3 -PEAI passivated device (initial PCE 24.5%) still retained 97.4% of the initial PCE after 1,800 h; the screen capture image demonstrating its continuous power output within almost the entire testing time is shown in Supplementary Fig.  37 . Since the defects at surface and grain boundaries are the active sites where perovskites have loose chemical binding, which facilitate severe ion migration and degradation, the most effective passivation of 2CF 3 -PEAI and the highest surface hydrophobicity (Fig.  4c ) are considered as the main reason for operational stability improvement. This is further supported by the highest activation energy of perovskite degradation of 2CF 3 -PEAI passivation versus the other passivator (Supplementary Figs.  38  and 39 ). The higher hydrophobicity of the 2CF 3 -PEAI modified samples could minimize the effect of the absorbed water and oxygen on the stability of encapsulated PSCs. The highest stability of the 2CF 3 -PEAI passivated perovskite films can be further proved by the in situ PL measurements combined with laser light ageing (Supplementary Fig.  40 ). It should be emphasized that other important factor enabling that improved device operational stability is the elimination of MA + cations and Br -anions from the perovskite absorber composition as discussed above. Indeed, comparing the stability of the PSCs based on conventional MAPbI 3 and Cs 0.15 FA 0.85 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 perovskite films and the introduced here FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 absorber formulations processed using 0% or 5% DBSO additive with 2CF 3 -PEAI passivation features the importance of several complementary parameters required to reach long operational lifetimes (Supplementary Figs.  41 42 43 ). Thus, the superior operational stability of the PSCs reported here is the result of multifactorial comprehensive optimization involving the proper selection of univalent cations (FA + and Cs + ), halide anions (I -only systems), solvent and intermediate phase engineering as well as designing efficient passivation coatings. In addition to the enhanced operational lifetime, the damp heat stability of the devices has also been tested in accordance with IEC61215 standard. The 2CF 3 -PEAI treated devices (average initial PCE of 24.8%) could retain 98.2% of their initial performance after ageing at 85 °C/85% RH for 1,000 h (Fig.  4d  and Supplementary Fig.  44 ). Meanwhile, the devices based on pristine perovskite films and the films with PEAI and CF 3 -PEAI passivation coatings degraded under the same ageing conditions to 71.3%, 87.2% and 91.1% of their initial PCEs, respectively. These results further confirm the notable impact of a close-to-ideal perovskite film with the lowest defect density, reduced internal residue stress and higher surface hydrophobicity on the device's stability. 
 Conclusions In summary, we report the strategy to improve the quality of both bulk and surface of FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 perovskite films to enable high-performance inverted PSCs. First, we use a low-volatile DBSO Lewis base additive with a strong coordination ability to improve the crystallinity, reduce the defect density and internal residual stress of the perovskite bulk. Then, 2CF 3 -PEAI was introduced as an interface passivator designed to optimize the energy levels, passivate defects and protect the film against moisture. The inverted PSCs achieve 25.1% efficiency and improved stability. The devices maintained 97.4% and 98.2% of their initial PCEs after operating under continuous 1-sun AM 1.5 G illumination for 1,800 h and under the damp heat conditions (85 °C and 85% RH) for 1,000 h. This work not only provides a novel avenue to engineer efficient and stable inverted PSCs, but also deepens the understanding of the correlation between the device performance to the MA + -and Br --free perovskite bulk and surface properties.

 Device fabrication Glass/ITO substrates (15 Ω sq -1 ) were consecutively cleaned by sequential ultrasonication for 20 min with detergent solution, de-ionized water, ethyl alcohol and isopropanol. The cleaned substrates were dried with high-pressure N 2 gas flow, and then were cleaned by UV-ozone treatment for 30 min and finally transferred into a N 2 -filled glove box before use.

The as-prepared p-PY solution was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates at 1,500 r.p.m. for 30 s, and the substrates were subsequently annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The FA 0.98 Cs 0.02 PbI 3 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 252.8 mg FAI,  
 Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01288-7   691.5 mg PbI 2 and 7.8 mg caesium iodide in 1 ml DMF:NMP (6:1 by volume ratio). To prepare the precursor solutions with DBSO (5-20 mol% with respect to PbI 2 ), the additive was added to the DMF: NMP precursor solution. Then the perovskite solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 5,000 r.p.m. for 60 s. At the 12th second of spinning, 500 µl of ethyl acetate was dripped onto the substrate centre. The as-coated precursor films were subsequently annealed on a hotplate at 150 °C for 20 min. Then 100 µl of PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI or 2CF 3 -PEAI (1 mg ml -1 in IPA) were spin-coated onto the as-prepared perovskite films at a speed of 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s; the films were subsequently dried at 100 °C for 5 min. Then a chlorobenzene solution of PCBM (20 mg ml -1 ) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite films (passivated or not) at the rotation speed of 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s and heated at 70 °C for 10 min. In the final step, BCP (8 nm) and Ag (80 nm) were deposited in high vacuum (pressure below 5 × 10 -4 Pa) while finely controlling the evaporation rate at 0.1, 0.1 and 0.1-0.5 Å s -1 , respectively. The Bi/Ag (20 nm/80 nm) electrodes in the devices used for stability tests were thermally evaporated with a controlled evaporation rate of 0.1 and 0.1-0.5 Å s -1 , respectively. 
 Computational details The calculation model is to calculate the adsorption energy of DBSO, NMP and DMSO on the surface of PbI 2 to characterize the interaction strength between different molecules and PbI 2 . Specifically, the adsorption energy can be obtained by using the following formula: The first-principles calculations were carried out by using the projector-augmented wave representations with DFT as implemented in the Vienna ab-initio simulation package  [51] [52] [53]  . The exchange and correlation energy were approximated by the spin-polarized generalize-gradient-approximation with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof formula  54  . Wave functions were expanded in plane waves up to a kinetic energy cut-off of 500 eV. Γ-centred k-meshes grids of 2 × 2 × 1 was used for slab calculations. To treat the van der Waals interactions, DFT-D3 correction method of Grimme was used  55  . All structures were fully relaxed until the force on each atom was smaller than 0.01 eV/Å. △E = E PbI 2 ⋅DBSO -E PbI 2 The electrostatic potentials (φ) of the passivators were calculated using the Gaussian 09 package at the B3LYP/def2TZVP level with DFT-D3 (ref. 56). The maximum φ (φ max ) of the NH 3 + terminal group in these passivators was obtained with the help of Multiwfn code. 
 Characterizations KPFM measurements were conducted using a dimension icon scanning probe microscope (Asylum Research, MFP-3D-Stand Alone) in the tapping mode. KPFM measurements were carried out using an atomic force microscopy under ambient conditions, using a gold-coated Si tip. The KPFM measurement was implemented using a two-path method at a scan rate of 0.5 Hz, where the first pass in every scan line was used to determine the topography and the following second pass was used to measure the contact potential difference between the tip and the sample. The second pass was scanned by raising the tip at a fixed 20 nm height above the sample following the topography. Each set of samples was arranged in proximity on a common substrate and was measured using the same tip and scanning parameters. SEM images were obtained using a Nova NanoSEM 450 scanning electron microscope (FEI). An XPS system (Thermo ESCALAB 250XI) was used to acquire the XPS spectra. UPS spectra were acquired using a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI instrument equipped with a 1 He ultraviolet radiation source (21.22 eV). The both UPS and KPFM are surface-sensitive measurements. The crystal structure of the films was characterized using XRD with an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (PANalytical B.V.). The UV-vis spectra of perovskite films were obtained using a Lambda 950 UV-vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer). The steady-state PL spectra were recorded using an Edinburgh FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh) with an excitation source wavelength of 532 nm. The transient fluorescence spectroscopy (TRPL) measurements were conducted using a fluorescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 478 nm (DeltaFlex, Horiba), and the excitation pulse has a repetition rate of 100 kHz with a spot size of 100 µm. The applied excitation fluences were varied between 8.9 nJ cm -2 and 56.3 nJ cm -2 by using neutral density filters. the TRPL profiles were fitted by a bi-exponential decay rate model according to the following function: y = A 1 exp(-t/τ 1 ) + A 2 exp(-t/τ 2 ) + y 0, where τ 1 and τ 2 are the lifetimes for the fast and slow decays, respectively. The femtosecond transient absorption measurements were performed on a Helios spectrometer (Ultrafast Systems) pumped by a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (Legend Elite, Coherent) operating at 5 kHz with fundamental wavelength of 800 nm and pulse width of ~40 fs. Briefly, the 800 nm output pulse by a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier was split in two parts. One part was used to pump a TOPAS Optical Parametric Amplifier (Light Conversion), which generates a wavelength-tunable laser pulse from 250 nm to 2.5 µm as pump beam. Another part was attenuated with a neutral density filter and focused into sapphire window to generate a white light continuum (420 nm to 840 nm) used for probe beam. The delay between the pump and probe pulses was controlled by a motorized delay stage. The pump pulses were chopped by a synchronized chopper at 500 Hz, and the absorbance change was calculated with two adjacent probe pulses (pump-blocked and pump-unblocked). All experiments were performed at room temperature. The transient absorption test of perovskite films without DBSO and with 10% DBSO is performed with incident wavelength of 520 nm and incident light excitation power of 0.3 µW. The repetition rate of the TA system is 5,000 Hz, and the diameter of the pump beam spot is 100 µm. Considering that the perovskite film has a high absorption coefficient, to detect the transmitted light more clearly, in all the transient absorption tests, we dilute the perovskite solution to 0.75 M to prepare samples. When we are using 0.3 µW excitation power, we did not observe the signal of 2D perovskite phase due to the small excitation power. To demonstrate the formation of 2D perovskite phase on the surface of perovskite. Keeping other test conditions unchanged, we increased the power to 15 µW to observe that the perovskite films were modified with PEAI, CF 3 -PEAI and 2CF 3 -PEAI. Photovoltaic measurements were carried out using a black mask with an aperture area of 0.09 cm 2 under standard AM 1.5 G simulated illumination (Oriel, model 9119), and the simulated light intensity was calibrated with a silicon photodiode (KG3, Enlitech). The PLQY was carried out via exciting the corresponding samples by a 405 nm laser inside an integrated sphere. The laser intensity was adjusted to 1 sun equivalent intensity using a PSC to obtain a current density at 0 V equal to its J SC . TOF-SIMS measurements were performed using a TOF-SIMS V instrument (IONTOF GmbH, 170 Cameca IMS 4F). The EQE spectra were obtained with EQE system (Saifan) using monochromatic light of 1 × 10 16 photons cm -2 in direct current mode. The EQE-EL spectra were recorded by a light emitting diode PL quantum-yield measurement system (Shenzhen Puyan Internet Technology) equipped with Keithley 2400 Source Measurement Unit. 
 Encapsulation For PSC encapsulation, the devices were firstly encapsulated by atomic-layer-deposited Al 2 O 3 thin films with the thickness of approximately 20 nm according to our previous report  9  . Then the tinned copper ribbons were soldered to the electrodes of the devices to extend the connections. And the device was encapsulated by a cover glass with edges sealed by butyl tape with 1 cm in width. The stack was vacuum laminated in an industrial laminator at 120 °C for 20 min. 
 Stability tests For the stability tests, a thin film of Bi with a thickness of 20 nm was inserted before the deposition of Ag, which could enhance the Supplementary Figure 14 :Supplementary Figure 17 : 1417 Williamson-Hall plots obtained from XRD patterns of the perovskite films without and with 10% DBSO in Figure 1c.

 Federal Research Center for Problems of Chemical Physics and Medicinal Chemistry of Russian Academy of Sciences, Chernogolovka, Russia. The certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the regular (n-i-p) structure has reached 25.7% (ref. 1), approaching that of the mature mono-crystalline silicon solar cells. The regular PSCs with high certified efficiencies of >25% are mainly based on organic hole transport material such as doped 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) 2-6 . However, commonly used spiro-OMeTAD with lithium salt dopants Received: 7 October 2022 Accepted: 1 June 2023 Published online: 3 July 2023 Check for updates 1 Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. 2 Optics Valley Laboratory, Hubei, could raise additional stability issues of PSCs beyond perovskite absorb-ers themselves 7,8 .

Spatial Atmospheric Pressure Atomic Layer Deposition of Tin Oxide as an Impermeable Electron Extraction Layer for Perovskite Solar Cells with Enhanced Thermal Stability
Despite the notable success of hybrid halide perovskite-based solar cells, their long-term stability is still a key-issue. Aside from optimizing the photoactive perovskite, the cell design states a powerful lever to improve stability under various stress conditions. Dedicated electrically conductive diffusion barriers inside the cell stack, that counteract the ingress of moisture and prevent the migration of corrosive halogen species, can substantially improve ambient and thermal stability. Although atomic layer deposition (ALD) is excellently suited to prepare such functional layers, ALD suffers from the requirement of vacuum and only allows for a very limited throughput. Here, we demonstrate for the first time spatial ALD-grown SnO x at atmospheric pressure as impermeable electron extraction layers for perovskite solar cells. We achieve optical transmittance and electrical conductivity similar to those in SnO x grown by conventional vacuum-based ALD. A low deposition temperature of 80 °C and a high substrate speed of 2.4 m min -1 yield SnO x layers with a low water vapor transmission rate of ∼10 -4 gm -2 day -1 (at 60 °C/60% RH). Thereby, in perovskite solar cells, dense hybrid Al:ZnO/SnO x electron extraction layers are created that are the key for stable cell characteristics beyond 1000 h in ambient air and over 3000 h at 60 °C. Most notably, our work of introducing spatial ALD at atmospheric pressure paves the way to the future roll-to-roll manufacturing of stable perovskite solar cells.
As can be seen in Figure  S3b  the variation in the shape of the perovskite absorption spectra (directly resulting in the EQE spectra of the PSC in Figure  S3a ) can be attributed to variations of the perovskite layer thickness independent of the SnO x thickness. Moreover Figure  S3c  shows that thickness variations that fall within the process fluctuation only result in minor changes in the J sc .  Within the past few years hybrid halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have seen an unprecedented progress as power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have reached a level beyond 20%.  [1] [2] [3] [4]  Nevertheless, a serious concern about stability is coming along with PSCs, as the photoactive perovskites tend to decompose upon exposure to moisture and/or elevated temperatures.  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]  On top of that, halide-containing species resulting from the decomposition of the perovskite can corrode metal electrodes and thereby drastically compromise the device stability.  11, 12  Recently, a number of approaches have been proposed to mitigate these stability issues. Aside from the use of alternative electrodes like carbon,  13  a very promising concept is based on the introduction of a protection layer as an electronically functional part of the solar cell stack. The purpose of these layers is to shield the rest of the device from ambient gases and simultaneously to prevent corrosive perovskite constituents to degrade the electrode. Organic, metal-oxide, and even modified two-dimensional perovskite capping layers have been considered for this aim.  [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21]  Although all of these strategies yield some kind of stability improvement, the respective PSCs still face notable degradation in the long run, especially when exposed to elevated temperatures. This is most likely related to the limited barrier properties of the proposed protecting layers. In general, metaloxide layers prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) provide the most promising avenue to realize functional protection layers, as ALD is known to afford extremely dense, conformal, and pinhole-free layers.  [22] [23] [24]  The plethora of studies on permeation barriers prepared by ALD is focused on insulating materials, like Al 2 O 3 , etc. A few authors have attempted to introduce ALD-grown Al 2 O 3 into a PSC to protect and to stabilize the photoactive perovskite.  [25] [26] [27]  Although some improvement has been demonstrated, the use of insulating layers inside a device stack is limited to at best a few monolayers through which carriers can still tunnel. For thicker layers (>1 nm) a severe deterioration of the device characteristics is typically observed. It is clear that these ultrathin protection layers do not form serious permeation barriers.  26  Likewise, Kim et al. introduced ALD-grown titanium oxide interlayers for stabilization, albeit at the cost of compromised solar cell performance due to the poor electrical conductivity of the low-temperature TiO x .  28  Specifically, the resulting solar cells show a notable series resistance and a relatively low FF <50%. Recently, we have demonstrated transparent and electrically conductive permeation barriers based on tin oxide grown by ALD.  29  We could show that these SnO x layers can be introduced in the stack of a PSC without compromising cell performance, where they efficiently prevented the ingress of moisture and at the same time suppressed the decomposition of the perovskite active layer.  30  Concomitantly, the SnO x layer has been shown to protect sensitive metal electrodes against the corrosive halide constituents of the perovskite.  31  Thereby, we were able to present highly robust, opaque, and semitransparent PSCs.  30, 32  As an important note, the efficiency of PSCs that were only encapsulated with an external permeation barrier, i.e., outside the cell stack, degraded swiftly under the same stress conditions. The most severe drawback of our SnO x layers is their preparation by classical batch-based ALD (B-ALD) under vacuum conditions. The limitations of classical ALD contradict the paradigm of low-cost, high-throughput preparation at atmospheric pressure, which is a particular selling point frequently associated with PSCs. There are efforts to overcome the limits of classical B-ALD by the introduction of spatial ALD (S-ALD), which can operate in a continuous fashion at atmospheric pressure.  33  Very recently, we have demonstrated that high-performance gas diffusion barriers based on Al 2 O 3 can be prepared by S-ALD at atmospheric pressure.  34  In this work, we introduce for the first time S-ALD-grown SnO x at atmospheric pressure as impermeable electron extraction layers in perovskite solar cells. Thereby, we render the use of these key stabilizing constituents to become compatible with the demands of even roll-to-roll manufacturing. We evidence that up to a web speed of 2.4 m min -1 , we can achieve the benefits of continuous processing without sacrificing the excellent electrical and barrier properties of SnO x known from vacuum-based B-ALD. Moreover, we demonstrate that the S-ALD SnO x layer can be grown in a continuous fashion at temperatures as low as 80 °C on top of the photoactive perovskite material. The resulting PSCs show an outstanding long-term stability in excess of 3000 h at elevated temperature. 
 EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Tin oxide thin films were deposited in a home-built S-ALD system, already described in a former work.  34  Tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin(IV) (TDMASn) (99.99%, Strem Chemicals) and water were used as precursors. A schematic of the S-ALD setup is shown in Figure  1a . Both precursors were kept in a bubbler at room temperature. N 2 was used as the purge gas. Typically, a flow of 150 sccm of N 2 through the TDMASn bubbler and 8 sccm of N 2 through the H 2 O bubbler have been used with a total gas flow at each precursor line of 2000 sccm. Note, the corresponding density of water molecules is about 3 × 10 15 cm -3 in the delivery zone of the water precursor in the S-ALD setup. This concentration is more than an order of magnitude below the levels of 1 × 10 17 cm -3 that has earlier been identified for the onset of decomposition of an unprotected MAPbI3 layer.  35, 36  The deposition temperature has been varied between 80 and 150 °C, and the substrate velocity has been varied between 5 and 160 mm s -1 . For reference, SnO x layers were deposited in a commercial ALD system (Beneq ALD TFS 200) at a base pressure of 1.5 mbar. Further details of the classical ALD growth process for SnO x can be found in ref 29. The inverted perovskite solar cells (p-i-n PSCs) are based on a glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 /PCBM/AZO/SnO x /Ag sequence (see Figure  1b ). First, PEDOT:PSS (AI4083) has been spin coated in ambient air and has been dried on a hot plate at 120 °C for 20 min in an N 2 environment. The CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite layers have been spin coated under inert atmosphere from a commercially available precursor solution (Ossila Ltd.) and have been post-annealed at 100 °C for 80 min. Afterward, PCBM (American Dye Source Inc., ADS61BFA) was spin coated from a solution in chlorobenzene (1000 rpm, 30 s, concentration: 100 mg/mL). The AZO layer has been spin coated from a commercial nanoparticle dispersion (8000 rpm, 60 s, 2.5 wt % in isopropanol, prod. no. 8045, Avantama AG, Switzerland). The size of the AZO nanoparticles is in the range of 12-18 nm. SnO x layers were deposited by S-ALD or B-ALD, as described above. Finally, Ag electrodes (thickness: 100 nm) were thermally evaporated. J/V characterizations and stabilized power output of the respective solar cells were conducted without encapsulation in air with a Keithley 2400-C source meter and a solar simulator (300W Newport, model 91160, AM1.5G). Calibration to 100 mW cm -2 was done with a commercial IEC 60904-9 compliant and certified Si reference cell (Rera Systems). Rutherford backscattering (RBS) and nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) were performed at the 4 MV tandem accelerator of the RUBION facility (University of Bochum, Germany). For RBS, a 2 MeV 4 He + ion beam (beam current of 20-40 nA) in combination with a silicon surface barrier detector at an angle of 160°was used. For a higher sensitivity to atoms with a low atomic number, i.e., C, N, and O, the complementary NRA measurements were performed with a 1 MeV 2 H + beam (beam current of 40-80 nA). A silicon surface barrier detector was placed at an angle of 135°and was shielded by a 6 μm Ni foil to eliminate scattered particles. The water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) was measured using an optical calcium test on 7 × 7 cm 2 glass substrates. Details of the Ca test can be found in our previous work.  34, 37  The electrical conductivity of our SnO x layers was measured with the Van der Pauw method. The transmission/reflection spectra of the SnO x films deposited by ALD were measured with a deuterium halogen lamp (DH-2000-BAL, Ocean Optics, 1 mW cm -2 ) and a fiber spectrometer (USB 2000+XR1-ES, Ocean Optics, from 186 to 1041 nm). Each spectrum is an average of 300 measurements at five different positions on the sample. The absorption spectra (A(λ)) were calculated directly from transmittance (T(λ)) and reflectance (R(λ)) spectra using the following equation: A(λ) = 1 -T(λ) -R(λ). External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out with a home-built setup using probe light from a tunable monochromatic light-source consisting of a 50 W tungsten halogen lamp and a monochromator (MSH-150, LOT-Quantum Design GmbH). The current response of the PSC devices was measured using a lock-in amplifier (5610B, NF Electronic Instruments). 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1. Properties of Tin Oxide Grown by S-ALD. Tin oxide thin films were deposited in an S-ALD system at atmospheric pressure. The S-ALD system is described in more detail in previous reports.  34  The layout of the S-ALD coating head is shown in Figure  1 . Briefly, in S-ALD, the moving substrate is sequentially exposed to the precursors emerging from the spatially separated precursor outlets in the S-ALD head. Thereby, the time-sequenced delivery of the precursors to a static substrate, as in conventional B-ALD, is mimicked. As a starting point, the substrate speed was set to 20 mm s -1 (=1.2 m min -1 ), and the process temperature was 80 °C. The ALDtypical self-limiting growth behavior at these processing conditions has been verified (Figure  S1 , Supporting Information). The selected N 2 -gas flows of 150 sccm (through the TDMASn bubbler) and 8 sccm (through the H 2 O bubbler) are clearly within the respective saturation regime, with a growth per cycle (GPC) of (0.15 ± 0.01) nm. The properties of SnO x layers grown by S-ALD and B-ALD are compared in Table  1 . Obviously, S-ALD yields a somewhat higher GPC compared with B-ALD. Note, higher growth rates of atmospheric pressure ALD at low-temperature versus classical vacuum-based ALD have been found before for other metal oxides, e.g., Al 2 O 3 or ZnO,  37, 38  and have been attributed to an excess of adsorbed water which leads to some additional CVD type of growth. In our earlier work, we have studied the GPC in the S-ALD of SnO x (from TDMASn/H 2 O) at varied deposition temperatures.  39  Specifically, the GPC varied from 0.15 nm (at 80 °C) to 0.07 nm (at 150 °C). The optical properties of the SnO x layers have been assessed by absorption spectroscopy and spectral ellipsometry. The respective absorption spectra for SnO x grown by B-ALD and S-ALD at various deposition temperatures are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure  S2 ). The optical band gap is determined from the respective Tauc plots. A band gap of 3.8 eV was derived for SnO x deposited by both S-ALD and B-ALD at 80 °C. By increasing the deposition temperature, the optical band gap decreases (to 3.2 eV at 150 °C deposition temperature) and a notable sub-band-gap absorption is found. A similar behavior has been previously reported  40  in B-ALD-grown SnO x layers and has been attributed to an increased density of subgap defects related to oxygen deficiency. In any case, a 20 nm thick SnO x layer based on S-ALD shows similar neglectable absorption in the spectral range of 430-780 nm as its low-pressure counterpart. The refractive indices of the S-ALD (1.88 @ 633 nm) and B-ALD (1.89) layers are quite similar. Moreover, within the accuracy of the experiment, the S-ALD process yields SnO x that shows the same permeation barrier properties (water vapor transmission rate: WVTR = 2 × 10 -4 gm -2 day -1 ) and electrical conductivity (σ = 10 -4 S cm -1 ) as those of their analogues grown by vacuum-based B-ALD. For thin SnO x layers of 20 nm, their electrical conductivity allows to estimate a very low specific series resistance of 0.02 Ω cm 2 , which is not expected to infer any notable loss of voltage in a PSC. 3.2. S-ALD Tin Oxide in Perovskite Solar Cells. The characteristics of representative PSCs incorporating an impermeable SnO x electron extraction layer prepared by S-ALD and B-ALD are shown in Figure  2a, b . The typical solar cell figures, as derived from the J/V data, are compared in Table  2 . Note, all current density data were calibrated with dedicated EQE measurements. The corresponding EQE spectra are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure  S3 ). Both sets of samples show a remarkable similarity in their cell characteristics. This is even more notable, as the S-ALD technique now paves the way to harvest the benefits of impermeable functional ALD layers even for high-throughput manufacturing. To compare the stability of the PSCs, monostress tests under ambient conditions (25 °C/60% RH) (Figure  2c ) and at elevated temperature (60 °C, inert atmosphere) (Figure  2d ) were conducted. Strikingly, under both conditions, excellent long-term stability of PSCs based on SnO x grown by S-ALD is afforded. Note, for PSCs without the SnO x layer, the devices degrade within tens of hours under ambient conditions (25 °C/ 60% RH) and within 200 h at elevated temperature (60 °C, inert atmosphere).  30  Please see Figure  S5  for a full set of cell characteristics (J sc , V oc , and FF) during temperature monostress testing. Taken together, SnO x prepared by S-ALD affords PSCs with outstanding thermal stability even on a time scale of >3000 h without noticeable decay in cell characteristics. In an aim to exploit the continuous S-ALD process for a roll-to-roll processing in the future, limitations regarding processing speed in S-ALD are of interest. 3.3. Deposition Speed in S-ALD. We now evaluate the role of substrate speed in S-ALD on the functionality and stability of the resulting PSCs. First, the GPC versus substrate speed is studied at otherwise fixed process parameters, e.g., gas flows (Figure  3a ). Obviously, the GPC is constant for a substrate speed below 60 mm s -1 . Further increasing the speed results in a reduction of the GPC, as the precursor dose is no longer sufficient to fully saturate the reactive surface sites. The decay of GPC when increasing the substrate speed was approximated with GPC = GPC sat (1exp(at q )), similar to an equation proposed by Poodt et al.  41  Here, GPC sat represents the GPC at low substrate speeds, t is the precursor exposure time, and a and q are fit parameters. For a further discussion, see refs 34, 41.  In addition to the drop in GPC, the refractive index decreases with increasing the substrate speed, i.e., from 1.88 at 20 mm s -1 to 1.80 at 160 mm s -1 , indicating not fully saturated ALD film growth and a lower film density. In principle, the regime of constant (saturated) GPC can be extended to even higher substrate speeds by further increasing the amount of precursor delivered to the precursor exposure zone (e.g., by increasing the flow of carrier gas through the bubbler). At the same time, higher amounts of precursor would require higher purge gas flows or a spatial extension of the respective purge gas zones. Unfortunately, both these possibilities cannot be tested due to limitations of our home-built S-ALD system. Aside from the changes of layer properties toward higher processing speeds, a further important characteristic of the ALD growth process is affected. It has to be noted that in the PSCs, the SnO x layer is deposited on top of a porous Al:ZnO layer that has been cast on top of the PCBM from a dispersion of nanoparticles. ALD in general is known for its conformal coating properties of high-aspect-ratio structures and even porous materials. By increasing the substrate speed, the exposure time of the porous layer to the respective precursor species in the S-ALD process is reduced. Thereby, the time for diffusion of precursors into the pores of the AZO layer is shortened. As suggested earlier,  30  the functionality of the AZO/ SnO x hybrid layer as a permeation barrier relies critically on the penetration of ALD precursors into the pores of the AZO layer and the concomitant growth of SnO x inside these pores. To further study the consequences of increased substrate speed, we analyzed the resulting AZO/SnO x hybrid layers by Rutherford backscattering (RBS). The degree of penetration of tin atoms into the pores of the AZO layer becomes obvious from the Snrelated RBS spectra (Figure  3b ). For relatively small substrate speeds of 20 and 40 mm s -1 , the Sn peak in the RBS spectrum shows a notable shoulder, indicating the penetration of tin atoms into the AZO layer underneath. As these Sn atoms are located further away from the surface (i.e., deeper inside the AZO layer), they cause backscattered ions with less energy (i.e., smaller channel number). On the contrary, for SnO x grown at elevated substrate speed of 80 mm s -1 , a symmetric Sn peak is found, indicating a substantially reduced penetration of tin into the pores of the AZO layer. Note, for SnO x grown on a flat, nonporous substrate, the tin RBS spectrum is fully symmetric, regardless of the substrate speed. A schematic of the penetration of SnO x inside the AZO is shown in Figure  3c . As a consequence of the penetration of the SnO x into the AZO pores, the barrier properties of the resulting AZO/SnO x hybrid layers are substantially better than those where the SnO x has been prepared at elevated substrate speed without notable pore filling. In addition, the WVTR of SnO x single layers grown For the S-ALD, a substrate velocity of 20 mm s -1 has been used. J/V characteristics (a) and stabilized power output (b). All related current density data were derived from EQE measurements (see Figure  S3 ).

Solar Cell Characteristics Corresponding to the Representative J/V Curves Shown in Figure  2a  for PSCs Based on SnO x Grown by B-ALD and S-ALD a reverse forward a Current density data has been derived from EQE measurements. Statistical data for a set of samples can be found in the Supporting Information (Figure  S4 , Table  S1 ). at 80 mm s -1 show inferior permeation barrier properties (WVTR ∼ 4 × 10 -3 gm -2 day -1 ) compared with their analogues grown at lower speed. This indicates an overall deterioration of layer density at elevated substrate speed, in agreement with the observed drop of the refractive index, as discussed above. PCE (%) FF (%) V OC (V) J SC (mA cm -2 ) PCE (%) FF (%) V OC (V) J SC (mA cm -2 ) S- As a result, the lifetime of PSCs based on the respective AZO/SnO x is critically affected by the choice of substrate speed, when the devices are exposed to ambient air (25 °C/ 60% RH) (Figure  3d ). The PCE of the PSCs based on the SnO x grown at a substrate speed of 80 mm s -1 , which does not afford filling of the AZO pores, decreases dramatically within the first 300 h in air, whereas the cells in which the SnO x has been grown at 20 mm s -1 show only minimum degradation even after more than 1000 h. 3.4. Effect of Deposition Temperature. Although we have found that increasing the substrate speed compromises the barrier properties of the AZO/SnO x hybrid layer, deposition temperature is a likewise critical parameter. For other material systems, an elevated growth temperature has been shown to have a beneficial impact on the layer density, electrical conductivity, and reduced concentration of precursor residues of the resulting ALD layers.  29, 34, 42  The effect of substrate temperature on the electrical conductivity of SnO x grown by both B-ALD and S-ALD using H 2 O as oxidant has been studied previously.  29, 39  For S-ALD SnO x , the electrical conductivity remained in the range of 10 -4 -10 -3 S cm -1 for a growth temperature between 80 and 150 °C. To analyze the influence of deposition temperature in the case of our SnO x layers grown by S-ALD, we performed a series of RBS studies. Thereby, we identify an elevated level of carbon (∼20%) and nitrogen (∼5%) residues in layers grown at 80 °C (Table  S2 ). For increasing the processing temperature to 120 and 150 °C, the content of carbon/nitrogen is significantly reduced to levels of 0.3/0.1% and 0.1/<0.1%, respectively. At the same time, the areal density of tin atoms (for a 20 nm thick layer) increases from 3.5 × 10 16 to 3.8 × 10 16 atoms cm -2 by increasing the deposition temperature. Concomitantly, the WVTR decreases by about an order of magnitude from ∼10 -4 to about 10 -5 gm -2 day -1 (Figure  4a ). Moreover, for the SnO x /AZO bilayers, the characteristic shoulder in the RBS spectra toward lower channel numbers indicating the partial growth of SnO x in the pores of the AZO layer shows a notable dependence on the deposition temperature (Figure  4b ). Obviously, higher deposition temperatures infer an increased penetration of the SnO x into the porous AZO (Figure  4c ). This is very likely due to the thermally activated precursor diffusion.  19  Owing to the improved mass density, lowered WVTR and better pore filling of the SnO x , increasing the deposition temperature appears to be attractive for the application in PSCs. Unfortunately, temperatures in excess of 100 °C result in PSCs with substantially deteriorated characteristics (Figures  4d  and S6 ). Here, it is important to note that the postdeposition annealing of the perovskite layers was done at 100 °C. It has been shown very recently that for MAPbI 3 , at temperatures higher than 100 °C, thermal degradation is happening at the perovskite surface within minutes time.  20, 21  For both S-ALD and B-ALD, some exposure time to the growth temperature prior to the actual deposition is technologically inevitable. Thus, the observed deterioration of our PSC at an ALD deposition temperature >100 °C is very likely related to the thermal instability of the perovskite. To further exploit the superior properties of SnO x grown at T > 100 °C, the use of more temperature-stable perovskite materials could be very rewarding but is beyond the scope of this work. Taken together, an optimum temperature window between 80 and 100 °C affords the best PSC characteristics. At the same time, the barrier properties of the AZO/SnO x hybrid layers grown by S-ALD in this temperature range provide an outstanding long-term cell stability. 
 CONCLUSIONS In summary, we have demonstrated that spatial ALD at atmospheric pressure affords SnO x with similar optical and electrical properties as those of their analogues deposited by conventional vacuum-based ALD. We unraveled the specific influence of deposition speed and temperature on the ability to form particularly dense hybrid AZO/SnO x electron extraction layers in perovskite solar cells. We identified a low deposition temperature of 80 °C as an optimum choice. The substrate speed can be as high as 2.4 m min -1 , without sacrificing material properties. The low water vapor transmission rate of the SnO x layers (∼10 -4 gm -2 day -1 ) renders them as excellent permeation barriers that limit the ingress of moisture into the devices. Most significantly, the SnO x simultaneously forms a shield that protects constituents of the cell against corrosive halide-containing perovskite decomposition products. The resulting PSCs showed stable characteristics beyond 1000 h in ambient air and over 3000 h at 60 °C. Most notably, the introduction of spatial ALD at atmospheric pressure paves the way to the future roll-to-roll manufacturing of stable perovskite solar cells.

Visualization and suppression of interfacial recombination for high-efficiency large-area pin perovskite solar cells
Supplementary Figure 1. Coupled Optical and Shockley-Queisser-Modelling. Fill factor (FF) as a function of ITO thickness and device aspect ratio corresponding to the device simulation in Figure 2b. For ITO thicknesses of 150 nm with a sheet resistance 15 Ω/sq a theoretical FF of 80.2% (73.8%) can be achieved for an device aspect ratio of 0.16 (0.64), respectively. The trend is in good agreement with the experimental results in Figure  2a .

For the neat absorber the decay is faster for high generation levels due to radiative emission (and/or Auger contributions). At very low injection levels we can recover a single exponential decay, interpreted as the minority carrier SRH lifetime. For the perovskite/C60 stack, the decay times are generally much shorter while 510 nm excitation causes a fast initial drop of the PL intensity (almost an order of magnitude relative to 700 nm), indicating a significant early time loss of carriers at the interface between the perovskite and C60. For the bare perovskite, the initial decay is much smaller at 510 nm due to a much better interface to glass. 
 Supplementary Note 1. Estimation of achievable Voc based on the monoexponential TRPL lifetime As recently demonstrated by Tress,  1  the achievable 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 in case of dominant Shockley-Read-Hall recombination can be predicted from the carrier lifetime (𝜏 SRH ) with the additional knowledge of the cells' short-circuit current density (~ 22 mA/cm 2 ), the bandgap (𝜖 G ~ 1.6 eV), the active layer thickness (𝑑 ~ 400 nm), and the electron (hole) effective masses (𝑚 * e(h) ~ 0.25 𝑚 e ).  1  𝑒𝑉 OC = 𝜖 G + 𝑘 B 𝑇 * ln ( 𝑛 e 𝑛 h 𝑁 C 𝑁 V ) (eq. 1) 𝑑𝑛 e 𝑑𝑡 = 𝐺 -𝑅 = 0 ~ 𝐺 -𝑛 e 𝜏 SRH  → 𝑛 e ~ 𝐺𝜏 SRH (eq. 2) Here, 𝑘 B 𝑇 𝑒 is the thermal voltage, 𝐺 and 𝑅 the generation and recombination rates (𝐺 is approximated by Quantum Efficiency (EQE) of our standard cells (ITO/PTAA/perovskite/C60/BCP/Cu) demonstrating a sharp absorption onset and Urbach tail of 14 meV. This allows the determination of a radiative recombination current J 0,rad of ~4x10 -21 Am -2 , which yields a radiative V OC limit of 1.345 V at room temperature and using a generation (short-circuit) current density of 22 mAcm -2 .

On the other hand, the quasi-Fermi level splitting of other films could be well reproduced. Films marked with ""*"" are shown and discussed in the main text. The thickness of all layers of the films is identical to the thicknesses used for the final solar cell stack. MAPI). In particular, our CsFAPbI3 perovskite cells compare exceptionally well to previously reported (MA/Br-free) FAPbI3 nip-cells; e.g. ~17.5% for neat FAPbI3 from Seok and co-workers 3 , 19.2% Wang et al.  4  for benzylamine-modified FAPbI3 cells, and Yu et al.  5  with 19.6% (18.1% forward scan) for FA0.8Cs0.2PbI3 cells. We note that all these studies employed nip cells with strongly doped spiroOMeTAD while we can achieve slightly higher efficiencies for pin-type cells with ultrathin undoped charge transport layers. Lastly, we note, that the application of the absolute PL recombination analysis allows us to confirm the improvements are a result of reduced interfacial recombination at both the n-and p-contact as shown as shown in Supplementary Table  2 .

 Articles T he solution processability and potential for simple manufacturing from earth-abundant materials drives research into perovskite solar cells in the search for cheap, printable photovoltaic devices. The discovery that perovskites effectively sensitize titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) in dye-sensitized solar cells in 2009  1  , and the demonstration of the first thin-film solid-state perovskite solar cells in 2012  2, 3  has spurred tremendous research efforts concerning the understanding and optimization of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices. Though power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells  4  are rapidly approaching industrially engineered silicon and inorganic thin-film solar cells  5  , several key issues remain that need to be understood and overcome. These include fundamental questions regarding recombination losses  6  , long-term stability  7  and difficulties in scaling to large electrode areas  8  . Today it is well known that to unlock the full thermodynamic potential of perovskite solar cells it is imperative to suppress all non-radiative recombination losses, which manifest as increased dark currents and ideality factors greater than one, limiting both the cells' open-circuit voltage (V OC ) and fill factor  6, 9  . One of the most challenging tasks in this regard is being able to pinpoint the origin of these losses in a complete device under operational conditions. In general, recombination losses may occur either in the perovskite bulk  4, 6, 10  or close to the interface of an adjacent transport layer as a result of a higher density of trap states at the surface  11, 12  . Likewise, recombination may also occur across interfaces  [13] [14] [15]  between charges in the transport layer and minority carriers in the perovskite, or in the transport layers themselves  15  . The situation becomes more challenging for cells with a comparatively large area (for example, 1 cm 2 ), where additional losses come from inhomogeneities of the active perovskite absorber as well as at the interfaces to the transport layers, with transport resistances also becoming an issue  8  . Knowing the origin of the non-radiative recombination losses would greatly facilitate targeted improvements in device performance  13  . This is particularly relevant for planar perovskite devices in the pin configuration, which still lag behind the most efficient nip cells  4, 11, [16] [17] [18] [19]  due to their lower opencircuit voltage and higher non-radiative recombination losses (for example, 1.15 V for record pin cells 11 compared to more than 1.23 V for nip cells  13, 17  ). Nevertheless, pin-type cells are very attractive for single-junction solar cells as they require only ultrathin undoped charge transport layers (for example, 8 nm poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA), 30 nm C 60 )  9  without the need for extensive chemical doping  9  and annealing at temperatures above 100 °C. This renders their fabrication compatible with rollto-roll deposition on flexible plastic substrates. Moreover, a pin perovskite device architecture is required for Si/perovskite tandem applications in combination with well-established solar cell technologies based on p-type silicon  20, 21  . Thus, a detailed investigation of non-radiative recombination losses and which interface represents the bottleneck for cell efficiency is urgently needed. We use a combination of steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL and TRPL) measurements to pinpoint the origin of non-radiative recombination losses in pin-type perosvkite solar cells. In particular, we determine the recombination kinetics and quasi-Fermi-level splitting (QFLS) in sample stacks consisting of the perovskite absorber-only, and perovskite/charge transport layer heterojunctions on length scales relevant to our solar cells (1 cm 2 ). We identify the main limitation to higher performance to be minority carrier recombination at the heterojunction with the organic charge transport layers. These losses are found to be surprisingly similar at the electron-and hole-selective interfaces. We therefore The performance of perovskite solar cells is predominantly limited by non-radiative recombination, either through trap-assisted recombination in the absorber layer or via minority carrier recombination at the perovskite/transport layer interfaces. Here, we use transient and absolute photoluminescence imaging to visualize all non-radiative recombination pathways in planar pintype perovskite solar cells with undoped organic charge transport layers. We find significant quasi-Fermi-level splitting losses (135 meV) in the perovskite bulk, whereas interfacial recombination results in an additional free energy loss of 80 meV at each individual interface, which limits the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of the complete cell to ~1.12 V. Inserting ultrathin interlayers between the perovskite and transport layers leads to a substantial reduction of these interfacial losses at both the p and n contacts. Using this knowledge and approach, we demonstrate reproducible dopant-free 1 cm 2 perovskite solar cells surpassing 20% efficiency (19.83% certified) with stabilized power output, a high V OC (1.17 V) and record fill factor (> 81%).

 Nature eNergy optimized the hole-selective interface through the use of a conjugated polyelectrolyte, which almost entirely suppressed interfacial recombination while simultaneously improving the wetting of the perovskite solution on the hole transport layer surface, delivering reproducible 1 cm 2 devices. With the knowledge that the V OC of the final device is now largely defined by the QFLS of the inferior perovskite/C 60 heterojunction we introduced an ultrathin layer of LiF (0.6-1 nm) between the absorber and the electron transport layer. This allowed us to reduce the interfacial recombination loss at the electron-selective interface by 35 meV. Suppressing the nonradiative recombination at both interfaces directly resulted in critical V OC and fill factor improvements in complete devices, allowing 1 cm 2 cells with ~20% efficiency, stabilized maximum power output and high reproducibility. This is currently the highest certified efficiency for a published 1 cm 2 perovskite solar cell structure. Last, numerical simulations highlight the importance of interface optimizations versus bulk optimizations for further perovskite solar cell developments. 
 Device architecture Our work builds on recent advancements in the understanding and improvement of pin devices  11, 19, 22  . The chemical structures of PTAA, perovskite and C 60 as used in our standard cells with architecture [(indium tin oxide, ITO (150 nm)/PTAA (8 nm)/perovskite (400-500 nm)/C 60 (30 nm)/bathocuproine, BCP (8 nm)/Cu (100 nm)] are shown in Fig.  1a . For the active layer material, we chose the previously reported 'triple cation perovskite' mixture with the composition CsPbI 0.05 [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.89 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.11 ] 0.95 , as it delivers among the best photovoltaic performance. We note that though we focus on triple cation cells we have also generalized the results to methylammonium lead iodide MAPbI 3 and caesium formamidinium lead iodide (Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 )PbI 3 absorber layers, as discussed at the end of the manuscript. Figure  1b  displays a schematic energy level diagram based on the results from ultraviolet and inverse photoemission spectroscopy  15  , and proposes possible recombination mechanisms. One of the most important considerations for scaling the device area is the electrode architecture, due to the relatively high sheet resistance of the transparent conducting electrode (TCE)  8  . It is thus essential to minimize the distance carriers have to traverse through the comparatively high resistance electrode (that is, ITO versus copper). Figure  2a  shows the current-voltage characteristics of optimized 1 cm 2 cells with electrode widths of 8 mm and 4 mm, which demonstrate that the fill factor can be increased from 69% to 77.9% simply by reducing the width of the active area. This is also in agreement with numerical solutions of the Shockley equation for different electrode aspect ratios, as illustrated in Fig.  2b , which confirm a roughly 2% absolute efficiency gain through the fill factor (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). This approach is in principle scalable, as the rectangular cells can be connected using laser patterning  23  while the electrode width may be slightly increased using a lower-resistance ITO substrate (for instance, 10 Ω sq -1 ). 
 Non-radiative recombination losses Among the most widely used and trusted techniques in the community to study the fate of photogenerated charges in perovskite solar cells is TRPL  24, 25  . At sufficiently low fluences a mono-exponential decay is usually observed, indicative of an underlying non-radiative trap-induced recombination that gradually reduces the density of emitting species, and hence the PL signal  6, 10, 26  . The fluence dependence of the TRPL signals is illustrated in Supplementary Fig.  2 . Figure  3  shows the result of such an experiment on a neat perovskite film, which displays a long PL lifetime of approximately half a microsecond, comparable to previously reported  16  perovskite films on TiO 2 . Considerably longer lifetimes have been reported in exceptional cases; for example, a lifetime of 8 µ s was recently realized through surface passivation of the perovskite with tri-n-octylphosphine (TOPO)  26  . As demonstrated  6  , the achievable V OC in the case of dominant Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination can be predicted from the monoexponential carrier lifetime (τ SRH ). As we detail in Supplementary Note 1, a SRH lifetime of 500 ns (as deduced from the exponential PL decay of the neat perovskite layer) should limit the open-circuit voltage to approximately 1.215 V at room temperature. The measured V OC of the device is significantly lower, which suggests that addition of the charge transport layers induces substantial non-radiative recombination losses. Figure  3  demonstrates the large impact of the addition of charge transporting layers on the TRPL decay, which is consistent with other previously reported studies  16  . Notably, large reductions in PL lifetimes  
 Articles Nature eNergy are seen independent of whether the PTAA is added between the glass and the active material or coated on top of the perovskite film (on glass), indicating that differences in perovskite morphology related to the nature of the underlying substrate are of minor importance in determining the PL lifetime (see Supplementary Fig.  3 ). Interestingly, all samples comprising one or two transport layers exhibited a similar and fast bi-exponential decay. As pointed out previously  6, 27  , this may be due either to the rapid extraction of charges on (sub)nanosecond timescales (quenching) or increased non-radiative recombination losses-two processes that are inherently difficult to disentangle from the TRPL signal alone. However, unless one transport layer completely depletes the perovskite bulk of one carrier type, the impact of non-radiative interface recombination will still be visible in the signal. As the bulk recombination happens at rather long timescales (lifetimes of approximately 500 ns), it can be concluded that the TRPL signals from the films with the transport layers present are subjected to additional non-radiative interface recombination. Following this line of reasoning, we attribute the fast initial decay to the loss of carriers at the interfaces due to charge extraction to the transport layers and/or to interface recombination, and the second decay (for which the mono-exponential lifetimes are provided in Fig.  3 ) to interface recombination. In accordance with this, the initial decay becomes less pronounced and smeared out when increasing the excitation wavelengththat is, when light penetrates deeper into the perovskite layer (see Supplementary Fig.  2 ). The rather similar decays after the initial drop in the samples with either PTAA or C 60 indicate that the two perovskite/organic heterojunctions equally limit the V OC due to additional non-radiative recombination losses at the interfaces. After carriers reach a quasi-equilibrium distribution, the lifetime of the second decay (τ II ) can be described by an equilibrium between the bulk decay time (τ bulk ), the diffusion time to the surface , where d is the perovskite film thickness and D the diffusion constant  24, 27  . Using the bulk lifetime of 500-785 ns, a mobility of 30 cm 2 V -1 s -1 (ref.  28  ), d = 400 nm and the measured τ II value of 20-30 ns would result in an interface loss velocity of S 1 ~ 1.6 × 10 3 -2.1 × 10 3 cm s -1 at the interface between the charge transport layer and the perovskite. However, other processes may potentially influence the TRPL signal as well, such as a decelerating charge extraction, light-soaking effects  29  , photon recycling  24, 25  , or a graded generation profile. Thus, it is clear that though TRPL is a useful guide to recombination losses, it by no means provides a definitive mechanistic insight. 
 Photoluminescence and QFLS A much more direct way to quantify the additional non-radiative recombination losses at the perovskite/organic interfaces is steadystate PL, as the absolute PL intensity (I PL ) is a direct measure of the QFLS (or ∆ E F )  [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35]  . Here, we use hyperspectral absolute photoluminescence imaging to create depth-averaged maps of the QFLS on the neat perovskite films in comparison to multilayer samples comprising one or both types of transport layer. This approach has been recently used by El-Hajje et al.  31  to spatially resolve the opto-electronic quality of evaporated methylammonium lead iodide junctions, and to study the hole blocking of different electron transport layers. Moreover, absolute PL has been recently applied to disentangle interfacial and bulk recombination losses in nip cells by Sarritzu et al.  33  , though the QFLS was not compared to the Reducing the active area width from 8 mm (aspect ratio 0.64) to 4 mm (aspect ratio 0.16) while keeping the active area the same improved the fill factor by approximately 9%, as indicated by the arrow. b, Simulated solar cell efficiencies using a combination of optical simulations of the obtainable short-circuit current, and the Shockley equation with a finite ITO series resistance depending on its thickness and the device aspect ratio. An internal cell resistance of 1.5 Ω cm 2 (for a 1 cm 2 cell) and an ideality factor of approximately 1.5 were assumed, as previously determined  9  . The two circled points correspond to the two devices from a.   30  , which describes the non-thermal radiation of a semiconductor: = π - -Δ ( ) I E E a E h c ( ) 2 ( ) 1 exp 1 (1) E E k T PL 2 3 2 F B Here, a(E) is the photon energy (E)-dependent absorptivity, c is the speed of light, h is the Planck constant and k B is the Boltzmann constant. Under the assumption that for emission energies above the PL maximum, a(E) approaches unity, equation (  1 ) can be simplified to              π = - + Δ I E h c E E k T E k T ln ( ) 2 (2) PL 3 2 2 B F B Equation (  2 ) allows one to deduce ∆ E F simply from fitting the high-energy slope of the PL emission  36  . By applying equation (  2 ) to every spectrum associated with each pixel (10 µ m in diameter) of the hyperspectral images, ∆ E F distribution maps can be created. Figure  4  shows the depth-averaged QFLS maps (1 cm 2 ) of the neat triple cation perovskite film, with either PTAA or C 60 alone, or both transport layers being present. The perovskite absorber exhibits a homogenous profile with a QFLS of approximately 1.21 eV (we note a 20 meV global systematic error on all maps). Though this value is remarkably close to the V OC obtained from the TRPL lifetime according to Supplementary Note 1, it is substantially below the radiative V OC of approximately 1.345 eV. The latter was estimated from the dark generation current J 0,rad ≈ 4 × 10 -21 A cm -2 (see Supplementary Fig.  4 ). This approach for calculating the radiative V OC limit has been extensively applied to perovskite solar cells, as shown in refs  [37] [38] [39]  , and dates back to Shockley and Queisser  40  . We also note that the emitted PL can be influenced by photon recycling  24, 25  . However, this does not affect our conclusions, because it is the external PL quantum yield that determines the QFLS and maximum achievable device V OC (ref.  41  ). Figure  4  also shows that the QFLS of the perovskite/C 60 film is reduced to approximately 1.136 eV ± 10 mV and the PTAA/perovskite film exhibits a QFLS of approximately 1.125 eV ± 10 mV. It is important to note that, compared to the neat absorber material with a PL quantum yield of ~0.5%, addition of PTAA or C 60 results in a large reduction of the average photoluminescence efficiency (for example, 0.017% for a perovskite/C 60 film), which also means a large increase in the nonradiative loss current (approximately 30-fold in case of perovskite/ C 60 compared to the neat absorber material). Yet, despite the different nature of these two interfaces, the non-radiative recombination losses at both interfaces are surprisingly similar (lowering the QFLS by ~80 meV compared to the neat absorber), which is consistent with the TRPL results. For the (unoptimized) pin stack (glass/PTAA/perovskite/C 60 ) we obtain a ∆ E F of approximately 1.121 V ± 10 mV, which perfectly matches the average V OC in complete cells under comparable illumination intensities (see below). Interestingly, this value lies only slightly below the QFLS of samples with only one transport layer present, which indicates that the  
 Articles Nature eNergy non-radiative recombination losses at each individual interface are both reducing the I PL (E), yet the QFLS only through the logarithm in equation (2). We also note a good reproducibility and homogeneity of the QFLS on the neat perovskite film and all films with C 60 , except for the glass/PTAA/perovskite heterojunctions, for which we observed a relatively large batch-to-batch variation (with the average QFLS ranging from 1.09 eV to 1.16 eV, see Supplementary Table  1 ). On the other hand, no difference in the QFLS was observed between a PTAA/perovskite film on a glass or an ITO substrate, which suggests no additional non-radiative recombination losses at the ITO/ PTAA interface (see Supplementary Fig.  5 ). Though Fig.  4  shows that the perovskite absorber imposes a substantial limitation on the V OC , we would expect that it is the weakest component of the (pin) stack that dominates the non-radiative loss current and sets the upper limit for the device V OC (in our case both interfaces equally). To further clarify the importance of interfacial optimizations in relation to bulk optimizations depending on the selectivity of the interlayers, we numerically simulated the opencircuit voltage of a pin device stack by varying the interface recombination velocities and the bulk lifetime using a drift-diffusion simulator (Supplementary Fig.  6 )  42  . Applying the measured interface-recombination velocity in our structures before optimization (that is, ~2,000 cm s -1 ) and bulk lifetime (500 ns) as input parameters, the simulation accurately describes the V OC of our standard cells. The simulations clearly show that even if we improved the perovskite bulk lifetime multiple times (to much greater than 500 ns), no V OC improvements are possible when the interface recombination velocities stay at 2,000 cm s -1 . We therefore conclude that the V OC of our cells is entirely limited by the interfaces, and any improvement of the bulk would be lost due to rapid interfacial recombination. Thus, it is essential to systematically improve the interfaces, as we discuss in the following. 
 Suppression of interfacial recombination Following the approach proposed by Lee et al.  43  to improve the wettability of hydrophobic charge transport layers, we functionalized the PTAA layer with the interface compatibilizer poly[(9,9-bis(30-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] dibromide (PFN-P2)-a conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPE). In line with their findings  43  , the amphiphilic properties of PFN-P2 improved the wetting of the perovskite film on the hydrophobic PTAA, thus greatly enhancing the fabri cation yield of our cells without frequent pinhole formation. To reveal possible changes of the layer morphology as a function of the underlying substrate, we performed top and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements of perovskite films deposited on glass, glass/ITO/PTAA and glass/ITO/PTAA/PFN-P2. The images shown in Supplementary Fig.  7  demonstrate perovskite grains ranging from tens of nanometres to micrometres in size and indicate, at least qualitatively, only small changes of the perovskite bulk morphology across these substrates. Importantly, we find that PFN-P2 causes a substantial reduction of the recombination at the hole transport layer contact, as shown in Fig.  5a, b . This resulted in an average QFLS value (~1.19 eV) very close to the value for the neat perovskite (~1.21 eV) while simultaneously improving the homogeneity of the absolute PL image. To check whether PFN-P2 itself passivates the perovskite surface by reducing trap-assisted recombination independent of the presence of the hole transport layer/ perovskite interface, we compared QFLS maps of glass/perovskite and glass/PFN-P2/perovskite samples (Supplementary Table  1 ). No differences in the QFLS were found, which allows us to assign the increased QFLS of the hole transport layer/PFN-P2/perovskite junction to suppressed interfacial recombination. In accordance with this, we recorded a significantly slower TRPL decay on samples including PFN-P2 (Fig.  5c ). Motivated by this success, we aimed to reduce the detrimental recombination at the perovskite/electron transport layer interface. Different strategies have been reported to block holes at the n-interface, such as polystyrene  44  or choline chloride  11  for pin cells or Ga 2 O 3 for nip cells  13  . However, for our triple cation pin perovskite solar cells we found the most significant effect on the QFLS and device efficiency when inserting an ultrathin layer (0.6-1 nm) of LiF between the perovskite and C 60 , causing a reduction of the non-radiative interfacial recombination loss by 35 meV (Fig.  5d, e ). Again, as shown in Fig.  5f , the increase in QFLS was correlated with a slower mono-exponential TRPL decay (with a lifetime that increased from 26 ns to 180 ns for a perovskite/C 60 and perovskite/LiF/C 60 film on glass, respectively.) 
 Photovoltaic performance Introducing both interlayers led to considerable improvements of the cell efficiency (from an average of 18% to 20%) through an increase in V OC and fill factor (see Supplementary Fig.  8  for the performance of 6 mm 2 devices). Importantly, the average V OC of cells with both interlayers present is 1.16 V, which compares well with the average QFLS of the perovskite/LiF/C 60 stack and the complete device stack (~1.17 eV, see Supplementary Table  1 ). Measuring the V OC as a function of light intensity on cells with and without both interlayers reveals a similar ideality factor but a smaller dark recombination current density for the interlayer-containing device, indicating that these additional layers do affect the rate but not the overall nature of the recombination process (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). From the device manufacturing perspective, introducing PFN-P2 greatly improved the homogeneity of the perovskite films, allowing us to manufacture 1 cm 2 cells without the frequent pinhole formation encountered in our standard cells (without the interlayers), resulting in reproducible high efficiencies. Typically, without PFN-P2, only one out of three 1 cm 2 cells resulted in efficiencies above 18%, while this PCE could be safely achieved with 17 out of 18 cells in two batches with 9 cells each if PFN-P2 was included. Cells with PFN-P2 (but without LiF) reached efficiencies up to 19.6% (J SC = 21.85 mA cm -2 , V OC = 1.143 V, fill factor = 78.6% Supplementary Fig.  10 ) when measured with an aperture mask (1.018 cm 2 ) at 25 °C. The short-circuit current matched the integrated external quantum efficiency (EQE) and solar spectrum product (21.5 mA cm -2 ) within an error of less than 2% (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). This cell was certified by an independent accredited institute (Institute for Solar Energy, Fraunhofer Freiburg), which gave a stabilized PCE of 19.22% Supplementary Fig.  12 ) with a negligible mismatch to our J-V measurement in terms of current. Moreover, encapsulated cells were stable for at least 100 h under maximum power point (MPP) tracking conditions in air and constant illumination from a white light-emitting diode (LED) with 1 Sun equivalent light intensity, with only a small loss in efficiency (0.6% absolute) (Supplementary Fig.  13 ). We also note that using 10 Ω sq -1 ITO substrates instead of our standard 15 Ω sq -1 ITO substrates allowed us to achieve fill factors above 81%; values which, to our knowledge, are 3% higher than the highest reported fill factors for 1 cm 2 size cells (Supplementary Fig.  14 )  45  . As expected from the QFLS analysis, the V OC of the cells is significantly increased through the introduction of the LiF interlayer (~1.17 V), pushing the PCE of our 1 cm 2 cells up to a value of 20.0%, with virtually no hysteresis and a stable power output, as shown in Fig.  6 . However, compared to the highest certified 1 cm 2 cells 46 with a PCE of 20.9% (J SC of 24.9 mA cm -2 , geometry and structure currently unpublished) a remaining limitation of our cells is their relatively low short-circuit current. Thus, to lower the bandgap of the perovskite layer, we optimized the ratio of FAPbI 3 to MAPbBr 3 . We found that using a ratio of 89:11 allows a significant improvement in short-circuit current (0.5-1 mA cm -2 ) with surprisingly minimal loss in V OC and efficiencies up to 21.6% for small 6 mm 2 cells (J SC = 23.2 mA cm -2 , V OC = 1.156 V, fill factor = 80.4%) (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). As for the 1 cm 2 devices, Supplementary Fig.  15a  shows our present hero device with both interlayers 0.89 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.11 ] 0.95 perovskite with an efficiency of 20.3%, again with very small mismatch versus the integrated EQE-solar spectrum product (Supplementary Fig.  15b ). This cell was certified by Fraunhofer-ISE, resulting in a PCE of 19.83%, which is currently the highest certified efficiency of a 1 cm 2 perovskite cell with published geometry and structure (Supplementary Figs.  16  and 17 )  4  . We also highlight the important fact that the efficiency of our cells is stabilized, in contrast to most previous perovskite solar cell certifications, which are denoted as 'not stabilized'  4, 46  . Last, we note that our concept to identify and suppress interfacial recombination can be successfully generalized to other perovskite compositions, including the standard methylammonium lead iodide absorber (MAPI), where we reached efficiencies slightly above 20%; as well as Cs-containing formamidinium lead iodide perovskite cells (Cs 0.05 FA 0.95 )PbI 3 with close to 20% PCE (Supplementary Fig.  18 ).

 Nature eNergy The latter system is particularly interesting as pure FAPbI 3 exhibits a bandgap of 1.47 eV, which is closer to the optimum bandgap in the Shockley-Queisser model  47  . However, reports of FAPbI 3 cells are rare and the efficiencies of such devices lag significantly behind the mixed perovskite systems  [47] [48] [49]  . Measurement of the absolute PL from the individual perovskite/charge transport layer junctions proves once again substantial reduction of interfacial recombination by the addition of PFN-P2 and LiF at the p-and n-interfaces, respectively (Supplementary Table  2 ). Notably, this allowed the devices to reach record efficiencies for MA/Br-free FAPbI 3 perovskite solar cells, which further underlines the potential of our recombination analysis and interfacial engineering approach (Supplementary Fig.  18 ). 
 Conclusions Hyperspectral photoluminescence imaging allowed us to identify the origin of non-radiative recombination loss channels through mapping of the QFLS of the relevant perovskite/transport layer combinations. We found significant non-radiative recombination losses in the neat perovskite layer that reduce the potential V OC by approximately 135 mV compared to the radiative limit of this type of perovskite (1.345 V). However, interface recombination at each individual hybrid interface (PTAA/perovskite and perovskite/C 60 ) dominates the non-radiative loss current in the stack and results in a significant reduction of the QFLS down to ~1.13 eV. In line with this interpretation, we achieved a considerable improvement of the device performance by applying PFN-P2 and LiF as interfacial layers, which suppressed the recombination losses by 65 meV and 35 meV at the p-and n-interfaces, respectively. The reduced recombination and increased QFLS splitting resulted in significant V OC and fill factor gains, which in combination with an optimized composition of the perovskite layer led to a PCE above 20% for 1 cm 2 cells, with a certified PCE of 19.83% and stabilized power output. This work demonstrates how interfacial recombination losses can be unambiguously identified and suppressed, and paves the way to reach the thermodynamic limit for perovskite solar cells through further minimization of interface and trap-assisted recombination in the absorber layer. 
 Methods Hyperspectral absolute photoluminescence imaging. Excitation for the PL imaging measurements was performed with two 450 nm LEDs equipped with diffuser lenses. The intensity of the LEDs was adjusted to ~1 Sun by illuminating a contacted perovskite solar cell (short circuit) and matching the current density to the short-circuit current measured in the J-V sun simulator (the measured shortcircuit current density of the solar cell under this illumination was 22.2 mA cm -2 ). The photoluminescence image detection was performed with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Allied Vision) coupled with a liquid crystal tunable filter. The system was calibrated to absolute photon numbers in two steps in a similar way to the process described by Delamarre and colleagues  50  . For this purpose an infrared laser diode and a spectrally calibrated halogen lamp were coupled to an integrating sphere. The pixel resolution of the images corresponds to about 10 μ m in diameter. Sets of images from 650 nm to 1,100 nm taken at a step size of 5 nm were recorded. All absolute PL measurements were performed on films with the same thicknesses as used in the operational solar cells. A global systematic error of 20 meV (or equivalently an approximate factor of two in PL efficiency) was estimated on the basis of uncertainties in the optimum approach to calculate the QFLS (equation (  2 )), as well as small uncertainties in the estimation of the bandgap and the temperature. Time-resolved PL. PL data was acquired with a TCSPC system (Berger & Lahr) after excitation with a pulse-picked and frequency-doubled output from a modelocked Ti:sapphire oscillator (Coherent Chameleon) with nominal pulse durations ~100 fs and a fluence of ~ 30 nJ cm -2 at a wavelength of 470 nm. The samples were excited from the side of the interface we sought to investigate (that is, the glass side for PTAA and the top side for the other samples). The short-wavelength excitation was chosen to specifically excite the samples close to the interface we were interested in. All TRPL measurements were performed on films with the same thicknesses as used in the operational solar cells. Device fabrication. Pre-patterned 2.5 × 2.5 cm² 15 Ω sq -1 ITO substrates (Automatic Research) were cleaned with acetone, 3% Hellmanex solution, deionized water and isopropanol, by sonication for 10 min in each solution. After a microwave plasma treatment (3 min, 200 W), the samples were transferred to a N 2 -filled glovebox. A thin (~8 nm) PTAA (Sigma-Aldrich) layer was spin-coated from a 1.5 mg ml -1 toluene solution at 6,000 r.p.m. for 30 s using an acceleration of 2,000 r.p.m. per second. The layers were subsequently annealed inside a nitrogenfilled glovebox ( < 1 ppm H 2 O and O 2 ) at 100 °C for 10 min. After the substrate was allowed to cool for 5 min, a 60 µ l solution of PFN-P2 (0.5 mg ml -1 in methanol) purchased from 1-Material was added to the spinning substrate at 5,000 r.p.m. for 20 s, resulting in a film with thickness below the detection limit of our atomic force microscopy (less than 5 nm). The perovskite layer was prepared using an anti-solvent treatment and the concentration of the perovskite components in the solution and solvent ratios were detailed in a previous work  9  . We found an improvement in V OC and reproducibility by switching the anti-solvent from diethyl ether (DEE) to ethyl acetate, which is miscible with dimethylformamide:dimethyl sulfoxide (DMF:DMSO) mixtures and has a higher boiling point (77.1 °C) and an optimal polarity of approximately 4.5. Therefore, all cells reported here were fabricated using ethyl acetate as the anti-solvent. The perovskite layer was deposited by spin-coating at 4,000 r.p.m. for 35 s. Ten seconds after the start of the spinning process, the spinning substrate was washed with 300 µ l ethyl acetate for approximately 1 s (the anti-solvent was placed in the centre of the film). The perovskite film was then annealed at 100 °C for 1 h on a preheated hotplate. The samples were transferred to an evaporation chamber and LiF (6 Å to 1 nm), C 60 (30 nm), BCP (8 nm) and copper (100 nm) were deposited under vacuum (p = 10 -7 mbar). After completion, the glass side of the 1 cm 2 cells was coated with a Brisbane Materials Technology (Australia Pty Ltd) anti-reflection coating optimized for a broadband spectral response in the AM1.5 window. Current density-voltage characteristics. J-V curves were obtained in a two-wire source-sense configuration with a Keithley 2400. An Oriel class AAA Xenon lamp-based sun simulator was used for illumination, providing approximately 100 mW cm -2 of AM1.5 G irradiation, and the intensity was monitored simultaneously with a Si photodiode. The exact illumination intensity was used for efficiency calculations, and the simulator was calibrated with a KG5-filtered silicon solar cell (certified by Fraunhofer ISE). A spectral mismatch calculation was performed based on the spectral irradiance of the solar simulator, the EQE of the reference silicon solar cell and three typical EQEs of our cells. This resulted in three mismatch factors of M = 0.9949, 0.9996 and 0.9976. Given the very small deviation from unity, the measured J SC was not corrected by the factor 1/M. All EQEs presented in this work were measured by ISE-Fraunhofer. Coupled optical and Shockley-Queisser modelling. We employed an optical modelling tool  51  to calculate the photogenerated current inside the perovskite material depending on the thickness of the ITO layer. To this end, we kept the other layer thicknesses constant (8 nm PTAA, 450 nm perovskite, 20 nm C 60 , 8 nm BCP, 100 nm copper). We employed measured spectral refractive indices n and k for all layers under normal incident illumination. The resulting short-circuit current was used to numerically solve the modified Shockley-Queisser equation (typical voltage steps are 1 mV) including an ideality factor of 1.5 (ref.  9  ), a shunt resistance of 4,000 Ω , a luminescent efficiency of 0.1% (ref.  15  ) a radiative current of 8 × 10 -20 A cm -2 and an internal series resistance of 1.5 Ω cm 2 in addition to the series resistance imposed by the ITO for any given thickness and geometry. Our standard ITO (Automatic Research GmbH, Germany) has a nominal sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq -1 with a thickness of 150 nm. We extrapolated the resulting sheet resistance starting from this value. 2 ⁄Figure 3 ,Supplementary Figure 4 . 234 𝑛 e/h density of electrons/holes in the conduction/valance band, and 𝑁 C/V ~ 𝑚 e(h) * 3 the effective density of states in the conduction and valence band (3.12x10 21 /m 3 ), respectively.

Supplementary Figure 3. Transient photoluminescence decays measured on glass/PTAA /perovskite and glass/perovskite/PTAA stacks.

Universal Current Losses in Perovskite Solar Cells Due to Mobile Ions

Introduction Perovskite solar cells have undergone major development from their first discovery in 2009, to a viable technology that is approaching commercialization.  [1]  One of their most interesting assets is the wide range of bandgaps which can be fabricated by changing the perovskite composition, opening up the possibility to produce allperovskite multijunction cells that can overcome the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit of single junctions. For a tandem cell, the ideal bandgaps for the top and bottom cell are 1.7-1.9 and 0.9-1.2 eV, respectively.  [2]  Fully lead-based perovskites are widely investigated and have reached power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 25.5%.  [3]  In order to achieve ideal bandgaps for the low-gap cell in all-perovskite tandem photovoltaics, a mixture of lead and tin atoms at the B-site of the ABX 3 perovskite structure is required. This allows metal halide perovskites to reach bandgaps as low as 1.2 eV.  [4, 5]  While many studies in the literature focus their efforts into improving the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) and fill factor (FF) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), there are less reports that investigate the loss in short-circuit current density (J SC ). In fact, highperforming perovskites have been shown to have ""only"" moderate (≈5-15%) J SC losses compared to the SQ limit making them competitive in this regard with established technologies such as c-Si and GaAs, as shown in Figure  1a . In many cases, this loss is quickly overlooked and treated as a result of suboptimal light management in the cell which could be solved by optimizing the thickness of the solar cell stack or by using more complex light management strategies such as, for example, textured substrates,  [6, 7]  cavities & plasmon resonances,  [8]  or carefully designed anti-reflective layers.  [9, 10]  However, as we will show, suboptimal light management is not the only cause of J SC losses in perovskite solar cells, even in well performing mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite cells. Tin-based and mixed PbSn perovskite solar cells are particularly affected by short-circuit current losses and their efficiencies lag behind those of their full-lead equivalents, despite having a band gap closer to the ideal for single junctions, with the best mixed lead/tin cells only reaching certified PCEs Efficient mixed metal lead-tin halide perovskites are essential for the development of all-perovskite tandem solar cells, however they are currently limited by significant short-circuit current losses despite their near optimal bandgap (≈1.25 eV). Herein, the origin of these losses is investigated, using a combination of voltage dependent photoluminescence (PL) timeseries and various charge extraction measurements. It is demonstrated that the Pb/Sn-perovskite devices suffer from a reduction in the charge extraction efficiency within the first few seconds of operation, which leads to a loss in current and lower maximum power output. In addition, the emitted PL from the device rises on the exact same timescales due to the accumulation of electronic charges in the active layer. Using transient charge extraction measurements, it is shown that these observations cannot be explained by doping-induced electronic charges but by the movement of mobile ions toward the perovskite/transport layer interfaces, which inhibits charge extraction due to band flattening. Finally, these findings are generalized to lead-based perovskites, showing that the loss mechanism is universal. This elucidates the negative role mobile ions play in perovskite solar cells and paves a path toward understanding and mitigating a key loss mechanism. of a bit over 20%.  [11] [12] [13] [14]  Considering reported bandgaps of 1.22 eV for a 50:50 Pb:Sn mixture, this would allow a maximum shortcircuit current density of ≈37.1 mA cm -2 if we assume that an average external quantum efficiency of 95% can be achieved as demonstrated in the best Pb-perovskite cells.  [15, 16]  However, even the best APbSnI 3 perovskites achieve significantly lower currents, for example, 32 mA cm -2 have been demonstrated for a bandgap of 1.22 eV in ref. [13]. In most other reports, PbSn perovskites with similar bandgaps delivered even lower shortcircuit current (<30 mA cm  -2  ).  [17] [18] [19]  This discrepancy between two apparently similar technologies is not often discussed and it is currently not clear why Sn(II) containing perovskites cannot achieve as high currents as their lead counterparts relative to their SQ limits. Generally, it is well known that Sn(II)-containing metal halide perovskites are more prone to oxidation to Sn(IV) than their Pb(II) counterparts, due to the inert pair effect stabilizing the 6s electrons in Pb(II). This propensity to oxidize has led researchers to conclude that this is likely the origin of performance losses in PbSn perovskites. In turn, significant efforts have been undertaken to prevent this oxidation, or reduce its negative effects, such as the addition of metallic Sn to the solution to reduce Sn 4+ through comproportionation,  [13]  addition of antioxidants and reducing agents,  [14, 20, 21]  or addition of excess Sn 2+ by using salts such as SnF 2 , which also acts as a reducing agent.  [22]  Recently, it was also proposed to move away from using dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as a co-solvent, as this could oxidize Sn 2+ to Sn 4+ in solution.  [23]  However, the exact effect of the increased concentration of ""oxidation-induced"" mobile charges in the system has only been investigated by a few researchers.  [24] [25] [26]  On the one hand, there has been substantial evidence of a large increase in the dark conductivity of Sn based perovskites upon exposure to oxygen, which is most likely due to electronic doping. For example, in ref. [27,28], a background hole carrier concentration of 10 15 to 10 16 cm -3 has been reported. This led to the conclusion that it is largely the p-doping that is responsible for the significant current losses.  [29, 30]  For example, a high concentration of doping-induced carriers could reduce the lifetime and diffusion length of photoinduced charge or screen the   [13,48,49], as compared to the perovskite cells studied in this work (filled circles). The graph was inspired by ref. [56] Generally, PbSn-perovskites have larger current losses compared to Pb-perovskites, including MAPbI 3 and several triple cation Cs 0.05 (FA x MA y ) 0.95 Pb(I x Br y ) 3 devices made from different (x:y) ratios of FAPbI 3 and MAPbBr 3 . b) A cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy image of a typical FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 perovskite pin-type solar cell device. c) Forward and reverse JV scan at a scan rate of 60 mV s -1 under AM1.5G illumination. d) Device absorption (1-reflectance) and external quantum efficiency spectra of a FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 perovskite pin-type solar cell, with a graphical representation of the different current losses that occur in the system. It can be seen that, besides parasitic absorption and optical losses that stem from the sample being too thin to absorb all the light, there are also significant charge collection losses. built-in field, which would in turn reduce the charge extraction efficiency, thereby causing short-circuit current losses.  [27, 31, 32]  Although it is expected that high levels of doping can undermine the device performance, the exact underlying mechanisms have not been studied thoroughly experimentally, and the concentration of charge carriers required to induce detrimental effects is not precisely known. Moreover, the charge collection losses at short-circuit conditions in Sn-based perovskites can be caused by an insufficient charge carrier diffusion length due to electronic defects, which would also negatively affect the open-circuit voltage. On the other hand, the performance losses could be caused by mobile ions, which may cause screening (or more precisely, a redistribution) of the internal field. Several groups have attempted to quantify mobile ion concentrations in different perovskites, and their outcomes are generally in the range of 10 15 to 10 19 cm -3 .  [33] [34] [35] [36]  Indeed, the presence of mobile ions is expected in PbSn perovskite thin-films. For example, Leijtens et al.  [37]  recently investigated the mechanism of oxidation of Sn and PbSn perovskites through X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and UV-vis, and demonstrated that mobile ions such as FA + or I -are likely formed. However, the effect of mobile ions on the short-circuit current losses in perovskites has, in general, not been investigated as intensively as, for example, their effect on the V OC ,  [38]  the hysteresis,  [39] [40] [41]  and device stability.  [42] [43] [44]  In order to further improve PbSn and Pb-based perovskite solar cells and other electronic devices,  [45, 46]  it is vital to gain a more detailed understanding of the mechanism causing short-circuit current losses and the exact effects of electronic doping and mobile ions on the device operation. In this work, we investigated short-circuit current losses in low bandgap, mixed PbSn (FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 ) and other lead-based perovskite cells. In particular, we first aimed to understand whether the charge transport losses under short-circuit conditions in mixed PbSn perovskites (FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 ) are a result of electronic doping or mobile ions, before generalizing the results to other Pb-based systems. To this end, we recorded the temporal evolution of the current transient and determined a concurrent rise in the photoluminescence (PL) emission intensity after switching the voltage from V OC to short-circuit, which implies an accumulation of electronic charge in the perovskite bulk. We hence attribute the reduced current-density to a reduced charge extraction efficiency. The decay in current directly translates into a loss of the steady-state maximum power point output of the device on the same timescales and to a current loss at slow scan speeds. To distinguish whether background doping or mobile ions are responsible for this loss, we performed bias assisted charge extraction (BACE) and charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV) measurements, which allowed us to investigate the density and dynamics of extracted electronic and ionic charges. Overall, these measurements underline the extraction of electronic (bias-induced injected) charges on the µs-timescales, while the characteristic features of mobile ions appear on the ms-s timescales, as observed in the current decay transients. Importantly, the ionic charge density (>1 × 10 17 cm -3 ) was found to exceed the injected and photogenerated electronic charge density (5 × 10 15 cm -3 ) present at V OC by several orders of magnitudes, therefore dominating the observed recombination losses in the transient current decay. Moreover, the density of doping induced equilibrium charges (≈6 × 10 14 cm -3 ) was found to be negligible compared to the capacitive charge density (6 × 10 15 cm -3 ), hence the density of doping-induced charge, in contrast with the mobile ion density, is insufficient to screen or redistribute the built-in potential. Furthermore, we could reproduce both the transient and steady-state performance of the device using numerical simulations, which further corroborated the understanding obtained from the experimental results. Finally, we demonstrated that PbSn based perovskites are not unique with respect to ion-induced current losses, but the same losses appear in various other perovskite compositions and architectures. Overall, the mobile ion induced losses limit the power conversion efficiency of our devices by 1-3% absolute. As such, this work underlines the importance ""ionmanagement"" to overcome band flattening and to minimize the recombination losses under maximum power point losses and improve device stability. 
 Results Here we studied, low bandgap FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 perovskite photovoltaic devices. The device stack is comprised of spin-coated poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) hole transporting layer (HTL) on a glass substrate coated with an indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) conductive layer. On top of that, the perovskite layer with a thickness of 470 nm is deposited via spin-coating. The stack is completed by an electron transporting layer (ETL) comprised of evaporated C 60 (30 nm) and bathocuproine (BCP) (8 nm), with a copper (Cu) electrode on top. A detailed description of the device preparation can be found in Supporting Information. A crosssection of a complete device is displayed in Figure  1b . A JV scan of a characteristic efficient device can be seen in Figure  1c , while more detailed characteristics and statistics can be found in Figure  S1 , Supporting Information. From the device absorption and the external quantum efficiency (EQE), displayed in Figure  1d , the different current losses in the device can be determined. First of all, the optical losses of the device, as determined from the total reflectance R of the device, are significant. This is caused by the relatively low absorption coefficient of the lead-tin perovskite near the band edge (Figure  S2 , Supporting Information) and the absorber layer being too thin to absorb all the incident photons with energies above the bandgap. On top of that, the lead-tin perovskite devices suffer from significant additional collection losses (≈2 mAcm -2 ), which can be determined from the difference between the device absorption minus parasitic losses in the ITO, PEDOT:PSS and copper (i.e., 1-R-R parasitic ), and the device EQE. The parasitic losses were estimated using a transfer matrix code developed by McGehee, et al.  [47]  Although the optical losses can be largely reduced in thicker ≈800 nm devices (Figure  S3 , Supporting Information), the J SC cannot be improved due to enhanced collection losses. Therefore, it can be concluded that the combination of relatively large optical losses in 470 nm thick devices and the large collection losses in our thicker devices (e.g., ≈800 nm), possibly due to traps resulting in an insufficient carrier diffusion length, are among the main reasons for the relatively low J SC of the PbSn-perovskite as compared to Pb-based perovskites, with respect to what is expected from their different band gaps. In the following, however, we focus on understanding the observed charge collection losses at 0 V in the optimum 470 nm-thick devices, which are poorly understood and also significantly contributing to the J SC loss. To investigate these collection losses at 0 V, we first measured the time dependence of the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and the short-circuit current density (J SC ) immediately after switching from V OC to 0 V, while the sample remains under continuous illumination. As can be seen in Figure  2a , the J SC falls during the initial few seconds of operation at 0 V before eventually reaching a steady-state. On average, we find that freshly prepared FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 devices experience current density losses of 1.4 mA cm -2 . This equals about 5% of the initial current density. To reveal the reason for the loss in current, we simultaneously measured the emitted PL from the cell as a function of time. The temporal evolution of the PL spectra is displayed in Figure  2b , while the corresponding peak height is displayed in Figure  2c . It can be seen that, when the device bias is changed to 0 V at t = 0 s, the PL is initially nearly completely quenched. Considering that the PL yield is directly proportional to the product of the electron and hole density (n × p), the strong reduction of the PL at 0 V with respect to V OC indicates an efficient initial extraction of electronic charges.  [50]  However, after the initial quench, the PLQY starts to quickly rise again despite the fact that the device is still kept under short-circuit conditions. This indicates that the efficiency of the charge extraction is gradually reduced, causing charges to accumulate in the device until the PL and the charge carrier distribution stabilizes after about 3 s. Therefore, the loss of current is not consistent with a deteriorating interface quality Adv. Energy Mater. 2021, 11, 2101447 or defects. At the time of stabilization, the PL has increased to up to ≈6% of the PLQY value at open circuit conditions. Importantly, the decrease in current density and increased PL yield leads also to a direct loss in efficiency, that is, in the initial phase of maximum power point (MPP) tracking measurements, as displayed in Figure  2d . This has important implications as it indicates that the observed effect also influences cell performance under steady-state working conditions. Figure  2e  displays the field screening due the accumulation of mobile ions at the interfaces over time, which is expected to cause the observed J SC and MPP losses and the increase of the PL on the same timescales. The simplified time dependent band structures displayed in Figure  2e  are extracted from our numerical device simulations (details about the simulations are discussed further below). The corresponding time-dependent simulated band structures are presented in Figure  S4 , Supporting Information, which also includes a more detailed description of the movement of mobile ions in the performed experiments. Interestingly, as shown in Figure  S5 , Supporting Information, we find that there is an approximately linear relationship between the current decay and the increase in PL at 0 V. To explain this, we consider that the PL yield is proportional to the radiative recombination current ( J rad = eϕ PL ), while the current decay is mostly governed by non-radiative recombination (as the overall PLQY yield of the sample is only 10 -4 ). Therefore, a linear relationship between the current decay and the PL increase implies that the radiative and non-radiative recombination losses are directly proportional to each other. In other words, the field screening-induced accumulation of electronic charges in the active layer increases the radiative and non-radiative recombination losses in the same way, which is consistent with the findings of our previous study.  [50]  It is important to note that the current losses can occur even if the charge carrier diffusion length in the perovskite exceeds the film thickness. This is because the transport layers can limit the extraction from the device and also interfacial recombination can increase if more charges accumulate in the active layer. To describe the current decay more quantitatively, we performed numerical drift-diffusion simulations of the cell, using the commercially available SETFOS 5.1 software package provided by FLUXiM. The input parameters for the simulations shown in Table  S1 , Supporting Information were partially based on our previous simulation work of pin-type triple cation perovskites,  [51, 52]  and parameters tailored for lead-tin using the literature specified in Table  S1 , Supporting Information and our own extraction measurements, as discussed further below. The fit from the numerical simulations is shown in Figure  2a  by the dashed line, which highlights that both the kinetics of the decay can be reproduced with the experimentally obtained effective ion diffusion coefficient (≈10 -10 cm 2 s -1 ) and density (≈10 17 cm -3 ) as well as the overall magnitude of the current losses. Figure  S6 , Supporting Information demonstrates the simulated current decay for other mobile ion densities. In the following we demonstrate that the time dependent losses of the short-circuit current are also present in JV hysteresis measurements at slow scan speeds. To clearly visualize this important fact, we performed ""fast hysteresis"" measurements, where the JV is measured in forward and reverse direction over several orders of magnitude in scan speed (100 mV s -1 to 800 V s -1 ) after keeping the cell under open-circuit conditions and constant AM1.5G illumination. The details of this measurement are presented in Supporting Information. ) ) ) Figure  3 . a) The current density as obtained from JV scans in forward and reverse direction as a function of scan speed (100 mV s -1 to 800 V s -1 ). b) exemplifies the JV scans in forward and reverse direction at the slowest (top) and fastest scan speed (bottom). At fast enough scan speeds (scan time << ion transit time), the mobile ions in the perovskite layer are not able to react to the change in the applied voltage, and hence the obtained efficiency can be regarded as a proxy of the ion-free efficiency. At slow scan speeds, however, mobile ions are able to screen the built-in field. This lowers the device efficiency, primarily through increased short-circuit current losses in case of the studied cells. Panel (a) shows lower current density for JV scans taken at slower scan speeds, as opposed to the ""mobile-ion free"" JV scans taken at the fastest scan speeds. Hence, the current losses also appear in the JV-measurements at slow scan speeds that are representative for steady-state conditions, as shown in Figure  2 . 800 V s -1 ), the mobile ions do not have enough time to react to the change in the external voltage, hence an ""ion-free current density"" is obtained if the ions are roughly homogeneously distributed at the starting voltage (V OC ). However, at slower scan speeds (e.g., 1 s per scan), the mobile ions are able to follow the change in internal field by moving from their equilibrium positions toward the transport layers, where they start to screen the field causing the losses in the J SC . Indeed, at the slowest scan speeds (10 -1 V s -1 ), a decrease in J SC of about 1.5 mA cm -2 is observed with respect to the fast-scan (800 V s -1 ). As such, both the timescale (1 ms to 10 s) and the magnitude of the current decay (1.5 mA cm -2 ) in the hysteresis measurements is consistent with the temporal current decay shown previously in Figure  2a . In order to distinguish between different processes that could cause the observed current losses and the suspected band flattening, and to elucidate the density and kinetics of free electronic and ionic charge, we performed different charge extraction measurements. Figure  4a  shows the extracted charge as a function of time from bias assisted charge extraction (BACE), where the (displacement) current is recorded upon a switch from V OC to 0 V. The charge inside the active layer is thereby obtained by integrating the displacement current over time. It is important to note that mobile ions are not extracted from the device rather transported to the transport layers or electrodes, which however, causes an external displacement current. As can be seen in Figure  4a , the obtained temporal evolution of the charge density displays two features; an initial rise at ≈1 µs and a second rise at ≈300 ms. The initial rise consists itself of two contributions, the extraction of electronic charges that were injected at V OC and the RC decay due to the electrode (capacitive) charge (CU, where U is the V OC ). As shown in Figure  S7 , Supporting Information, using a separate setup with a home-built amplifier with a relatively low resistance (≈5 Ω), we can distinguish the contribution of these two initial processes to the first bump. As shown in  an injected charge carrier density of 2 × 10 15 cm -3 , while the electrode charge divided by the perovskite volume equals to 6 × 10 15 cm -3 at 0 V (if the V OC is equal to the built-in field). Furthermore, upon applying a constant background illumination with a 1-sun equivalent intensity, the same measurement allows us to quantify the photogenerated charge carrier density that is present at V OC , Figure  S8 , Supporting Information. The details of the measurement are discussed more elaborately in the captions of the corresponding figures in Supporting Information. Coming back to Figure  4a , the second increase in the extracted (or transported) charge is assigned to the mobile ion density in the system with a characteristic effective displacement time of 300 ms. This corresponds to the timescale observed in the current decay and PL increase. Note, this corresponds to an effective ion mobility of 4 × 10 -9 cm 2 V -1 s -1 and a diffusion coefficient of ≈1 × 10 -10 cm 2 s -1 . Importantly, the obtained ion density in the system is ≈2 × 10 17 cm -3 , which is significantly larger than the electronic charge in the system, including the electrode charge (per volume) that creates the built-in potential. Hence, a significant redistribution of the built-in field is expected due to the obtained ion density (as already shown above in Figure  2e ). We note again, that the obtained ion diffusion coefficient and density was used as an input parameter for the numerical simulations, which allowed us to fit the current decay shown in Figure  2a . In order to further corroborate the BACE measurements, we performed charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (dark-CELIV) measurements, which are shown in Figure  4b . In this measurement, the linearly increasing voltage leads to a constant charging current of the electrodes. For a dielectric capacitor in the absence of mobile charges in the active layer, the response to the CELIV voltage pulse is a step function.  [53]  Any additional charge present, for example, doping induced equilibrium charges or mobile ions (or photogenerated charges with background light), will cause a ""bump"" in the transient response, which allows us to estimate their density with respect to the electrode charge (CV max , where V max = -0.4 V is the maximum applied voltage of the triangular pulse in this case). Hence, the absence of an initial bump in the dark-CELIV response, shown in Figure  4b , indicates that the doping density is insignificant with respect to CV max per cell volume (≪ 5 × 10 15 cm -3 ). To further highlight this important point, we performed a photo-CELIV measurement, where we intentionally photogenerated a charge carrier density of e.g. 1 × 10 15 cm -3 in the perovskite cell. As shown in Figure  4c , this photogenerated charge carrier density can nicely be seen in the current response and is roughly in the correct ratio compared to the CV max charge. Moreover, the extraction of the photo generated charge carrier density happens on the order of 1 µs, which further confirms the timescale of electronic charge transport. We note the relatively long extraction time is likely limited by the transport layers rather than bulk transport through the perovskite layer, as has been previously shown.  [54]  To quantify the doping density in the PbSn perovskite, we performed lateral conductivity measurements which revealed a dark conductivity of 9 × 10 -5 S cm -1 (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information). Assuming a long-range charge carrier mobility of roughly 1 cm 2 V -1 s -1 (which is lower than the short-range charge carrier mobility as obtained from optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy measurements in ref. [18], since we consider grain boundaries), this would correspond to a doping-induced charge carrier density of ≈6 × 10 14 cm -3 , which is consistent with the absence of a dopinginduced feature in the CELIV response. Turning our attention again to the dark-CELIV transient in Figure  4b , after ≈1 ms the signal rises again just as observed in the BACE measurements due to the presence of mobile ions until beyond 100 ms, which represents the detection limit of our current setup. Considering that the current does not saturate, only a lower mobile ion density of 1.5 × 10 16 cm -3 , can be specified upon integration of the dark-CELIV signal. Therefore, these transient measurements demonstrate that the mobile ion concentration is much larger than the photogenerated charge carrier density, the injected charge at V OC and the doping induced charge, and sufficiently large to redistribute the device built-in electric field. In contrast, it is important to note that the doping density is much smaller than the CU charge per cell volume (6 × 10 15 cm -3 ), which is too low to screen the electric field. To further highlight this point, we performed numerical simulations, the results of which, displayed in Figure  4d , demonstrate that the doping density will only start to make a significant impact at densities exceeding ≈1 × 10 16 cm -3 , at which point the built-in field becomes screened. Moreover, it can be seen that electronic doping, although it can affect the device performance at higher concentrations, as is displayed in Figure  S10 , Supporting Information, never leads to a temporal current decay, whereas for mobile ions, temporal current decays are observed for a range of concentrations. Interestingly, we also found that when the mobile ion concentration reaches a certain threshold, the stabilized current still decreases with increasing mobile ion densities, but the temporal decay disappears. We attribute this to the fact that at these high mobile ion densities, the ion concentrations at the TL interfaces are already large enough at t = 0 s to fully screen the field. The simulation results displayed here are for the case of only one mobile ionic species. In Figure  S11 , Supporting Information, results for the case were there are two types of mobile ion present are displayed. Overall, the experimentally measured timescales and carrier densities allow us to conclude that the collection losses of the current stem from the ionic movement in the perovskite causing a redistribution of the internal field, rather than from electronic doping. In order to find out whether the loss mechanism described above is unique for tin-containing perovskites, or if it also occurs for other perovskite compositions or architectures, we investigated several different lead-based perovskite systems. Surprisingly, as shown in Figure  5a , we observed that the exact same charge transport losses are indeed present for all other studied lead-based perovskites, including methyl ammonium lead triiodide, two triple cation perovskites (Cs 0.05 (FA x MA y ) 0.95 Pb(I x Br y ) 3 ), with different x/y ratios as well as for a triple cation perovskite in a nip-configuration based on TiO 2 and Spiro-OMeTAD. Further details of the device fabrication are presented in the Supporting Information. Also for these systems, as displayed in Figure  5b , the transient current decay is accompanied by an increase in PL over time at 0 V, while the timescales of the current loss and deterioration in charge extraction efficiency corresponds to the timescales at which the ions move in the respective systems. Figure  5c  displays the effects of different scan speeds on the obtained short-circuit current confirming that the current at slow scan speeds is significantly lower than the ""ion-free"" J SC fast-scan speeds. This confirms that the finding that ionic charge movement is responsible for the observed current losses can be generalized beyond tin-based perovskites to lead halide perovskites. The formation of field-free regions in the perovskite bulk due to mobile ions is thus not only responsible for the JV hysteresis, but also for significant current and efficient losses under realistic operating conditions. The latter is shown in Figure  5d , which highlights the MPP tracking of several devices with a high time resolution (≈10 ms). Each of these devices displays a quick initial decrease in maximum power output (which might be easily overlooked when tracking the device efficiency over longer times). We point out that light soaking has also shown to have an impact on ion migration and hysteresis.  [55]  In order to distinguish between light soaking effects and the studied current losses, we have checked whether the scan-rate dependent hysteresis is reversible, or if there are permanent/light-induced changes in the device performance. Figure  S12 , Supporting Information shows that for the pin-type perovskite cells studied here, the current losses observed are not linked to light soaking induced changes in the device performance. However, on longer timescales, light soaking may have more pronounced effects. Finally, we note that we found the mobile-ion-induced  losses were overall quite similar in PbSn-and Pb-perovskite, hence we attribute the difference in the J SC loss in these two systems more to the difficulties in obtaining thicker active layers in PbSn-perovskites, which are required due to their lower absorption coefficient at the band edge. Nevertheless, preventing the fast-field screening and the corresponding current losses by minimizing the mobile ion density in all studied perovskites, would thus allow a significant improvement of the current in steady-state and in turn a substantial PCE improvement of between 1.5-3% absolute, even in our optimized devices. 
 Conclusions To summarize, we have demonstrated that the charge collection losses in mixed lead-tin perovskites are caused by an accumulation of electronic charge in the active layer due to a reduction in the charge extraction efficiency over the first few seconds of operation, which simultaneously increases the emitted PL from the device. Through a series of transient electronic measurements and numerical modeling, we identified this collection loss to be due to the presence of mobile ions in these systems which redistribute the internal field within the first few seconds of operation, rather than an recombination rate of photogenerated carriers with doping-induced background charges or increased defect densities. As far as we could assess in this work, doping of (non-oxidized) mixed lead-tin perovskite is not directly causing current losses through band flattening as the doping density is too low to screen the electric field. Going beyond mixed lead-tin systems, to lead-based perovskites, we show that the same process also occurs for a range of different mixed-ion lead-based perovskite solar cells. As with the low bandgap materials, we again find that the timescales of the current loss correspond to the timescales of ion motion in these different systems. Our findings demonstrate that even in what appear to be ""hysteresisfree"" perovskite solar cells at typical scan speeds (≈100 mV s -1 ), the role of mobile ions cannot be neglected, since they still have a large and negative impact on device performance. Considering that the ion-free current (measured at fast scan speeds) is typically ≈1.5 mA cm -2 larger, this constitutes a significant PCE loss. In order to reduce charge collection losses both in mixed lead tin perovskites, but also in neat lead-based perovskites, it is important to gain further understanding of how to reduce the mobile ion density, or how to engineer the devices so that the charge collection is insensitive to the redistribution of the ions. This will then enable us to move closer to the radiative efficiency limit. air from a 1:2 (PEDOT:PSS):methanol solution, that had been filtered using a 0.45 μm GMF filter. The PEDOT:PSS/methanol solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 45 seconds at a ramp of 1500 rpm/s After 20 minutes annealing on a pre-heated hotplate at 150 °C, the films were transferred immediately to N 2 filled glovebox. solution (1-Material, 0.5 mg/ml in methanol) was deposited on top of the PTAA layer dynamically at 4000 rpm for 30 s resulting in a film with thickness below the detection limit of our AFM (< 5 nm). No further annealing of the HTL took place after this.

 Perovskite film fabrication: The mixed-metal FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I3 perovskite films were deposited by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 45 s with a ramp of 1000 rpm/s. 25 s after the start of the spinning process, the spinning substrate was washed with 200 µL anisole, which was deposited in the centre of the film. By the end of the spinning process, the perovskite films turned dark brown. The perovskite films were then annealed at 100 °C for 10 minutes on a preheated hotplate inside the N 2 filled glovebox. During the annealing process, the perovskite films turned black. All triple cation perovskite films were prepared by depositing 120 μL and spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 400 s at a ramp of 1334 rpm/s. 10 s after the start of the spinning process, the spinning substrate was washed with 300 µL ethylacetate for approximately 1 s (the antisolvent was placed in the center of the film). We note, that by the end of the spinning process the perovskite film turned dark brown. The perovskite film was then annealed at 100 °C for 1 h on a preheated hotplate where the film turned slightly darker. The MAPI solution (80 μL) was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 5 s followed by 3000 rpm for 80 s. 100 μL toluene was added dropwise after 40 s to form a transparent perovskite film. After the spin-coating, the films were dried for 2 min in the glovebox at room temperature until the films changed their color from yellow to light brown. The MAPI perovskite layers were then subsequently annealed at 100 °C on a hotplate where the films turned black immediately. For the Cs 0.15 FA 0.85 Pb(I 0.75 Br 0.25 ) 3 perovskite, a volume of 120 μL of the precursor solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm (with a ramping rate of 1334 rpm/s) for 40 sec. After 10 seconds, the film is quenched by adding 300 μL of ethyl-acetate. Right afterward the film is annealed at 100 °C for 60 min inside the N 2 filled glovebox. 
 ETL and Top Contact: After annealing, the samples were transferred to an evaporation chamber where fullerene C 60 (30 nm), 2,9-Dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline BCP (8 nm) and copper (100 nm) were deposited under vacuum (p = 10 -7 mbar). The overlap of the copper and the ITO electrodes defined the active area of the pixel (6 mm 2 ). 
 Device fabrication of nip-type cells: Substrates: Pre-patterned (2.5×2.5 cm 2 ) FTO substrates (Advanced Election Technology Co. Ltd., China) were sonicated for 10 minutes subsequently in 2% Mucasol solution in deionized (DI) water (Schülke & Mayr GmbH, Germany), acetone and isopropanol. After each sonication in Mucasol solution and acetone, the substrates were thoroughly rinsed with DI water. After sonication in isopropanol, the substrates were dried with a nitrogen gun and further cleaned using a UV-ozone cleaner for 20 minutes just before the deposition of the compact TiO 2 layer. 
 Deposition of compact TiO 2 layer: The compact TiO 2 layer was deposited by spray pyrolysis. The solution consisted of 0.72 ml titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt.% in isopropanol, Sigma Aldrich) and 0.48 ml acetyl acetone (Sigma Aldrich) in 10.8 ml of ethanol. The sides of the substrates were covered with glass to ensure a direct contact to the FTO for the evaporated electrodes. After heating the substrates to 450 °C and letting the temperature stabilize for 15 min, the full volume of solution was sprayed with oxygen gas flow on 32 substrates (4 rows and 8 columns) by slowly moving over the substrates once every 30s in a distance of approximately 20 cm at an angle of approximately 45°. The substrates were then kept at 450 °C for 30 min and taken off the hot plate after cooling down to below 150 °C. 
 Deposition of mesoporous TiO 2 layer: The substrates with compact TiO 2 layer were cleaned using a UV-ozone cleaner for 15 minutes. TiO 2 paste (30NR-T, Greatcell Solar Materials Pty Ltd., Australia) was dissolved in ethanol with a weight ratio of 1:6. It was stirred overnight before spin-coating. The mesoporous TiO 2 layer was prepared by spin-coating 50 μl of the dispersion on the compact TiO 2 layer at a speed of 4000 rpm for 10 s with a ramp of 2000 rpm/s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for a minimum of 5 min. The substrates were then annealed on a hot plate programmed to hold a temperature of 125 °C for 5 min, 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, and 450 °C for 30 min with 5 min ramping time between each temperature. 
 LiTFSI-doping of mesoporous TiO 2 layer: 80 μl of a fresh solution consisting of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI, 99.95 %; Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile (10 mg/ml) were spin-coated on the mesoporous TiO 2 layer at a speed of 3000 rpm for 10 s with a ramp of 1000 rpm/s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for a minimum of 5 min. The substrates were then annealed on a hot plate using the same program as for the mesoporous TiO 2 layer. Both TiO 2 layers and the LiTFSI were deposited and annealed in a flow box in ambient air. The surface of the annealed film was finally cleaned using a UV-ozone cleaner for 15 minutes.  
 Perovskite film fabrication: The perovskite layer was prepared by spreading 100 μl of perovskite solution on the substrate and then spinning it with one step of 3500 rpm for 35 s with 5 s acceleration time. 10 s before the end of the program, 300 μl of the anti-solvent Anisole was dripped on the film. The films were then annealed at 100 °C for 40 min. 
 HTL and Top Contact: For the HTL solution, 36.15 mg of 2,2'7,7'-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamin)-9,9'spirobifluoren (Spiro-OMeTAD; Sigma Aldrich) were dissolved in 1 ml of Chlorobenzene.  
 Numerical drift-diffusion simulations: The simulations were performed using Setfos 5.1. Details of the parameters used can be found in Table  S1  Figure  S1 . JV parameter and cell statistics for the studied PbSn-perovskites.       
 Figure S9. The conductivity in 50/50 mixed-metal lead-tin perovskite, which can be used to estimate doping levels. The conductivity was found to be 9x10 -5 S/m, which, assuming a mobility of 1 cm 2 /Vs would correspond to a doping density of 5.6x10 14 cm -3 . The results of these 2-point-probe measurements were crosschecked against previously obtained 4-pointprobe conductivity measurements, and the values turned out to be consistent. 
 Figure S10. Simulated JV curves for a mixed-metal lead-tin perovskite cell with different doping concentrations. It can be seen that doping density only starts to affect the performance of the device once the doping density becomes higher than the electrode charge per perovskite volume that creates the built-in field at 0V. These JV curves were simulated using SCAPS-1D, a software developed at the Department for Electronics and Information Systems (ELIS) at the university of Gent, Belgium. This software is freely available upon request to the developers. 
 Figure S11 . Simulated current decay (a) and stabilized current (b) for a system with either electronic doping, mobile anions, or mobile anions + mobile cations. It can be seen that, though doping can cause a decrease in stabilized current with increasing concentration, it never leads to a transient current decay. In both cases where mobile ions were present, a current decay is observed. We note that the presence of a second mobile ion species seems to have a mitigating effect both on the temporal current decay observed, but also, importantly, on the reduction of the stabilized current.

The graph was inspired by ref.[56] Generally, PbSn-perovskites have larger current losses compared to Pb-perovskites, including MAPbI 3 and several triple cation Cs 0.05 (FA x MA y ) 0.95 Pb(I x Br y ) 3 devices made from different (x:y) ratios of FAPbI 3 and MAPbBr 3 . b) A cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy image of a typical FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 perovskite pin-type solar cell device. c) Forward and reverse JV scan at a scan rate of 60 mV s -1 under AM1.5G illumination. d) Device absorption (1-reflectance) and external quantum efficiency spectra of a FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 perovskite pin-type solar cell, with a graphical representation of the different current losses that occur in the system. It can be seen that, besides parasitic absorption and optical losses that stem from the sample being too thin to absorb all the light, there are also significant charge collection losses.

It can be seen that the PL is initially almost completely quenched, due to efficient charge extraction. However, it quickly comes back up again, indicating that the charge extraction is becoming less efficient and that photogenerated charges accumulate in the perovskite layer. d) The corresponding temporal evolution of the relative device efficiency loss under maximum power point tracking under AM1.5G illumination. e) A schematic representation of the band flattening that is presumably causing the decay in current upon switching to SC conditions. A more elaborate overview of the change in band structures can be found in Figure S4, Supporting Information. Comparing panels (a), (c), and (d) highlights that the decay of the current and the MPP happens on the same timescales as the PL increases.

 Figure 4 . 4 Figure 4. a) Bias assisted charge extraction (BACE) measurement (solid line) upon a switch from open-circuit to short-circuit, including the associated change in the electrode charge (i.e., the capacitance-voltage product 6 × 10 15 cm -3 ) and the injected charge at open-circuit conditions (2 × 10 15 cm -3 ). The extraction of both electronic charge and ionic charge occurs at very different timescales, where the extraction of mobile ions coincides with the current decay observed in Figure 1. b) Current extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV) measurements confirm the results from the BACE measurements,showing that electronic charge extraction occurs much faster than ionic charge, and that the latter occurs on timescales of ms. c) Photo-CELIV transients after a laser excitation with given photocarrier concentrations. The graph demonstrates that a (photogenerated) carrier density of about 1 × 10 15 cm -3 would create an initial bump in the transient response. Considering that the bump is absent in the dark measurement confirms that the doping-induced equilibrium carrier density is significantly lower than this threshold which is consistent with lateral conductivity measurements. d) Simulated stabilized current and current decay as a function of the mobile ion concentration (solid lines) and the doping concentration (dashed lines), respectively.

 For the pin-type Pb-based cells shown in the main text, 60 μL of PTAA (Poly-[bis-(4-phenyl)-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-amin]) solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 1.75 mg/mL in toluene) was spincoated at 6000 rpm for 30 seconds with a ramp of 2000 rpm/s After 10 min annealing on a hotplate at 100 °C, the films were cooled down to room temperature. The estimated thickness of the PTAA layer is 8 nm. Thereafter, 60 µL of PFN-Br (Poly(9,9-bis(3'-(N,Ndimethyl)-N-ethylammoinium-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene))dibromide) 
 ) 3 . 3 These 2 triple cation perovskites are respectively named 60/40 and 83/17 in the manuscript. The MAPI solution was prepared by dissolution of MAI powder (Dysol 1.3 M) with PbI 2 (TCI, 1.3 M) in a γ-butyrolactone/dimethyl sulfoxide mixed solvent (7:3 by volume), while stirring at 60 °C for 10 min. 
 Perovskite solutions: 1 . 5 M 15 nominal PbI2 and PbBr2 stock solutions were prepared in DMF:DMSO = 4:1 volume and shaken overnight at 60 °C. PbI2 was added to FAI solution with 9 % PbI2 excess and PbB2 was added to MABr with 9 % PbBr2 excess. The resulting FAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 solutions were then mixed in 85:15 volume ratio. Finally, 5 vol-% of 1.5 M nominal CsI in DMSO was added to the perovskite precursor. The CsI stock solution was prepared one day before mixing.

The current transients and obtained charge carrier density from bias-assisted charge collection measurements in the dark, upon a switch from different prebiases around the Voc to 0 V. The contribution of the capacitative charge to the total extracted charge can be obtained by doing a reference measurement from 0 V to minus Voc. Subtracting the capacitive charge carrier density from the measured charge carrier density yields this the injected charge carrier density at the different prebiases as indicated on the top. 
 Figure S12 . S12 Figure S12. PCE as a function of scan speed for an '83/17' Pb-based perovskite solar cell. The JV scans were taken at different scans speeds, while the cell was left on the light in between the different scans. The total time to measure the scan rate dependent JV-curves takes about 15 minutes. In order to check whether light soaking effects could account for the current losses observed, the measurements were performed twice -once starting with the slowest scan speeds and scanning progressively faster, and once starting with the fastest scan speeds and scanning progressively slower. Similar current losses were observed in both scan directions, hence ruling out light soaking is the underlying cause for the observed changes in PCE.

 MABr and PbBr 2 in DMF:DMSO (4:1 volume ratio) which contains a 10 %-molar excess of PbBr 2 . The solutions were stirred overnight at room temperature. By mixing these FAPbI 3 and MAPbBr 3 solutions in a ratio of 60:40 or 83:17 respectively, we get what we call ""MAFA"" solutions. Lastly, 42 of a 1.5 M CsI solution in DMSO was mixed with 958 L of each one of the MAFA solutions resulting in nominal triple cation perovskite stoichiometries of Cs 0.05 (FA 0.60 MA 0.40 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.60 Br 0.40 ) 3 and Cs 0.05 (FA 0.83 MA 0.17 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 were stored and weighed in a N 2 -filled glovebox, to prevent contamination of the solution with O 2 or H 2 O. The solution was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature. Finally, the solution was filtered using a 0.45 μm PTFE filter. The solutions for the lead-based perovskites layers were prepared as follows: 1.2 M FAPbI 3 2 M mixed-metal lead-tin perovskite solutions were prepared by dissolving FAI, CsI, SnI 2 and PbI 2 , together with, relative to their respective metals, 6 molar % Pb(SCN) 2 and 10 molar & SnF 2 in a 4:1 DMF:DMSO mixture. We note that all precursors used for this solution solution was prepared by dissolving FAI and PbI 2 in DMF:DMSO (4:1 volume ratio) which contains a 10%-molar excess of PbI 2 .

Supplementary Note 1: Further discussion on the heterointerface energy band diagrams In Extended Data Fig.  3 , the perovskite bulk work function should also be affected by ΔEvac. This is because the less negative ΔEvac by replacing OAI treatment with OATsO treatment resultantly delocalizes the accumulated electrons in the potential well, which enhances the electron density and thus electron quasi-fermi level (𝐸 𝑓𝑛 ) work function of the perovskite bulk. Moreover, the change in bulk work function by surface treatment would also affect the band alignment and thus charge accumulation at the perovskite/SnO2 heterointerface. Indeed, a slightly increased hole accumulation was observed for the OATsO-treated device (Fig.  1h, i ). However, although the hole quasi-fermi level (𝐸 𝑓𝑝 ) for the OATsO-treated device slightly up-shifted, its increase is not as significant as 𝐸 𝑓𝑛 . The overall effect on the quasi-fermi level splitting is consistent with the slight VOC enhancement by replacing OAI treatment with OATsO treatment (Extended Data Fig.  5 ). 
 Supplementary Note 2: Derivation of the charge density distribution from KPFM The electric field distribution across the device cross section, E(𝑧), was calculated from the contact potential difference, V(𝑧), according to the equation: 1 𝐸(𝑧) = - 𝑑 𝑑𝑧 [𝑉(𝑧) - Φ tip (𝑧) 𝑒 ] = - 𝑑 𝑑𝑧 𝑉(𝑧) where Φ tip (𝑧) is the work function of the probe and 𝑒 is the elementary charge. Φ tip (𝑧) 𝑒 is constant. The charge density distribution in a device, ∆𝜌(𝑧), is then given by: 1 ∆𝜌(𝑧) = 𝜖 0 𝜖 𝑟 𝑑 𝑑𝑧 𝐸(𝑧) where 𝜖 0 and 𝜖 𝑟 are the vacuum and relative permittivity, respectively. In accordance with the previous report,  1  the data were smoothened with the Savitzky-Golay processing by a second order polynomial regression and the same ratio of data points. 
 Supplementary Note 3: Further discussion on the low-dimensional phase formation Surface-sensitive GIXRD (ω = 0.2°, penetration depth <60 nm) revealed that only OAI and OABr treatments form 2D perovskites. OABF4, OATFA, and OATsO all did not form 2D perovskites (Supplementary Fig.  8 ), likely due to steric hindrance and the inability of asymmetrical counter-anions to be shaped into the ordered PbX6 4-octahedrons. We note that the observed negative ΔEvac and consequent charge obstruction/accumulation is separate and likely unrelated from 2D formation: (1)   OABF4 and OATFA do not form 2D perovskites, but their ΔEvac is still negative; (2) 2D perovskites are known to have low conductivity. Fundamentally, the low conductivity is because of the large organic cation (e.g. insulating alkyl group of alkylammonium), not the iodide or bromide anion. In this work, the organic cation is fixed as octylammonium; Based on Fig.  2e  and Extended Data Fig.  5 , we observed that the varying performance of the surfacepassivated devices is mainly contributed by their differing FFs. A reduced FF is indicative of less efficient charge extraction. We postulate that this is related to ΔEvac as follows: Firstly, the negative ΔEvac deepened the valence band offset (Supplementary Table  1 ) to worsen the energy level mismatch with spiro-MeOTAD (HOMO level: -5.2 eV). This sacrifices FF by reducing hole extraction into spiro-MeOTAD, which is observed as an increased charge extraction lifetime from the PL results (Fig.  2c, 2d ). Similar phenomenon has been observed in published works that studied the charge extraction time after surface treatment by conventional alkylammonium salts paired with iodide or bromide as the counteranion.  2, 3  Secondly, the negative ΔEvac created the heterointerface energy barrier seen from the KPFM device profiling, which also contributed to impede charge extraction to reduce FF.  1, 4, 5  ΔEvac progressively became less negative going from OAI treatment (-0.37 eV), to OABF4 treatment (-0.22 eV), and to OATsO treatment (+0.07 eV). This minimizes the inefficient charge extraction trade-off, therefore maximizing the FF and PCE gains enabled by surface treatment. Consequently, the OATsO-treated devices have the best performance. On the other hand, we observed that the VOC of the surface-passivated devices, while still different, are relatively less affected by a negative ΔEvac and inefficient charge extraction. Contrary to popular belief, from the perspective of the fundamental physics of solar cell operation, series resistance is actually not directly correlated with VOC.  6, 7  Fundamentally, this is because at V=VOC, the current flow across a solar cell, in other words the current flow through the series resistance, is exactly equal to zero (I=0).  7  Published perovskite literature have also reported that the device FF can be more sensitive than VOC to inefficient charge extraction and potential energy barriers,  4, 5  which supports our device results. Finally, we further validated the generality of our observations and universality of our proposed strategy by applying it to a different, pure FAPbI3 composition with DMSO replaced with NMP (fabrication details included in Methods). The results are presented in Extended Data Fig.  8  and Supplementary Table  3 . 
 Supplementary Note 5: Contrasting the device degradation under MPP aging versus OC aging In general, we observed that all devices were less stable under OC stability test, compared to their corresponding degradation rate under MPP stability test. This is consistent with previous reports that studied PSC degradation behavior under different aging conditions.  8  That previous study showed that PSC degradation rate increases in the trend MPP aging < short-circuit aging < OC aging (i.e. PSCs have the worst stability under OC aging). Therefore, the OC stability test can be used to represent a conservative estimate of the PSC lifetime under maximum accelerated degradation, although we note that MPP aging is more truly reflective of real working PSCs. Relatedly, a rapid ""burn-in"" decay stage is often observed during the first ~100 h of aging during PSC photostability tests.  [8] [9] [10] [11]  Importantly, the ""burn-in"" decay has been shown to be more severe for OC aging, and less severe for MPP aging.  8  This is also consistent with our own observations (Fig.  2f ). Although the ""burn-in"" decay is less noticeable under MPP stability tests, it nevertheless still exists, where the devices decayed at a more rapid rate in the first 100 h compared to the following ~400 h (Fig.  2f , Supplementary Table  4 ). Specifically, the OABF4-treated device performance decreased by -0.029 %/h in the first 100 h, compared to -0.014 %/h in the next 400 h. The OAI-treated device performance decreased by -0.064 %/h in the first 100 h, compared to -0.022 %/h for the next 400 h. Remarkably, the OATsO-treated devices displayed no obvious ""burn-in"" decay in both MPP aging and OC aging. General n-i-p devices are notoriously plagued by crippling initial ""burn-in"" decays,  8, 12  so this improvement was already noteworthy. Ligand-induced work function changes, ∆W, is given by the relation:  [13] [14] [15]   ∆W = 𝑒 𝜀 0 𝐴 Δ𝜇 = 𝑒 𝜀 0 𝐴 (𝜇 𝑑𝑖𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑒 + 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 ) where 𝑒 is the elementary charge, 𝜀 0 is the vacuum permittivity, A is the surface area, and Δ𝜇 = 𝜇 𝑑𝑖𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑒 + 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 . 𝜇 𝑑𝑖𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑒 and 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 are two independent contributions,  [13] [14] [15]  where respectively, 𝜇 𝑑𝑖𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑒 is the ligand intrinsic dipole moment normal to the surface, while 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 is related to a charge density displacement by interaction and bond formation of the ligand during chemisorption to the surface. The former is intensively reported in the perovskite community,  16  while the latter has been relatively less explored. 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 is the primary mechanism by which low polarity (or non-polar) species cause a ∆W. We first computed the respective dipole moments of various species in this work (Supplementary Fig.  15, 16 ). The negative ∆W (i.e. more n-type) with increasing alkylammonium chain length is correlated with their successively increasing positive dipole moments. On the other hand, while both [I] -and [Br] - are non-polar, the experimentally measured ∆W for the films treated with OAI or OABr were different (Fig.  1b ), hinting of a contribution from 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 . Additionally, the dipole moment of [TsO] -has an opposite sign but only half that of [OA] + , and thus the net dipole remains positive, which should have resulted in a negative ∆W, and thus cannot fully explain the experimental observations. Therefore, the contribution of 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 must be taken into consideration. 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 is related to the charge density differential, ∆𝜌, as a function of position (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧) by: 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 ≈ -𝑒 ∭ 𝑧∆𝜌 𝑑𝑥 𝑑𝑦 𝑑𝑧 The averaged charge density displacement as a function of 𝑧, ∆𝜌̅ (𝑧), and charge displacement, ∆𝑞(𝑧), in terms of ∆𝜌̅ (𝑧), is given by: ∆𝜌̅ (𝑧) = 1 𝐴 ∬ ∆𝜌 𝑑𝑥 𝑑𝑦 ∆𝑞(𝑧) = 𝐴∆𝜌̅ (𝑧)∆𝑧 where ∆𝜌 is calculated from: ∆𝜌 = 𝜌 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥 -𝜌 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 -𝜌 𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑎𝑛𝑑 Here, 𝜌 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥 , 𝜌 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 and 𝜌 𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑎𝑛𝑑 are the charge densities of the surface-ligand complex, freestanding surface, and free ligand, respectively. Subsequently, the charge displacement, 𝑞 ̅ , near the surface positioned at 𝑧 𝑠 is then calculated by: 𝑞 ̅ = 1 ∆𝑧 ∫ Δ𝑞(𝑧)𝑑𝑧 𝑧 𝑠 +Δz/2 𝑧 𝑠 -Δ𝑧/2 We computed the ∆𝑞(𝑧) with the different ligands to explore the 𝜇 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 contribution (Fig.  4c-e ). Strikingly, [TsO] -induces a pronounced negative surface charge displacement, 𝑞 ̅, of -0.022 e, threefold larger in magnitude than the positive 𝑞 ̅ of [OA] + of +0.006 e. Calculations with varying ligand surface density corroborate the trends (Supplementary Fig.  18 ). We did further calculations by introducing iodine vacancy (VI) or lead-iodine antisite (PbI) defects to the surfaces of the slab models. Both defects have been reported to form readily on the perovskite surface.  17, 18  We present our results in Supplementary Fig.  17  and Supplementary       OA + BF 4 - V OC (V) J SC (mA cm -2 ) FF (%) PCE (%) V OC (V) J SC (mA cm -2 ) FF (%) PCE (%) V OC (V) J SC (mA cm -2 ) FF (%) PCE (%) 
 Supplementary Figure 13. XRD analyses of the aged devices. XRD diffraction patterns measured with an ω-2θ setup of the aged a, OAI-treated and b, OATsO-treated devices. These were the same devices used for the STEM analyses, and were recovered after FIB milling. X-rays from the ω-2θ diffraction setup were able to penetrate through the top electrode and spiro-MeOTAD layers to probe the active layer itself. Concurrently, given the large penetration depth of ω-2θ XRD (>700 nm), it is not sensitive to the ultrathin 2D interlayer, which is only detectable by the GIXRD measurements.   Optoelectronic devices consist of heterointerfaces formed between dissimilar semiconducting materials. The relative energy-level alignment between contacting semiconductors determinately affects the heterointerface charge injection and extraction dynamics. For perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the heterointerface between the top perovskite surface and a charge-transporting material is often treated for defect passivation  [1] [2] [3] [4]  to improve the PSC stability and performance. However, such surface treatments can also affect the heterointerface energetics  1  . Here we show that surface treatments may induce a negative work function shift (that is, more n-type), which activates halide migration to aggravate PSC instability. Therefore, despite the beneficial effects of surface passivation, this detrimental side effect limits the maximum stability improvement attainable for PSCs treated in this way. This trade-off between the beneficial and detrimental effects should guide further work on improving PSC stability via surface treatments. Progress in compositional and crystal-growth engineering has made possible the fabrication of halide perovskite thin films with minimized bulk trap density, such that defects are predominantly located at the surface  5, 6  . This has motivated the development of defect passivation treatments applied onto the top perovskite surface  [1] [2] [3] [4]  . However, such treatments can also change the heterointerface energetics and thus the charge-carrier dynamics between the perovskite and the top charge-transporting material  1  . Here we study the consequences of the altered heterointerface energetics on carrier extraction, trap passivation, charge accumulation and ion migration. We show that a negative work function change (ΔW) accumulates charges in a potential well, which lowers the halide migration activation energy to limit the perovskite solar cell (PSC) stability. A negative ΔW is equivalently described as a negative vacuum-level change (ΔE vac ) at a heterointerface, and hereafter, ΔW and ΔE vac are used interchangeably. 
 Perovskite surface and heterointerface dynamics The genesis of this study began with our investigations on the surface energetics of perovskite films, based on a (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 composition (where FA is formamidinium and MA is methylammonium). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements showed that ubiquitously used ammonium-iodide-based surface treatments generally result in a negative ΔW (Fig.  1a , Supplementary Fig.  1  and Supplementary Table  1 ), which successively increases in magnitude with longer alkylammonium chain length. Given that a negative ΔW is associated with a relatively more electron-enriched surface, we speculated initially that the negative ΔW can be modulated by increasing the electron-withdrawing ability of the counteranion. Further UPS measurements (Fig.  1b ) showed that substitution of iodide [I] -with bromide [Br] -, tetrafluoroborate [BF 4 ] -or trifluoroacetate [TFA] -progressively negated the negative ΔW of octylammonium iodide (OAI) treatment towards that of the reference film, but only substitution with tosylate [TsO] -fully neutralized the negative ΔW. In particular, among the counteranions, [TsO] -has the strongest electron-withdrawing character  7  , which also justifies its ubiquitous use as the leaving group in synthetic heterolytic fission chemistry. The interaction of [TsO] -with the surface was further verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements were performed to verify the work function distributions (Fig.  1c-f ). The mean work function of the OAI-treated film decreased to 4.49 ± 0.09 eV, from 4.67 ± 0.08 eV for the reference film, and in contrast to the 4.77 ± 0.11 eV for the OATsO-treated film. From the topographical atomic force microscopy (AFM) maps, the surface morphology and root-mean-square roughness of the treated films were negligibly different (Fig.  1g ), which was expected given the dilute (but common) solution concentration used for surface treatment. (SEM) images also suggested that the surface uniformity is relatively similar for the treated films (Extended Data Figs.  1, 2 ). 
 Consequences for charge-carrier dynamics Band alignments constructed from the UPS results predict that a negative ΔE vac may create a potential well to trap charges at the heterointerface (Extended Data Fig.  3  and Supplementary Note 1). Cross-sectional KPFM measurements under illumination in the open-circuit (OC) condition were followed to investigate the real-time charge-carrier distributions in complete devices of planar-architecture indium tin oxide (ITO)/ tin oxide (SnO 2 )/perovskite/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl) amino]-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD)/gold (Au) (Extended Data Fig.  4 , Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Figs.  3, 4 ). The measured device ΔE vac values at the perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD heterointerface are consistent with those obtained from the films (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). Charge carriers are unextractable in the OC condition (split quasi Fermi level), and might accumulate at a contacting selective heterointerface of the opposite polarity  8, 9  . This is observed as an accumulation of holes for both devices at the perovskite/SnO 2 heterointerface (Fig.  1h, i ). In contrast, a pronounced electron accumulation exists at the perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD heterointerface for only the OAI-treated device. The electron accumulation is noted to be significantly more severe than the counterpart hole accumulation. In principle, the ideal photovoltaic device would have a homogeneous electric-field distribution with no charge accumulation across its heterojunctions  10  , which is seen for the OATsO-treated device at its perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD heterointerface. Both devices were relatively field-free (that is, flat potential) along the active layer, indicative of a high-quality perovskite bulk, suggesting that the different behaviours were a consequence of the surface treatments. The results are consistent with those predicted based on the band diagrams (Extended Data Fig.  3 ), where the non-negative ΔE vac of the OATsO-treated device avoided the potential well and charge accumulation.  
 Article Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy indicated an effective suppression of charge-trapping defect states in the surface-treated films, as evidenced by their enhanced PL intensities and carrier lifetimes with a glass/ perovskite architecture (Fig.  2a, b ). The defect passivation efficacies of the surface-treated films are noted to be relatively comparable. Comparing their PL intensity distributions indicates again that the surface uniformity is similar between the films (Supplementary Fig.  6 ). Despite the beneficial passivation effects, charge extraction into spiro-MeOTAD is sacrificially impeded in all surface-treated films (Fig.  2c, d  and Supplementary Table  2 ), but to different extents, with the trend correlated with the magnitude of ΔE vac . Compared with the reference/spiro-MeOTAD film, the average carrier lifetime (τ ave ) more than doubled to 8.1 ns (from 3.0 ns) for the OAI-treated film and the steady-state PL intensity was 223% higher. In contrast, OATsO treatment simultaneously suppressed the trap states whereas charge extraction was barely impeded, avoiding the trade-off seen for the OABF 4 and the OAI treatments. Further phototransient measurements on complete devices complement the film PL results (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). We postulate that the charge obstruction and accumulation cannot be explained by the surface two-dimensional phase, as the insulating large organic cation (OA + ) is kept unchanged (Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig.  8 ). 
 Device performance and hysteresis behaviour For the surface-treated devices, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) shows the trend OATsO-treated devices > OABF 4 -treated devices > OAI-treated devices, owing primarily to an increasing fill factor (FF) (Fig.  2e  and Extended Data Fig.  5 ). The device open-circuit voltages (V OC ) are marginally different, reflective of the comparable PL results of the glass/perovskite films. The best OATsO-treated device reached a PCE of 24.41% (Extended Data Fig.  6 ). We further verified the performance of encapsulated devices at an independent third-party laboratory, noting that the performance slightly decreased after the encapsulation procedure (Extended Data Fig.  7 ). Contrasting the surface-treated devices, the PCE trend can be explained as follows (further discussion in Supplementary Note 4). First, a more negative ΔE vac deepened the valence band offset with spiro-MeOTAD, which increased the hole extraction resistance to sacrifice the FF. In addition, the heterointerface barrier observed from the KPFM profiling may also contribute to impede charge extraction  9, 11  . Regardless, a negative ΔE vac remains the cause that gave rise to both effects. Separate investigations of a FAPbI 3 composition further verified our observations (Extended Data Fig.  8  and Supplementary Table  3 ).   Comparing the surface-treated devices, the hysteresis behaviour generally improved as the negative ΔE vac decreased in magnitude (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). This provided the first hint at a correlation between ΔE vac and ion migration, given that ion migration is responsible for PSC hysteresis  12, 13  . In contrast, the reference devices showed the lowest performance and worst hysteresis, owing to the abundant, unpassivated heterointerface traps. Overall, the device performance results provide evidence for the sacrificial trade-off of a negative ΔE vac to limit PSC performance. 
 Device stability under continuous illumination We assessed the photostability of encapsulated devices under continuous illumination without an ultraviolet filter. All devices were aged in an ambient atmosphere at about 40 °C. We preserved the original device architecture with spiro-MeOTAD as the hole-transporting material, without applying further modifications (for example, copper phthalocyanine (CuPC) or poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) were not used). Under maximum power point (MPP) testing (Fig.  2f ), the OATsO-treated device sustained its performance with negligible degradation after about 800 h. The OABF 4 -treated device was also relatively stable, retaining 91.5% of its performance after about 500 h. Among the surface-treated devices, the OAI-treated device degraded the most rapidly to 84.8% of its performance after about 500 h. Contrasting the device degradation under MPP testing versus OC condition testing, all devices were generally less stable under OC condition testing (Fig.  2g , Extended Data Fig.  9  and Supplementary Note 5). However, the device degradation trends are identical, and correlated with the magnitude of ΔE vac . In particular, the OABF 4 -treated devices with an intermediate negative ΔE vac showed stability between that of the OAI-treated and the OATsO-treated devices. Near the approximate halfway point of 1,014 h, the devices retained 94.3% (OATsO treated), 86.2% (OABF 4 treated) and 74.8% (OAI treated) of their average PCEs. Ending after 2,092 h, the OATsO-treated devices retained 87.0% of their initial PCE on average. In contrast, the average PCE (65.1% of initial) of the OAI-treated devices decreased dramatically over the 2,092-h aging duration. The most stable OATsO-treated device (Fig.  2h ) retained 94.9% and 88.5% of its initial PCE after 1,014 h and 2,092 h, respectively. Analysing the degradation trends, we postulated that the potential well and charge accumulation may have accelerated ion migration, considering that the KPFM profiling was also performed under illumination in the OC condition. In particular, the more rapid 'burn-in' decay of the OAI-treated and the OABF 4 -treated devices, observed in both the MPP (Supplementary Table  4 ) and the OC tests, strongly hints that ion migration has been aggravated by a negative ΔE vac , given that transient ion migration underlies the 'burn-in' regime  12, 14, 15  . The altered ion migration energetics was also hinted by the device hysteresis behaviour. Moreover, the two-dimensional interlayer of the conventional OAI treatment probably contributed to impeding ion migration  16  , yet the OABF 4 -treated and the OATsO-treated devices still had superior photostability, indicating that the ion migration energetics have been dominantly affected. 
 Analyses of the degraded devices To directly investigate the extent of ion migration, on completion of the OC stability testing, the original OAI-treated and OATsO-treated devices (after 2,092 h illumination) were sent for scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analysis. The encapsulation cover glasses were detached immediately before focused ion beam (FIB) milling to extract sample cross-sections. STEM bright-field images of the planar device stacks revealed that the micrometre-scale grain sizes were still visibly intact even after the extended aging (Fig.  3a, b  and Supplementary Fig.  10 ). The first notable difference between the two samples can be seen at the perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD heterointerface. The OAI-treated device had a rougher heterointerface morphology, which is in contrast to the negligibly different topography for the fresh films observed by AFM and SEM. This suggests that the roughening is inherent to the ageing process, possibly associated with heterointerface degradation by ion-migration-induced compositional loss. The elemental distributions were compared by X-ray energy-dispersive (EDX) mapping in STEM (Fig.  3c -f and Supplementary Fig.  11 ). On close inspection, large accumulations of both bromine (green arrows) and iodine (yellow arrows) can be seen for the OAI-treated device along the top Au/platinum (Pt) region. This is verified by quantitative analysis of the elemental distributions (Fig.  3g-j ). In consideration of the nominal stoichiometry of the perovskite, both bromine and iodine accumulation were approximately similar in order magnitude (Supplementary Fig.  12 ). We note that despite progress to completely remove the need for bromine in FAPbI 3 -based compositions  17, 18  , it has been shown that bromine might remain necessary to stabilize the α-FAPbI 3 phase in state-of-the-art devices  19  . The bulk devices that underwent FIB milling were further recovered and characterized by Bragg-Brentano XRD (Supplementary Fig.  13 ). The δ-FAPbI 3 peak supposedly at about 11.8° was not detected for both devices, and the α-FAPbI 3 phase remained dominant, ruling out possible aggravation of the perovskite phase metastability by iodine interstitial generation  20  . 
 Aggravated ion migration and device instability We further simulated the ion migration pathways using the first-principles nudged-elastic-band methodology (Supplementary Note 6)  12  . To model the charge accumulation at the perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD heterointerface, we calculated the activation energy for halide migration in either a neutral uncharged or a negatively charged environment. Two independent pathways were explored: migration within a unit cell of a supercell (intra-lattice) and migration escaping a supercell (extra-lattice) (Extended Data Fig.  10  and Supplementary Table  5 ). The intra-lattice migration (vacancy mediated) investigates possible Coulombic screening effects by a charged environment to alter the bonding affinities and thus migration energetics  21, 22  , whereas the extra-lattice migration is defect independent. For intra-lattice migration (Fig.  4a ), the energy barriers for both iodine (-38.7%) and bromine (-29.4%) decreased substantially in the negatively charged environment. Similarly observed for the extra-lattice scenario (Fig.  4b ), the activation energy for iodine migration (-13.3%) and bromine migration (-17.8%) were both lower in the charged environment. Per the Arrhenius relationship, the rate constant has exponential dependence on the activation energy barrier. Ion penetration can result in irreversible chemical reactions with spiro-MeOTAD to degrade its hole-transporting functionality  23  , and also chemical corrosion of the top electrode layer  24  , which potentially contributed to the V OC and FF decays of the devices. The robust encapsulation procedure ruled out environmental degradation factors, indicating that intrinsic mechanisms (that is, ion migration) were responsible, and also excluded trapped charges catalysing extrinsic degradation pathways by moisture and oxygen  25  . This is evidenced by the short-circuit current retention for the devices, demonstrating the excellent phase stability of the active layers. By excluding ion migration, half-device tests further indicate that the photostability of the surface-treated films are negligibly different (Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary Fig.  14 ). Tying together all results, we propose that the potential well and charge accumulation created by a negative ΔE vac aggravated device instability, by detrimentally accelerating halide migration at the spiro-MeOTAD/perovskite heterointerface. More generally, the beneficial improvements of surface treatments are sacrificially limited by a negative ΔE vac , but modulating the counteranion presents a simple method to further improve PSC stability and performance. Backtracking, we also preliminarily explored the possible mechanistic origins of ΔE vac using first principles (full discussion in Supplementary Note 8), summarized as follows. Ligand-induced ΔW originates from two independent contributions  26, 27  : the ligand intrinsic dipole moment (μ dipole ), and a charge-density displacement by ligand-surface interactions and bond formation (μ charge ). The dipole moments of [OA] + and [TsO] -were +20.3 D and -10.5 D, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 15, 16). On the other hand, [TsO] -induces a striking negative surface charge displacement, q, of -0.022e, which is threefold larger in magnitude than the positive q of [OA] + (+0.006e) (Fig.  4c -e and Sup- plementary Table  6 ) . The negative q sign of [TsO] -indicates a depletion of electrons from the surface, and is equivalent to a positive ΔW. This trend is reproducible even with defect states on the surface, or different surface concentrations and species (Supplementary Figs. 17, 18 and Supplementary Table  7 ). Therefore, we speculate that simultaneous contributions from both μ charge and μ dipole for [TsO] -synergistically counterbalanced [OA] + , to result in a net positive ΔE vac for the OATsO treatment. More broadly, this proposes design principles for the ideal perovskite/charge-transporting material heterointerface. We preliminarily tested pairing [TsO] -with alkylammoniums with different chain lengths, but OATsO treatment yielded the best performance (Supplementary Fig.  19  and Supplementary Note 9).

 Methods 
 Perovskite film fabrication All materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise stated. For the (FAPbI 3 ) 0.95 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.05 composition, 889 mg ml -1 FAPbI 3 (FAI, GreatCell Solar; PbI 2 , TCI America), 33 mg ml -1 MAPbBr 3 (MABr, 1-Material; PbBr 2 , Alfa Aesar Chemicals) and 33 mg ml -1 MACl (GreatCell Solar) were dissolved in a dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)/ dimethylformamide (DMF) mixed solvent (1:8 v/v). The films were deposited at 4,000 rpm for 20 s. After 10 s, 0.2 ml diethyl ether was dropped on the film. The film was then annealed for 10 min at 150 °C. For the FAPbI 3 composition, 1,266 mg FAPbI 3 and 34 mg MACl were dissolved in 192.8 μl N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and 1 ml DMF. The films were deposited at 4,000 rpm for 20 s. After 10 s, 0.2 ml diethyl ether was dropped on the film. The film was then annealed for 5 min at 100 °C, and subsequently 10 min at 150 °C. Subsequently, for post-fabrication surface treatment, 10 mM of the respective ammonium salts were dissolved in isopropyl alcohol, followed by deposition at 5,000 rpm for 30 s. Only OABr was dissolved in chloroform. All treatments, except with phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI), were annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. No annealing was done for PEAI. The reference films without post-treatment were washed with pure isopropyl alcohol at 5,000 rpm, followed by 100 °C annealing for 5 min. 
 Device fabrication Substrates of ITO on glass were cleaned by successive ultrasonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, for 20 min each. Cleaned substrates were treated by ultraviolet ozone for 20 min. For the electron-transporting material, SnO 2 colloidal solution (Alfa Aesar Chemicals) was diluted in water in a 1:5 ratio. The solution was spun at 3,000 rpm for 30 s, and the film was subsequently annealed for 35 min at 165 °C. Ten-millimolar potassium hydroxide or potassium chloride in water was spun at 3,000 rpm for 30 s, and subsequently annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. We note that potassium chloride treatment was slightly improved over potassium hydroxide. The perovskite film fabrication and post-treatment procedures were performed as described above. Subsequently, 60.0 mg spiro-MeOTAD (p-OLED), 25.5 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine, 15.5 μl bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (520 mg ml -1 in acetonitrile) and 12.5 μl of FK209 (p-OLED; 375 mg ml -1 in acetonitrile) were dissolved in 0.7 ml chlorobenzene. The solution was spun at 3,000 rpm for 30 s. For the top electrode, 100-nm gold was thermally deposited at an evaporation rate of 0.5 A s -1 . The device active area is determined by a shadow mask to be 0.13 cm 2 . For the anti-reflection coating, 150-nm magnesium fluoride (MgF 2 ) was thermally deposited at an evaporation rate of 1 A s -1 . MgF 2 was deposited on all devices, unless otherwise stated. 
 AFM and KPFM To obtain the spatial variation of the work function for each perovskite sample, we performed KPFM, which is an AFM-based technique to acquire work function information of the sample surface via measuring the contact potential difference for every pixel. For cross-sectional KPFM, the devices were cleaved simply to expose their cross-sections. A map of contact potential difference, or the relative surface potential of a sample to that of a biased AFM tip, is simultaneously obtained with a topographic image of the sample surface. The work function of the AFM tip is calibrated before and after every measurement with highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, whose work function is well known to be 4.6 eV. The real work function value of each perovskite sample is calculated from the measured surface potential of each sample, with respect to the tip work function. The temperature and humidity near the AFM were recorded before every measurement. The AFM tips used for the KPFM measurement are Au-coated NSC36/ chromium-Au tips (MikroMasch) as the measurement of electric properties requires at least one conductive component. Also, each KPFM measurement involved the electrically grounded perovskite samples with conductive sample holders, through which the surface potential of any sample may have the same zero point. All AFM-based measurements were conducted with a commercial AFM NX-10 (Park Systems). 
 STEM and EDX The STEM images and EDX maps were taken using a JEOL 2800 S/TEM equipped with dual 100-mm 2 silicon drift detectors at 200 kV with a probe size of 1 nm. To perform the STEM analyses on the devices, the device cross-section was lifted out and mounted on a copper (Cu) grid using a Tescan GAIA3 SEM/FIB microscope. The sample was protected by a 2-μm-thick Pt layer to prevent gallium implantation during the milling procedure. The sample was successively polished, first using 30 kV and 600 pA, then subsequently at 15 kV and 150 pA, and finally at 3 kV and 90 pA, until reaching electron-transparent thickness. 
 First-principles density functional theory computation All bulk and slab first-principles calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) in the plane-wave/pseudopotential approach implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation (VASP) package  29  . A revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBEsol) was used for the exchange-correlation functional  30  . We included dispersion corrections to the total energy using Grimme's DFT-D3 scheme  31  . Projector-augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials were used to describe valence-core interactions  32  . Plane-wave expansions with kinetic energies up to 300 eV were chosen. Both ionic positions and supercell dimensions were allowed to relax using conjugate gradient algorithm until all residual forces were smaller than 0.02 eV-Å -1 . Bulk 4 × 4 × 4 and slab 4 × 4 × 1 Γ-centre k-point meshes were adopted for Brillouin-zone sampling. For bulk calculations, 2 × 2 × 2 supercells were used. For surface-energy calculations, the 2 × 2 × L surfaces(L is the number of perovskite layers in the slab) were formed along (001) by periodic slabs including 9 to 11 atomic layers for a surface separated by 10-15 Å of vacuum. For the electrostatic potential maps, all structures were pre-optimized with the very tight GFN2-xTB method using the xTB program (version 6.2)  33, 34  before conformational search. Conformational analysis of each structure was performed in water using metadynamic sampling in the extended tight binding Conformer-Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool (xtb CREST) program package (version 6.2)  35  . The iMTD-GC workflow was used for the conformational search algorithm with 6 kcal mol -1 energy and 0.5-Å root mean square deviation thresholds at 298.15 K. All further DFT calculations of the lowest conformers were performed using Gaussian16. Geometry optimization and frequency calculations were completed at the ωB97X-D/6-311++G(d,p) level in the gas phase. Optimized structures were verified by frequency calculations as minima (zero imaginary frequencies). Electrostatic potential charges and maps were computed with the B3LYP method, the GD3BJ 36 empirical dispersion and the LANL2DZ basis set for iodide, and the aug-cc-pvtz basis set for all other atoms based on the Hirshfeld population analysis  37  . Dipoles were calculated with the ωB97X-D/6-31+G(d) method and basis set. Electrostatic potential maps were generated using GaussView 6.0.16. 
 Preparation of ammonium salts p-Toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate was first dehydrated to remove the water of crystallization. Using 100 ml toluene dissolves 1 g p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate in a 250-ml two-neck round-bottom flask. Vacuum distillation of toluene (about 20 mm Hg is a sufficient vacuum to lower the boiling point of toluene to a reasonable value) was followed to obtain solid p-toluenesulfonic acid using a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 1 week. For the anion substitution of alkylammonium salts, alkylamine (for example, octylamine) was added stoichiometrically to the acid (for example, p-toluenesulfonic acid) in an isopropyl alcohol mixed solvent, followed by stirring at 50 °C overnight. The chemical structure and purity of the salt was further verified by  1  H NMR (Supplementary Note 10, Supplementary Fig.  20 ). Typically, a concentrated stock solution (>500 mM) is first prepared, followed by solution dilution to reach the final 10-mM concentration. Trifluoroacetic acid (>99.5%) was obtained from EMD Millipore. Octylammonium iodide and octylammonium bromide were purchased commercially from GreatCell Solar. 
 Device encapsulation and stability testing Device encapsulation was carried out inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox (<0.6 ppm of O 2 /H 2 O) by using an ultraviolet-curable adhesive (Nagase America) applied to a custom-designed cover glass (AMG Korea). The glovebox was completely absent of any chemical solvents to ensure a pristine atmosphere. The devices were kept in the glovebox for at least 2 h before and after encapsulation. The cover glass was superimposed on the active layer and fixed in position with the adhesive. This was then exposed to ultraviolet illumination for 2 min to cure the adhesive and seal the cover glass to the device. Care was taken to block the device active-layer area from the ultraviolet illumination by superimposing black electrical tape on the cover glass area that corresponded to the device active-layer area. We note that in our experience, it was important to pay attention to the expiry date of the ultraviolet-curable adhesive, with fresh adhesives preferred. For the MPP stability testing, encapsulated devices were exposed to continuous illumination by a simulated air mass 1.5G spectrum illumination from a solar simulator. The devices were biased with a voltage corresponding to their MPP. The aging atmosphere was open ambient air (relative humidity (RH) 40 ± 10%). For the OC stability testing, encapsulated devices were exposed to continuous illumination by a metal halogen lamp source (90 ± 10 mW cm -2 ). The devices were placed in an in-house-built aging chamber under the OC condition. The chamber atmosphere was open ambient air (RH 40 ± 10 %). Periodically, the devices were transferred to a simulated AM 1.5G spectrum illumination from a solar simulator, also in ambient air (RH 40 ± 10 %), to measure their performance. The devices were immediately returned to the aging chamber upon measurement completion. 
 Material and device characterization SEM was carried out using an FEI Nova NanoLab 600 DualBeam (FIB/ SEM) instrument in secondary electron mode. The films were coated with an approximately 1-nm-thick Au layer by sputtering to prevent charging during the measurement. XPS measurements were carried out on an XPS AXIS Ultra DLD (Kratos Analytical). An Al Kα (1,486.6 eV) X-ray was used as the excitation source. UPS measurements were carried out using a helium discharge lamp, emitting ultraviolet energy at 21.2 eV. All UPS measurements were performed using standard procedures with a -9-V bias applied between the samples and the detectors. PL spectroscopy was performed with a Horiba Jobin Yvon system, with a 532-nm xenon lamp or a 640-nm monochromatic laser excitation source. Time-resolved PL spectra were measured using a Picoharp 300 with time-correlated single-photon counting capabilities (PLD 800B, PicoQuant) with a repetition frequency of 100 kHz. The confocal PL maps were measured using a Leica Confocal SP8-STED/ FLIM/FCS confocal laser scanning microscope, using an HC PL APO oil objective (40×/1.40) and a 514-nm argon pulsed diode laser. XRD was performed by an X-ray PANalytical diffractometer at a scan rate of 4° min -1 with a Cu Kα radiation source. The simulated AM 1.5G 1-sun spectrum illumination (100 mW cm -2 ) was from an Oriel Sol3A class AAA solar simulator (Newport). The light intensity was first calibrated with an National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)-certified silicon photodiode with a KG-5 filter. A Keithley 2401 source meter was used to perform the current density-voltage device measurements. A 0.100-cm 2 -sized metal aperture was used to precisely define the device active area during measurement. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured with a custom-designed Enlitech system under a.c. mode (frequency 133 Hz) without light bias with a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under a short-circuit condition. The phototransient measurements were done with a pulsed red dye laser (Rhodamine 6G, 590 nm) pumped by a nitrogen laser (LSI VSL-337ND-S) as the perturbation source. The pulse width was 4 ns at a repetition frequency of 10 Hz. The laser pulse intensity was monitored to maintain the amplitude of transient V OC below 5 mV. Then, the voltage under the OC condition and the current under the short-circuit condition were measured over a 1-MΩ resistor and a 50-Ω resistor, and recorded on a digital S4 oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO 4104B). The CPD offsets were adjusted such that the CPD value of the buffer layer becomes zero. Note that this does not affect the electric field and charge displacement profiles, which calculate the derivatives of the CPD profiles. Although we do not expect the rough morphology seen in c to affect the KPFM signal, we cannot completely rule this out at this stage. Therefore, we have repeated the KPFM measurement on another separate OAI-treated device. As shown in Supplementary Fig.  4 , we were able to reproduce the potential drop at the perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD heterointerface. ( 3 )Supplementary Note 4 : 34 Relatedly, halide orbitals contribute density of states to the perovskite band edge structure. Therefore, iodide or bromide actually participate in charge conduction; (4) It is actually possible for 2D perovskites to form a type II band alignment, which does not obstruct charge extraction. Therefore, 2D perovskite, by itself, cannot be used to explain the charge obstruction and accumulation observations; (5) Directly comparing OABF4 and OATsO allows us to exclude any possible effects of 2D formation.

 Impact of Electrode Materials on Process Environmental Stability of Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells We employ a mesoporous BaSnO 3 electron transport layer to satisfy both solar-cell performance and stability as an alternative to conventional Li-doped TiO 2 . Both BaSnO 3 and Li-doped TiO 2 show considerable power conversion efficiency exceeding 21% and 20%, respectively, under 10% relative humidity. However, in 40% relative humidity, PSCs using Li-doped TiO 2 are dramatically deteriorated within 24 h while PSCs with BaSnO 3 exhibit excellent processing stability.  
 INTRODUCTION Organometal-halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received considerable attention because of their low-cost fabrication process and remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE), recently exceeding 22%.  1  Most highly efficient PSCs utilize a bilayered device architecture of a mesoporous scaffold, which is infiltrated by a formamidinium (FA)-cation-based perovskite and an overlayer of the perovskite.  2  Mesoporous (mp) TiO 2 has been commonly used for high-surface-area electrodes, but it exhibits low electron mobility ($1 cm 2 V À1 s À1 ).  3, 4  Therefore, the use of substitutional dopants such as Li salt has been necessary for facilitating electron injection and transport in the mesoporous TiO 2 .  5, 6  A number of problems with PSCs should be resolved before expanding from a lab scale to actual mass production, including homogeneity over a large area and the throughput and yield of the process with quality and the stability of large-area devices. One further major issue is the processing stability of the perovskites, which are sensitive to atmospheric conditions with uncontrolled humidity. With respect to processing costs, it is not ideal to establish a 100% nitrogen environment or a dry air atmosphere with less than 10% relative humidity (RH) for a mass production line. On the other hand, humidity higher than 40%$50% should be avoided for the perfect conversion of the precursors into the perovskite film. Thus, high processing stability of all of the incorporated materials is essential for practical fabrication under a broad window of humidity (with an upper limit of 40%$50%). Efforts to address the aforementioned limitations include incorporating 2D perovskites into 3D perovskites or introducing an inorganic cation (such as Cs or Rb) into the perovskites.  [7] [8] [9] [10]  To protect the perovskite layer from the ingress of moisture, the perovskite film can be covered with a hydrophobic polymer layer.  11  For better stability, the use of hole transport materials (HTMs) without a hygroscopic dopant such as lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSi) has also been explored.  12  Finally, device stability against humidity has been obtained by applying encapsulation.  13  Nevertheless, all the layers of the device during the fabrication and aging process in a practical mass production line could be exposed to ambient humid air before encapsulation of the device. 
 Context & Scale For the aforementioned reasons, many researchers have conducted research to enhance the stability of the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL) against humidity.  14, 15  However, to date, little research has been performed on the humidity stability of the metal-oxide layer of the device. As explained, facile doping of Li salt into mesoporous TiO 2 could lead to improved electron conductance, but the stability issue has still not been addressed. Furthermore, high reactivity of the intercalated Li ions with any moisture may produce undesirable byproducts such as Li 2 O and LiOH, which can degrade device performance.  16, 17  Therefore, in finding an alternative to Li-doped mp-TiO 2 , the development of an electron transport layer (ETL) that exhibits better mobility and superior moisture stability in humid air is also critical for attaining processing stability during practical mass production. BaSnO 3 (BSO) is an n-type semiconductor that is induced by oxygen vacancies in the lattice with a wide band gap of 3.1 eV. It has high mobility because the conduction band (CB) minimum originating from the Sn 5s-O 2p orbital interaction gives rise to a large CB dispersion and thus a low effective mass. Recently, our group and Seok reported a highly efficient and stable planar PSC with a device configuration of a fluorine-doped SnO 2 (FTO)/thin layer of nanoparticle La-BaSnO 3 (NP-BSO)/MAPbI 3 / polytriarylamine polymer (PTAA)/Au.  18  This planar PSC based on a BSO-MAPbI 3 heterojunction showed excellent device performance of 21% and better photostability compared to that obtained with the use of a thin layer of its TiO 2 counterpart. However, thus far, there have been no reports on employing BSO nanoparticles in a mesoporous scaffold or in a heterojunction with FA-based mixed perovskites. In this work, we propose a strategy for improving the process stability by incorporating a BSO mesoporous layer into a state-of-the-art PSC architecture of a bilayered device, including FA-based mixed perovskites. From the resultant device, we achieved stabilized efficiency of 21.7% (reverse scan: 22%) with a certified efficiency of 21.3%, which is the highest efficiency among non-TiO 2 -based PSCs. The mp-BSObased device exhibited excellent processing stability during the fabrication and aging processes under a broad window of humidity in a range up to $40% RH. In contrast, the device using Li-doped mp-TiO 2 showed relatively poor stability under a similar humid atmosphere. Furthermore, the mp-BSO-based PSCs exhibited good long-term stability under dark and light illumination for 500 h. 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION BSO may be the best candidate as an ETL for commercializing PSCs because it has excellent conductivity with no additional process compared to its TiO 2 counterpart. But, a previous report shows the TiO 2 /BSO-based PSCs have a large hysteresis in current-voltage (J-V) curves.  18  Surprisingly, during the optimization process, we found that the introduction of SnO 2 nanoparticle layer onto the spray-deposited TiO 2 reduces the hysteresis in J-V curves (Figure  S1 ). For this reason, we employed a TiO 2 /SnO 2 bilayer as a blocking layer for mp-BSO-based PSCs. To maximize the device performance of mp-BSO-based PSCs, we adopted a state-of-the-art PSC architecture consisting of an FTO/ blocking layer (bl-TiO 2 and SnO 2 bilayer)/mesoporous layer/FA-based mixed perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au (Figure  1A ). For fabricating best-performing devices, all processes were carried out under optimum condition, i.e., 10% RH. From a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Figure  1A ), all the layers are discernible; the mesoporous BSO layer is deposited with a thickness of 140 nm, and a uniform perovskite layer on top of BSO is fabricated with a thickness of 450 nm by using our solvent engineering technique. From this resultant device, we obtained a reverse PCE of 22% with a stabilized PCE of 21.7% (Figure  1B ) and a certified average PCE of 21.3% (Figure  S2 ). As displayed in Figure  S3 , hysteresis behavior is clearly observed but is considerably suppressed in the mesoporous scaffold based on FA-based mixed perovskites, as compared to a previous study using La-doped BSO/MAPbI 3 planar PSCs.  18  A histogram of the solar-cell PCEs for 43 cells is shown in Figure  1C  and Table  S1 . Surprisingly, over 30 cells have a PCE of more than 21% (an average PCE of 21.45% G 0.61%), which is comparable to that of Li-doped mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs (hereafter, denoted as mp-TiO 2 ) (20.74% G 0.58%) (Figure  1C ). In addition to a highly efficient performance, practical processing stability in a production line is required until the device is encapsulated since moisture cannot be perfectly excluded in the processing environment, in contrast with the inert atmosphere of a laboratory (e.g., a glove box filled with nitrogen or dry air). We investigated the processing stability of an mp-BSO-based device fabricated and aged under controlled humidity (i.e., low humidity [$10% RH] and high humidity [$40% RH]). For comparison, we also prepared an mp-TiO 2 -based device under the same conditions. It should be noted that it is usually difficult to prepare a high-quality perovskite film with a dense and uniform morphology under humidity higher than 40% RH. Thus, we adjusted the humidity up to 40% RH. As shown in Figure  S4 , at 10% RH, we could not detect any degradation in either device even after 1 week, and the performance was enhanced from 19.4% and 19.2% to 20.1% and 21.3% for the mp-TiO 2 -based PSC and mp-BSO-based PSC, respectively, owing to the aging effect. However, at 40% RH, we found a significant difference in the device stability between mp-BSO and mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs. Figure  2A  shows the evolution of the average photovoltaic parameters over 24 h for non-encapsulated mp-BSO-and mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs aged at controlled 40% RH. Surprisingly, the mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs show serious degradation at 40% RH in the early stage of the first 3 h because of abrupt decreases in the fill factor (FF) and open circuit voltage (V OC ), and their performance diminishes to approximately 50% of the initial efficiency over 24 h (Figure  2A ). Conversely, the mp-BSO-based PSCs exhibit good stability at 40% RH for 24 h. The FF and short circuit current (J SC ) values stay constant for the first 3 h, while the V OC increases slightly because of the aging effect (similar to the result at 10% RH), resulting in an improvement in the PCE (Figure  2A ). Even after 24 h, only a slight decrease in the PCE is observed for the mp-BSO-based devices. For detailed information, a histogram of PCEs (Figure  S5 ), and full photovoltaic parameters (Tables  S2  and S3 ) for mp-BSO-and mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs processed and aged at 40% RH for 0 and 24 h are further shown. Consequently, it can be concluded that the mp-BSO is an ideal candidate for the ETL in a highly efficient PSC with good processing stability. To elucidate the degradation pathway by the humidity effect on both PSCs, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed at a V OC under 1 sun illumination. Figure  2B  presents the Nyquist plots of mp-TiO 2 -and mp-BSObased PSCs at different humidity conditions. The Nyquist plots show a typical semicircle in a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. The semicircle in the high-frequency region is caused by the selective contact or the interface of this contact and is related to the series resistance (R series ).  19  For a BSO-based PSC, the R series is negligibly affected by humidity, while the diameter of the semicircle for the mp-TiO 2 -based PSC in high-frequency regions increases significantly at higher humidity (40% RH), i.e., the increase in R series , which reduces the FF and thus decreases the PCE of the device. This is in agreement with R series trends extracted from the J-V curves. This increase in the R series can be attributed to the reduced electrical property of Li doped mp-TiO 2 film because all layers in the PSCs are identical except for the n-type mesoporous layer. Because the measured electron concentration for BSO and TiO 2 film also is the same (Figure  S6 ), the reduced electrical property may be ascribed to low mobility of TiO 2 film. Furthermore, the dark J-V curves show a clear difference between mp-BSO-and mp-TiO 2 -based devices, depending on humidity (Figure  2C ). The dark current of mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs is significantly reduced at high humidity ($40% RH) compared to mp-BSO-based PSC, although at low humidity ($10%), they exhibit similar dark J-V curves. In general, the reduction of dark current has a positive effect on devices, suggesting a decrease in defects and hence a reduction of recombination. However, an abnormally greater reduction of dark current may be due to a large drop in electrical properties of the ETL or the ETL/perovskite interface, i.e., an increase in the resistance of the ETL or the ETL/perovskite interface, which increases the R series , as shown in EIS analysis.  19  We further performed transient photocurrent (TPC) and photovoltage (TPV) analysis for devices aged at 40% RH (Figures  2D  and S7 ). It is observed that the mp-BSO-based PSC shows faster decay in TPC and slower decay in TPV than that of the mp-TiO 2 -based PSC, respectively. Additionally, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) result exhibits that the BSO/perovskite sample has a faster charge transfer compared to TiO 2 /perovskite (Figure  S8 ). Based on these results, we can conclude that mp-BSO-based PSCs fabricated and aged at 40 % RH have superior charge extraction capability than mp-TiO 2 -based PSCs fabricated and aged at 40% RH. Therefore, it can be assumed that a high-humidity condition can inhibit electron transport or transfer at the interface between oxide particles or at the interface between the perovskite and the ETL, thereby increasing the resistance of the ETL, which in turn can significantly decrease the FF and PCE of the device with mp-TiO 2 -treated Li salt. To reveal the exact reason for the increase in the resistance of the device, various analyses for mesoporous films under different humidity conditions were performed. First, we carried out X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figures  3A  and S9 ). Figure  3A  displays XPS O 1s spectra of BSO and mp-TiO 2 films with different humidity conditions. The spectra of the BSO films are almost identical regardless of the humidity, indicating that BSO is almost unaffected by humidity, whereas the spectra of the TiO 2 film show clear differences at different humidity conditions. A peak deconvolution process shows that the O 1s spectrum of the samples consists of two peaks at 529.4 and 531.4 eV. The peak with low binding energy is generally associated with the contribution of O 2 À ions in the anatase anionic network, while that with higher binding energy is attributed to the oxygen atoms in the OH species and/or the adsorbed oxygen species on the surface.  20, 21  At a high-humidity condition ($40% RH), the shoulder peak at 531.4 eV is diminished compared with the TiO 2 film at a low-humidity condition, indicating a decrease in the OH species on TiO 2 . Generally, the reduction of OH species may originate from the formation of a new oxide layer (e.g., oxide shell) on the surface of TiO 2 nanoparticles. To support this speculation, we performed a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis (Figure  3B ). Comparing the FTIR spectra of pristine TiO 2 and Li-doped TiO 2 , we found that Li doping inevitably produces lithium oxide (e.g., 625 and 716 cm À1 ; Li-O stretching) on TiO 2 films regardless of the humidity level.  22  Interestingly, the peaks for 625 and 716 cm À1 become stronger at higher humidity, although the peak at 832 cm À1 (Ti-O-Ti stretching) becomes weaker. This indicates that the moisture can accelerate the formation of lithium oxides in TiO 2 . As reported, some types of lithium compounds are critically sensitive to moisture in the air. Water can easily penetrate crystal structures or porous films and react with lithium in the lattice or surface, which can produce Li 2 O.  16  Furthermore, we directly confirmed the formation of an oxide layer on TiO 2 nanoparticles via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). Figures  3C  and 3D  compare HR-TEM images of Li-doped TiO 2 nanoparticles prepared under different humidity (10% or 40% RH). At low humidity (10% RH), the surface of the TiO 2 nanoparticles is smooth. Although we detected Li-O stretching on TiO 2 under low humidity through an FTIR analysis, we could not directly observe a noticeable layer on the TiO 2 surface in the TEM image. This can imply that Li x O can be partially or very thinly formed at a low-humidity condition. However, at high humidity (40% RH), we distinctly observed a non-uniform thin amorphous layer (<5 nm) on the surface of the TiO 2 nanoparticles. Therefore, it can be concluded that the formation of a lithium oxide layer on the surface of TiO 2 nanoparticles is one of the key factors responsible for deterioration of the device under high humidity.  Along with outstanding device performance, the durability of PSCs is another major factor for the commercialization of PSCs. We therefore investigated the long-term stability of BSO-based PSCs under dark storage, as well as under continuous illumination. First, devices were tested without any encapsulation in an ambient environment (25 C and $25% humidity). Figure  5A  shows a normalized PCE of the non-encapsulated FTO/ BSO/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au device as a function of storage time. The resulting device exhibits substantially excellent storage stability for 500 h, retaining almost 100% of the original PCE. Second, we performed a light stability test using two representative HTMs, i.e., Spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA, in a nitrogen-filled chamber at a constant temperature of $25 C under AM 1.5 G illumination using a xenon lamp. Figure  5B  displays the normalized PCE of the encapsulated FTO/BSO/(FAPbI 3 ) 0.93 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.07 (FAMA)/ Spiro-OMeTAD/Au device as a function of testing time under constant air mass (AM) 1.5 G illumination. The PCE of the BSO-based PSC degrades to 67% of its original value within the first 50 h, followed by retention over the next 450 h. Figure  5C  shows the normalized PCE of the encapsulated FTO/BSO/FAMA/PTAA/Au device as a function of testing time under constant AM 1.5 G illumination. The BSO-based PSCs using PTAA exhibit excellent photostability under light illumination, including UV without a drop in the PCE over 500 h, showing superior light stability to a Spiro-OMeTAD-based device. Based on these results, including successful elimination of the problems originating from the TiO 2 ETL, the n-type BSO ETL is a good candidate as an ETL for PSC commercialization. In conclusion, through systematic analyses, we demonstrated that a BSO ETL is an excellent alternative to TiO 2 for commercialization of PSCs. With the state-of-the-art PSC using mp-BSO ETL, we achieved a certified efficiency of 21.3% (reverse scan: 22%; and forward scan: 20.6%) with a stabilized efficiency of 21.7%. These values are comparable to those of the top-performing PSCs based on Li-doped TiO 2 and are the highest efficiencies among non-TiO 2 -based PSCs. By establishing a humid environment similar to that of an actual production line (i.e., high humidity over 40%), we have verified that the BSO ETL would be beneficial to the actual process because of its superior resistance to moisture relative to TiO 2 ETL. In addition, we confirmed that the mp-BSO-based PSCs exhibit superior long-term stability in a humid environment (25%-30% RH) and under light illumination, including UV. We believe that the introduction of mesoscopic BSO will enable a wide processing window in an actual production line, where it is difficult to remove moisture or control humidity, and it can move us a step closer to PSC commercialization.

 Organometal-halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as very promising next-generation solar cells owing to their low fabrication cost and remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 24%. With improving the PCE, stability issues have been raised for commercialization. Recently, much effort has been made to enhance the stability of the perovskite layer and the hole transporting layer, which has successfully improved the durability of the device. However, little research has been done on the humidity stability of the metaloxide layer, especially conventional Li-doped TiO 2 . This issue is very important because moisture cannot be perfectly excluded in an actual production line. Herein, we provide deeper understanding of the degradation mechanism for Li-doped TiO 2based PSC under a humid environment and propose a new metal-oxide (BaSnO 3 ) ETL to improve both device performance and processing stability under a humid environment.

 Figure 4 4 Figure4shows a schematic illustration of electron transport in typical bilayered devices employing mp-TiO 2 and mp-BSO as an ETL. As mentioned above, moisture in the air can induce Li x O on the TiO 2 surface by reacting with Li ions, regardless of the humidity level. In a low-humidity environment (Figure4A), even if Li x O is partially or very thinly formed on the TiO 2 surface, it does not have a significant effect on electron transport, thus maintaining excellent device performance. However, a high-humidity condition can promote the formation of Li x O on the TiO 2 surface, which can operate as a barrier layer for electron transport in TiO 2 (Figure4B). Such suppression of electron transport increases the resistance of the TiO 2 ETL, thereby deteriorating the device performance. Even with no additional doping of Li, BSO nanoparticles have intrinsic properties of high electron conductance and good chemical stability against moisture. Therefore, we could realize a highly efficient and stable PSC fabricated under a broad window of humidity (up to $40% RH) by incorporating BSO nanoparticles as an ETL in a typical bilayered architecture comprising an FA-based mixed perovskite and a mesoporous scaffold.

T wo-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper layered metal-halide perovskites, with desirable optoelectronic properties and good environmental stability, have recently attracted extensive research interest as one of the most promising materials for the fabrication of long-term operationally stable and high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs)  [1] [2] [3]  . The general chemical formula of the layered perovskite is L 2 A n-1 M n X 3n+1 , where L is a long-chain organic cation (spacer), A is a short-chain organic cation, M is a divalent metal cation and X is a halide anion. The unique architecture, with n layers of inorganic [MX 6 ] octahedral sheets sandwiched by two long organic spacer layers, represents a natural quantum well (QW) due to a mismatch in the dielectric constants between the organic and inorganic layers  4, 5  . However, layered perovskites deposited using solution methods typically suffer from a mixture of multiple quantum wells with a random well width (n number) distribution (MQWs), which has severely hindered further progress in this field  [6] [7] [8]  . The component interaction in the solution generally controls the final assembly of the layered perovskite segment. The perovskite solution prepared with stoichiometric amounts of precursors, however, has been confirmed to be a complex mixture of colloid particles with a random size distribution in a mother solution of dissolved ions  9, 10  . Although the large particles can be easily filtered out, the small particles with a few unit cells persist in the solution, and could act as nucleation centres in forming QWs with different well widths. Therefore, the deposition of phase-pure QWs remains a key scientific challenge for the thermodynamic stability of compounds in solution. 
 Supplementary Here, we report phase-pure QW thin films by introducing a molten salt spacer n-butylamine acetate (BAAc), instead of the traditional halide spacers n-butylamine iodide (BAI). For strong ionic coordination between BAAc and the perovskite framework during the initial stage of solution processing, compounds with a uniformly distributed intermediate phase can be gelled from the precursor solution with near-monodisperse unit cell particles. We observe that the phase-pure QW films with microscale, vertically aligned grains can then be crystallized from their respective intermediate phases. Two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper layered metal-halide perovskites have attracted increasing attention for their desirable optoelectronic properties and improved stability compared to their three-dimensional counterparts. However, such perovskites typically consist of multiple quantum wells with a random well width distribution. Here, we report phase-pure quantum wells with a single well width by introducing molten salt spacer n-butylamine acetate, instead of the traditional halide spacer n-butylamine iodide. Due to the strong ionic coordination between n-butylamine acetate and the perovskite framework, a gel of a uniformly distributed intermediate phase can be formed. This allows phase-pure quantum well films with microscale vertically aligned grains to crystallize from their respective intermediate phases. The resultant solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency of 16.25% and a high open voltage of 1.31 V. After keeping them in 65 ± 10% humidity for 4,680 h, under operation at 85 °C for 558 h, or continuous light illumination for 1,100 h, the cells show <10% efficiency degradation. 
 Articles Nature eNergy improved stability with respect to their MQW counterparts under conditions of humidity, heat and light stress. After keeping them in 65 ± 10% humidity conditions for 4,680 h, under operation at 85 °C for 558 h, or under continuous light illumination for 1,100 h, the unencapsulated devices showed no significant degradation (<10%). 
 Properties of MQW and phase-pure QW films Phase-pure QW (BA 2 MA n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 ) films, with different well widths (<n> = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; <n> represents the designed n value), were prepared by introducing a molten salt spacer BAAc, instead of the traditional halide spacers such as BAI (Supplementary Fig.  1 )  [11] [12] [13]  . Here, n is the number of semiconducting [PbX 6 ] 4-octahedron slabs within the organic ammonium n-butylamine (BA) spacers. The number of these slabs determines the QW thickness and the degree of quantum confinement, leading to tunable exciton properties and band gaps. To probe the phase purity of the perovskite films deposited with BAAc, as well as the control films deposited with BAI, femtosecond transient absorption (TA) measurements were conducted on these films (Fig.  1a, b  and Supplementary Figs.  2  and 3 ). Upon a 3.1 eV photon pulse excitation, hot charge carriers are injected into all the perovskite QWs. These hot charge carriers subsequently cool to the band edge states or transfer to the adjacent QWs through quantum coupling. The cooled charge carriers in the band edge states induce pronounced photobleaching (PB) in the transitions associated with these states. The high energy level transitions, which dominate the linear absorption above the band gap, are almost invisible in this differential absorption spectrum. Therefore, even if the volume doping concentration of a QW (with n) in a film is very small, the band edge exciton transition associated with this QW (with n) can be identified in the white light probe spectrum, at the early probe delay times  3, 14, 15  . Although all the films were prepared with the desired precursor stoichiometry for single-phase perovskite QWs, Fig.  1a  clearly shows that the TA spectra of the QWs (<n> = 2, 3, 4, 5) deposited with traditional BAI are dominated by multiple PB peaks. The peaks located at 516, 572, 610, 644, 670 and 760 nm closely match with the band edge exciton transitions in n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and ∞ QWs, respectively. The multiple peaks indicate that the QW films deposited with traditional halide spacers are perovskite MQWs, which is consistent with previous publications  [4] [5] [6] [7] 14  . The deposition of phase-pure metal-halide perovskite QWs was a long-term challenge for the research community. By contrast, as shown in Fig.  1b , the TA spectra are dominated by single PB peaks, for all the QW films prepared with the molten salt spacer BAAc. The PB signals associated with the undesired phases in each film are almost negligible. These results reveal that near-single-phase perovskite QWs films could be deposited with a molten salt spacer. The phase-pure perovskite QWs show dramatically different linear absorption (Fig.  1c, d ) and photoluminescence (PL; Fig.  1e, f  and Supplementary Figs.  4  and 5 ) patterns from that of the perovskite MQWs. As presented in Fig.  1c , the MQW films (for <n> ≥ 2) show typical multiple exciton absorption peaks  4, 5, 16, 17  . Correspondingly, the PL spectra of these films are complicated with multiple peaks (Fig.  1e ). Owing to the volume doping concentration of the three-dimensional (3D) perovskite, the phase increases with increasing <n>. This increase combined with an efficient charge carrier funnelling from the thin to thicker QWs  3, 6, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21]  causes the PL of the MQW films with <n> > 2 to be dominated by the broad emission from 3D perovskite, with a slight contribution from thin QWs. By contrast, the linear absorption and PL spectra of phase-pure QW films exhibit a clear single peak (Fig.  1d, f ). Both the absorption and PL peak wavelengths increase monotonically with increasing designed well width <n>. The peak positions of film <n> matched well with the values determined for QW n  1, 3, 18, 19  . Furthermore, no obvious PL from 3D perovskite was observed for any of the films. These results further confirm that near-single-phase perovskite QW films were deposited with the molten salt spacer BAAc. In light of the above findings, as well as the results of a comparative optical investigation by probing from the top (QW side) and bottom (quartz side) surfaces, the schematic structures of the films deposited with BAI and BAAc are illustrated in Fig.  1g, h , respectively. MQWs with a graded vertical distribution are formed in the films deposited with BAI. Thin QWs were located near the substrate and thick QWs (including the 3D phase) were located on the top, which is consistent with previous reports  17, 19  . The 3D (n = ∞) phase on top of the films is subject to degradation, which is not good for perovskite stability. By contrast, the phase-pure QW films deposited with BAAc possess a continuous phase distribution, which not only ensures stability but also guarantees efficient carrier transport along the vertical direction  22  . The vertical alignment of the phase-pure QWs was proved with the following crystal structure characterizations. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the QW films deposited with BAI and BAAc are shown in Fig.  2a, b , respectively. In MQW films deposited with BAI, clear periodic two-dimensional (2D) crystallographic planes (00k) and (0k0) were observed for the <n> = 1 and <n> = 2 films, respectively. However, the 2D crystallographic planes disappeared in the films with <n> ≥ 3 for the largely mixed phases, which is consistent with previous reports 8,  12, 23  . By contrast, clear periodic 2D crystallographic planes (0k0) were observed in all the films (<n> = 2, 3, 4, 5) deposited with BAAc, which further confirmed their high phase purity. To further elucidate the crystal orientation of the QWs on the substrate, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed on the films (<n> = 4) deposited with BAI and BAAc (Fig.  2c, d ). The MQW film exhibited diffraction rings with the signal of the (111) plane, indicating considerable randomness of the polycrystalline orientation, which agrees well with the X-ray diffraction results. However, sharp, sporadic Bragg spots in the phase-pure QW films were observed, such as (060), (  080 ) and (0100) diffractions, suggesting superior crystallinity and preferential orientation with respect to the substrate and high phase purity. The aligned phase-pure QWs could build an efficient carrier-transport channel between the two electrodes, which is favourable for electronic devices  17, 24  . The surface morphologies of the films were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (Fig.  2e ,f and Supplementary Figs.  6  and 7 ). The results show that phase-pure QW films possess a smooth surface with a large average grain size of ~10 μm, while the MQW films possess much smaller grains (~1-2 µm) and obvious pinholes. The high quality of the phase-pure QW films was further confirmed by atomic force microscopy and photo-image measurements (Supplementary Figs.  8  and 9 ). These dense and pinhole-free perovskite films with smooth surfaces and excellent crystallinity are highly desirable for optoelectronic devices. 
 Probing the formation mechanisms of phase-pure QWs The introduction of BAAc into the precursor solution instead of the traditional BAI affected the perovskite sol-gel processes during spin coating. These processes may include solution formation, gelation and crystallization  9, 25, 26  . The solution, prepared with stoichiometric amounts of precursors, has been confirmed to be a complex mixture of colloid particles with random size distribution in a mother solution of dissolved ions  9, 10  . Although large particles are easily filtered out before spin coating, the small particles with one to a few unit cells persist in the solution, and can act as nucleation centres forming QWs with different well widths. Therefore, this random particle size distribution in the precursor solution is a fundamental limitation for depositing phase-pure QWs films. Here, particle size distribution in the precursor solutions prepared with BAI and BAAc was examined by dynamic light scattering (Fig.  3a ). In the solution prepared with BAI, the particles were randomly distributed, with separation varying from 1 nm to several micrometres, indicating different degrees of [PbI 6 ] 4-octahedron aggregation  9, 10, 25, 27  . Surprisingly, in the solution prepared with BAAc, the particles showed a very narrow size distribution (~0.6 nm). This narrow size distribution may originate from the strong interaction between Ac -and Pb 2+ , which prevents the aggregation of colloids with more than one unit cell. To prove this strong interaction between the carbonyl groups of acetate and Pb 2+ , attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectra were collected (Fig.  3b ). The asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration peaks of Ac -in pure BAAc are located at 1,557 cm -1 and 1,402 cm -1 , respectively. The corresponding peaks shifted to 1,548 cm -1 and 1,405 cm -1 upon interaction with the lead ions  28  . This strong coordination interaction may result in the formation of a stable and homogeneous precursor solution. In addition, the local coordination environment of Pb ions in the precursor solution was examined by X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy at the Pb L3 edge (Fig.  3c-e ). The extended X-ray absorption fine structure study showed that the coordination environment of Pb in BAAc precursor solution is distinctly different from that in the BAI precursor solution (Supplementary Table  1 ). In the solution with   BAI, a dominant peak at a distance R = 2.8 ± 0.01 Å was observed in the Fourier-transformed spectrum (Fig.  3d ), which corresponds to the Pb-I scattering path. However, in the solution with BAAc (Fig.  3e ), the peak of the Fourier-transformed spectrum is located at R = 1.8 ± 0.01 Å, which corresponds to the Pb-O scattering path. Therefore, the strong coordination interaction between Ac -and Pb 2+ was further confirmed by the results of the X-ray absorption near-edge structure. Furthermore, the 1 H NMR spectra (Fig.  3f ) show that there is a strong upfield chemical shift (Δδ ≈ 0.08 ppm) in the resonance signal of the -NH 3 + protons, by introducing BAAc (7.57 ppm) instead of BAI (7.49 ppm) into the perovskite precursor solution. This chemical shift is caused by the stronger shielding effect of N-H•••O=C-O -compared to the N-H•••I -hydrogen bond. For these strong coordination interactions between Ac -and the precursors as well as the high viscosity and negligible vapour pressure of BAAc (ref.  25  ), as the other solvents evaporate during the initial stage of spin coating, a uniformly distributed intermediate phase could be gelled from the precursor solution with near-monodisperse unit cell particles. Subsequently, a phase-pure QW film with microscale vertically aligned grains could be crystallized from the intermediate phase, by ejecting the coordinated molten salt and evaporating the by-product methylammonium acetate (MAAc). To more clearly illustrate the mechanisms of different QW films deposited with BAI and BAAc, the reaction formation enthalpies were also calculated using density functional theory from first principles. The results clearly show that MQW formation has the lowest enthalpy value in the case of BAI. However, the formation of phase-pure QWs is thermodynamically preferred by introducing BAAc (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Figs.  10  and 11 ). 
 Photovoltaic performance of solar cells To demonstrate the potential application of phase-pure QW films, efficient solar cells with remarkably high stability and high V OC were constructed. The device structure is made up of layers of indium tin oxide (ITO), SnO 2 nm), perovskite QWs (~500 nm), spiro-OMeTAD (2,2' ,7,7'-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine) -9,9'-spirobifluorene) (~200 nm), MoO 3 (~5 nm) and Au (~80 nm; Supplementary Fig.  12 ). Here, a value of <n> = 4 QWs is used for its balanced wide-band visible-light absorption and good stability (for other <n> QW devices, see Supplementary Fig.  13  and Supplementary Table  2 ). Scanning transmission electron microscopy cross-sectional images of a typical phase-pure QW device are shown in Fig.  4a . Compact multiple layers with clear contrast can be observed. The coloured energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental mapping exhibits a uniform distribution of lead and iodide across the perovskite layer, which is further confirmed by the intensity of lead and iodide elemental signals. The uniform element distribution in the phase-pure QW film is significantly different from the vertical gradient distribution of the elements in the MQW films  19  . A PCE of 16.25% was achieved for the phase-pure QW PSC, with a record high V OC of 1.31 V, a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 16.75 mA cm -2 , a fill factor of 74.07% and negligible J-V hysteresis (Fig.  4b  and Supplementary Table  3 ). By comparison, the MQW PSC demonstrated a PCE of 13.81%, with a V OC of 1.12 V, a J SC of 18.43 mA cm -2 , a fill factor of 66.95% and visible J-V hysteresis. The increased J SC in the MQW PSC was caused by the broadened visible-light absorption in the MQW film. However, with the large increases in V OC and fill factor, the phase-pure QW PSC presented a substantially higher PCE than the MQW PSC. The steady-state output powers, measured under the maximum power point voltages, are 16.14% and 12.97% for the champion phase-pure QW and MQW devices, respectively (Fig.  4c ). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and integrated J SC of the two champion devices are presented in Fig.  4d . The IPCE spectra closely match the corresponding linear absorption spectra (Fig.  1c, d ). The integrated J SC is also in good agreement with the value derived from the corresponding J-V measurements. The statistical results of the devices' performance are shown in Supplementary Fig.  14 . For each condition, 20 devices were fabricated. To explore whether the QW phase purity will affect stability, the long-term stability of the PSCs was recorded under various conditions without encapsulation. After storage under ambient conditions (65 ± 10% relative humidity) for 4,680 h, the phase-pure QW device retained 93.8% of its original PCE, while the MQW device showed a 49.4% PCE loss (Fig.  4e ). Under accelerated ageing tests in a N 2 -filled glovebox (Fig.  4f, g ), the phase-pure QW cells retained 95.7% of their original PCE after continuous heating at 85 °C for 558 h, and retained 96.2% of the initial PCE after continuous illumination at AM1.5G for 1,100 h. By contrast, the MQW device retained only 59.1% and 70.8% of its initial PCE after the corresponding ageing tests (Supplementary Table  4 ). Therefore, the phase-pure QW device possesses much better stability than the MQW device under varying conditions. This conclusion is also consistent with a previous publication  12  , which concluded that the stability of thin QWs is better than that of thick (or 3D perovskite). The long organic cation spacers between the inorganic slabs could be responsible for blocking the perovskite from reacting with moisture and oxygen, as well as inhibiting ion migration within the perovskite lattice  [29] [30] [31] [32]  . In phase-pure QW films, the inorganic slabs are uniformly protected by the spacer layers, whereas in the MQW films, there are substantial thick QWs and 3D perovskite crystals. Hence, QW phase purity is of crucial importance for device stability. 
 Conclusions Our findings show that the traditional constraints of deposition phase-pure QW films could be overcome by introducing a molten salt spacer. High-quality phase-pure QW films in 2D Ruddlesden-Popper layered perovskite with microscale vertically aligned grains were produced, yielding an efficient and stable PSC. Compared to the traditional all-inorganic QWs deposited with vacuum methods  33  , the hybrid organic-inorganic metal-halide perovskite phase-pure QWs offer several improvements, including solution processability, low-temperature fabrication and atomic layer accuracy. Considering the good stability, unique structure and optoelectronic properties, we anticipate that the phase-pure QWs will facilitate the development of solar cells and other perovskite-based optoelectronic devices, such as detectors, light-emitting diodes and lasers.

Methylammonium iodide (MAI, 99.9%), butylammonium iodide (BAI, 99.9%) and poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA, 99.9%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology. Lead iodide (PbI 2 , 99.99%) and 4-isopropyl-4′-methyldiphenyliodonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (TPFB, 98.0%) were purchased from TCI Development. Spiro-OMeTAD (Lumtec, 99.5%), acetonitrile (ACN, 99.8% anhydrous), 4-tert-butylphenol (t-BP, 99%), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, 99.95% trace metals basis), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.99%), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, 99.5%), chlorobenzene (99.9%), BA (98%), hydriodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in H 2 O), acetic acid (HAc, 99.99%), ethyl alcohol, acetone and isopropyl alcohol were used as received from Sigma-Aldrich. The SnO 2 colloid precursor was obtained from Alfa Aesar (tin(iv) oxide, 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion), and the particles were diluted by H 2 O to 2.67% before use. Unless otherwise noted, all the reagents were used without additional treatment. 
 Synthesis of BAAc. First, 50 ml acetic acid and 71 ml butylamine were injected and stirred in a 250 ml round-bottom flask in an ice water bath for 2 h. After stirring at 0 °C for 2 h, the resulting solution was recovered by reduced pressure rotary evaporation at 80 °C for 1 h and produced synthesized liquid chemical BAAc. The liquid product was put into a refrigerator for 2 h to crystallize. The frozen product was washed three times with diethyl ether and then was dissolved in ethanol and recrystallized from diethyl ether three times. Then, the solid product was dissolved in ethanol again, and liquid product was collected by reduced pressure rotary evaporation at 80 °C for 1 h. Finally, the liquid product was cooled to room temperature. Synthesis of perovskite precursors. The BA 2 MA n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving BAI, MAI and PbI 2 , or BAAc, MAI and PbI 2 in DMF and DMSO (volume ratio is 4:1). For the n = 1-5 systems, the molar concentration of BAAc (liquid) was 0.58 mmol ml -1 , 0.31 mmol ml -1 , 0.21 mmol ml -1 , 0.16 mmol ml -1 and 0.13 mmol ml -1 , respectively. The obtained solution was stirred at 65 °C for 2 h in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. BAAc-based precursor (<n> = 1) was prepared with BAAc (76.86 mg, 0.58 mmol), HI (~66 µl, 0.58 mmol) and PbI 2 (133.14 mg, 0.29 mmol) in DMF and DMSO. For the <n> > 1 precursor, we provided additional MAI with the BAAc in the amount needed to make up for the insufficient iodine; for example, the <n> = 2 precursor contained BAAc (41.47 mg, 0.31 mmol), MAI (74.36 mg, 0.47 mmol) and PbI 2 (143.74 mg, 0.31 mmol); <n> = 3 precursor contained BAAc (28.39 mg, 0.21 mmol), MAI (67.90 mg, 0.43 mmol) and PbI 2 (147.65 mg, 0.32 mmol); <n> = 4 precursor contained BAAc (21.59 mg, 0.16 mmol), MAI (64.53 mg, 0.41 mmol) and PbI 2 (149.68 mg, 0.32 mmol); and <n> = 5 precursor contained BAAc (17.42 mg, 0.13 mmol), MAI (62.46 mg, 0.39 mmol) and PbI 2 (150.93 mg, 0.33 mmol). Device fabrication. The patterned ITO substrate was washed with deionized water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol successively, with drying under nitrogen flow. After 15 min ultraviolet-O 3 treatments, a SnO 2 nanocrystal solution was spin coated on the substrate at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s to form a 50-nm-thick electron-transporting layer, which was then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in air. For the persistent hot-casting process, the ITO/SnO 2 substrates were preheated at 100 °C on the spin coater for 5 min, and 50 μl of precursor solution was dropped onto the hot substrate. The spin coater was immediately started with a spin speed of 4,000 r.p.m. for 20 s with 4,000 ramp, and the substrate temperature was elevated from 100 °C to 110 °C by a program controller. The colour of the thin film turned from pale yellow to brown in a few seconds as the solvent escaped. After spin coating, the substrates were quickly removed from the spin coater and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min covered with a small Petri dish. The substrates were then transferred to a nitrogen glove box to complete the device fabrication. For the hole transporting layer, a spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (75 mg ml -1 ) solution was employed with the addition of 35 μl Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (260 mg ml -1 ) and 30 μl 4-tertbutylpyridine. For the stability test, PTAA solution was obtained by dissolving 40 mg PTAA powder in 1 ml chlorobenzene with 10% TPFB. Then 35 μl of the spiro-OMeTAD solution or PTAA solution was dropped onto the perovskite-coated substrate and spin coated at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The device was finished by the thermal evaporation of molybdenum trioxide (5 nm) and Au (80 nm) under vacuum with a shadow mask that kept an active area of 0.05 cm 2 . Characterization. The crystallographic structure information was characterized on a Rigaku (Smart Lab 3 kW) X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å) at a speed of 20 degrees per minute under the operation conditions of 40 kV and 30 mA. Scanning electron microscopy images were obtained via a field emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL-JSM7800F).
