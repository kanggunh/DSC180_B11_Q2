Title: Revealing the full potential of CsPbIBr 2 perovskite solar cells: advancements towards enhanced performance †
Cesium lead iodide bromide (CsPbIBr 2 ) perovskite solar cells (PSCs)   have improved stability compared to other perovskite compositions. However, they still face significant challenges due to their poor photovoltaic performance parameters, which limit the devices' power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). This study proposes a novel device design to tailor the potential of CsPbIBr 2 PSCs by improving their optoelectronic properties. An advanced 3D multiphysics approach was rigorously used to investigate the optics and electrical properties of the proposed CsPbIBr 2 PSCs. This approach combines finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) and finite element method (FEM) techniques with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The outcome from the adapted numerical approach is in good agreement with the experimental results. The optimized CsPbIBr 2 PSC demonstrates a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 16.4%, associated V OC of 1.53 V, FF of 80.6%, and J SC of 13.4 mA cm À2 . Therefore, the potential of CsPbIBr 2 perovskites could be further explored with continued research and development in material science and device physics.
Introduction The inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites CsPbX 3 (X = Cl, Br, I) represent an area of research interest that has grown in the past few years owing to their remarkable thermal stability, addressing critical challenges faced by their organic-inorganic counterparts and tunable optical bandgap, making them suitable for tandem solar cell applications.  [1] [2] [3]  So far, several dominant types of all-inorganic absorber materials such as CsPbI 3 (1.73 eV), CsPbI 2 Br (1.92 eV) to wide-bandgap CsPbIBr 2 (2.05 eV), and CsPbBr 3 (2.36  
 eV) have been comprehensively The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of wide bandgap all inorganic mixed halide CsPbIBr 2 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has not reached its theoretical limit due to challenges in material selection, device engineering, and other crucial factors. However, a new potential device design has been proposed in this study, which could potentially achieve a PCE of over 16.4% through a combination of multiple engineering approaches (e.g., device engineering, interface engineering, and composition engineering) and photon management. This design involves a textured front contact with an array of metal oxide nanoholes, allowing for efficient photon management and improved light trapping within the device. Advanced 3D multiphysics approaches, such as finite-difference timedomain (FDTD) and finite-element method (FEM) techniques embedded with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, have been utilized to gain a detailed understanding of the new device optics and its underlying electrical effects. This innovative device design may offer a promising solution to overcome the current challenges associated with lower PCE of all inorganic halide CsPbIBr 2 PSCs and could have potential applications in the development of wide bandgap materials for efficient perovskite-based multifunction tandem solar cells. explored. Among them, CsPbIBr 2 perovskite has appeared to be a promising light harvester representing the most balanced features in terms of optical bandgap and stability (stable up to 460 1C under ambient conditions).  4, 5  The inorganic cesium component mitigates issues related to thermal decomposition and moisture sensitivity, which are common in organicinorganic counterpart perovskites.  6, 7  This stability translates to longer lifetimes and better performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in varying environmental conditions. The CsPbIBr 2 with a bandgap of B2.05 eV has the potential to be used in multi-junction tandem solar cells and thus, the open circuit voltage (V OC ) of the resultant device further improves.  8, 9  Therefore, it appears a desirable alternative to organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite light absorbers, which is put forward. To date, huge efforts have been executed to optimize the CsPbIBr 2 thin films and their resultant PSC performances. The fabrication of CsPbIBr 2 PSCs typically involves solution processing or vapor deposition methods. These techniques are designed to produce high-quality CsPbIBr 2 thin films for achieving optimal device performance. In 2016, Ho-Baillie and colleagues demonstrated CsPbIBr 2 -based PSCs achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.7% using a dual source thermal evaporation technique.  8  Zang and colleagues made further efforts on low-temperature treated CsPbIBr 2 PSCs to achieve a high PCE of 5.59% for the first time.  10  This work promotes new insights towards low-temperature solution-processable flexible PSCs. Ho-Baillie and colleagues enabled further attempts to achieve a stabilized PCE of 6.3% with negligible hysteresis using a sprayassisted deposition technique.  11  The low hysteresis and the highly stabilized PCE of PSC meant that the CsPbIBr 2 perovskite remains a viable alternative to its organic-inorganic counterparts. Furthermore, Jin et al. stated an improved PCE of 8.25% for a holetransport layer (HTL)-free device using a two-step technique.  12  Zhang et al. demonstrated a light-processing method to enhance the crystallization route, subsequently enabling the full-surface coverage with large grain sizes, high crystallinity, and pure-phase CsPbIBr 2 films along favorable electronic structure. The resultant devices achieved a PCE of 8.6% with a high V OC of 1.283 V.  13  The poor quality of CsPbIBr 2 film inevitably facilitates an extreme recombination loss and consequently a lower V OC .  14  Liao et al. reported a carbon-based CsPbIBr 2 PSC achieving a PCE of 8.76% with a superior V OC of 1.289 V using a vapor-assisted deposition strategy.  15  The large-area (1 cm 2 ) devices also exhibited a PCE of 6.78% with an impressive V OC of 1.336 V. The higher V OC can be attributed to the decreased defects/recombination losses in the bulk CsPbIBr 2 perovskite because of full surface coverage over the substrate with vertically orientated larger grains (over 1 mm) (enabling easy dissociation of the photogenerated carriers) and much higher light absorption capability. Thus, the pure-phase CsPbIBr 2 -based PSCs are supposed to deliver a higher V OC . Hao and colleagues further reported air-stable carbon-based PSCs achieving a PCE of over 9% with no HTL using a simple intermolecular exchange strategy.  5  Dense, large grain sizes and surface coverage of CsPbIBr 2 perovskite were greatly enhanced, resulting in a high V OC of 1.245 V. Zang et al. further boosted the PCE to over 11% with negligible hysteresis and increased stability using an interface modulator of ultrathin magnesium oxide (MgO) as an effective passivation strategy.  16  Wang and colleagues further improved the PCE to 12.11% by double-side rubidium acetate passivation.  17  The resultant device (encapsulated) retained over 92% of the PCE value after 800 h exposed to a relative humidity of 25%. Recently, Yu et al. boasted a record PCE of 12.8% with a considerably higher optimal short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 11.50 mA cm 2 by using a triple-component precursor (TCP) system based on lead bromide, lead iodide, and cesium bromide. This TCP system facilitates dense and uniform CsPbIBr 2 films with high crystallinity, micron-sized grains, reduced grain boundaries, and less defect density. To date, a reasonably higher device performance of CsPbIBr 2 PSC is achieved by optimizing the film quality, interfacial engineering, defect passivation, and composition engineering. However, the PCE is still far from its theoretical limit and even lags behind other inorganic counterparts.  18, 19  Despite that, low V OC , fill factor (FF), and J SC are the major challenges to achieving higher PCE from the CsPbIBr 2 PSC. That means, a low V OC is attributed to the loss of energy in the form of recombination, where an energy loss is the difference between band gap energy and V OC .  20, 21  The majority of CsPbIBr 2 PSCs exhibited lower V OC , and FF indicating quite high energy loss  [22] [23] [24]  due to radiative and non-radiative recombination.  25, 26  The radiative recombination in CsPbIBr 2 PSCs is mainly related to the film quality and interfacial recombination, whereas non-radiative recombination is related to the interfacial band alignment, defect state, and grain boundaries.  27, 28  However, very little attention has been given to CsPbIBr 2 PSC parameters in terms of exploring and discussing the challenges and developments of these materials. In this study, we proposed a potential device design for CsPbIBr 2 PSCs that can achieve high performance in terms of conversion efficiency and associated optoelectronic properties. We have implemented 3D layer configurations of the CsPbIBr 2 PSC, whose optical and electrical properties are investigated using advanced 3D multiphysics solvers. In particular, the 3D multiphysics solvers combine both the finite-difference timedomain (FDTD) and finite element method (FEM) techniques to study solar cell performance. Finally, we provide an outlook for the future development of this material for the next generation of high-efficiency PSCs. 
 Realization of high-performance CsPbIBr 2 perovskite solar cells 
 Device design and materials A proper selection of solar cell materials is required to achieve high-efficiency PSCs while maintaining the stability of the device. The performance of CsPbIBr 2 PSCs can be enhanced by a proper selection of both ETL and HTL materials. The commonly used materials such as TiO 2 and SnO 2 as ETL and Spiro-OMeTAD as HTL are considered in this study. However, the record PCE of CsPbIBr 2 PSC is still lower than its theoretical limit due to the lowered J SC , V OC , and FF.  18, 29  In order to improve these parameters and eventually the PCE of the PSC, several constraints need to be taken into consideration, including material selection (band gap adjustment), device engineering, interface engineering, low-temperature fabrication, and modification of the solution-processed absorber layer using additives or similar approaches. However, all these methods require a detailed understanding of the underlying device physics and electrical characteristics. Therefore, to achieve high efficiency and stable CsPbIB 2 PSCs, we propose a substrateconfigured (opposite to superstrate architecture) solar cell design.  30, 31  This design involves the deposition of HTL on top of a prepared metal substrate (Au, Ag, or Al), followed by consecutive layers. This allows for the realization of efficient single-junction PSCs and perovskite-based tandem solar cells (TSCs). The proposed PSC consists of a 50 nm thick NiO layer as the HTL, which is considered an ideal inorganic material due to its better chemical stability, low resistivity, and, most importantly, large work function, which contributes to high V OC .  32, 33  However, a thin NiO layer must be considered to realize highefficiency PSCs. The proposed device design incorporates a double-layered (doped ZnO/SnO 2 ) ETL configuration, which has the potential to improve the performance of PSCs significantly. This innovative ETL configuration aims to address efficiency and stability challenges by enhancing electron mobility, reducing recombination losses, optimizing band alignment and energy levels, facilitating smoother electron flow, improving charge transport, passivating surface defects, providing a more uniform morphology, enhancing interface quality, and ensuring better contact with the perovskite layer.  34  Additionally, the use of two different materials (doped ZnO and SnO 2 ) in the ETL can offer protection against environmental factors, such as moisture and UV light, thereby enhancing the longterm stability of the solar cells.  35  By combining the optical properties of different ETLs, the design also aims to reduce reflection and increase light absorption in the perovskite layer, ultimately boosting overall efficiency. The proposed device design includes a textured front contact comprising an array of metal oxide nanoholes (NHs). This textured multi-layered front contact can enable efficient photon management due to improved light incoupling and a fraction of light trapping within the device. The proposed front contact can be prepared using industrially viable nanoimprinting or stamping techniques and various lithography and etching methods.  33, [36] [37] [38] [39]  The textured front contact has a comparable refractive index (2-2.5) with the HTL (NiO) and perovskite material (CsPbIBr 2 ), assuming it is to be a single block device. In addition, the NH front contact also acts as a refractive index matching layer to allow incident light to travel from the air medium to the device effectively. It is expected that incorporation of the NH front contact and optimized other solar cell layers can lead to reduced energy loss due to recombination (interface and surface), overcome energy level mismatch, and minimize optical losses at the front contact layer. Thus, overcoming these parameters can improve the electrical performance (V OC and FF) and optical performance (quantum efficiency, reflection, and J SC ) of the solar cell, resulting in an increased PCE. On top of that, an all-inorganic PSC will exhibit better device stability.  35  The 3D schematic sketch of the proposed device design, energy level of each layer of the solar cell, and experimentally realized complex refractive index of the materials used in the device are presented in Fig.  1 (a), (b), (c), and (d), respectively. 
 Optics and electrical characteristics of the device In this part of the study, we have employed a highly advanced 3D multiphysics technique to analyze the performance of solar cells. This technique is tailored by a combination of FDTD and FEM numerical methods, which are further enhanced by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The simulation process utilizes the complex refractive index, 3D layer morphologies, electronic properties of materials, and 3D simulation environment in conjunction with boundary conditions as input parameters.  18, [31] [32] [33] 40  A circularly polarized incident plane with an amplitude of 1 V m À1 was used. The device was simulated for a wavelength range varying from 300 nm to 630 nm, which is quite close to the band gap of CsPbIBr 2 perovskite (2.05 eV). This simulation approach enables us to calculate the electric field distributions, power density, quantum efficiency (QE), J SC , and current-voltage (J-V) characteristics of the device. The simulation results have been found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental outcomes, which our prior research works have confirmed.  7, 33, 41  More details regarding the simulation methods and calculation of the solar cell's parameters can be found in the ESI † (Sections S1, S2, and Table  S1 ).  33  Prior to investigating the proposed PSC device, we conducted a study on the records of CSPbIBr 2 PSC with the device structure ITO/SnO 2 /CsPbIBr 2 /Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag (inset of Fig.  2b ) to validate our numerical approach. This approach establishes a valid starting reference for the investigation of the optoelectrical performance of PSCs. Fig.  2 (a) compares QEs between simulation and experiment. The QE obtained from 3D FDTD optical simulations demonstrates reasonable agreement with the experimentally realized QE within the complete spectral range (300-620 nm), as depicted in Fig.  2(a) . It is important to note that the ellipsometry measurements were performed on a single thin film layer on the substrate, while the experimentally realized QE measurements were conducted on multilayered films or a complete device. Analyzing multilayered films becomes more complex, requiring fitting parameters such as refractive index, extinction coefficient, and thickness. Interference effects from layers and the influence of the substrate also need to be considered. In the context of PSCs, the quality of the bottom layer (ETL) significantly impacts device performance. The rough surface of the fabricated device is further post-processed when generating the QE data, leading to a slight discrepancy in the QE spectra between the experiment and the simulation, which may also lead to slight changes in the bandgap of the perovskite material. It is important to note that the optical simulation uses a smooth material surface, whereas, in the case of fabricated devices, a certain level of roughness is present, which leads to haze and loss of interference effects during the fabrication of the real device.  7, 33  That means, this effect results in a slight discrepancy between the simulation and experimental outcomes. The measured QE of the fabricated device is maximized (B92%) at the wavelength of 450 nm, while the simulated QE shows a QE peak (B90%) at 540 nm wavelength. However, the simulated QE nicely follows the overall trend of measured QE, resulting in equivalent integrated J SC s (Fig.  2a ). However, the optical simulations (QE and J SC ) provide realistic information on the photon harvesting  efficiency within the active layer; however, they do not provide the electrical parameters necessary to calculate the conversion efficiency of the complete solar cell. A combination of FDTD and FEM numerical solvers provides a great agreement between simulated and measured results of the CsPbIBr 2 PSCs, as confirmed by the J-V characteristic curves presented in Fig.  2(b ). This technique is highly beneficial in estimating QE accurately before realizing the real device. Experimental data was extracted from this reported article.  29  The simulated PSC has revealed J SC of 11.72 mA cm À2 , V OC of 1.42 V, FF of 70.9%, and PCE of 11.81%, which are in good agreement with the fabricated device listed in the Table shown in Fig.  2(c ).  29  Based on these investigations, it is assumed that the electrical parameters are limited due to the imperfection of interfaces between perovskite and transport materials. On the other hand, the flat front surface causes high optical (reflection) losses that minimize the QE and J SC . Since our employed multiphysics approach has successfully validated the data realized from experiments, we firmly believe that the proposed modified PSC design will provide a realistic outcome for developing high-efficiency devices. In the following section, we will discuss investigating the optoelectronic properties of the proposed solar cell further. It is crucial to optimize the front textured contact of the solar cell as it greatly affects its optical performance. The interfaces between perovskite and charge transport layers are considered to be planar, ensuring maximum electrical parameters of the device. The 3D FDTD method, in combination with the PSO algorithm, was used to obtain an optimized NH profile dimension with a depth (h) of 600 nm and a diameter (d) of 550-600 nm for a given period (p) of 600 nm, as presented in Fig.  3(a) . The J SC map was simulated for the different NH's h (300-600 nm) and d (300-600 nm) (Fig.  3a ). Fig.  3(b)  shows the QEs and integrated J SC s of the solar cell against NH diameters for a given period of 600 nm and depth of 600 nm. The J SC varies from 10.18 to 12 mA cm À2 for a diameter range of 300-600 nm. It has been observed that larger diameters (550 nm and 600 nm) exhibit almost identical QE and J SC values. PSCs with larger NHs provide more efficient light in-coupling than the lower NHs, allowing for improved QE and J SC . It is also noticed that the influence of NH depth on the device's optical performance is minimal, as confirmed by their QEs and integrated J SC presented in Fig.  3(c ). To study the electrical properties of the device along with the optical properties of solar cells, an additional set of electrical simulations was rigorously conducted, where the NH diameter and depth ranged from 300 nm to 600 nm. The J-V characteristics of these studied devices are shown in Fig.  S1 (ESI † ), and extracted photovoltaic parameters are listed in Tables  S2  and S3  in the ESI. † Similarly, it was observed that the NH depth does not greatly contribute to the changes in PSC performance; however, the overall device performance is greatly dependent on the NH diameter. For fabrication benefits, we recommend considering a 550 nm diameter and 600 nm period with a 600 nm depth of the NH Fig.  3  (a) Short circuit current density (J SC ) map as a function of NH depths and diameters for a fixed period of 600 nm.

These results showed that the J SC is maximized for a diameter-toperiod (d/p) ratio of 0.92-1. The simulated J-V characteristic curve of the optimized device is presented in Fig.  3(d) , where extracted photovoltaic parameters are summarized in the inset of Fig.  3(d) . The proposed CsPbIBr 2 PSC exhibits a J SC of 13.44 mA cm À2 , V OC of 1.53 V, FF of 80.6%, and PCE of 16.44%, which is much higher than the record singlejunction CsPbIBr 2 PSC (PCE = 12.57%).  29  It is also understood that the integrated J SC derived from the simulated QE is lower than the extracted J SC from the J-V characteristic curve. We are aware that the phenomenon of the integrated J SC from QE being lower than the J SC from the J-V curve is observed in practical perovskite photovoltaic devices.  34  This difference can be attributed to variations in measurement conditions, potential artifacts, and the intrinsic properties of solar cells. To address this, we emphasize the importance of careful tool calibration and the implementation of standardized measurement systems to understand and minimize these discrepancies better. However, we believe that the proposed device design and fabrication method can significantly contribute to the development of nextgeneration high-performance solar cells, including multijunction solar cells. To further understand the optics of optimized solar cells, we calculated the simulated electric fields and power densities in the solar cell. Fig.  4(a-c ) illustrates the cross-sectional timeaveraged electric field distributions of the device for monochromatic wavelengths of 350 nm, 550 nm, and 610 nm, along with their top-view electric field distributions presented in Fig.  4(d-f ). The yellow arrow indicated in Fig.  4(a)  shows the position where the top view electric field distributions were taken for wavelengths of 350 nm, 550 nm, and 610 nm. Corresponding power densities absorbed in the device are presented in Fig.  4(g-i ). For the shorter wavelength, in the UV region, most photons are absorbed by the front contact and interface between the front contact and perovskite layers, where a fraction of light travels to the perovskite bulk layer (Fig.  4 (a), (d) and (g)). However, for the longer wavelengths, The simulated power density profiles of the PSC are demonstrated for an incident wavelength of (g) 350 nm, (h) 550 nm, and (i) 610 nm, respectively. The simulated NH of the PSC has a diameter, depth, and period of 550 nm, 600 nm, and 600 nm, respectively. photon absorption is dominated by the perovskite layer until wavelengths longer than 600 nm (Fig.  4b, c, e, f, h  and i ). Furthermore, it exhibits decreased perovskite absorption, reflection, and parasitic absorption in the HTL/Au electrode, becoming dominant for wavelengths close to the absorber's bandgap at B625 nm. So, this shows how the NH-textured front contact contributes to light manipulation (incoupling and diffraction) and acts as a refractive index gradient. This phenomenon contributes to standing wave-like patterns and improving QE and J SC . In this work, the study focused on the various engineering approaches to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs. The research emphasized composition engineering, interface engineering, device engineering, and photon management as crucial factors contributing to PSCs' performance. It was highlighted that the selective choice and optimization of inorganic hole and electron transport layers, along with the addition of bromine (Br) into the perovskite structure, can significantly enhance the stability of PSCs. Furthermore, the use of mixed halides and interface engineering was found to reduce ion migration and improve FF and stability. The study also emphasized the importance of device engineering, interface engineering, encapsulation, and device architecture design in enhancing PSCs' overall robustness and longevity. The effectiveness of these approaches was further validated through rigorous experimental testing, affirming their potential for practical applications. Furthermore, the inorganic perovskite CsPbIBr 2 , with a bandgap of around 2.05 eV, is advantageous for multi-junction solar cell and image sensor configurations due to its superior stability, reduced nonradiative recombination losses, and ability to achieve high V OC .  15, 35, 42  In multi-junction solar cells, a larger bandgap contributes to a high V OC in the top cell, enhancing the total voltage and efficiency of the device. Mixed-halide perovskites CsPbIBr 2 exhibit better thermal and environmental stability than their pure iodide counterparts, and adding bromine can improve stability.  35  Likewise, a larger bandgap of perovskite CsPbIBr 2 can reduce non-radiative recombination losses, leading to higher internal QE and improved overall performance.  43  Interestingly, such high bandgap perovskite materials like CsPbIBr 2 can be more efficient under indoor lighting conditions. They can be used to create semi-transparent solar cells suitable for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) applications such as windows and facades. 
 Conclusions We have proposed a promising device design for CsPbIBr 2 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to achieve high performance in terms of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and device stability. To thoroughly investigate this device, we employed rigorous multiphysics numerical solvers that integrate finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) and finite element method (FEM) techniques with the particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Our initial findings indicate that the proposed CsPbIBr 2 PSC exhibits a J SC of 13.44 mA cm À2 , V OC of 1.53 V, and FF of 80.6%, resulting in a PCE of 16.44%. Overall, CsPbIBr 2 perovskites show great potential in photovoltaic technologies and could revolutionize solar energy harnessing with further research and development and a deeper understanding of the underlying physics of solar cells. This paper addresses the challenges that CsPbIBr 2 PSCs face and proposes constructive solutions to overcome them.

Title: Revealing the Full Potential of CsPbIBr 2 Perovskite Solar Cells: Advancements Towards Enhanced Performance

S1. Optical Modeling: Power Density, Quantum Efficiency, and Short-circuit 
 Current Density Calculations The FDTD optical simulation allows for determining electric field distribution within the perovskite solar cell (PSC) structure. Hence, the total electron-hole generation rate and power density profiles in the device can be calculated. The total generation rate (GR Total ) using electric field, E(x,y,z) is calculated by 𝐺𝑅 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 (𝜆) = 𝜀 '' ∫ |𝐸(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧)| 2 × ℎ 𝑑𝜆 1 where, ε '' is the imaginary part of the relative permittivity, ε r =(n-ik)  2  , where n is the refractive index, and k is the extinction coefficient of the perovskite absorber. And h is the Planck's constant. The time-averaged power density absorbed within the PSC structure can be computed by 𝑄(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧) = 1 2 𝑐𝜀 0 𝑛𝛼|𝐸(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧)| 2 2 where, is the speed of light in free space, is the permittivity of free space, is the 𝑐 𝜀 0 𝑛 refractive index of the material and is the electric field distribution. is the absorption 𝐸 𝛼 coefficient which is related to extinction coefficient of the material as given by α=4πk/λ, where λ is the wavelength. Based on the power density, the quantum efficiency (QE) of the PSC is calculated by 𝑄𝐸(𝜆) = 1 𝑃 𝑂𝑝𝑡 ∫ 𝑄(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧)𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑦𝑑𝑧 3 where, is the optical input power of the sun. The QE is defined as the ratio of 𝑃 𝑂𝑝𝑡 photons absorbed by the perovskite layer divided by the total number of photons incident to the solar cell. Furthermore, photon absorption in the perovskite absorber only contributes to the QE, and photons absorbed by other layers are considered to be parasitic absorption. The short-circuit current density (J SC ) can be calculated by 𝐽 𝑆𝐶 = 𝑞 ℎ𝑐 ∫ 𝜆 × 𝑄𝐸(𝜆) × 𝑆(𝜆)𝑑𝜆 4 where, q is the electron charge and is the solar spectral irradiance (AM1.5G). 
 𝑆(𝜆) Photons absorbed by the perovskite layer contribute to the J SC , and photons absorbed by all other layers do not. 
 S2. Electrical Modelling: Current-Voltage Relationship In the FEM approach, non-linear Poisson's, continuity, and drift-diffusion equations are engaged for the calculations. The charge density (ρ) and the electron and hole current densities (J n , and J p , respectively) can be expressed by 5 𝜌 = 𝑞(𝑛 -𝑝 + 𝑁 𝐷 + 𝑁 𝐴 ) 6 𝐽 𝑛 =-𝑞𝜇 𝑛 𝑛𝐸 + 𝑞𝐷 𝑛 ∂𝑛 ∂𝑥 7 𝐽 𝑝 =-𝑞𝜇 𝑝 𝑝𝐸 -𝑞𝐷 𝑛 ∂𝑝 ∂𝑥 𝐽 = 𝐽 𝑛 + 𝐽 𝑝 where, n and p are electron concentration and hole concentration, respectively. N D and N A are donor density and acceptor density, respectively. μ n and μ p are electron and hole mobilities, respectively. E is the electric field. D n,p =µ n,p (KT/q) are electron and hole diffusion constants. The electron-hole pair generation rate was used as an optical input for the FEM simulation, which was realized from the FDTD optical simulation. The generation rate for electrons and holes was kept constant with the total generation rate (G Total = G n = G p ). Furthermore, both radiative recombination (R rad ) and nonradiative recombination, which are auger recombination (R auger ), Shockley-Read-Hall recombination (R SRH ), and surface recombination (R surface ) rates, were considered for the investigation. The close boundary conditions were applied to the simulation environment, where ITO or doped ZnO and Ag metal contacts were designated as anode and cathode, respectively. To attain the J-V curve, the voltage swipe ranged from 0 to 1.6 V with a step size of 0.02 V. Next, the photovoltaic performance parameter values from the J-V characteristic curve can be determined. Afterward, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and fill factor (FF) of the solar cell can be calculated by 8 𝑃𝐶𝐸 = 𝑃 𝑀𝑃𝑃 𝑃 𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡 = 𝐽 𝑆𝐶 × 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 × 𝐹𝐹 𝑃 𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡 9 𝐹𝐹 = 𝑃 𝑀𝑃𝑃 𝑃 𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡 = 𝐽 𝑀𝑃𝑃 × 𝑉 𝑀𝑃𝑃 𝐽 𝑆𝐶 × 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 where, P MPP is the power at the maximum power point (MPP) of the solar cells.
