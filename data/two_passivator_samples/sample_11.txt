Title: Green Solvent Strategies toward Sustainable Perovskite Solar Cell Fabrication
Remarkable advancements have been made in the field of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) since their inception, leading to an impressive 26.1% power conversion efficiency (PCE).  [1]  Researchers have been dedicated to enhancing the efficiency, [2]   modularity, [3]  and reproducibility [4]  of PSCs, bringing them closer to potential commercialization. Nevertheless, there are significant sustainability challenges, particularly regarding the environmental impact and human health risks associated with PSC fabrication. Currently, PSC fabrication relies predominantly on solventbased processes, which offer several advantages, such as cost, processability, high-throughput production, and scalability for large-area manufacturing. However, most solvents used for PSC fabrication are highly hazardous. [5]   The use of these solvents raises concerns, poses challenges for large-scale manufacturing, and impedes the commercialization of PSCs. Various guidelines and organizations have sought to categorize solvents based on their safety, health, and environmental impacts with the aim of identifying more environmentally friendly alternatives. [6]  However, differences in classifications among these guidelines underscore the critical importance of careful solvent selection. Life cycle assessments (LCA), including quantitative environmental impacts throughout production, have also analyzed the impact of using various solvents in PSC fabrication. [7]  Notably, certain solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), have shown a pronounced impact on human health, whereas others, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), exhibit relatively minimal effects on both health and the environment during the perovskite layer deposition process. [7a]   To address these challenges, significant efforts have been devoted to exploring and adopting greener solvents as substitutes or complementary components to address the environmental and health concerns associated with solvent-based PSC manufacturing. It specifically addressed the toxicity issues surrounding the solvents used in PSC fabrication and delved into recent studies focusing on three key aspects: green solvents for perovskite precursors, antisolvents, and charge transport layers. This comprehensive review aims to shed light on the progress made, hurdles encountered, and potential for a more sustainable future for PSC fabrication. 
 Toxicity of Solvents Currently, PSCs are predominantly fabricated using solventbased processes because of their cost-effectiveness, simplicity, high yield, and suitability for large-area production. As illustrated in Figure  1 , various solvent-based methods, such as spin coating, vapor-assisted processes, blade coating, inkjet printing, and slotdie coating, have been employed for the main layers (i.e., the perovskite layer and charge transport layer [CTL]) to achieve high-quality PSCs. These solvent-based technologies play a crucial role in determining the quality and processability of the deposited film and the properties of the solvent itself, including
The shift towards ecofriendly solvents in perovskite solar cell (PSC) production represents a significant leap towards sustainable renewable energy generation, effectively addressing concerns related to the harmful nature of conventional solvents employed in PSC manufacturing. This review assesses the toxicity of traditional solvents utilized in the PSC fabrication process as well as recent studies and challenges related to substituting toxic solvents with less harmful or green alternatives. Although considerable efforts have been made to adopt greener solvents, this review underscores the variations in evaluations based on specific criteria, highlighting the need for thorough consideration to ensure the viability and sustainability of each solvent replacement. This study offers a comprehensive exploration of the transition to greener solvents in PSC fabrication and elucidates the associated challenges and opportunities in this pivotal shift towards a more environmentally sustainable approach to renewable energy production. viscosity, donor number, vapor pressure, polarity, and boiling point. They also have a significant impact on film formation and, consequently, photovoltaic (PV) performance. Careful consideration is required when preparing the precursor solvent for the perovskite layer, because of the low solubility of the precursor salts. Perovskite precursor solutions contain lead halide salts (PbX 2 , X = I, Br, Cl, etc.) and organic halide salts (MAX and FAX) dissolved in coordinating organic solvents. The dissolution of lead halide salts in solvents is challenging and limits the choice of suitable solvents. Polar aprotic solvents coordinated with PbI 2 are commonly used to prepare perovskite precursors. These polar aprotic solvents, including DMF, DMSO, γ-butyrolactone (GBL), and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), serve as electron donors that can coordinate with the electron acceptor in Pb 2þ , resulting in a well-dissolved precursor solution. However, most of these solvents are harmful to both human health and the environment, raising significant concerns regarding their practical use in the PSC industry. The DMF, which is commonly used as a perovskite precursor solution, is considered a hazardous solvent with the potential for harm, especially through inhalation and skin contact. This recognition has prompted various chemical companies to establish regulations such as the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals to oversee the handling of such perilous substances.  [8]  Efforts have been made to categorize various solvents based on their toxicity to ensure sustainable manufacturing processes. Three primary criteria-safety (S), health (H), and environmental (E) impact-have been utilized to classify solvents into different groups.  [6]  Organizations like AstraZeneca (AZ), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and the ACS Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical Roundtable (GCI-PR) have offered guidance for the selection of greener solvents.  [6a]  It is important to note that these criteria may yield differing rankings for the same solvent due to variations in data collection, evaluation criteria, boundaries, and scoring methods. These criteria can prove immensely valuable for the thoughtful design of environmentally friendly solvent processes. The Chemical Manufacturing Methods for the 21st Century Pharmaceutical Industry (CHEM21) project has established a solvent guide based on the criteria of S, H, and E,  [6b]  as presented in Table  1 . Each criterion was scored from 1 to 10, with a higher score indicating a greater hazard level. These scores were then used to categorize each solvent into one of the three classifications: hazardous (red), problematic (yellow), or recommended (green), with each classification justified by the respective score combinations. These guidelines highlight that the solvents commonly used in PSC fabrication, such as DMF, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), NMP, and diethyl ether (DE), are considered hazardous, limiting their use in large-scale processes. Additionally, DMF, DMAc, and NMP are categorized as carcinogenic, mutagenic, or toxic for reproduction substances with the H360 label, indicating their potential harm to fertility and unborn children.  [9]  Some solvents classified as problematic in the CHEM21 guidelines are regarded as hazardous materials in other guidelines, such as AZ, GCI-PR, and GSK. For instance, toluene, which is used as an antisolvent in PSC fabrication, is classified as problematic in CHEM21, AZ, Table  1 . Comparison of solvents categorized with their hazardous scores (S: safety, H: health, E: environment) obtained from CHEM21 method.  [6b]  A high score indicates a higher level of hazard in safety, health, and the environment: green (recommended), yellow (problematic), and red (hazardous). and GSK, whereas the GCI-PR guidelines categorize toluene as hazardous. Chlorobenzene (CB), another commonly used antisolvent, has received conflicting evaluations across various guidelines. The CHEM21 and GCI-PR classify CB as a problematic substance, whereas AZ and GSK classify it as a hazardous and recommended substance, respectively. Hence, solvent selection is crucial for environmentally friendly PSC fabrication. LCA is a quantitative methodology used to evaluate the environmental impacts throughout the entire product lifecycle.  [10]  Several studies have employed LCA to assess the environmental impact of various solvents.  [7a,11]  Vidal et al. conducted an assessment of human health toxicity, and environmental impact related to the use of polar aprotic solvents in the perovskite layer deposition process, using the methodology of LCA (Figure  2 ).  [7a]  The LCA, which encompassed eight solvents (DMF, DMAc, DMSO, 1,3-dimethylimidazolidin-2-one (DMEU), GBL, 1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidin-2(1H)-one (DMPU), NMP, and tetrahydrofuran (THF)), revealed that DMF had the most significant impacts on human health, DMSO had the lowest impact on both human health and the environment. When comparing the solution-based perovskite deposition process with the CdTe (cadmium-telluride) and amorphous Si deposition processes used in other PV technologies, it was concluded that the solutionbased perovskite deposition process, even when using DMF, had the lowest impact on both human health and the environment. Despite the relatively low environmental impact of PSCs compared to that of other PV technologies, it is necessary to adopt greener solvent processes for large-scale production and commercialization. In response to concerns surrounding the use of toxic solvents, several studies have explored the adoption of greener solvents, either as replacements for toxic solvents or in combination with them, as summarized in Table  2 . 
 Green Solvent for Perovskite Precursor In the solvent-based process, selecting an appropriate solvent for the perovskite precursor can be challenging due to the low solubility of lead halide salts. As mentioned earlier, polar aprotic solvents such as DMF, DMAc, GBL, and NMP have been commonly employed because of their strong dissolving capabilities for lead salts.  [12]  However, it is crucial to note that these solvents are highly toxic, leading to research on the replacement of green solvents, as shown in Figure  3 . Hsieh et al. introduced an alternative approach using a water-based lead precursor, lead nitrate (Pb(NO 3 ) 2 ), through a sequential coating method.  [13]  This approach presents a promising alternative to hazardous solvents. In this method, Pb(NO 3 ) 2 /water was first applied through spin coating onto the TiO 2 layer. Subsequently, the coated layer was immersed in an MAI/isopropanol (IPA) solution, which was categorized as the recommended solvent. However, this sequential spin-dipping coating process is time consuming and requires ≈700 s. This resulted in poor coverage of the TiO 2 layer, leading to a lower PCE of 12.58%. Thus, a two-step spin-coating process was developed for the Pb(NO 3 ) 2 /water and MAI/IPA precursor systems, improving the perovskite layer H301: toxic if swallowed, H302: harmful if swallowed, H304: maybe fatal if swallowed and enters airways, H314: causes severe skin burns and eye damage, H315: causes skin irritation, H318: causes serious eye damage, H319: causes serious eye irritation, H332: harmful if inhaled, H336: may cause drowsiness or dizziness, H350: may cause cancer, H351: suspected of causing cancer, H360: may damage fertility or unborn child, H361: suspected of damaging fertility or the unborn child.

[14]  Recently, Zhai et al. further developed a water-based lead precursor system by adding halide-free aqueous nanofluids (NFs), resulting in an impressive PCE of 23.95%.  [15]  The perovskite formation process using the Pb(NO 3 ) 2 /water system is slower than that of the toxic PbI 2 /DMF system, potentially leading to morphological imperfections and incomplete transformation. However, halide-free aqueous NFs effectively enhanced the perovskite formation kinetics. These NFs acted as nucleating seeds and had a weak affinity for MA þ , preventing their extraction from the perovskite nuclei. Although this approach has the potential to improve the performance and sustainability of PSCs, it is essential to acknowledge that water-based systems have limitations in using lead halide salts directly in water due to their low solubility. The Hansen solubility parameter (HSPM) was used to select a green solvent system that could effectively dissolve the perovskite precursor. The HSPM comprises three distinct parameters: polarity (δP), dispersion (δD), and hydrogen bonding (δH), which describe the interactions between the solute and solvent.  [16]  These parameters are instrumental in predicting the solute's dissolution behavior in different solvents. Gardner et al. tested various solvent combinations to dissolve perovskite precursors by adjusting the volumetric ratios of GBL with green protic solvents through HSPM.  [17]  A clear perovskite solution was obtained when the GBL volumetric concentration exceeded 40% in the mixture of the perovskite precursor with GBL (Figure  4a ), and a high-quality perovskite layer was formed (Figure  4b ).

( AcOH, the PSC achieved a PV performance of 15.1% with a less hazardous solvent, whereas DMF resulted in a higher PCE of 16.7% (Figure  4c ). Additionally, the GBL/EtOH/AcOH device exhibits a PCE of 13.5%, similar to that of the reference DMF device (13.6%), after 5 min of tracking the maximum power point. Cao et al. also employed the HSPM to obtain perovskite layer using entirely green solvents.  [18]  In their study, they successfully prepared high-quality CsPbBr 3 films through a combination of green polyethylene glycol (PEG) and GBL solvents, optimizing both the HSPM and viscosity. The PSC prepared with the PEG/40% GBL mixture achieved an impressive PCE of 8.1% due to its significantly smoother surface and larger perovskite grain size, surpassing those of the DMF solvent. However, despite GBL being considered less toxic than DMF, it is subject to regulations and restrictions in many countries due to its classification as a psychotropic substance.  [19]  Thus, γ-valerolactone (GVL), a biodegradable and less toxic substitute for GBL, was utilized for preparing PSCs.  [20]  As a result, the GVL exhibited relatively modest PV performance, with a PCE of 12.91%, primarily attributed to its relatively lower values of short-circuit current ( J sc ) and fill factor (FF). Recently, Miao et al. achieved an impressive high PCE of 25.09% in PSCs using a GVL-based perovskite precursor.  [21]  The GVL-based precursor directly transformed into the α-FAPbI 3 phase due to the formation of high-valence [PbI 2 ] 2Àx , while a DMF:DMSO-based precursor went through a phase transition from α-FAPbI 3 to δ-FAPbI 3 (Figure  5a, b ). This direct formation of the α-FAPbI 3 phase resulted in a pure α-phase perovskite film without any residual δ-phase. The strong interaction between GVL and FA þ contributes to the improved storage stability of the precursor solution. Despite these advantages, GVL was limited to FAPbI 3 perovskite precursors in this study; therefore, further research is needed to explore a wider range of compositions and conditions for practical PSCs applications. Otherwise, EtOH-based perovskite precursor was reported for deposition of α-FAPbI 3 layers, achieving high PCE of 25.1%.  [22]  The FAPbI 3 perovskite precursor was prepared by simultaneously adding DMAc and alkylammonium chloride (RNH 3 Cl) to EtOH. Normally, the FAPbI 3 precursor does not dissolve in EtOH, but the addition of a Lewis base changes its solubility by facilitating the complexation between PbI 2 and PACl, as shown in Figure  5c ,d. The EtOH-based precursor was able to form a uniform thin film of α-FAPbI 3 even without requiring an antisolvent, indicating a more environmentally friendly process without the need for additional solvent treatments (Figure  5e, f  ). However, it is essential to perform high-temperature annealing to eliminate all additives such as DMAc and RNH 3 Cl, in addition to EtOH. The use of the hazardous solvent, DMAc, primarily mixed with EtOH, poses environmental safety limitations. They also fabricated the PSCs using DMSO instead of DMAc and achieved an impressive PCE of 21.3%. However, it is relatively low compared to that of PSCs fabricated with DMAc; this is relatively lower compared to the PSCs fabricated with DMAc, suggesting the need for further research into all green solvent systems with high efficiency. Another strategy for an ecofriendly process involves the use of ionic liquids (ILs), which are molten salts at room temperature.  [23]  Proritic ILs based on the MA cation were proposed as perovskite precursors with various green cosolvents such as water, acetonitrile, EtOH, and IPA exception any use of toxic solvents.  [24]  Fang et al. prepared GA 0.12 MA 0.88 PbI 3 layer using molten salt methylammonium acetate (MAAc) through blade coating.  [25]  The addition of a small quantity of MABr improved the perovskite film morphology, reduced lattice   and E ) for the solvents listed in Table  1 , based on the CHEM21 method. A greater numerical value indicates a higher level of risk. strain, increased grain size, and slightly widened the bandgap. Consequently, the PCE of the green-printed PSC reached 20.21%, with a perovskite layer over 700 nm thick. Despite the environmental advantages of the IL process, its relatively low PCE remains an obstacle for its practical utilization. 
 Green Antisolvent The quality of perovskite films is primarily influenced by factors such as the solution surface tension, convection, and solvent evaporation rate, all of which play a role in determining perovskite crystallization and grain growth. In this context, the use of antisolvents becomes particularly significant, affecting the nucleation and crystal growth of perovskites and thereby controlling the final morphology of the perovskite layer. The introduction of antisolvents induces rapid supersaturating by reducing the solubility of the precursor solute, resulting in the formation of uniform nucleation seeds and crystal growth through an intermediate adduct state.  [26]  Hence, it is crucial that the polarity of antisolvents finds a delicate balance, being high enough to effectively blend with the perovskite precursor solution yet low enough to avoid dissolving the perovskite (the ideal polarity range for antisolvents falls between 2.0 and 4.5).  [27]  Previously, CB, toluene, and DE were extensively used, but their volatile and highly toxic nature necessitates their replacement with greener solvents for a sustainable PSC process. Zhang et al. employed methoxybenzene (PhOMe), which has similar features to CB and toluene, as a green antisolvent.  [28]  The PhOMe is biodegradable, less toxic, and can be used as a fragrance or food,  [6a]  suggesting its potential as a green solvent to replace CB. The use of PhOMe as an antisolvent resulted in the perovskite with larger grains and a smoother surface than CB, leading to better PV performance with a PCE of 19.42% (PCE of PSC prepared with CB:19.08%). Ethyl acetate (EA), having a low boiling point of 77 °C, exhibits appropriate polarity of 4.4 as an antisolvent and is thus most widely used as a green anti-solvent.  [27, 29, 30]  However, the low boiling point of EA provides not only easy removal of precursor solvent resulting in pinhole-free films but also causes roughness and defects on the perovskite surfaces. Lee et al. demonstrated a halogen-free antisolvent system using EA with hexane as a less-toxic antisolvent, which effectively enhanced the perovskite quality by passivating grain boundaries and cracks through the addition of hexane.  [29]  However, the use of a bisolvent system may increase the sensitivity to working conditions such as temperature and humidity due to the differing evaporation rates of the solvents. Alkali metal cation-free PSCs containing (MAPbI 3 ) 1Àx (FAPbBr 2 ) x were prepared using a single solvent system of EA as a green antisolvent.  [30]  This optimized PSC composition and the volume of EA resulted in a high PCE of 20.93%, attributed to larger grain sizes, which in turn reduced charge trap density and recombination at grain boundaries. Various acetate-based solvents, including EA, methyl acetate (MA), propyl acetate (PA), and butyl acetate (BA), were compared for the preparation of PSCs as an antisolvent.  [31]  As shown in Figure  6a, b . the PSCs prepared with MA exhibited Reproduced with permission.  [17]  Copyright 2016, John Wiley and Sons. the highest PCE of 16.3%, with an increase in V oc , J sc , and FF. Moreover, these PSCs maintained more than 80% of their initial PCE, highlighting the advantages of using MA as a green antisolvent. The relatively high vapor pressure of MA improves the evaporation rate of the precursor solvent (DMF), and its high water solubility acts as a protective barrier, preventing moisturerelated issues and enhancing the stability of the perovskite films. Several ethers such as anisole (ANS), DE, diisopropyl ether Reproduced with permission.  [22]  Copyright 2023, Springer Nature. (DIE), and dibutyl ether (DBE) have also been explored as antisolvents in PSC fabrication.  [32]  The polarity of these ethers plays a crucial role in controlling the intermediate phase of the perovskite, with DIE demonstrating the most suitable polarity for forming a pure intermediate phase, resulting in a higher PCE of 21.26% (Figure  6c, d ). However, it's important to note that despite being considered a green solvent in this study, DIE is categorized as a hazardous substance due to its potential for peroxide formation.  [6]  Therefore, its usage in large-scale and practical applications should be approached with caution. Recently, Cho et al. introduced nontoxic SAL derived from buckwheat as an antisolvent, showcasing its semipolar properties attributed to the attached hydroxyl group.  [33]  This approach yielded a remarkable PCE of 20.23% %and long-term stability, with over 80% of its initial PCE retained after 750 h. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was employed as a green antisolvent for the fabrication of the inverted PSCs (Figure  6e-i ).  [34]  The TEOS exhibits lower toxicity than toluene and CB, resulting in a for PSCs fabricated with different antisolvents. Reproduced with permission.

These results can be attributed to the formation of a pure intermediate state due to the immiscibility of TEOS and DMSO. In addition to these solvents, various substances considered less toxic or greener solvents have been investigated as antisolvents, as summarized in Table  2 .  [35] [36] [37] [38] [39]  However, despite research on different green antisolvents, there are contradictory evaluations and challenges in achieving higher efficiency that still need to be addressed. 
 Green Solvent for CTL The charge transport layer (CTL) is a critical component of PSCs and is designated as either the electron transport layer (ETL) or hole transport layer (HTL), depending on the type of carrier it transports. Recently, one of the most widely used HTL materials is 2,2 0 ,7,7 0 -Tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9 0 -spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), which is typically dissolved in nonpolar solvents like CB, toluene, and dichlorobenzene. However, because of the toxicity of these solvents, efforts have been made to replace them with environmentally friendly alternatives. The EA, which has been previously examined as an antisolvent, was also investigated as an HTL precursor. Bu et al. employed EA as both an antisolvent and an HTL precursor solvent.  [27]  The PSCs prepared using EA in both processes exhibited a higher PCE of 19.43% than those prepared using CB. This improved PCE can be primarily attributed to the enhanced FF, indicating more efficient interface carrier transportation. Recently, a noteworthy achievement was reported in the context of PSC processing with fully green solvents, including EA as the HTL precursor, as shown in Figure  7a .  [25]  Water, MAAc, and EA served as green solvents for depositing the SnO 2 layer (ETL), perovskite layer, and spiro-OMeTAD layer (HTL), respectively, using the bladecoating method. The PSC produced using this fully green solvent process achieved an impressive PCE of 20.21%, demonstrating its potential for practical application in fully green processes. Anisole, another green solvent with lethal dose 50% (LD 50 ) of 3700 mg kg À1 , higher than the 1100 mg kg À1 LD 50 of CB, was used as a replacement for CB in depositing the spiro-OMeTAD layer (Figure  7b ).  [40]  Anisole effectively dissolved the spiro-OMeTAD, leading to a uniform and well-covered perovskite layer. The PSCs prepared with anisole demonstrated PV performance and stability comparable to those prepared with CB. Wang et al. incorporated anisole into a PCBM (ETL) precursor solution for inverted p-i-n PSCs (Figure  7c ).  [39]  They also utilized tetraethyl orthocarbonate (TEOC), which is commonly used in pharmaceutical intermediate synthesis, as a green solvent for the perovskite layer, resulting in an enhanced PCE of 18.15% (compared to CB-based PSCs at 15.38%). These results indicate the potential for environmentally friendly solvent processing during PSC fabrication. 
 Conclusion and Outlook The adoption of greener solvents in the fabrication of PSCs represents a significant step toward a more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to renewable energy production. The hazardous nature of traditional solvents used in PSC manufacturing has spurred concerns about their adverse effects on human health and the environment. This has led to the exploration of alternative ecofriendly solvents. Crafting an ideal solvent system for each fabrication step, whether for depositing the perovskite layer or the CTL, requires thoughtful consideration beyond the environmental impact. Selecting solvents for perovskite precursor solutions is challenging due to low lead halide salt solubility, leading to the prevalent use of toxic solvents like DMF, DMAc, and NMP. The utilization of HSPMs facilitates the identification of greener solvents with lower hazards and competitive performance. Exploring ionic liquids and ecofriendly options like GVL and DMSO reflects a commitment to environmentally sustainable PSC fabrication. Despite notable progress, challenges like regulatory restrictions and lower efficiency with some green solvents persist. Additional research is essential to explore solvents, enhance processing conditions, and examine a broader range of compositions, making large-scale production of efficient and ecofriendly PSCs practical. The quality of perovskite films is intricately influenced by factors like solution surface tension, convection, and solvent evaporation rate. Antisolvents play a pivotal role in regulating nucleation, crystal growth, and the final morphology of the perovskite layer. The challenge lies in achieving the optimal polarity in antisolvents, but promising green alternatives such as EA, ethers, and TEOS have emerged. These alternatives address concerns regarding the toxicity and volatility associated with conventional solvents. However, further efforts are required to explore diverse antisolvents, improve processing conditions, and investigate a broader range of compositions for practical and sustainable large-scale production of high-efficiency PSCs. For CTL precursors, the chosen solvent should dissolve the CTL without adversely affecting the predeposited perovskite layer. Numerous efforts have been dedicated to substituting traditional toxic solvents with less toxic or green alternatives, which have yielded significant outcomes. However, in some instances, evaluations diverged based on distinct criteria, underscoring the need for meticulous consideration to ensure the viability and sustainability of each approach. Moreover, for sustainability and solvent processing in the PSC industry, recent LCA studies have indicated that solvent recycling may be a requisite step to mitigate environmental impacts.  [7a,11]  However, limited research has been conducted on solvent reuse,  [12b,41]  underscoring the need for further investigation and exploration in this area. DOI: 10 10 .1002/solr.202300910
