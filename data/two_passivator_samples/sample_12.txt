ACN (acetonitrile) and IPA (isopropyl alcohol) were purchased from Energy Chemical. FAI (formamidine iodide) was synthesized in our own laboratory. SnO2 (tin(IV) oxide, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. All reagents and solvents were purchased commercially and used as received without further purification, unless otherwise stated. The synthesis of BCZ is described in Supplementary note 1. 
 Preparation of Spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution The control Spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 72.5 mg Spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 µL tBP and 17.5 µL LiTFSI solution (520 mg/ml in acetonitrile) in 1 mL chlorobenzene. And then, CPA (BCB or BCZ) was added into Spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution at different concentrations: 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1mg/mL. The optimal concentration of CPA was 0.05 mg/mL for BCB and 0.5 mg/mL for BCZ, respectively. The Spiro-OMeTAD precursor solutions were stirred in a glovebox overnight before use. The Control HTL films were fabricated by spin coating Spiro-OMeTAD precursor solutions on top of different substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s.
The PSCs were fabricated with a n-i-p device structure: glass/ITO/SnO2/perovskite/i-BABr/Control HTL w/wo CPA/Ag contact. The ITO glass substrates were cleaned with glass cleaning fluid, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 15 mins, respectively, and then dried by dry compressed air. The cleaned ITO glass was treated with UV-Ozone for 15 min to promote wettability. The SnO2 (15 wt%) nanoparticle solution was mixed with deionized water in a volume ratio of 1:3 and stirred for 5min. The solution was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates at 2500 r.p.m. for 30s and annealed at 200 ℃ for 40 min to prepare electron transport layer. After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were treated with UV-ozone again. To fabricate MA0.03Cs0.07FA0.9Pb (I0.92Br0.08)3 perovskite solution, 12.8 mg of MAI, 27.1 mg of FABr, 49.2 mg of CsI, 63.8 mg of MACl, 79.2 mg of PbBr2, 380.8 mg of FAI and 1182.4mg of PbI2 were mixed in a DMSO/DMF mixture (400 μL DMF and 1602 μL DMSO solution) and then stirred in the glove box overnight. The perovskite solution was filtered through a 0.22 µm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter before used. Perovskite films were deposited in the glovebox with ethyl acetate as the antisolvent. In detail, the well-filtered 40 μL perovskite precursor solution was dropped onto the SnO2 substrates and spin-coated at 1000 r.p.m. for 10 s and 4000 r.p.m. for 30 s. We quickly dropped 260 µL of ethyl acetate onto the substrates 20 s before the end of the program. The samples were immediately placed on a preheated hot plate and annealed at 100 ℃ for 40 mins. The i-BABr solution (2.3mg/mL in IPA) was dynamically spin coated on the perovskite film and annealed at 100°C for 5 minutes as described in the liteature  [1]  . To fabricate Rb0.05FA0.95PbI3 perovskite solution  [2]  , 1383 mg of PbI2 and 18 mg RbCl were dissolved in DMF:DMSO (9:1) solvent was spin-coated onto SnO2 at 1,500 rpm for 30 s, and annealed at 70 ℃ for 1 min, then cooled to room temperature. For FAPbI3 perovskite film deposition, the 180 mg FAI and 27 mg MACl were dissolved in 2mL IPA, the solution was spin-coated onto the PbI2 at spin rate of 1,800 rpm. for 30 s, and the perovskite precursor film was taken out from the nitrogen glove box to ambient air for thermal annealing at 150 ℃ for 15min. After perovskite formation, the samples were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box for further processing. The control or CPA-modified Spiro-OMeTAD film was deposited on top of the perovskite film by spin coating at 3000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The samples were then placed in a humidity-controlled cabinet filled with air (RH, <18%, 30 ℃) for 20 h to ensure sufficient oxidation of the doped Spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport layer before evaporation of the Ag contact. Finally, a thin layer of Ag film (~80 nm) was thermally evaporated as the contact electrode using a 0.09 cm 2 shadow mask (PD-400S, Wuhan PDVacuum Technologies Co., Ltd). For the flexible device fabrication, PEN/ITO substrates (125 μm thickness, 15 Ω sq -1 sheet resistance, Peccell Japan) were used. And the fabrication of other layers is the same as the rigid devices. For the fabrication of the large-area device, the coating of all layers is the same as the small devices, but a 1 cm 2 shadow mask was used for thermal evaporation of 80 nm Ag as back contact. 
 Characterizations The 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 500 MHz spectrometer with deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) as the solvent and teramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal reference. Mass spectra were collected using GCT-MS EI and Bruker Daltonics Biflex III MALDI-TOF Analyzer in the MALDI mode. The software of VMD was applied to map molecular surface electrostatic potential. The electron density level of Van der Waals surface was defined to be 0.001 e Bohr  -3  , and all molecular size information was calculated by Multiwfn. (For 1H NMR measurements, 5 mg BCZ with or without 15 mg FAI was dissolved in 0.5 mL deuterated DMSO.) The space charge limiting current (SCLC), capacitance-voltage (C-V), linear scanning voltage (LSV), Mott-Schottky analysis and electrochemical impedance (EIS) were performed in the dark by electrochemical workstation (CHI600E). Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurements were carried out to analyse the depth profile. A primary beam (Bi 3+ ) at 30 kV and sputter beam (Cs + ) at 1 kV were used for analysing positive and negative polarities. The J-V curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A solar simulator (SS-X50, ENLITECH, Taiwan China, 3A class) with a xenon light source (LSB-X150A0FR, ZOLIX) was used to generate the AM 1.5G irradiance (100 mW/cm 2 ). The simulated solar illumination was controlled by a calibrated crystalline Si cell. Scanning ranges from 1.2 V to -0.1 V and -0.1 V to 1.2 V with a scan rate of 0.1 V s -1 with an effective active area of 0.04 cm 2 (rigid and flexible device) and 1 cm 2 (large area device). The long-term operational stability test was measured at the maximum power point (MPP) for the unencapsulated devices (Ezhou Zhong Neng Optoelectronics Co., Ltd.). The incident photonto-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement was obtained on an IPCE measurement system (Model, QE-R, made in Taiwan, China). Capacitance-voltage measurement was conducted to study the interfacial electronic structures in devices: ( 𝐶 𝐴 ) 2 = 𝑞𝜀𝜀 0 𝑁 2(𝑉 𝑏𝑖 -𝑉) where V is the applied bias, A is the active area, e is the charge of the element, ɛ is the static permittivity of the perovskite, ɛ0 is the vacuum permittivity, and N is the carrier concentration. The X-axis intersection represents the built-in potential Vbi, and the slope reflects the carrier density of the interface  [4]  . (The devices for the above mentioned characterization are based on PSCs with a n-i-p structure: glass/ITO/SnO2/perovskite/i-BABr/control+CPA/Ag. The addition of CPA in Spiro-OMeTAD solution was 0.05 mg/mL for BCB and 0.5 mg/mL for BCZ, respectively.) Top-view optical images were taken by the Fluorescence polarizing microscope (Leica DM6000B). The scanning kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) and conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) were measured by Cypher ES (Oxford Instruments Asylum Research) via AC mode at 2.44 Hz with ASYELEC.01-R2 probe. Photoluminescence (PL) and time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained by using FLS1000 (Edinburgh instruments) with an excitation at 460 and 450 nm, respectively. (The HTL was fabricated by spin coating of the mixed Spiro-OMeTAD solution with BCB (0.05 mg/mL) or BCZ (0.5 mg/mL).) The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were collected on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550). (The solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1, 0.5, or 1 mg CPA (BCB or BCZ) in 1 mL chlorobenzene. And then, 50 µL mixture solution was diluted into 5 mL chlorobenzene.) Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed by PHI 5000 VersaProbe III with He I source (21.22 eV) under an applied negative bias of 5.0 V. The water contact angle was obtained by a video optical contact angle measuring instrument (DSA-20) with a drop of ultrapure water (1 µL). The FTIR results were recorded by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Nicolet is10) under illumination of 500W LED. (For FTIR, UPS and water contace angle measurement, the HTL was fabricated by spin coating of a mixed solutions of BCB or BCZ at 0.5 mg/mL in Spiro-OMeTAD at 3000 rpm for 30 s. For the LiTFSI/CPA film, the solutions was firstly prepared by dissolving CPA (0.1 or 0.5 mg for BCB, 0.5 or 1 mg for BCZ) and 17.5 µL LiFTSI stock solution in 1 mL chlorobenzene. Afterwards, the solutions were spin coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s to fabricate the corresponding films. The pristine LiTFSI film was prepared without CPA for reference.) XPS spectra were gotten using a Thermo-Fisher ESCA-LAB 250Xi system with a monochromatized Al Ka (for XPS mode) under the pressure of 5.0x10 -7 Pa. (For XPS measurement, the Spiro-OMeTAD solution with BCB or BCZ (0.5 mg/mL) was prepared by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s. 10nm Ag film was thermally evaporated on top of the HTL films. For LiTFSI/CPA, the film was fabrication by spin coating (3000 rpm for 30s) of a solution of LiTFSI (17.5 µl stock solution) with and without CPA (0.5 mg BCB, or 0.5 mg BCZ) in 1 mL chlorobenzene.)

BCZ-2C4Br (0.80 g, 1.52 mmol) was dissolved in triethyl phosphite (5.2 mL, 30.40 mmol) and the reaction mixture was heated at reflux for 16 h. After the mixture was cooled down to room temperature, it was poured into 200 mL petroleum ether and stirred at -70°C for several hours until no more solids precipitated out. Subsequently, the solid was filtered out and washed with petroleum ether to afford BCZ-2C4P as a yellow solid (0.76 g, 78 %).

Title: Conjugated Phosphonic Acids Enable Robust Hole Transport Layers for Efficient and Intrinsically Stable Perovskite Solar Cells
High efficiency and long-term stability are the prerequisites for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, inadequate and non-uniform doping of hole transport layers (HTLs) still limits the efficiency improvements, while the intrinsic instability of HTLs caused by ion migration and accumulation is difficult to be addressed by external encapsulation. Here it is shown that the addition of a conjugated phosphonic acid (CPA) to the Spiro-OMeTAD benchmark HTL can greatly enhance the device efficiency and intrinsic stability. Featuring an optimal diprotic-acid structure, indolo(3,2-b)carbazole-5,11-diylbis(butane-4,1-diyl) bis(phosphonic acid) (BCZ) is developed to promote morphological uniformity and mitigate ion migration across both perovskite/HTL and HTL/Ag interfaces, leading to superior charge conductivity, reinforced ion immobilization, and remarkable film stability. The dramatically improved interfacial charge collection endows BCZ-based n-i-p PSCs with a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.51%. More encouragingly, the BCZ-based devices demonstrate remarkable stability under harsh environmental conditions by retaining 90% of initial efficiency after 3000 h in air storage. This work paves the way for further developing robust organic HTLs for optoelectronic devices.
Introduction Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved impressive improvement in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in both single-junction (26.14%) and tandem devices (33.9%).  [1]  However, the unsatisfied long-term stability of functional layers associated with device degradation still limits the DOI: 10.1002/adma.202308969 scalability and practical application of this technology. Ideally, advanced encapsulation techniques could address the device deterioration caused by external factors such as moisture and oxygen.  [2]  However, the self-degradation process stemming from intrinsic ion migration and accumulation appears to be unavoidable, becoming one of the thorniest challenges to realize practical applications.  [3]  Therefore, a sensible strategy that simultaneously improves the device's efficiency and intrinsic stability is highly desired. To date, the state-of-the-art PSCs with PCEs beyond 25% are mostly fabricated with the benchmark hole conductor: 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N, N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD).  [4] [5] [6]  Due to low intrinsic hole mobility (10 -5 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) and conductivity (10 -8 S cm -1 ), Spiro-OMeTAD-based HTLs often require chemical doping by lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiT-FSI) in order to facilitate the generation of Spiro-OMeTAD •+ TFSI - radicals, and also need the addition of 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) to improve film morphology (Figure  1A ).  [7]  Currently, the doped Spiro-OMeTAD encounters several challenges in balancing the device performance and operational stability (Figure  1B );(i) the hygroscopic lithium salts and volatile tBP are sensitive to the moisture and thermal stress, which leads to severe morphological deformation and accelerated ion diffusion in the HTL  [8]  ; (ii) mobile lithium ions  (Li +  ) are prone to migrate through the HTL into perovskite layer or electron transport layer,  [9, 10]  which speeds up the perovskite degradation and interfacial carrier accumulation  [7]  ; (iii) Li + aggregation induces de-doping of Spiro-OMeTAD,  [11] [12] [13]  which deteriorates the compositional uniformity and charge conductivity of the HTLs. Meanwhile, a long air-exposure process (10-20 h) is required to achieve adequate oxidation and superior film conductivity,  [10]  which unfortunately limits the film reproducibility. Apart from the HTL doping issues, irreversible chemical reactions between perovskites and metal electrodes have also been recognized as the factors limiting the device's stability even under inert circumstances.  [14]  Under the stress of electric field, light, or heat,  [15]  the perovskite lattice is susceptible to fracture or deformation due to its inherent ionic nature, while the conventional metal electrodes (Au or Ag) are prone to diffuse. Once permeat-ing through the HTL, the generated ion species from perovskites and metal electrodes would react with each other, thereby causing severe current-voltage hysteresis and poor stability in the devices.  [16, 17]  Considering that the HTL acts as a barrier layer to prevent the ion migration between the metal electrode and the perovskite layer, a robust HTL with high film uniformity and low ion permeability is highly required for realizing scalable fabrication of n-i-p PSCs. To improve the Spiro-OMeTAD doping efficiency and mitigate its doping instability, several approaches have been explored, including the addition of acids,  [18]  doping with CO 2 ,  [19]  alternative dopants (metallic salts,  [20]  protic ionic liquids  [21]  ) and the use of dopant-free HTLs.  [22]  These interfacial engineering methods have shown positive effects in the inhibition of ion migration and enhancement of device stability.  [23] [24] [25] [26]  Unfortunately, there is a lack of strategy to simultaneously alleviate the Spiro-OMeTAD′s doping problems and prevent the intrinsic ion interdiffusion without sacrificing the PCEs. In this work, we develop a conjugated phosphonic acid (CPA) strategy to simultaneously regulate the morphological stability of Spiro-OMeTAD-based HTLs and adjust the ion-migration dynamics in the PSCs. Considering the molecules with amphiphilic groups tend to form spontaneous aggregation in the organic solution, we rationally design indolo(3,2-b)carbazole-5,11diylbis(butane-4,1-diyl) bis(phosphonic acid) (BCZ) with two orthogonal acid-terminated side chains, to enhance the ioncoordination strength in the HTLs and therefore to suppress the ion migration at the interfaces. The results show that the incorporation of BCZ in the HTL suppresses the de-doping effects, enhances the ion-immobilization ability, and achieves remarkable film uniformity, which favors improving the charge conductivity and device reliability. As a result, the HTLs based on BCZ yield a champion PCE of 24.51% in the corresponding PSCs compared to the control (20.93%), along with outstanding environmental stability. Importantly, the CPA strategy is generally applicable for different perovskite materials in both flexible and large-area devices. This study provides new insights into designing organic chelates for ion immobilization, and for developing reliable and robust HTLs toward high-efficiency and intrinsically stable PSCs. 
 Results and Discussion The introduction of medium-strong acids like alkyl phosphonic acids or acetic acids into Spiro-OMeTAD plays a critical role for promoting the oxidation of Spiro-OMeTAD, increasing the film conductivity and capturing cations (e.g., Li + , Pb 2+ , FA + , Ag + ).  [27, 28]  To simultaneously improve the device efficiency and intrinsic stability of PSCs, we herein demonstrate the design of polycyclic aromatic phosphonic acids to modulate the aggregation behavior in their bend film with Spiro-OMeTAD. Extended donating skeletons are incorporated to construct p-type semiconductors with appropriate energy levels. When applied as an interfacial layer, conjugated molecules can also effectively capture cations to prevent ion interdiffusion across the HTL.  [29]  By combining these strategies, we rationally design indolo(3,2-b)carbazole-5,11-diylbis(butane-4,1diyl) bis(phosphonic acid) (BCZ) as the additives in the Spiro-OMeTAD-based HTLs (Figure  1C ). For comparison, we select its monoacid counterpart, namely, 4-(7H-benzo(c)carbazol-7yl)butyl) phosphonic acid (BCB, Figure  1E ) as the reference. The detailed synthesis for BCZ is provided in Supplementary Note 1 and Figures  S1, S2  (Supporting Information). The phosphonic acid terminals could guarantee their ion-coordination functionalities. Importantly, BCZ features a larger indolocarbazole as a ladder-type conjugated skeleton with two orthogonal phosphonic acid functionalities pointed to two different directions, while BCB boasts an asymmetrical benzo(c)carbazole to realize suitable energy levels and high molecular solubility in chlorobenzene. To gain insights into the geometry and electronic structure of CPAs, molecular simulation was conducted using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP level with 6-31G as the basis set. As presented in Figure  1C, E , BCZ exhibited a calculated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of -4.86 eV in relative to -5.25 and -4.16 eV for BCB and Spiro-OMeTAD (Figure  S3 , Supporting Information). The phosphonic acid groups in both BCB and BCZ exhibited relatively high negative charge delocalization (red color), which is beneficial to form strong interactions with different cations (Li + , Pb 2+ , FA + , Ag + ). Taking advantage of these merits, we explored the ability of CPAs in the conventional HTL (consisting Spiro-OMeTAD, LiTFSI, and tBP) to accelerate the oxidation, regulate the doping stability of Spiro-OMeTAD and inhibit the ion migration through the HTLs. Notably, BCB is an amphiphilic molecule composed of a hydrophilic end (phosphonic acid group) and a hydrophobic terminal (benzo[c]carbazole skeleton). Such structured molecules appear to form aggregates in which the water-affinity hydrophilic groups are located at the interior of the aggregate when dissolved in organic solvents (such as chlorobenzene  [30]  ). Accordingly, we measured the contact angle of the bare CPA films to study the molecular aggregation in the solid film. The BCB film is hydrophobic in nature, as indicated by a high contact angle of 133.5°( Figure  S4 , Supporting Information), which is consistent with the notion that the acidic groups tend to aggregate in the phosphonic acid-containing amphiphilic molecules.  [31] [32] [33]  Therefore, the side-to-side interaction of phosphoric acids between two BCB molecules would weaken their multiple functionalities, as illustrated in Figure  1F . In contrast, BCZ with dual phosphoric acid ends mitigates the negative effects of the self-aggregation effect even if some BCZ-based aggregates could be formed in the film (Figure  1D ). The free phosphonic acid groups of BCZ could capture Ag from the cathode, immobilize Li + from the doped HTL and capture the possible cations leaked from perovskite. We also examined the impacts of CPAs on the hydrophobicity of the doped HTLs with LiTFSI and tBP (control). Considering the high hygroscopicity of LiTFSI, the incorporation of CPAs may interact with Li + , which therefore influences the hydrophobicity of doped HTL. As seen from the evolution of film hydrophobicity, the addition of BCB (86.3°) and BCZ (90.7°) in the HTLs led to notable increases in water contact angle compared to the control (67.4°) (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information), indicating that high ion-coordination effects from CPAs improve HTL' s resistance to the moisture. A higher contact angle for BCZ-based HTLs confirms its stronger ion-immobilization ability than the BCB. The enhanced hydrophobicity of CPA-based HTLs favors the improvement of device stability under humid conditions. 
 Oxidation Promotion and Ion Immobilization To confirm the proposed mechanism of CPAs in promoting the oxidation of Spiro-OMeTAD and suppressing the Li + migration in the HTLs, we measured the UV-vis absorption spectroscopy of the Spiro-OMeTAD solutions with and without the CPAs. As shown in Figure  2A , the characteristic peak at 525 nm assigned for Spiro-OMeTAD + radicals was dramatically increased with the addition of CPAs, with the highest intensity observed for BCZbased HTLs. This indicates that CPAs could effectively promote the oxidation of Spiro-OMeTAD to generate a higher quantity of Spiro-OMeTAD + , and the BCZ exhibited a stronger catalytic effect than the BCB. In parallel, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were examined to monitor the peak changes of Spiro-OMeTAD after the addition of CPAs (Figure  2B ). The characteristic peak at 1507.5 cm -1 representing the C-N tensile vibration of the triphenylamine group in Spiro-OMeTAD was shifted to a longer wavenumber region after the addition of CPAs, which proves the generation of more Spiro-OMeTAD + in the CPAbased HTLs.  [9, 34]  We suggest that the acids catalyze the oxidation reaction of Spiro-OMeTAD by forming chemical coordination with the lithium salts. To confirm this, we fabricated the film based on the mixture of CPAs and LiTFSI to monitor the FTIR peak shift corresponding to the vibrational mode of LiTFSI.  [35]  As displayed in Figure  2C , the corresponding peak was shifted to smaller wavenumbers once the CPAs were blended into the films, confirming the chemical interactions between CPAs and LiTFSI. To reveal the reaction mechanism between phosphonic acids and Li + , X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further performed (Figure  2D, E ). It is evident that the binding energy for the Li 1s signal from LiTFSI was shifted from 56.67 to 56.42 eV after the addition of BCZ (to 56.51 eV for BCB), while the binding energy for P 2p peak in BCZ was increased from 133.31 to 133.49 eV when blended with LiTFSI. This result suggests that the proposed interaction mostly origins from the chemical coordination between Li + and the phosphoric acid groups in the CPAs. The oxidation promotion is expected to significantly improve the conductivity of the prepared HTLs. Accordingly, a four-point probe test was applied to examine the conductivity of the doped HTLs with the addition of CPAs (Figure  2F ). A lower resistivity was obtained for BCZ-based film compared to that for the BCBbased and the control ones, which could be mostly attributed to the higher doping capacity by BCZ (Figure  2A, B ). We also tested the film stability by measuring the conductivity variation during the air storage for 60 days (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information, 30 °C, 40 ± 5% relative humidity (RH)). The control film experienced a rapid increase of resistivity by almost threefold after two-month storage in ambient conditions, which could be due to Li + -aggregation-induced phase segregation and the de-doping effects. In contrast, BCZ-based films exhibited a negligible change in resistivity within the first two weeks, followed by a slight increase (<10%) in the following days. These results suggest that effective Li + immobilization enabled by BCZ favors suppressing the morphological deformation of HTLs and maintaining compositional uniformity in humid conditions. To evaluate the spatial conductivity in the CPA-modified HTLs, conductive-AFM (C-AFM) was performed (Figure  3A ). Compared with the control and BCB, BCZ-based HTLs displayed much higher current over the whole film, which further confirms higher electrical conductivity enabled by efficient p-type doping. The influence of CPAs on the optoelectronic properties of HTLs was further investigated by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy via detecting the contact potential difference. The BCZ-modified HTLs showed a lower surface roughness (Figure  S6 , Supporting Information) and much higher surface potential (1.335 V) than the control (0.923 V) and BCB (1.192 V), indicating a higher energy barrier for the electron transfer from perovskite to the BCZ-based HTLs (Figure  3B ).  [36]  Subsequently, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy was different HTLs to assess their energetic properties, as shown in Figures  S7, S8  (Supporting Information). In spite of a lower HOMO level for BCZ than BCB, the BCZ-doped HTLs (-5.67 eV) showed a deeper HOMO energy level than the ones with BCB (-5.59 eV) and the control (-5.45 eV), which could be due to the use of higher concentration of BCZ (0.5 mg mL -1 ) than BCB (0.05 mg mL -1 ) in the HTLs. A smaller energy offset between the HOMO of BCZ-modified HTLs and the perovskite (-5.86 eV) is favorable for obtaining high open-circuit voltage (V oc ) in the devices. These properties are favorable for the interfacial hole extraction and suppression of carrier recombination, which therefore contribute to high open-circuit voltage (V oc ) in the corresponding devices. We studied the effect of CPA on the morphological stability of the HTLs by placing the HTLs in a humid condition (RH = 65 ± 5%, 30 °C) for 80 h. As illustrated in Figure  3C , the control sample exhibited notable morphological deformation by showing large aggregates and pinholes across the film. This may be mostly caused by the phase segregation of LiTFSI under humid conditions. In contrast, BCZ-based HTLs appeared high uniformity without notable defects, which could result from negligible lithium aggregation owing to effective Li + immobilization by BCZ. Furthermore, the superior morphological stability for BCZ compared to BCB may also indicate double-side phosphoric acid groups are essential to strengthen the Li + immobilization. To explore the impact of CPAs on the hole extraction capacity of the HTLs, interfacial charge carrier dynamics were analyzed by photoluminescence (PL), as shown in Figure  3D , BCZ-based HTL exhibited a lower luminescent intensity across the film under a laser excitation of 532 nm, which suggests that the addition of BCZ enhances hole extraction from the perovskite. This effect was further certified by steady-state PL spectra (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information), where a much weaker PL intensity was realized in BCZ-based devices. We also examined the role of CPA on the suppression of ion migration from the perovskite during the working conditions. Previous studies have shown that the trap density at the interface is one to two orders of magnitude higher than that inside the perovskite film,  [37]  and therefore the immobilization of surface ionic defects is critical for enhancing the device stability. Considering the high sensitivity of organic cations to the ambient environment, proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) was employed to investigate the interfacial interaction between BCZ and the perovskite.  [29]  The mixture of FAI and BCZ was adopted to mimic the migrated FA + ions in the perovskite films. Previous studies have shown that the P═O moiety could form hydrogen bonds with the ammonium tails of the organic cations (P═O•••H─N), while hydroxyl groups (─OH) of phosphonic acid could easily form acid-base neutralization reaction with the amino groups (─NH 2 ) in FA. +  [38, 39]  As shown in Figure  4A , notable shifts of proton peaks (at 8.9, 8.6, and 7.8 ppm) were observed after the BCZ incorporation into FAI, suggesting the interaction causes the redistribution of electron density. To confirm the chemical interaction between Ag and CPA, the XPS spectra of the Ag 3d orbit (Figure  4B ) were analyzed. The Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 peaks in the bare Ag film were appeared at 367.65 and 373.63 eV, which were shifted to lower binding energy (Ag 3d 5/2 (367.54 eV) and Ag 3d 3/2 (373.55 eV)) in the BCZ/Ag film, indicating strong coordination between BCZ and Ag. The P 2p peak for BCZ (131.35 eV; Figure  S10 , Supporting Information) showed a shift toward higher binding energy in the film of BCZ/Ag (131.79 eV), which indicates that the phosphonic acid groups in BCZ could coordinate with Ag to form a (BCZ-Ag) polymeric film, as discussed in previous reports.  [40, 41]  The diffusion of Ag electrodes toward HTLs could cause severe damage to the underlying perovskite and thereby deteriorate the device stability. To test the Ag blocking effects from CPAs, we have measured the break-down voltage of different HTLs by applying external voltage (0-5 V) to the devices (Figure  4C ). The electrical current underwent a sudden increase when the external voltage was applied to 3.9 and 4.1 V for the control and BCB-base devices, which suggests that the devices were completely short-circuited under such conditions (Figure  S11 , Supporting Information). In comparison, a much higher break-down voltage of 4.4 V was realized for BCZ-doped HTLs under the same condition, which could be mostly attributed to synergistic effects of strong Ag-BCZ interaction as well as high film density. To further certify the Li + immobilization as well as suppressed ion interdiffusion, the depth profiling of time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) was conducted to investigate the element distribution in the aged devices based on different HTLs. The signal of PO 3 -, Li + , and Ag + ions were selected as the representative elements for CPA, LiTFSI, and Ag contact. The PbI 3 -, SnO -and InO 2 -ions were assigned to the perovskite layer, SnO 2 , and ITO substrate, respectively.  [42, 43]  As illustrated in Figure  4D , Ag + and Li + have obviously diffused into the adjacent functional layers in the aged devices, indicating the moistureinduced ion migration in the HTLs. In the BCB-based devices, similar ion-migration effects were observed, which could be related to its weak Li + immobilization due to side-to-side interaction of phosphoric acids (Figure  S12 , Supporting Information). However, ion migration was suppressed in the BCZ-based devices (Figure  4E ), as proved by the uniform distribution of Ag + and Li + in the cross-section direction (Figure  4F ). These results emphasize the critical roles of BCZ in enhancing the stability of film composition and morphology. The key contribution of BCZ in ion immobilizing highlights the necessity of double-side phosphonic acids in the CPAs for obtaining high binding affinity to the corresponding ions. 
 Device Performance and Charge Dynamics We fabricated n-i-p PSCs (ITO/SnO 2 /FA 0.9 MA 0.03 Cs 0.07 PbBr 0.24 -I 2.76 /HTL/Ag) to characterize the photovoltaic performance of CPA-based devices (Figure  S13 , Supporting Information). The concentration of CPA in the HTLs was optimized (Figure  S13 , Table  S1 , Supporting Information). Notably, the PSCs based on the BCZ exhibited much higher PCEs than those with the control or BCB at the optimal concentrations. Figure  5A  shows the J-V characteristics of the representative devices with different HTLs. Specifically, the champion devices based on BCZ exhibited a remarkable PCE of 23.49%, with a high V oc of 1.168 V, a short-circuit current density (J sc ) of 25.14 mA cm -2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 80%. These values were substantially higher than those of the control (PCE = 20.61%) and BCB (PCE = 22.04%). Meanwhile, the statistical distribution of all photovoltaic parameters of the PSCs based on BCZ indicates good device reproducibility (Figure  S14 , Supporting Information). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the optimized BCZ-based devices is shown in Figure  S15  (Supporting Information). The integrated J sc value from EQE is calculated to be 24.2 mA cm -2 , closely matching the J sc (25.14 mA cm -2 ) obtained from J-V scans. For BCB and control device, the integrated current values are ≈23.01 and 22.37 mA cm -2 from EQE measurement (Figures S16,S17, Supporting Information), which are ≈95.72% and 95.15% of J sc derived from the J-V scans, as shown in Figure  5A . The small deviation between two J sc values could be due to the difference of the light intensity or other conditions between EQE and J-V measurement, as discussed in the previous work.  [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51]  The efficiency enhancement for BCZ-based devices was mainly attributed to the significant improvement of V oc and J sc , which could be mostly resulting from the positive roles of BCZ on the defects passivation and effective doping of HTLs. To expand the versatility of this strategy, we applied CPAs in Rb 0.05 FA 0.95 PbI 3 -based PSCs. Encouragingly, the BCZ-based devices yielded a champion PCE of 24.51% with a V oc of 1.166 V, a J sc of 25.64 mA cm -2 , and a FF of 82% (Figure  5B ), which is much higher than the control (20.93%) and BCB devices (22.73%). The integrated J sc value from EQE is calculated to be 24.9 mA cm -2 (Figure  S18 , Supporting Information). Furthermore, the CPA strategy can be well applicable to flexible devices, which promoted an efficiency increase from 18.04% (the control) to 21.5% (BCZ) and 20.19% (BCB), as shown in Figure  5C . We also applied CPAs in the large-area cells (1 cm 2 ). Compared to 17.22% for the control, the best-performing large-area device based on BCZ demonstrates a remarkable PCE of up to 19.56% (Figure  5D ). The   E, F, H, I ). detailed photovoltaic parameters of the rigid, flexible, and largearea PSCs are summarized in Tables S2-S5 (Supporting Information). To understand the working mechanism of CPA in the devices, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) (Supplementary note 2) was conducted to study the carrier dynamics. The time constants based on the fitting parameters are listed in Figure  5E  and Table  S6  (Supporting Information). As displayed, BCZ-based perovskite film exhibited shorter PL decay time (17.21 ns) relative to the control (43.17 ns) and BCB (33.04 ns). This indicates efficient hole transfer from the perovskite to HTL in a BCZ-based device. We then performed the dark current to investigate the recombination-blocking effect of CPA at the perovskite/HTL interface. As shown in Figure  S19  (Supporting Information), the BCZ-based device exhibited a much lower leakage current in contrast to other counterparts, indicating more photocurrents flow through the device before direct shunting. Mott-Schottky (MS) analysis was further conducted to analyze the built-in potential (V bi ) at the interfaces (Figure  5F ).  [52]  The V bi of the devices was obtained from the interceptions of the linear region with the x-axis.  [15]  The extracted V bi of BCZ-based devices was 1.05 V, which was higher compared to those with BCB (1.01 V) and the control (0.95 V). A larger V bi in BCZ-based devices illustrates a higher driving force for charge extraction and transport at the perovskite/HTL interfaces, which is in consistent with the PL results. In addition, the carrier density at the HTL/perovskite interface could be estimated by analyzing the slope of the M-S plots. The slope of PSCs with BCZ is much higher than BCB and the control, indicating faster charge transfer at the HTL/perovskite interface along with reduced carrier accumulation. Furthermore, the space charge-limited current (SCLC) was employed to measure the trap density (N t ) of different HTLs in the hole-only devices. The N t can be obtained from the equation: N t = 2V TFL 𝜖 0 /eL 2 , where V TFL is the trap-filled voltage, e is the elemental charge and L is the distance between the electrodes. The corresponding V TFL determined from the dark I-V characteristics (Figure  5G ) were extracted to be 0.14, 0.11, and 0.08 V for the control, BCB, and BCZ-based samples, respectively. The calculated N t value for BCZ (2.15 × 10 16 cm -3 ) was lower than that of the BCB (2.96 × 10 16 cm -3 ) and the control (3.76 × 10 16 cm -3 ), implying the enhanced surface passivation at the contact interfaces, which is expected to mitigate non-radiative recombination loss and improve the V oc and FF of the corresponding solar cells.  [53, 54]  Electrical impedance spectroscopy was applied to investigate the transport and recombination resistance at the perovskite/HTL interface (Figure  5H ). The fitted parameters calculated from the equivalent circuit are listed in Table  S7  (Supporting Information). As illustrated in the equivalent circuit model, R s stands for the series resistance, and R ct represents the charge transfer resistance at the interfaces of perovskite/HTL/Ag and R rec means recombination resistance. The attained R rec values for BCZ based device was (1.83 × 10 5 Ω), which was much higher than that of BCB (1.05 × 10 5 Ω) or control (1.00 × 10 5 Ω). We also explored the carrier recombination by performing lightdependent V OC measurements (Figure  5I ). The ideality factor (n id ) can be estimated from the slope of the fitted lines,  [55]  the lower value for the device with BCZ-modified HTL (1.15) is in-dicative of a reduced charge recombination process, as compared to the cell with BCB (1.18) and control (1.27) ones. The drop in the ideality factor is consistent with the improvement in photovoltaic properties, clearly demonstrating that BCZ suppresses the recombination of charge carriers in devices. 
 Device Stability We also investigated the PCE evolution of the devices under different conditions, including the environment of air condition, high humidity, and heat. In a dry cabinet with RH 35%-45%, the unencapsulated device based on BCZ remained more than 90% of the initial performance after storage for 3000 h, while the efficiency of the control device decayed rapidly to only 30% of the initial value after 2000 h (Figure  6A ). The thermal stability of the PSCs with different HTLs was investigated by heating the unencapsulated devices at 85 ± 2 °C under an N 2 atmosphere. As shown in Figure  6B , the BCZ-based device retained over 80.67% of its initial PCE after ≈300 h, which was more stable than the control and BCB-based device. By exposing the unencapsulated devices to a high RH of ≈65 ± 5%, a notable difference was occurred in the time evolution of PCEs. As displayed in Figure  6C , BCZ-based PSCs demonstrated superior humid stability than the control, maintaining ≈80.59% of its initial PCE after ≈800 h of storage. However, the control devices exhibited a substantial PCE drop even with only 50 h of exposure. This may be attributed to the complete degradation of devices caused by external moisture invasion. It should be noted that the BCZ-based devices showed higher stability than the BCB counterparts under all conditions, which proves the rationality of our design to develop double-side phosphonic acid groups in CPAs. All these results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CPA strategy to achieve both high efficiency and impressive stability in n-i-p PSCs. 
 Conclusion In summary, we developed indolo(3,2-b)carbazole-5,11diylbis(butane-4,1-diyl) bis(phosphonic acid) as a multifunctional conjugated phosphonic acid to strengthen the morphological stability and the ion-immobilization ability of Spiro-OMeTAD based HTLs, enabling enhanced device efficiency and stability. The orthogonal diacid structure of BCZ was elegantly designed to regulate the oxidation process of Spiro-OMeTAD as well as the ion-migration behavior in the HTLs. The results reveal that BCZ favors providing effective doping uniformity and strong ion coordination, leading to superior charge conductivity, stable film morphology, and inhibited ion interdiffusion. Consequently, the devices with BCZ demonstrate superior hole collection and interfacial stability, enabling significant enhancement of PCE from 20.9% (the control) to 24.51% (BCZ). This CPA strategy is applicable for both flexible and large-area devices. Besides, the PSCs based on BCZ exhibited promising stability under different stresses, maintaining 90% of initial efficiency after 3000 hours in air storage. We believe that this CPA strategy can be generally applied to other organic hole conductors, which opens a new avenue for developing robust organic HTLs for high-performance and stable optoelectronic devices.
