Title: Thermally Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with Fluoropolymer Coating
Halide perovskites are promising as the light absorbers of solar cells with efficient solar power conversion. However, why the degradation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially at high temperatures, happens has not been completely understood to date. Herein, it is shown that evaporation of 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-tBP) from the hole transport layer (HTL) of 2,2',7,7'-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is one of possible degradation mechanisms in PSCs at a high temperature of 85 °C. In fresh PSCs, the chemical doping of the spiro-OMeTAD HTL with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) is not so efficient because of the formation of a LiTFSI:4-tBP complex in the HTL. When PSCs are placed at 85 °C, 4-tBP gradually evaporates from the HTL, resulting in the dissociation of the LiTFSI:4-tBP complex. This 4-tBP evaporation enhances the chemical doping of spiro-OMeTAD by LiTFSI and makes the hole transport level of the spiro-OMeTAD HTL deeper, thereby impeding hole extraction at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/ Au interfaces. Herein, the 4-tBP evaporation by covering PSCs with a fluoropolymer CYTOP layer, significantly improving the high-temperature durability of PSCs, is suppressed. The basic understanding obtained in this study would help promote the spread of more thermally durable PSC products in the future.
Introduction Halide perovskites have been widely used for diverse device applications, such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes, fieldeffect transistors, and laser devices,  [1] [2] [3] [4]  because they have excellent optoelectronic properties, which include tunable bandgaps, high absorption coefficients, efficient photoluminescence, high carrier mobilities, long carrier diffusion lengths, and so on.  [5] [6] [7] [8]  Especially, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained increasing interest because of their very efficient solar power conversion, and compatibility with costeffective and low-temperature solution processing. It is worth mentioning that the certified highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have increased rapidly and already reached 26.1% in a single-junction architecture and 33.9% in a perovskite/silicon tandem architecture.  [9]  Such high PCEs have been achieved just in the last decade after the first discovery of PSCs in 2009 by Miyasaka et al.  [5]  Despite high PCEs, the degradation of PSCs is still a serious issue and needs to be suppressed for the way to commercialization in the future. The PSC degradation is caused by extrinsic and intrinsic factors. For example, the extrinsic factors are moisture (water) and oxygen in air. The PSC degradation caused by the moisture is related to the hygroscopicity of a chemical dopant of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) used in the hole transport layer (HTL).  [10, 11]  Degradation of PSCs results from the migration of LiTFSI through pinholes in the chemically doped 2,2 0 ,7,7 0 -tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9 0 -spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) HTL in air.  [12]  The exposure of PSCs to light in the presence of oxygen leads to a deprotonation reaction of methylammonium cations, resulting in the formation of gaseous methylamine and superoxide species with byproducts, such as PbI 2 , PbO x , I 2 , and so on.  [13] [14] [15]  Although doping the spiro-OMeTAD HTL with oxygen in a short period of time causes a positive influence on PSC performance,  [16]  the excess oxygen doping into the spiro-OMeTAD HTL is detrimental for PSCs.  [17]  These extrinsic factors can be ruled out with reliable encapsulation to protect PSCs from air. However, the intrinsic degradation factors, such as defects, ion migration, phase instability, and so on, still exist and make PSC performance lower with time. The perovskite film morphology plays an important role in increasing PCE and operational durability of PSCs.  [18] [19] [20]  The structural defects or Schottky defects, such as halide vacancies at grain boundaries, cause significant first-order charge-carrier recombination, leading to reduced open-circuit voltages (V OC ) and a severe light-soaking effect.  [18, 19]  Ion migration has been proposed as a possible cause of a photovoltaic currentÀvoltage ( J-V ) hysteresis in PSCs; ions begin to migrate through layers once PSCs are exposed to the sunlight, and serious ion migration and accumulation at contacts impair PCEs and durability.  [21] [22] [23] [24]  The instability of the perovskite phase is caused by the high volatility of organic cations, such as CH 3 NH 3 þ .  [25]  To address this issue, cesium-based perovskite materials, such as α-CsPbI 3 , are explored.  [26]  The black-phase α-CsPbI 3 is not stable at room temperature, necessitating its conversion into the nonperovskite δ-CsPbI 3 phase.  [27]  Using excess PbI 2 can be a source of metallic lead, which is formed in the perovskite light absorber and works as a carrier recombination center.  [28]  Furthermore, it is important to note that one critical PSC degradation happens at high temperatures. The PSC degradation at high temperatures is strongly associated with the spiro-OMeTAD HTL: Au diffusion into spiro-OMeTAD  [29]  and the crystallization of spiro-OMeTAD.  [30]  Iodide ions diffusing from the perovskite layer interact with spiro-OMeTAD, causing PSC performance to decrease with time.  [31, 32]  Most high-performance PSCs reported to date contain the spiro-OMeTAD HTL with proper chemical dopants, such as LiTFSI, tris(2-(1 H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III) tri[bis-(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide] (FK-209), and 4-tertbutylpyridine (4-tBP).  [33] [34] [35]  PSCs with the chemically doped spiro-OMeTAD HTL are comparably durable under illumination at room temperature.  [36]  However, their durability at high temperatures is very poor.  [29] [30] [31] [37] [38] [39]  Additionally, reasons why the high-temperature degradation occurs in PSCs have not completely been clarified to date. It is necessary to ensure the high-temperature durability of PSCs for outdoor use in hot summer. In this study, we investigate the degradation of PSCs at high temperatures. We find that one high-temperature PSC degradation comes from the evaporation of 4-tBP from the spiro-OMeTAD HTL. In the fresh spiro-OMeTAD HTL, a LiTFSI:4-tBP complex is formed. When PSCs are placed at a high temperature of 85 °C, this LiTFSI:4-tBP complex is dissociated by the 4-tBP evaporation. Then, the LiTFSI component is left in the spiro-OMeTAD HTL, leading to a stronger chemical doping of spiro-OMeTAD by LiTFSI. Resultantly, the hole transport level of the spiro-OMeTAD HTL becomes deeper, which increases the energy barrier for hole extraction. The increased hole extraction barrier is one of the causes of the high-temperature PSC degradation. Moreover, we demonstrate that covering PSCs with a fluoro-polymer CYTOP layer prevents the evaporation of 4-tBP and, therefore, greatly improves the high-temperature PSC durability. We fabricated PSCs with the device architecture of glass substrate/indium tin oxide (ITO; ≈100 nm) electrode/SnO 2 electron transport layer (ETL; ≈30 nm)/Cs 0.05 (FA 0.85 MA 0.15 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 perovskite light absorber (≈650 nm)/chemically doped spiro-OMeTAD HTL (≈150 nm)/Au electrode (≈70 nm) (see Figure  1a  for the PSC architecture). Here, FA is formamidinium and MA is methylammonium. The spiro-OMeTAD HTL was doped with LiTFSI, FK-209, and 4-tBP. J-V curves of PSCs were measured under the simulated AM1.5 G solar illumination with a power of 100 mW cm À2 (1 sun) at room temperature. Figure  1b  shows a J-V curve measured from fresh PSCs (denoted by 0 h) in a reverse (positive to negative) voltage scan. For fresh PSCs, the PCE was ≈18.6%, the short-circuit current density ( J SC ) was ≈23.3 mA cm À2 , the V OC was ≈1.09 V, and the fill factor (FF) was ≈0.73. These parameters are the mean values calculated from ten independent PSCs fabricated in different batches. J-V curves of fresh PSCs, which were measured in the consecutive forward and reverse voltage scans, were similar (Figure  S1 , Supporting Information). Maximum power point tracking was used to discuss PCE modulation (Figure  S2 , Supporting Information). PCEs became constant within several seconds, immediately after the illumination began. The stabilized PCE was ≈18%, which nearly agrees with the PCE measured from the J-V measurements. The J SC value calculated from the integration of an incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) curve shown in Figure  S3 , Supporting Information, was ≈22.2 mA cm À2 , which is not largely different from that estimated from the J-V curve. The bandgap calculated from the IPCE onset shown in Figure  S4 , Supporting Information, was ≈1.55 eV, which agrees with the bandgap of the perovskite with the same composition.  [40, 41]  Degradation reportedly begins from defects existing in the perovskite light absorber.  [42, 43]  In this study, to investigate defect-induced degradation at a high temperature, we did not use any defect passivation method for our PSC fabrication. Contrary to our expectation, we found that the high-temperature degradation observed in this study was related to the spiro-OMeTAD HTL, which will be discussed later. For reference, PCEs of our PSCs were increased to ≈21% when defects were passivated with potassium hydroxide (KOH)  [44]  and pyridine-carbazole (PyCz)  [45]  treatments (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information). To evaluate the high-temperature durability, PSCs were stored at a high temperature of 85 °C in pure nitrogen for 3 h without illumination. J-V curve measurements were periodically performed on PSCs under the 1-sun illumination every hour after PSCs were cooled down to room temperature. Figure  1b  shows the J-V evolution of PSCs. Table  S1 , Supporting Information, summarizes the solar cell parameters at each degradation level. The PCEs decreased from ≈18.6% (0 h; fresh PSCs) to ≈14.0% (1 h), ≈11.0% (2 h), and ≈8.9% (3 h). As can be seen from Table  S1 , Supporting Information, while the V OC did not change significantly, the decrease in J SC and FF was larger, probably pointing to the reduced charge-carrier extraction. Although better high-temperature durability of PSCs has been reported,  [46, 47]  differences between the reported results and our results may be because of different device fabrication conditions and device architectures. To investigate the reason behind the observed hightemperature degradation, we fabricated electron-only devices (EODs), hole-only devices (HODs), and spiro-OMeTAD-only devices (SODs), the architectures of which are shown in Figure  2a-c , respectively. The EOD architecture was glass substrate/ITO electrode (100 nm)/SnO 2 ETL (≈30 nm)/perovskite layer (≈650 nm)/1,3,5-tris(1-phenyl-1 H benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi) ETL (≈40 nm)/LiF layer (≈0.8 nm)/Al electrode (≈100 nm). The HOD architecture was glass substrate/ITO electrode (100 nm)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) HTL (≈30 nm)/perovskite layer (≈650 nm)/ chemically doped spiro-OMeTAD HTL (≈150 nm)/Au electrode (≈70 nm). Only the spiro-OMeTAD HTL was sandwiched between the ITO electrode and the Au electrode for the SOD architecture. HODs, EOD, and SODs were placed at 85 °C in nitrogen, and then their J-V curves were measured without illumination after cooling down to room temperature. Figure  2d ,e shows the high-temperature durability of EODs and HODs. The J-V characteristics of HODs degraded while those of EODs remained unchanged. Next, we checked the high-temperature durability of SODs (Figure  2f  ). The J-V characteristics of SODs also degraded when stored at 85 °C in nitrogen. These results indicate that the degradation of PSCs at 85 °C is closely related to the spiro-OMeTAD HTL because only spiro-OMeTAD is included in SODs. From these results, we conclude that the reduced hole extraction decreases J SC and FF in our PSCs at the high temperature. In order to figure out why the high-temperature degradation occurred, we measured the hole transport level of the spiro-OMeTAD layer using photoelectron yield spectroscopy. The hole transport level of undoped spiro-OMeTAD was À5.05 eV and did not change even after heating at 85 °C in nitrogen for 3 h (Figure  3a ). As shown in Figure  3b , the spiro-OMeTAD layer, which was chemically doped with LiTFSI, FK-209, and 4-tBP, had a hole transport level of À5.20 eV before heating. This hole transport level is deeper than that of undoped spiro-OMeTAD (À5.05 eV). The chemical doping makes the spiro-OMeTAD's hole transport level deeper.  [48] [49] [50] [51]  Heating the chemically doped spiro-OMeTAD film caused the hole transport energy levels to further deepen to À5.50 eV. This means that the chemical doping is further promoted after heating the spiro-OMeTAD film. The dopant 4-tBP is likely the source of the observed energylevel modulation because 4-tBP is liquid at room temperature and more easily evaporates from the HTL, especially at the high temperature, in comparison with the other dopants.  [52]  It is known that 4-tBP forms a complex with LiTFSI.  [53]  This LiTFSI:4-tBP complex, the structure of which is illustrated in Figure  4a , would decompose because of the 4-tBP evaporation from the spiro-OMeTAD HTL when PSCs are stored at the high temperature in nitrogen (Figure  4b ). As a result, LiTFSI is left in films, enhancing the chemical doping by LiTFSI and deepening the hole transport level. This assumption can be supported by the fact that the LiTFSI-and FK-209-binary-doped spiro-OMeTAD films (without 4-tBP) have a very deep hole transport level of À5.75 eV (Figure  3c ). We assume that the existence of 4-tBP can suppress the excess chemical doping because of the complex formation with LiTFSI. It noted that photoelectron yield spectroscopy is a surface-sensitive method and the 4-tBP evaporation begins from the spiro-OMeTAD surface. Therefore, the hole transport level of the spiro-OMeTAD film interior would be different from the measured values. Heating for a longer period of time may result in the energy-level deepening even in the film interior. Furthermore, we conducted thermogravimetric (TG) measurements on chemically doped spiro-OMeTAD to confirm the 4-tBP evaporation (Figure  4c ). The spiro-OMeTAD solution (chlorobenzene) was poured into a metal pan and left to dry at room temperature overnight. The solid sample thus prepared was heated at 85 °C. Then, a change in sample weight was monitored. An 8.4% weight loss was observed from spiro-OMeTAD solid samples binary doped with LiTFSI and FK-209 (without 4-tBP). This weight loss is attributed to the evaporation of the chlorobenzene solvent from the solid sample. On the other hand, spiro-OMeTAD solid samples ternary doped with LiTFSI, FK-209, and 4-tBP exhibited a larger weight loss of ≈17.3%. The difference between these two weight losses is ≈8.9%, which would correspond to the evaporation of 4-tBP. The original spiro-OMeTAD solution contains ≈23% of 4-tBP in weight, which is smaller than the 4-tBP weight loss observed here. This may mean that 4-tBP still exists in solid samples even after heating and/or the amount of 4-tBP becomes lower during the sample fabrication. The chemically doped spiro-OMeTAD HTL of PSCs was analyzed with scanning electron microscopy in a region, where the Au electrode was not present (Figure  S6 , Supporting Information). Before heating, a continuous spiro-OMeTAD surface was formed. After heating the sample at 85 °C for 3 h,  numerous pinholes were clearly observed on the spiro-OMeTAD surface. The pinholes would be created as the result of the 4-tBP evaporation, as reported previously.  [38, 39]  The question here is whether 4-tBP can evaporate from the spiro-OMeTAD HTL covered with the 80 nm-thick Au electrode. To further investigate the 4-tBP evaporation through the Au electrode, a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) method was used. A chemically doped spiro-OMeTAD film (≈150 nm) prepared on an Au-coated quartz crystal plate. The initial frequency of the QCM without the spiro-OMeTAD film was ≈9 MHz. The frequency was decreased by ≈6800 Hz after the spiro-OMeTAD film fabrication. Based on the well-known Sauerbrey equation, this frequency shift corresponds to a mass change of ≈18 500 ng cm À2 . Considering the spiro-OMeTAD film thickness (≈150 nm) and this mass change, the spiro-OMeTAD film density is calculated at ≈1.2 g cm À3 , which seems reasonable for normal organic films. When the doped spiro-OMeTAD film was heated at 85 °C for 3 h in nitrogen, the frequency increased by ≈450 Hz (≈1230 ng cm À2 ), which is indicative of the evaporation of both chlorobenzene (solvent) and 4-tBP from films as discussed with the TG measurements. In a separate experiment, a chemically doped spiro-OMeTAD film (≈150 nm) covered with an Au electrode film (≈80 nm) was prepared on an Au-coated quartz crystal plate, resulting in a decrease in frequency by ≈54 400 Hz (≈148 000 ng cm À2 ). The Au film density calculated after the subtraction of the spiro-OMeTAD frequency shift was ≈16.2 g cm À3 , which was lower than the widely known 19.3 g cm À3 , probably because of the existence of many grain boundaries in vacuum-deposited Au films as discussed later. This two-layer sample of spiro-OMeTAD and Au was heated in the same way, causing the frequency to increase by ≈430 Hz (≈1170 ng cm À2 ). Because the frequency increases caused by heating are very similar in uncoated (≈450 Hz) and Au-coated (≈430 Hz) spiro-OMeTAD films, the presence of Au on top of the spiro-OMeTAD layer does not impede the 4-tBP evaporation. As shown in Figure  S7 , Supporting Information, vacuumdeposited Au films have a grain structure, with a grain diameter of ≈200 nm. Therefore, we assume that the 4-tBP evaporation through the grain boundaries of the Au electrode is possible. When the chemical doping by LiTFSI proceeds as the result of the 4-tBP evaporation at the high temperature, we believe that the hole transport in bulk spiro-OMeTAD films is enhanced. To more precisely evaluate the electrical characteristics of bulk spiro-OMeTAD films, a four-point probe geometry was used (see Figure  5a ). For this, a chemically doped spiro-OMeTAD film was prepared on a fused silica substrate in the same way used for the PSC fabrication. On top of the spiro-OMeTAD-coated substrate, two Au pads are formed by vacuum deposition through a shadow mask; the channel length was 0.5 mm and the channel width was 1 mm. In between the two Au pads, two small Au electrodes were installed to read actual voltages without the influence of contact resistance. Figure  5b  shows J-V curves of chemically doped spiro-OMeTAD samples, which were measured at room temperature before and after heating at 85 °C in nitrogen. J-V slopes apparently increased after the high-temperature storage, which indicates the enhanced hole transport in bulk spiro-OMeTAD films because of the promoted chemical doping. However, this observation is contrary to the decreased current densities of previously discussed PSCs (Figure  1b ), HODs (Figure  2e ), and SODs (Figure  2f  ). When PSCs, HODs, and SODs are heated, the energy-level mismatching at the interfaces with spiro-OMeTAD occurs (in other words, increased contact resistance) because of the deepened hole transport level, thereby decreasing the hole extraction out of devices (Figure  5c ). The energy levels of the perovskite layer (À5.40 eV) and the Au electrode (À5.10 eV) in this figure are taken from the literature.  [54]  The contact resistance issue is negligible with the four-point probe geometry used in this study, resulting in enhanced hole transport. We conclude that the increased hole extraction barrier, caused by the 4-tBP evaporation, is one of the reasons for the PSC degradation at high temperature. Although the 4-tBP evaporation is a well-known fact,  [38, 39, 52, 55]  a relationship between the 4-tBP evaporation and the PSC performance in terms of the energylevel modulation as revealed in this study has never been reported so far. Although the exact role of 4-tBP in PSCs remains unclear, its negative effects on device performance have been reported. As we mentioned earlier, the 4-tBP evaporation at elevated temperatures leads to the formation of detrimental voids in the HTL.  [38, 39]  Corrosion of the perovskite by pyridine additives  [56]  and formation of pyridinated products in the HTL  [57]  are known to decrease device performance. On the other hand, positive effects of using pyridine-based materials in PSCs have been demonstrated. Lewis bases of pyridine act as a defect passivation material, thus reducing carrier recombination at the perovskite/ HTL interface.  [58]  These positive effects become ineffective as the result of the 4-tBP evaporation, which is another reason for the decreased performance at high temperature. To reduce the 4-tBP evaporation, we covered the surfaces of SODs and PSCs with a fluoropolymer CYTOP layer by drop casting. The material CYTOP, the molecular structure of which is shown in the inset of Figure  6a , is commercially available from AGC Inc. and has a molecular weight of 150 000-200 000.  [59]  Because CYTOP is dissolved in fluoro-solvent, a CYTOP layer can be formed without the dissolution of the underlying and, therefore, widely used for organic-based devices. For example, CYTOP works as an excellent insulating layer in organic field-effect transistors.  [60, 61]  CYTOP-coated devices were placed in a vacuum overnight to dry. The drop-cast CYTOP thickness was tens of micrometers. We confirmed that the PSC characteristics were unchanged by covering with CYTOP. We demonstrated that covering with CYTOP could greatly suppress the J-V degradation of SODs (Figure  6a ) and PSCs (Figure  6b ) when stored at 85 °C in nitrogen. We believe that the suppressed high-temperature degradation arises from the reduced 4-tBP evaporation by the CYTOP covering since it is impossible to overcome other degradation processes happening inside PSCs by just covering with CYTOP. The grain boundaries of the Au electrode may be filled with CYTOP to physically reduce the 4-tBP evaporation (see Figure  S8 , Supporting Information). As can be seen in Figure  6c , PCEs were more thermally durable in CYTOP-covered PSCs than in uncovered PSCs in a short time scale of up to 3 h. Additionally, CYTOP-covered PSCs maintained ≈90% of the initial PCE after 96 h of heating at 85 °C in nitrogen (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information). The operational durability of PSCs was evaluated under illumination from a 3000 K white light-emitting diode (LED) with an intensity of 100 mW cm À2 at a high temperature of 85 °C. The operation condition was at a maximum power point. Before the durability measurements, PSCs were encapsulated with a glass cap, UV-curing resin, and a desiccant sheet to protect devices from oxygen and moisture in air. It is clear from Figure  6d  that CYTOP-covered PSCs had better operational durability than uncovered PSCs did. This means that our CYTOP covering method is effective in improving the high-temperature durability even under illumination. Next, FAPbI 3 -based PSCs, the architecture of which is the same as Figure  1a  except the perovskite layer composition, were fabricated. The FAPbI 3 perovskite layer fabrication condition was referred to the literature  [62]  while the other layers were fabricated with the same conditions used for the fabrication of Cs 0.05 (FA 0.85 MA 0.15 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 -based PSCs. The mean PCE of FAPbI 3 -based PSCs was ≈22% and almost unchanged after the CYTOP coating (Figure  S10 , Supporting Information). The operational durability test was carried out on FAPbI 3 -based PSCs using the same conditions described in the previous paragraph (the 3000 K 100 mW cm À2 white LED illumination at 85 °C), resulting in that the operational durability was better in CYTOP-covered PSCs than in uncovered PSCs (Figure  6e ). Additionally, FAPbI 3 -based PSCs had slower PCE degradation compared with Cs 0.05 (FA 0.85 MA 0.15 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 -based PSCs discussed earlier, probably because the MA component with higher volatility is absent in FAPbI 3 . We demonstrate that our CYTOP covering method can be used to increase the durability of PSCs with the other perovskite composition FAPbI 3 . As we discovered in this study, the 4-tBP evaporation causes a negative impact on the high-temperature durability of PSCs. Therefore, we investigated how the lack of use of 4-tBP for the spiro-OMeTAD HTL fabrication affected its energy level and PSC performance (Table  S2 , Supporting Information). Spiro-OMeTAD films binary doped with LiTFSI and FK-209 had a too-deep hole transport level of À5.75 eV. The hole transport level was also too deep (À5.75 eV) for spiro-OMeTAD films unary doped with LiTFSI only. Therefore, these two doped spiro-OMeTAD films did not work well as the HTL of PSCs (Table  S2 , Supporting Information). On the other hand, unary doping FK-209 alone into the spiro-OMeTAD HTL led to a shallower hole transport level of À5.20 eV, which is the same as the hole transport level of spiro-OMeTAD ternary doped with LiTFSI, FK-209, and 4-tBP. Nevertheless, PSCs unary doped with FK-209 only had lower performance (Table  S2 , Supporting Information). Very similar results have been reported; ternarydoped PSCs had the best performance in comparison with unaryand binary-doped ones.  [63]  Although 4-tBP is easier to evaporate from films,  [38, 39, 52, 55]  adding 4-tBP into the spiro-OMeTAD HTL is necessary for the fabrication of PSCs with higher performance. For example, 4-tBP plays an important role in making the spiro-OMeTAD HTL smoother without pinholes.  [64, 65]  Spiro-OMeTAD radical cations can be formed by electrontransfer reaction with LiTFSI in the presence of oxygen.  [63, [66] [67] [68]  During solution stirring for several hours and next spin coating, this oxygen-initiated radical cation formation likely happens in our spiro-OMeTAD samples because a trace amount of oxygen is present even in a nitrogen glove box used for the spiro-OMeTAD layer fabrication. It is known that FK-209 can help the aforementioned reaction without the need of oxygen.  [63, 68]  We believe that the spiro-OMeTAD oxidation by LiTFSI is largely suppressed in 4-tBP-containing films because of the LiTFSI:4-tBP complex formation.  [53]  At higher temperatures, 4-tBP gradually evaporates from films as revealed in this study, resulting in the dissociation of the LiTFSI:4-tBP complex. In that case, LiTFSI begins to work as a stronger dopant to form more spiro-OMeTAD radical cations with the help of oxygen contained in films or iodide ions coming from the perovskite layer. There are many papers showing similar energy-level deepening in spiro-OMeTAD by increased chemical doping.  [48] [49] [50] [51]  This may be because of forming radical cations with larger valency, like dior trivalent cations. Reorganization of spiro-OMeTAD molecules and/or redistribution of dopants at higher temperatures, which can promote the cation formation, are another source of the energy-level modulation. In conclusion, we find that the 4-tBP dopant evaporation from the spiro-OMeTAD HTL at a high temperature of 85 °C is one possible degradation mechanisms of PSCs in addition to other degradation mechanisms reported thus far.  [56] [57] [58]  Specifically, the 4-tBP evaporation enhances the chemical doping of spiro-OMeTAD by LiTFSI because of the LiTFSI:4-tBP complex dissociation. Therefore, this enhanced chemical doping makes the hole transport level of the spiro-OMeTAD HTL deeper, impeding hole extraction at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au interfaces although the bulk hole transport through the spiro-OMeTAD HTL is enhanced. Moreover, we demonstrate that covering PSCs with CYTOP suppresses the 4-tBP evaporation, which greatly improves the high-temperature PSC durability. About 90% of the initial PCE is kept in CYTOP-covered PSCs after 96 h of heating at 85 °C while uncovered PSCs lose half of the initial PCE just after heating for 3 h. These findings obtained in this study, such as the suppressed 4-tBP evaporation and improved high-temperature durability with the CYTOP covering, will lead to the establishment of basic science in perovskitebased devices and open a way to the realization of more thermally durable PSCs, contributing to future commercialization.

The precursor solution was stirred at 70 °C for 1 h and then filtered with a 0.2 μm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter before use. A precursor solution for the HTL was prepared by dissolving 36.5 mg spiro-OMeTAD in 0.5 mL CB. This solution was mixed with 9 μL of a LiTFSI solution (520 mg mL À1 in acetonitrile), 14.5 μL of an FK-209 solution (300 mg mL À1 in acetonitrile), and 15 μL of 4-tBP. The spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution was also filtered with a 0.2 μm PTFE filter before use. Device Fabrication: Glass substrates coated with a prepatterned ITO layer with a thickness of ≈100 nm (Atsugi Micro) and a sheet resistance of ≈10 Ω sq À1 were cleaned sequentially by ultrasonication in detergent, pure water, acetone, and isopropanol each for 15 min and then subjected to UV-ozone treatment for 15 min. Next, the SnO 2 ETL was prepared on the ITO layer by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s from an aqueous SnO 2 colloidal solution, which was diluted with pure water (1:3 in volume). The SnO 2 ETL was annealed at 150 °C for 30 min and then subjected to UV-ozone treatment for 15 min. The perovskite layer was spin coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s and then at 6000 rpm for 30 s. Ten seconds before the end of the substrate rotation, 120 μL of CB was dropped onto the spinning substrate. Next, the perovskite layer was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. The spiro-OMeTAD HTL was fabricated on the top of the perovskite layer by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The SnO 2 ETL was deposited in dry air while the perovskite layer and spiro-OMeTAD HTL were fabricated in nitrogen. Finally, an ≈80 nm-thick Au electrode was thermally deposited in a vacuum at a base pressure of 10 À4 Pa. The Au deposition rate was ≈0.1 nm s À1 . A CYTOP solution was dropped and spread to completely cover the PSC region in nitrogen and then dried overnight in a vacuum. Fabricated PSCs were encapsulated using a glass lid and UV-curing sealant without exposure to air. HODs, EODs, SODs, and four-point probe devices were fabricated with the aforementioned conditions. For HODs, PEDOT:PSS was spin coated at 4,500 rpm for 30 sec and then annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. For EODs, TPBi, LiF, and Al were vacuum deposited at rates of 0.1, 0.01, and 0.1-0.4 nm s À1 , respectively. Characterization: J-V measurements were performed on PSCs using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source unit under simulated AM1.5G solar illumination from a Xe lamp-based solar simulator (SRO-25 GD, Bunkokeiki). The scan rate was 0.1 V s À1 . The active area of the PSCs was defined to be 3.24 mm 2 (1.8 Â 1.8 mm 2 ) using a black shadow mask while the original device area defined by an overlap of the ITO and Au electrodes was 4 mm 2 . Before each J-V measurement, the lamp power was carefully calibrated at 100 mW cm À2 (1 sun) using a crystalline Si reference cell with an amorphous Si optical filter (Bunkokeiki), which was certificated by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology of Japan. For dark high-temperature durability measurements, devices were placed at 85 °C in nitrogen. Before each J-V measurement under the simulated solar illumination, devices were cooled down to room temperature. J-V curves of HODs, EODs, and SODs were measured in the same way except for no illumination. In separate experiments, the alternative operational durability of encapsulated PSCs was measured under the 3000 K 100 mW cm À2 white LED illumination at a high temperature of 85 °C with a maximum power point tracking method (PAS-100, System Engineers). Four-point probe devices were evaluated using a softwaremodified semiconductor parameter analyzer (B1500A), which was connected to a digital multimeter (M3500A, PICOTEST). Hole transport levels of spiro-OMeTAD films were obtained using photoelectron yield spectroscopy (AC-3, Riken Keiki). TG measurements were carried out on spiro-OMeTAD solid samples using a Bruker TG-DTA2400SA analyzer. For QCM measurements, a QCM TRIAL KIT (PIEZO PARTS) was used.
