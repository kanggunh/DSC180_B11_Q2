Title: Simultaneously enhancing hole extraction and defect passivation with more conductive hole-selective self-assembled molecules for efficient inverted perovskite solar cells â€ 
Suppressing the interfacial energy losses of the buried hole-selective layer (HSL) is essential to upgrade the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this regard, innovations in hole-extraction materials featuring self-assembled molecule (SAM) characteristics show great potential. Herein, two SAMs of C-2PACz and S-2PACz based on phenyl-and thienyl-substituted carbazole units, respectively, were developed to serve as multifunctional HSLs. The pendant phenyl and thienyl units increase the dipole moment of the SAMs as compared to that of the standard control 2PACz, which was used to efficiently modulate the work function of ITO and form desirable energy level alignments with a perovskite absorber. C-2PACz and S-2PACz SAMs possess greater capability to passivate the interface defects of a perovskite absorber, especially S-2PACz, due to the electrostatic interaction between the under-coordinated Pb 2+ and S of thiophene. C-2PACz and S-2PACz with increased conjugation also show higher conductivity to promote charge transport. Moreover, HSLs based on C-2PACz and S-2PACz form a template for the crystallization of the perovskite layer to achieve more dense and uniform crystalline grains and higher crystallinity. Owing to the abovementioned synergistic effects, C-2PACz-and S-2PACz-derived solar cells exhibit low non-radiative recombination loss, higher PCEs and enhanced stability compared to the control device with 2PACz.
Introduction Organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as the most popular photovoltaic technology because of their unique advantages, such as strong light absorption, good defect tolerance, low non-radiative recombination losses, and flexible processing.  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  For a long time, the highest efficiency of PSCs have been achieved using n-i-p structures based on mesoporous scaffolds (i.e., TiO 2 layers),  [6] [7] [8]  and the PCEs of planar inverted PSCs evidently lagged behind.  9, 10  However, inverted p-i-n PSCs (i-PSCs) possess clear superiorities of low-temperature fabrication, low current-voltage hysteresis, high photostability and dopant-free HSLs.  [11] [12] [13]  Therefore, i-PSCs carry great potential in constructing tandem and flexible large-area solar cells,  [14] [15] [16]  and the efforts to improve the performance of i-PSCs are constantly active.  [17] [18] [19] [20]  In view of the similarity of a sandwiched and tunable perovskite absorber between i-PSCs and the high-efficiency n-i-p PSCs, the interfaces between the perovskite layer and charge-selective layer significantly account for the efficiency deficits.  [21] [22] [23]  The buried interface is vulnerable to microcracks that lead to a high density of trap states and nonradiative recombination losses.  24  Moreover, the buried HSL has to perform as a template to modulate the crystallization process of the top perovskite layer.  25  Accordingly, the buried holeselective layer is bound to be optimized. The typical hole transport materials used in i-PSCs are organic polymers, such as (poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine]) (PTAA) and PEDOT:PSS,  1, 10  or inorganic metal oxides,  26  e.g., NiO x . Organic polymers are expensive and detrimental to device stability because of structural defects induced by their acidic (e.g., PEDOT:PSS) or highly hydrophobic nature (e.g., PTAA).  21  In addition, their energy levels inadequately match those of the perovskite layer, which adversely affects hole extraction and causes insufficient open-circuit voltages (V OC s) in solar cells.  22, 27  NiO x conducts charges through intrinsic Ni vacancies. Furthermore, high-quality NiO x HSLs usually involve high-temperature annealing that complicates fabrication and restricts flexible applications.  28  Although low-temperature synthesized NiO x nanoparticles can circumvent such an issue, the intrinsic drawbacks of redox reactions of NiO x with perovskites and the self-aggregation influence of NiO x nanoparticles still persist.  21  Typical methods used to reduce interfacial defects and recombination loss include the insertion of an additional buffer layer between the absorber and HSL  22, 29  or doping NiO x with metal cations or organic molecules.  30, 31  However, the resulting products likely encounter multi-layer compatibility and dopant-related or stress-imposed morphological instability.  29  An ideal HSL should satisfy the following requirements: economy of cost, enhancement of efficiency and stability, and compatibility with high throughput production.  18  Furthermore, it is undoubtedly preferred to integrate the desired properties of HSL in a single-component layer, avoiding the treatment of doping or interface modifications.  32  Self-assembled molecules (SAMs) are unique in their properties of minimal parasitic absorption, low material consumption, and good conformal coverage to an irregular surface.  33  An ultra-thin layer of SAM is intrinsically conducive to decreasing series resistance. The strong anchoring onto a transparent conductive oxide substrate (e.g., ITO) can be used to strengthen the adhesion of SAM on ITO, and thus show high stability to mechanical stress and various solvent processing.  34  In 2018, Albrecht S. and co-workers demonstrated an efficient carbazolebased SAM as the HSL in i-PSCs.  35  Subsequently, they developed optimized SAM molecules, such as 2PACz, MeO-2PACz, and Me-4PACz, to construct high-performance tandem solar cells.  23, 36  Thereafter, SAMs as the buried HSL of i-PSCs prompted many research efforts.  37  Jen A. K.-Y. et al. developed SAMs by fusing one or two benzene rings onto a carbazole unit, respectively, to enlarge the molecular dipole moment and strengthen the p-p interaction.  38  Gao P. et al. replaced the aliphatic linker of MeO-2PACz with a benzene ring to improve the stability of SAMs and solar cells against ultraviolet (UV) irradiation.  39  Very recently when we prepared our manuscript, Ho-Baillie A. and co-workers reported a SAM of Ph-2PACz that is the same structure as C-2PACz, and achieved an enhanced V OC of 1.26 V and FF of 82.6% in a 21.3%-efficiency high-bandgap i-PSCs due to the superiority of Ph-2PACz compared to the controls of 2PACz or PTAA.  27  Similarly, Chen C.-C. developed a SAM, named Ph-4PACz, containing two more CH 2 atoms in the linker compared to Ph-2PACz or C-2PACz. They found that Ph-4PACz with a large dipole moment can improve the interfacial energy level alignment to minimize energy loss and achieve a high V OC of 1.2 V.  24  Moreover, they introduced alumina nanoparticles prior to the deposition of SAM to flatten the rough FTO substrate. Thus, a PCE of 25.6% was obtained due to less interfacial defects.  24  The works of both Ho-Baillie A. and Chen C.-C. groups demonstrated the distinct advantages of phenylsubstituted derivatives of 2PACz. Carbazole-based SAMs (for example, 2PACz and MeO-2PACz) have revealed great successes in achieving high-efficiency i-PSCs.  27, 29  In addition to a minimized thickness to reduce material consumption and cost, such analogous SAMs can be used to circumvent the disadvantages of spin-coating or vacuum deposition by simply immersing the substrate in a dilute solution of the modifier, which is suitable for fabricating large-area devices. More importantly, it allows for recycling of the deposition solution.  35  However, there is a compromise between the molecular dipole moment and HOMO energy level, e.g., MeO-2PACz has a larger dipole moment but up-shifted HOMO level.  38  In this scenario, there is a conflict in some aspects of capability to facilitate hole transfer. Thus, it is necessary to increase the molecular dipole moment of SAMs for modulating the work function of the substrate, while not sacrificing the appropriate HOMO level.  39  To further strengthen the conductivity of SAMs, expanding the conjugation of the carbazole through linking a p-electron moiety is promising.  39  More importantly, we also hope the buried SAM possesses the ability to passivate the interface defects of the perovskite layer through chemical binding and to reduce microstructured voids and cracks.  35  With these considerations, we designed and synthesized two SAM molecules of C-2PACz and S-2PACz by linking two phenyl and thienyl rings, respectively, to the para-positions of the N atom in the carbazole core of 2PACz. Methylammonium (MA)-free i-PSCs with C-2PACz, S-2PACz, and 2PACz for a control as HSLs were investigated. S-2PACz-and C-2PACz-modified ITO substrates have more favorable energy level alignments with the perovskite, and thus better hole extraction ability. The perovskite film based on the new SAMs has larger and more uniform crystalline grains, stronger crystallinity, and superior optical properties. S-2PACz exhibited the highest conductivity and the most mitigated interface defects, which stem from the role of the heteroaromatic thiophene ring. Accordingly, i-PSCs with S-2PACz showed an optimum PCE of 18.65% compared to those of 18.16% for C-2PACz and 17.50% for 2PACz, respectively. Also, i-PSCs with S-2PACz exhibited the best storage stability without encapsulation, which correlated with the coordination of S and Pb 2+ , and the improved crystalline morphology of the templated perovskite. These results highlight that the strategically designed single-component SAM can perform the multiple functions of charge transfer, defects passivation, and crystal growth control. Thus, carbazole-based SAMs with heteroaromatic substitution open up promising possibilities for the development of hole-selective materials for PSCs with cost advantages, performance gains and large-area compatibility. 
 Results and discussion The structures of 2PACz, C-2PACz, and S-2PACz are shown in Fig.  1a , and the synthetic details for the new SAMs of S-2PACz and C-2PACz are provided in the ESI. â€  All the reagents are commonly available, and the lab-scale synthetic cost of S-2PACz was estimated to be only 233 f per g (Table  S1 , ESI â€ ). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to simulate the electrostatic surface potential (ESP) and calculate the dipole moments of the three SAMs. As shown in Fig.  1b, C -2PACz and S-2PACz exhibit lower charge density at the carbazole moiety, suggesting an efficient electron delocalization due to conjugation extension. Also, the region at the S atom of the thiophene ring shows a high electron density that would be favorable for coordination between the thiophene moiety and the undercoordinated Pb 2+ via the lone pair of electrons offered by the sulfur atom.  40  The dipole moments were 1.87 D for 2PACz, 2.20 D for C-2PACz, and 2.88 D for S-2PACz. The largest dipole moment of S-2PACz is desirable to downshift the work function of the metal oxide substrate for forming matched energy alignments. SAMs were deposited on ITO through spin-coating a dilute solution. The phosphonic acid anchoring groups present in 2PACz, C-2PACz, and S-2PACz are known to form densely packed molecules on ITO by forming strong bidentate/tri-dentate bonds.  35  To confirm the formation of SAMs layers on ITO substrates, we measured X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the samples. As shown in Fig.  1c , evident P 2p signals originating from phosphonic acid groups have been detected for the SAMs-modified ITO, but not for the bare ITO. In addition, the XPS spectra of the C 1s signals of the three SAMs on ITO could be deconvoluted to C-C, C-N, and C-P contributions (Fig.  1d-f ) that are consistent with their respective structural compositions. As for the S-2PACz, the S 2p signal stemming from a thienyl ring was observed (Fig.  S1b , ESI â€ ). To investigate the coverage of the different SAMs on the ITO, we calculated the coverage factor according to previous reports.  38  Coverage factors of 2.7 Ã‚ 10 Ã€3 , 2.9 Ã‚ 10 Ã€3 , and 4.5 Ã‚ 10 Ã€3 were determined for 2PACz, C-2PACz, and S-2PACz, respectively (Table  S2 , ESI â€ ). Moreover, the S-2PACz-modified ITO exhibited the lowest In 3d content (Fig.  S2b, ESI â€  ). Such profiles verify the presence of the SAMs on ITO and the relatively full coverage of S-2PACz. We also found that the P 2p, O 1s and N 1s signals of the three SAMs are located at different positions, but with the same shifting trend going from 2PACz to C-2PACz, and then to S-2PACz (Fig.  1c  and Fig.  S1c  and d, ESI â€  ). This is consistent with their dipole moment variations, because these elements of P, O, and N in the three SAMs have the same binding modes, and the observed shifts correlate with the electronegativity. The solar photons pass through the SAM layer to reach the perovskite absorber, so a desirable SAM should absorb more ultraviolet photons to protect the perovskite layer from UV-induced degradation. As shown in Fig.  2a  and Fig.  S3a (ESI â€  ), the S-2PACz layer exhibits much stronger light absorption ability below 400 nm than both C-2PACz and 2PACz. This intrinsic UV resistance of S-2PACz would help reduce defect states and enhance the stability of the target PSCs.  24, 39  The optical bandgaps of the SAMs were determined to be 3.98, 3.97, and 3.95 eV for 2PACz, C-2PACz, and S-2PACz, respectively (Fig.  S3 , ESI â€ ). These results are consistent in the trend of change with the results deduced from theoretical calculations (Fig.  S4 , ESI â€ ), and such wide bandgaps help ensure their minimal parasitic absorption. As shown in Fig.  2b , the SAMs-modified substrates show almost identical transmittance to the bare ITO, saving more photons for the perovskite absorber. However, in comparison, the S-2PACz-coated ITO exhibits slightly higher transmittance in the 400-600 nm wavelength range that may partially account for the relevant EQE variations. The energy level alignments between the SAMs and perovskite absorber are crucial for charge selection and extraction. Therefore, we conducted UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements on SAMs-modified ITO substrates, and the results are shown in Fig.  2c  and Table  S3  (ESI â€ ). The substrate with S-2PACz exhibited the largest work function of 4.48 eV, which originated from its larger dipole moment. The HOMOs of the SAMs were determined from secondary electron cut-off, presenting a downward trend from 2PACz (Ã€5.44 eV) to C-2PACz (Ã€5.46 eV), and then to S-2PACz (Ã€5.48 eV). Therefore, the offsets between the HOMO energy levels of 2PACz, C-2PACz, and S-2PACz and the valence band maximum (VBM) of perovskite are 0.91, 0.89, and 0.87 eV, respectively. The smallest offset of S-2PACz will guarantee fast hole extraction and low energy loss.  38, 39  The energy level alignments are visually shown in Fig.  2d . To investigate the charge transfer kinetics at the SAMs/ perovskite interface, we evaluated the hole extraction ability of different SAMs by measuring photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra. The PL spectrum was acquired using a 470 nm pulsed laser as incident light from the surface of perovskite thin films coated on different substrates. As shown in Fig.  3e , the perovskite films on ITO/C-2PACz and ITO/S-2PACz exhibit stronger PL quenching, which suggests stronger hole extraction capabilities. Then, TRPL spectra of the corresponding films were obtained, as shown in Fig.  3f . The TRPL spectra comply with a double exponential fitting, and the fitted parameters are listed in Table  S4  (ESI â€ ). The results show that compared to ITO/2PACz-based perovskite thin films with a t ave of 27.58 ns, the carrier decay lifetime of the perovskite thin films on the ITO/C-2PACz substrate and the ITO/S-2PACz substrate decreases to 27.50 ns and 15.02 ns, respectively. This suggests that the holes can be quickly extracted through the S-2PACz into the ITO.  38, 39  It is worth noting that the hole extraction is accompanied by defects-induced non-radiative recombination for the bi-exponential decay,  23  and these two aspects both quench PL. To understand the non-radiative recombination, PL and TRPL measurements were applied to the perovskites deposited on SAMs/quartz without ITO. The results show that the S-2PACz and C-2PACz samples exhibited higher PL intensity and longer t ave (Fig.  S6  and Table  S4 , ESI â€ ), and the average carrier lifetimes of 2PACz, C-2PACz, and S-2PACz are 59.69, 63.36, and 67.15 ns, respectively. This trend is completely opposite to that of ITO substrates, indicating that the new SAMs not only have strong carrier extraction ability, but also have a positive effect on passivating the surface defects of perovskite. Furthermore, we acquired the PL mapping images of the perovskite films coated on SAMs-modified ITO by laser confocal fluorescence microscope. The PL intensity and lifetime distribution maps are shown in Fig.  3a  and b . It is distinct that the perovskite thin films grown on S-2PACz show the most uniform PL intensity and lifetime, indicating high-quality crystalline microstructures. Fig.  3c  and d    the intrinsic high conductivity and low resistance are favorable for charge transport. As shown in Fig.  S7 (ESI â€  ), the S-2PACz film exhibits the smallest resistance and the control of 2PACz displays the largest resistance. The SAM layer plays a prominent role in modulating the crystallization process and the film quality of the top perovskite absorber. Contact angle measurements were conducted to judge the wettability of the SAM films, and also understand their surface modification to the ITO. As shown in Fig.  4a , the surfaces of the C-2PACz-and S-2PACz-coated ITO exhibit contact angles (CA) of 62.7 and 77 1C, respectively, both of which are much larger than the control of 2PACz (CA = 55.6 1C). According to the literature,  41  the contact angles correlate with the coverage of the SAM on ITO. When the ITO surface featuring a small CA is fully covered by the SAMs, the CA becomes even larger.  39, 42  To this end, we further investigated the coverage of SAMs on ITO through energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements. The elemental mapping of P (Fig.  4d ) indicates that all three SAMs are evenly distributed without severe aggregation, but only the ITO decorated with S-2PACz obviously displays complete coverage. It is well recognized that the hole extraction layer with a small water CA usually yields good wettability to the perovskite precursor solution.  24, 27  However, quite a few works highlighted that an appropriately hydrophobic surface is beneficial to facilitate crystallization nucleation and grain growth of the perovskite precursor solution.  9, 38, 43  We can envisage that the wettability and templating properties are two different and sometime inconsistent roles of the SAM layer that are both related with contact angles. In other words, we could not simply anticipate that a smaller CA of the SAM layer results in a better quality perovskite film and higher device performance. To disclose the impacts of the SAMs on the crystallization kinetics of perovskite, optical microscope images of the crystallization process were recorded. As shown in Fig.  4b , the perovskite precursor solution began to crystallize at 60 s for S-2PACz, and 65 s for C-2PACz, but not yet at 70 s for the control film of 2PACz. Across the time span of 80-100 s, the S-2PACz film derived larger and denser crystal grains than C-2PACz and 2PACz. As the nucleus spacing increased for C-2PACz and became more apparent for S-2PACz, heterogeneous nucleation could be suppressed and the grain boundaries were reduced.  9  This is beneficial for attenuating the interfacial defects of crystal grains and mitigating charge recombination.  9  At 110 s, the secondary crystallization had already evolved well for the 2PACz-based film, and it appeared to begin about ten minutes later for the S-2PACz-and C-2PACz-supported sample film. This indicates that the SAM of S-2PACz helped to reduce the free energy of nucleation and prolong the crystallization process.  44  Subsequently, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the corresponding films were obtained to confirm the crystalline quality. As shown in Fig.  4c , the perovskite films grown on the SAMs exhibit similar diffraction profiles in peak position. However, the S-2PACz-derived film shows an apparently stronger diffraction intensity for the (100) and (  200 ) crystal planes compared to those of C-2PACz and 2PACz.  45  This evidences that the crystallinity of the perovskite film is enhanced with the aid of S-2PACz, and it is favorable for charge transport. The absence of a peak near 12 1C for all the examined films indicates a complete transformation from the d-phase to the black a-phase.  46  The effects of different SAMs on the crystal quality and surface morphology were further investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The SEM images (Fig.  5a ) show that the grain size of the perovskite thin films on C-2PACz and S-2PACz substrates is significantly larger. This denotes less grain boundaries, and is consistent with the results of optical microscope. The statistic distributions of the grain sizes (Fig.  5b ) confirm such a fact. The AFM height images of Fig.  5c  reveal that the roughness of the perovskite thin films grown on 2PACz, C-2PACz, and S-2PACz are 23.56, 20.24, and 16.78 nm, respectively. The smoothest surface of the perovskite grown on the new selfassembled molecules of S-2PACz correspond to the uniformity of the grain sizes, and is more conducive to the deposition of subsequent electron transport layers. The water contact angles of perovskite films grown on different SAMs were tested (Fig.  S8, ESI â€  ). It can be seen that the value for S-2PACz is the largest, which is followed by C-2PACz, and then the control of 2PACz. The relatively hydrophobic surface of S-2PACz might correlate with its high crystallinity and good connection of crystal grains. To investigate the potential of the new SAMs as a HSL for PSCs, we fabricated devices with a structure of ITO/SAM/ Cs 0.2 FA 0.8 PbI 3 /C 60 /BCP/Ag. Fig.  6b  shows the J-V curves of the optimized PSCs, from which the standard photovoltaic parameters were derived. The PSC with 2PACz exhibited a PCE of 17.50% with a J SC of 21.87 mA cm Ã€2 , a V OC of 1.01 V, and an FF of 79.23%. The V OC s of the PSCs with C-2PACz and S-2PACz were significantly elevated to 1.05-1.06 V, and their corresponding efficiencies were also improved to 18.16% and 18.65%, respectively. Statistical variations of the photovoltaic parameters based on multiple devices confirmed the merits of S-2PACz and C-2PACz (Fig.  S9, ESI â€  ). Next, we measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the corresponding device (Fig.  6c ). The integrated current densities based on EQEs are approximately equal to the J SC s obtained from the J-V tests of the corresponding devices. Afterward, we examined the influence of the processing manner of the SAM layer on the performance of PSCs. It was found that the PCEs agreed well with each other between the SAM deposited from a dilute  solution and the SAM formed by dipping into a solution and subsequent washing (Fig.  S10, ESI â€  ). This verifies the formation of SAM via spin-coating, and highlights the tolerance of the SAMs against solvent rinse. To obtain more insights into the performance discrepancies of the PSCs, we investigated the charge transport and recombination kinetics of the devices using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig.  6e  shows the Nyquist diagram of the devices measured under dark conditions, which is fitted with an equivalent circuit model consisting of series resistors (R s ) and composite resistors (R rec ). Table  S5  (ESI â€ ) provides the detailed fitting parameters for R rec and R s , which are related to the high-frequency and lowfrequency characteristics of the EIS plot, respectively. We observed that the R rec values of the devices monotonically increase from 956.6 O for 2PACz to 1702 O for C-2PACz, and to 2551 O for S-2PACz, pointing to a gradual decrease in the charge recombination rate. To further evaluate the charge recombination in the devices with SAMs of 2PACz, C-2PACz, and S-2PACz, the dependence of V OC on the light intensity was probed (Fig.  6f ). The slope factor n of the C-2PACz and S-2PACz devices is smaller and closer to 1, indicating that the trapassisted charge recombination is mostly suppressed for S-2PACz-derived PSC compared to the reference device. The effect of new SAMs on the carrier transport efficiency and defect density of states in the device was investigated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. In the ohmic region with low voltages, the current increases linearly with the increase of voltage. Furthermore, when the voltage reaches the trap filling limit point (V TFL ), the current sharply increases with the increase of voltage. As shown in Fig.  S11  (ESI â€ ), the trap filling limit voltages (V TFL ) of hole-only devices with 2PACz, C-2PACz, and S-2PACz are determined to be 0.23, 0.21, and 0.19 V, respectively. Then, we can obtain the trap densities (n trap ) of the device using the following formula:  43  n trap Â¼ 2ee 0 V TFL qL 2 Among them, e 0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, e is the relative dielectric constant of Cs 0.2 FA 0.8 PbI 3 , L is the thickness of the perovskite film, and q is the basic charge. The n trap was calculated to be 3.6 Ã‚ 10 15 , 3.3 Ã‚ 10 15 and 3.0 Ã‚ 10 15 cm Ã€3 for the devices with 2PACz, C-2PACz, and S-2PACz, respectively. Such results indicate that C-2PACz and S-2PACz have lower defect state densities, which have a more positive effect on decreasing the charge recombination at the interface of the perovskite thin films. The hole mobilities of 2PACz, C-2PACz, and S-2PACz were determined from the J 0.5 -V curves of holeonly devices (Fig.  S12 , ESI â€ ) by using the Mott-Gurney formula of J = (9/8) Ã‚ ee 0 m Ã‚ (V 2 /L 3 ).  47  A much higher hole mobility of 2.39 Ã‚ 10 Ã€3 cm 2 V Ã€1 s Ã€1 was derived for S-2PACz compared to 1.24 Ã‚ 10 Ã€3 and 8.01 Ã‚ 10 Ã€4 cm 2 V Ã€1 s Ã€1 for C-2PACz and 2PACz, respectively. This is consistent with the higher conductivity of S-2PACz, and is beneficial for improving J SC . The steady-state power output of the champion devices at the voltage corresponding to the maximum power point was tracked and plotted in Fig.  S13 (ESI â€  ). Stable PCEs of 17.4%, 18.1%, and 18.6% with stabilized J SC s over 500 s were recorded for the devices based on 2PACz, C-2PACz, and S-2PACz, respectively. The devices without any encapsulation were stored under an N 2 atmosphere for 30 days, and the PCE of the PSC with S-2PACz exhibited the slowest degradation (Fig.  6d ). Moreover, the devices based on S-2PACz and C-2PACz showed negligible hysteresis between the reverse and forward scans (Fig.  S14, ESI â€  ). The reduced hysteresis herein further evidences suppressed interfacial traps and recombination for the devices with the two new SAMs.  48  The overall enhanced stability of PSCs with S-2PACz and C-2PAC stems from not only their high-quality crystalline structures and hydrophobic surfaces, but also their fewer interfacial defects, faster hole extraction, and stronger interactions between the SAMs and the perovskite compositions (Fig.  S15, ESI â€  ). 
 Conclusions In summary, two new carbazole-based self-assembled holeselective materials of C-2PACz and S-2PACz were designed and synthesized by covalently binding symmetric phenyl and thienyl units. The conductivity was improved by the extended conjugation. S-2PACz exhibited a much larger dipole moment than C-2PACz, and they were able to more efficiently tune the work function of ITO compared to the control of 2PACz. Thus, the S-2PACzmodified ITO exhibited the highest number of matched energy levels with the perovskite absorber to facilitate hole extraction. The twisted phenyl or thienyl substituent also help alleviate severe molecular self-aggregation to achieve uniform and densely packed SAM layers. The higher crystallinity and uniform, larger crystal grains were achieved for the S-2PACz-based perovskite film, benefiting from its intrinsic interactions with the perovskite components. This contributed to less interfacial defects and reduced the charge recombination loss. The potential of C-2PACz and S-2PACz as a hole-selective layer for inverted PSCs was investigated and compared to the control of 2PACz. The PSCs with S-2PACz exhibited improved V OC s (1.05 V), superior PCEs (18.65%), less hysteresis, and higher storage stability compared to the other two SAMs. Although the PCEs obtained by us are unimpressive, we have good reasons to believe that much higher PCEs would be achieved especially for S-2PACz if given highly-skilled device fabrication in view of the latest successful demonstration of PCEs for the analogues of the inferior C-2PACz. Our findings suggest that S-2PACz is a highly promising SAM for hole-selective contact, and emphasize that multiple roles of hole extraction, surface defects passivation, and crystallization control can be merged into a simple single-component SAM layer by structurally engineering the carbazole unit with appropriate heteroaromatic rings.

CsI (499.99%), PbI 2 (499.99%), and C 60 were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Bathocuproine (BCP) was purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp. FAI and 2PACz were synthesized by literature methods.  35, 49, 50  Chlorobenzene (CB), N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The perovskite solutions were prepared by dissolving FAI, CsI and PbI 2 in a mixed solvent of DMF : DMSO (4 : 1, vol%) to form a 1 M Cs 0.2 FA 0.8 PbI 3 precursor solution. Perovskite solar cell fabrication ITO-coated glasses were first washed with deionized water, acetone, isopropanol, and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min each. The precleaned ITO glasses were dried with a nitrogen flow and exposed to UV-ozone (UVO) illumination for 30 min. After that, the ITO glasses were transferred into a N 2 -filled glovebox to accomplish the rest of the procedures. A SAMs solution with a concentration of 0.3 mg mL Ã€1 in DMSO was coated on an ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 100 1C for 10 minutes. The perovskite precursor solution was dripped onto the ITO/SAM substrates and spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 6000 rpm for 30 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating stage, 120 mL of chlorobenzene (as antisolvent) was quickly injected onto the substrate at 10 s before spin-coating was finished. Then, the perovskite films were transferred onto a hot plate and annealed at 150 1C for 30 min. Afterwards, C 60 with a thickness of 20 nm and BCP with a thickness of 7 nm were thermally evaporated under a low pressure of 4 Ã‚ 10 Ã€4 Pa. Finally, Ag electrodes with a thickness of 100 nm were deposited under the low pressure. The perovskite solar cells were measured with an effective area of 0.08 cm 2 . The J-V curves were measured at a step size of 20 mV s Ã€1 and a delay time of 10 ms under AM 1.5G solar illumination at 100 mW cm Ã€2 using a Newport Oriel solar simulator (model SAN-EI, ELS 155(XE)) calibrated with a standard photovoltaic cell equipped with a KG5 filter (certificated by the National Institute of Metrology) and a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit.

Compared to the 2PACz substrate, the perovskite films on the C-2PACz and S-2PACz substrates exhibit stronger PL quenching and shorter fluorescence lifetime. These results are consistent with the results of steady-state PL and TRPL, further confirming that the introduction of C-2PACz and S-2PACz has a positive impact on improving the hole extraction efficiency.

Characterizations and measurements 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker AVANCEIII 600 MHz spectrometer. The chemical shift (Î´) values are given in ppm and are referenced to residual solvent peaks. The DFT calculations were implemented in Gaussian 16. The ground-state equilibrium geometries of structures were fully optimized with density functional theory (DFT) using B3LYP functional and 6-31G(d,p) basis sets, with D3 dispersion correction of grimme 1-2 . During photovoltaic J-V curve measurements, a nonreflective mask with an aperture of 0.08 cm 2 was used. The light-intensity-dependent V OC measurement was measured under a solar simulator (SS-X50, ENLITECH, Taiwan) with variable light intensity. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured by quantum efficiency measurement system (QTesT HIFINITY 5, CROWNTECH, USA) in air. The absorption spectra were measured on a Hitachi U-3900/3900H UV-vis spectrophotometer. The surface morphological characterizations of the perovskite films were performed by using SEM (NovaNanoSEM450, USA) at a 10 kV accelerating voltage. The roughness of the films was evaluated via AFM (Bruker, Multi-Mode 8). The steady-state PL were measured under excitation of a 470 nm pulsed laser with a power density of 15 Î¼J/cm 2 , based on an FLS920 (Edinburgh Instruments) fluorescence spectrometer. The PL mapping and TRPL were performed by confocal fluorescence microscopy (ISS fastFLIM) with 405
nm, 1 MHZ in ambient air. A Micro Capture Pro coupled with ImageJ software was applied to obtain the water contact angles of the substrates. XRD were measured using X-ray diffractometer (D8 ADVANCE, Bruker AXS, Germany) with Cu KÎ± radiation source in ambient air. XPS and UPS measurements were performed using a surface analysis system (ThermoFisher, ESCALAB 250Xi) equipped with a He discharge lamp (hÎ½ = 21.22 eV) and a monochromatic Al-KÎ± x-ray gun. The X-ray spot size was 500 Î¼m in diameter.
