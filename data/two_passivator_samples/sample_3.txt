Title: Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells Using Donor-Acceptor-Donor Small Molecules to Tuning NiO x /Perovskite Interfacial Microstructure
Nickel oxide (NiO x ) is one of the most widely used inorganic hole transport materials for inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which has the advantages of low cost, easy preparation, and good stability. However, the energy-level mismatch and interfacial redox reactions at the NiO x /perovskite interface limit the performance of NiO x -based PSCs. Herein, triphenylamine-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-triphenylamine (TBT) small-molecule material is first used as an interfacial modification layer between NiO x and perovskite. The deposition of TBT on NiO x helps to hinder the contact between NiO x and perovskite, improves the electrical conductivity, passivates interfacial defects, and inhibits the recombination of interfacial carriers. TBT makes the valance band top energy level of NiO x better match that of perovskite and promotes the hole transfer at NiO x /perovskite interface, and the hole transfer rate increases from 2.19 Â 10 10 to 4.12 Â 10 10 s À1 . The TBT-based device obtains a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.84%, much higher than the control device (18.62%). Furthermore, the optimized device which is conserved in 30 AE 5% relative humidity and 25 °C environments more than 1000 h retains 90% of the initial efficiency. A effective strategy to improve the PCE and stability of NiO x -based PSCs is provided.
Introduction After more than ten years of development, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has increased from 3.9% in 2009 to 25.7%.  [1, 2]  Perovskite has attracted extensive research interest due to its low exciton binding energy,  [3]  long exciton diffusion length,  [4]  and good bandgap tunability.  [5]  However, the poor long-term stability of PSCs severely hinders its commercialization. Currently, widely studied device structures are divided into inverted (p-i-n) structure and formal (n-i-p) structure, among which the inverted structure is favored by people due to its high stability, low hysteresis, low fabrication cost, and low-temperature fabrication.  [6] [7] [8] [9]  Hole transport materials such as poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS),  [10, 11]  poly-bis (4phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) amine (PTAA),  [12, 13]  poly (3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT),  [14, 15]  and nickel oxide (NiO x )  [16, 17]  are commonly used in inverted structures. Inorganic hole transport materials NiO x have received extensive attention due to its low price, high stability, large bandgap, and ease of mass production, compared with the high price and poor stability of organic hole transport materials.  [18] [19] [20]  However, Ni vacancies in NiO x lead to lower conductivity of NiO x , which is not conducive to the extraction of holes, and leads to interfacial charge recombination with perovskite.  [21]  In addition, due to the redox and photocatalytic activity of NiO x , the Ni 3þ of NiO x will react with I À in the perovskite to cause the interfacial degradation of the perovskite.  [22] [23] [24] [25]  These problems not only hinder hole extraction but also reduce the stability of PSCs. To solve these problems, the widely used method is to plus an interfacial modification layer at the NiO x /perovskite interface. To improve the PCE of the device, a CsBr buffer layer was inserted between the NiO x and perovskite layers to relieve the interfacial stress caused by lattice mismatch and induce more ordered crystal growth, and the PCE of the device increase to 19.7%.  [26]  3,3 0 -(4,8-bis(hexylthio)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b 0 ]dithiophene-2,6-diyl) bis (10-(6-bromohexyl)-10 H-phenoxazine) (BDT-POZ) was introduced at the NiO x /perovskite interface to reduce the adverse reactions of uncoordinated Ni 3þ and perovskite and increase the PCE of the device to 20.16%.  [27]  Trimethylolpropane tris(2-methyl-1-aziridinepropionate) (SaC-100) was inserted at the NiO x /perovskite interface to inhibit the reaction between Ni 3þ and I À , reduce the interfacial defects, and improve the PCE to 20.21%.  [28]  2-Cyano-3-(4-(diphenylamino) phenyl) acrylic acid (LS1) was used to modify NiO x to suppress the interfacial reaction between NiO x and perovskite by chemical passivation and increase the PCE to 20.94%.  [29]  2-Mercaptoimidazole (2-MI) was introduced at the NiO x /perovskite interface to coordinate the S atom with the undercoordinated Pb 2þ near the NiO x /perovskite interface, which helps to suppress the carrier recombination and enhances the interfacial hole carrier transport extraction.  [30]  2-Thiophenemethylamine (TPMA) was introduced at the NiO x /perovskite interface, TPMA provided a moderate dipole moment pointing to the perovskite side, passivated the interfacial defects of NiO x and MAPbI3, and improved the PCE to 20.4%.  [31]  Based on spiro [fluorene-9,9 0 -phenanthrene-10 0 -1] derivatives (YLCs) that were introduced at the NiO x /perovskite interface to coordinate Pb 2þ , improve the carrier transport speed and increase the PCE to 20.37%.  [32]  P-type semiconductor 4,4 00 -bis(diphenylamine)-[1,1 0 :3 0 ,1 00 -terphenyl]-5 0 -carboxylic acid (TBP-BA) was used to modify NiO x /perovskite interface to promote hole transfer between the perovskite and NiO x layers by reducing the interfacial energy band offset and increase the PCE to 22.25%.  [33]  Ultrafast charge separation of p-type small molecules [triphenylamine-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-triphenylamine (TBT)] has been investigated.  [34]  Compared with other methods, TBT has easy availability of raw materials, simple preparation process, and less preparation time. Here, TBT was first used to tune the interfacial properties of the NiO x /perovskite interface. The study found that the TBT interfacial modification layer can reduce the interface defects, increase the ratio of Ni 3þ /Ni 2þ in NiO x , hinder the adverse reaction between Ni 3þ and perovskite, improve the quality of perovskite film, and improve the hole extraction efficiency. The valence band maximum (VBM) of the NiO x and perovskite layers are more matched. The final NiO x /TBT-based device achieved a champion PCE of 21.84%, and the unencapsulated device maintained 90% of the initial efficiency after more than 1000 h when stored in an environment of 30 AE 5% relative humidity (RH) and 25 °C. The synthetic route of TBT small molecule material is shown in Figure  S1 , Supporting Information. The chemical structure of TBT was confirmed by 1 H and  13  C NMR spectrum (Figure  S2 , Supporting Information). The TBT small molecule material was introduced into the NiO x /perovskite interface for modification. The device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/NiO x /TBT/perovskite/phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag is shown in Figure  1a  (without explanation, the TBT discussed later is all 0.25-TBT). The S element in the TBT small molecule can interact with the noncoordinating Pb 2þ near the perovskite interface.  [35, 36]  First, to confirm that TBT small molecules were successfully introduced into the NiO x /perovskite interface, we measured the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of NiO x and NiO x /TBT. The XPS of the C 1s and N 1s peaks of NiO x and NiO x / TBT films are shown in Figure  S3  and S4, Supporting Information, respectively. It can be clearly seen from these two figures that TBT was successfully prepared on the NiO x surface. The XPS of the Ni 2p 3/2 peaks of NiO x and NiO x /TBT films is shown in Figure  1b, c , respectively.  [28, 30]  The Ni 3þ /Ni 2þ ratio of the NiO x /TBT film can be obtained by estimating the integrated area of each peak, and the Ni 3þ /Ni 2þ ratio of the NiO x /TBT film is increased to 1.14 compared with the Ni 3þ /Ni 2þ ratio (0.96) of the NiO x film. The increase of Ni 3þ /Ni 2þ ratio is beneficial to improve the conductivity and hole migration of NiO x film.  [33]  Similar results can also be found in the O 1s XPS spectra of the NiO x films with and without TBT (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information). The conductivity of NiO x and NiO x /TBT films was measured, as shown in Figure  1d . It can be clearly seen that the conductivity of NiO x /TBT films is significantly higher than that of NiO x films. For PSCs, the light transmittance of NiO x will also affect the performance of the device. The light transmittance of NiO x and NiO x /TBT films is shown in Figure  1e . It can be seen from the figure that after the modification of TBT, the effect on the light transmittance of NiO x is not significant, and the light transmittance in most wave bands exceeds 95%, which is beneficial to the light absorption of perovskite. This is further evidenced by the optical absorption spectra of NiO To investigate the effect of TBT modification of NiO x on the energy-level structure of NiO x , the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) of NiO x and NiO x /TBT thin films was measured (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information), and the cutoff binding energies of NiO x and NiO x /TBT thin films were 16.79 and 16.68 eV, respectively. By the formula E F ¼ E cutÀoff À 21.22 eV, the work functions of NiO x and NiO x /TBT films are 4.43 and 4.54 eV, respectively. The Fermi edges (E F,edge ) of NiO x and NiO x /TBT films are 0.74 and 0.78 eV, respectively. According to the formula E VB ¼ E F À E F, edge , the VBM of NiO x and NiO x /TBT films are À5.17 and À5.32 eV, respectively. The energy-level structures of NiO x and NiO x /TBT thin films in Figure  2a  were determined by combining the optical bandgaps of NiO x and NiO x /TBT thin films in Figure  S9 , Supporting Information. Based on previous report,  [37, 38]  the energy-level structure of inverted PSCs can be determined (Figure  2b ). It can be seen that the VBM of the TBT-modified NiO x matches that of the perovskite better, which facilitates the migration of holes from the perovskite to the hole transport layer. The N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (9:1) contact angles of NiO x and NiO x /TBT films are shown in Figure  2c, d , and the ratio of DMF/DMSO is the same as that of the perovskite precursor. This is beneficial for probing the wettability on top of NiO x and NiO x /TBT films. With the modification of NiO by TBT, the adhesion of DMF/ DMSO to the hole transport layer was improved. The DMF/ DMSO contact angle of NiO x /TBT film (29.18°) was not significantly changed compared with that of NiO x film (31.63°), which is conducive to the formation of high-quality perovskite. 
 Results and Discussion 
 Effect of Triphenylamine-2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole-Triphenylamine-Modified NiO x on the Surface Properties and Optical Properties of Perovskite Thin Films To investigate the effect of TBT-modified NiO x on the surface properties of perovskite films, scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of perovskite films grown on NiO x and NiO x /TBT films were measured (as shown in Figure  3a, b ). It can be seen that the crystalline grains of the perovskite films grown on NiO x and NiO x /TBT films are very dense. Figure  3c  counts the average grain size of perovskite grains, and the grain sizes of perovskite films grown on NiO x and NiO x /TBT films are 205.61 and 264.72 nm, respectively. The larger grain size of the perovskite films grown on NiO x /TBT films indicates that the TBT-modified NiO x surface is more conducive to the crystallization of the perovskite film. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) of perovskite films grown on NiO x and NiO x /TBT films is shown in Figure  3d , and the (110), (220), and (310) crystal faces of perovskite can be seen at 14.1°, 28.4°and 31.9°, respectively. The intensity of the diffraction peak of the perovskite film grown on the NiO x /TBT thin film is significantly higher than that of the perovskite film grown on the NiO x thin film, which further proves the increased grain size of the perovskite film grown on the NiO x /TBT film. The optical absorption spectra of the perovskite films grown on NiO x and NiO x /TBT films are shown in Figure  3e , and there is no obvious change in the light absorption in the visible range. The absorption of the perovskite film grown on the NiO x /TBT film in the short-wave range is significantly improved, and more photogenerated carriers will be generated, which is conducive to enhancing the photocurrent in the perovskite. According to Figure  3e , the Tauc plots of perovskite films grown on NiO x and NiO x /TBT films were obtained (Figure  3f  ). It can be seen that the bandgap of the perovskite is 1.61 eV, indicating that the crystal lattice of the perovskite has not changed, which also means that the TBT molecules have not penetrated into the crystal lattice of the perovskite. 
 Carrier Dynamics of the Interface between NiO x -Triphenylamine-2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole-Triphenylamine/ Perovskite Film To investigate the effect of TBT-modified NiO x on the NiO x / perovskite interface, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of NiO x /perovskite and NiO x /TBT/perovskite were measured and shown in Figure  4a . The PL spectrum of the perovskite film grown on NiO x /TBT is quenched faster than that of the perovskite film grown on NiO x under the condition of the same excitation optical power density. This directly proves that the hole extraction efficiency is higher at the interface between NiO x /TBT and perovskite than between the NiO x /perovskite interface. To further explore the effect of TBT-modified NiO x on the transient carrier dynamics at the NiO x /perovskite interface. Ultrafast femtosecond transient absorption spectra (fs-TAS) of NiO x / perovskite and NiO x /TBT/perovskite were measured and shown in Figure  4b ,c by exciting the sample with a 450 nm (5 μJ cm À2 ) femtosecond laser. The pseudocolor images of NiO x /perovskite and NiO x /TBT/perovskite are shown in Figure  S10 , Supporting Information, respectively. It can be seen that the ground-state bleaching (GSB) peaks of the two sets of samples are both at 760 nm. The bleaching attenuation of NiO x /TBT/perovskite is more obvious than that of NiO x /perovskite by comparing the bleaching attenuation at 760 nm. Then the GSB dynamics of NiO x /perovskite and NiO x /TBT/perovskite were extracted, respectively (Figure  4d ). The GSB dynamics of NiO x /TBT/ perovskite decayed significantly faster than that of NiO x / perovskite, which was attributed to the superior hole extraction rate of the NiO x /TBT. To quantitatively explain the difference in charge transfer, the GSB dynamics at 760 nm were fitted by single wavelength, and the results are shown in Table  1 , τ 1 ,τ 2 ,τ 3 are the hole transfer time, electron-hole pair recombination time, and defect capture time, respectively.  [39]  The calculated hole transfer rates are 2.19 Â 10 10 s À1 (NiO x /perovskite) and 4.12 Â 10 10 s À1 (NiO x /TBT/perovskite), which is consistent with the difference in PL intensity, again indicating that the hole extraction efficiency of TBT-modified NiO x is significantly higher than that of NiO x . Through the carrier dynamics analysis of NiO x /perovskite interface, it can be assumed that TBT is conducive to suppress defects at the buried interface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technology has also been used to characterize the transfer and recombination of interfacial charges in devices, and Figure  S11 , Supporting Information, shows a Nyquist plot of a device based on the NiO x and NiO x /TBT. The series impedance (R s ) and charge transfer resistance (R ct ) can be obtained by fitting EIS data. Using the equivalent circuit shown in Figure  S11 , Supporting Information, all parameters are fitted and represented in Table  S1 , Supporting Information. The decrease in R s from 62.57 to 52.84 Ω was due to the improved conductivity of NiO x and the improved quality of perovskite films. Because only the interface between NiO x and perovskite has changed, the decrease in R ct is mainly due to a better match between the energy level at the NiO x /perovskite. To further evaluate the variation of trap, the space-chargelimited currents (SCLC) of the devices (ITO/NiO x /perovskite/ P3HT/Ag and ITO/NiO x /TBT/perovskite/P3HT/Ag) were measured and shown in Figure  4e . The J-V curve can be divided into three parts, including the ohmic region, the trap-filled region, and the trap-free region.  [37]  The trap filling limit voltage (V TFL ) of the hole-only devices based on NiO x and NiO x /TBT are 0.84 and 0.61 V, respectively. The trap density of perovskite film can be calculated according to the following formula:  [40]  N traps ¼ 2ε 0 εV TFL eL 2 , where ε 0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, ε is the relative dielectric constant (%18), e is the charge, and L is the thickness of perovskite film. By calculation, the trap densities of NiO x and NiO x /TBT-based perovskites are 1.71 Â 10 16 and 1.24Â10 16 cm À3 , respectively. The reduced trap density is mainly attributed to the larger grain size of perovskite and the coordination of the S atoms in TBT to Pb 2þ in perovskite, which reduces the nonradiative recombination. The reduction of traps originating from the coordination of the S atoms in TBT to Pb 2þ in perovskite can also be demonstrated by the ideality factor (n). Open-circuit voltage values of the PSCs with/without TBT treatment as function of light intensity are shown in Figure  4f , and the n-value for PSCs based on NiO x and NiO x /TBT decreases from 1.79 to 1.53 kT/q. A lower ideality factor means a lower defect.  [41]     When NiO x was used as the hole transport layer, the optimal V oc , J sc , FF, and PCE are 1.124 V, 21.42 mA cm À2 , 77.35%, and 18.62%, respectively. When the NiO x /x-TBT film was used as the hole transport layer, the device performance was significantly improved. The V oc , J sc , FF, and PCE of the device based on NiO x /0.125-TBT as the hole transport layer are 1.140 V, 21.83 mA cm À2 , 80.06%, and 20.54%, respectively. The optimal V oc , J sc , FF, and PCE of the device based on NiO x /0.25-TBT as the hole transport layer are 1.166 V, 23.38 mA cm À2 , 80.12%, and 21.84%, respectively. When NiO x /0.5-TBT was used as the hole transport layer, the optimal V oc , J sc , FF, and PCE of the device are 1.134 V, 22.19 mA cm À2 , 79.23%, and 19.93%, respectively. Relatively speaking, 0.25-TBT-modified NiO x is the best for improving the performance of PSCs. The increase in V oc is mainly due to the passivation of defects at the NiO x /perovskite interface, better energy-level alignment, and the coordination of the S atoms in TBT and Pb 2þ in perovskite. The increase of J sc is due to the larger grain size of perovskite and enhanced light absorption. The statistical V oc , J sc , FF, and PCE of the inverted PSCs based on different TBT concentrations are shown in Figure  S12 , Supporting Information. The average photovoltaic performance of the inverted PSCs based on different TBT concentrations is summarized in Table  2 . Each average parameter was calculated from 40 devices under the same experimental conditions. As the TBT concentration increased from 0 to 0.25 mg mL À1 , the PCE of the device increased from 18.62% to 21.84%. However, when the TBT concentration was in the range of 0.25-0.5 mg mL À1 , the V oc and J sc of the device both decreased. The EQE spectra of NiO   5c, d , where forward and reverse represent forward and reverse scanning, respectively. The hysteresis index (HI)  [42]  can be calculated by the formula HI ¼ ðPCE Forward À PCE Reverse Þ=PCE. By quantitative calculation, the HI of devices based on NiO and NiO x /TBT films are 0.061 and 0.011, respectively, indicating that the device based on NiO x /TBT film has good suppression of hysteresis effect. The dark-state J-V curves of devices based on NiO x and NiO x /TBT films are presented in Figure  5e . The devices based on NiO x / TBT films have smaller leakage currents than those based on NiO x . When the leakage current of the battery is smaller, the corresponding short-circuit current density is larger.  [31] [32] [33]  The test results of the dark state are also consistent with the measurement The long-term environmental stability is the key to the future commercialization of PSCs. Unpackaged devices were stored at 30 AE 5% RH and 25 °C, and their performance was occasionally tested over a range of more than 1000 h to evaluate device stability, as shown in Figure  6a-d . After 1000 h, the PCE of the device based on NiO x film is only 30%, while the PCE of the device based on NiO x /TBT film is more than 90%. Although V oc , J sc , FF, and PCE decay at different rates, all experiments show that the NiO x /TBT-based device has better stability. The water contact angles of perovskite films based on NiO x and NiO x /TBT are presented in Figure  6e ,f, respectively. The water contact angles of perovskite films based on NiO and NiO x /TBT are 42.26°and 69.74°, respectively. It proved that the improved environmental stability of the device is mainly due to the increased water contact angle of the perovskite film based on NiO x /TBT. The reason for the increase in the water contact angle of perovskite films is that TBT changes the growth environment of perovskite, and the perovskite grain size is larger and of higher quality. These results demonstrate that the TBT interfacial modification layer can significantly improve the air stability of PSCs. 
 Conclusion In summary, we demonstrate that the modification of NiO x by TBT is an effective way to improve the PCE of inverted NiO x -based PSCs. When the optimal concentration of TBT was 0.25 mg mL À1 , the PCE of PSCs was increased from 18.62% to 21.84%. The analysis of the optical and electrical properties of NiO x thin films shows that TBT-modified NiO x not only increases the ratio of Ni 3þ to Ni 2þ but also enhances the conductivity of NiO x thin films, improves the work function of NiO x thin films, and makes the VBM of NiO x more closely match that of perovskite. TBT-modified NiO x can promote hole transport at the The previous value is the average result, and the value in parentheses is the best result. Statistical analysis was based on 40 devices. NiO x /perovskite interface. Simultaneously, the unpackaged device was placed in an environment of 30 AE 5% RH and 25 °C for more than 1000 h, and the device performance could still retain 90% of the initial value. The study of TBT-modified NiO x as a hole-transporting layer provides a simple and effective strategy to improve the performance of inverted NiO x -based PSCs.

Device Fabrication: The ITO substrate was ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water, isopropanol, acetone, and absolute ethanol, respectively. The ITO substrate was treated with ozone for 20 min. The NiO x films were spin-coated on the ITO substrate at 5000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 30 min. Then ITO substrates were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box to cool. TBT solutions of 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg mL À1 were spin-coated on NiO x using spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 30 s and followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. The perovskite films were spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and 180 μL of CB was dropped vertically on the perovskite at 12 s as an antisolvent, followed by annealing at 85 °C for 30 min. PCBM was spin-coated on perovskite at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. BCP was spin-coated on PCBM at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Then, the device was transferred to an evaporation coating machine with a vacuum degree of 5.0 Â 10 À4 to deposit a layer of silver with a thickness of 120 nm as an electrode. Finally, a complete device is obtained, and the effective area of the device is 0.075 cm 2 . These devices and perovskite films are signed as NiO x , 0.125-TBT, 0.25-TBT, and 0.5-TBT, respectively.

The XPS was obtained by Thermo Scientific K-Alpha. Finally, to measure the stability of the device, the unpackaged device was placed in a sealed box, protected from light, at a temperature of 25 AE 2 °C and a RH of 30 AE 5%, and regularly tested for more than 1000 h. 2. 1 . 1 Optical and Electrical Properties of Triphenylamine-2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole-Triphenylamine-Modified NiO x

 x and NiO x / TBT thin films (Figure S6, Supporting Information), there is no obvious change in optical absorption, possibly due to the low concentration of TBT. According to Figure S6, Supporting Information, we made Tauc plots for NiO x and NiO x /TBT films (Figure S7, Supporting Information), and we can know that the optical bandgaps of NiO x and NiO x /TBT films are 3.77 and 3.74 eV, respectively. Atomic force microscope (AFM) images of NiO x and NiO x /TBT films are shown in Figure S8, Supporting Information. After TBT treatment, the surface roughness (SR) of NiO x was reduced from 3.6 to 3.57 nm, indicating that TBT modification of NiO x does not change the surface morphology of NiO x .

 2. 4 . 4 Effect of Triphenylamine-2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole-Triphenylamine-Modified NiO x on Photovoltaic Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells The J-V curves of PSCs based on NiO x and NiO x /x-TBT films under standard simulated solar radiation (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm À2 ) are presented in Figure 5a. The performance parameters of PSCs are mainly PCE, open-circuit voltage (V oc ), short-circuit current density ( J sc ), and fill factor (FF). 
 FigureS12, Supporting Information. The average photovoltaic performance of the inverted PSCs based on different TBT concentrations is summarized in Table2. Each average parameter was calculated from 40 devices under the same experimental conditions. As the TBT concentration increased from 0 to 0.25 mg mL À1 , the PCE of the device increased from 18.62% to 21.84%. However, when the TBT concentration was in the range of 0.25-0.5 mg mL À1 , the V oc and J sc of the device both decreased. The EQE spectra of NiO x and NiO x /x-TBT-based devices are presented in Figure 5b. The integrated current densities of devices based on NiO x , NiO x /0.125-TBT, NiO x /0.25-TBT, and NiO x /0.5-TBT are 21.19, 22.02, 23.13, and 21.92 mA cm À2 , respectively, and it is consistent compared with the change trend of the J-V curve.The J-V curves of devices based on NiO x and NiO x /TBT (hereafter all 0.25-TBT) films in different scanning directions are presented in Figure5c,d, where forward and reverse represent forward and reverse scanning, respectively. The hysteresis index (HI) [42]  can be calculated by the formula HI ¼ ðPCE Forward À PCE Reverse Þ=PCE. By quantitative calculation, the HI of devices based on NiO and NiO x /TBT films are 0.061 and 0.011, respectively, indicating that the device based on NiO x /TBT film has good suppression of hysteresis effect. The dark-state J-V curves of devices based on NiO x and NiO x /TBT films are presented in Figure5e. The devices based on NiO x / TBT films have smaller leakage currents than those based on NiO x . When the leakage current of the battery is smaller, the corresponding short-circuit current density is larger. [31] [32] [33]  The test results of the dark state are also consistent with the measurement
