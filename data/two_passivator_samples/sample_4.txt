Title: Harnessing Surface Dipole for CsPbI 3 Perovskite Solar Cells with Poly(3-hexylthiophene)

Introduction Perovskite solar cell (PSC) efficiency has approached 83% of the Shockley-Queisser limit (theoretical limit) in its single junction and over 75% in tandem architectures.  [1] [2] [3]  However, the stability of PSCs is the chink in the armour for their market introduction.  [4, 5]  Inorganic perovskite CsPbI 3 is one of the most stable compositions reported in the field of PSCs.  [6]  Though, there has been a lot of work dedicated to its crystallization and phase stability for CsPbI 3 .  [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]  However, the CsPbI 3 -based devices need precise improvement. The most efficient devices, with record efficiencies of over 21%, are only stable for up to a few hundred hours in operational conditions.  [13, 14]  In contrast, the most stable device, which holds a record in stability with a T S80 lifetime of around 51,000 hours, has 17% efficiency.  [6]  The studies suggest room for improvement in the CsPbI 3 interface to make the devices more efficient by interfacial engineering.  [6, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]  The perovskite absorber determines the working device's stability, and the other layers are equally crucial for the best performance and stability.  [16, 17]  Generally, PSCs contain two essential charge extraction layers known as selective contacts, such as the electron-transport layer (ETL) and the hole-transport layer (HTL). The organic molecule spiro-OMeTAD (2,2 0 ,7,7 0 -tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9 0 -spirobifluorene) is one of the widely used HTLs in n-i-p device structures and is considered as the standard for the most efficient devices reported so far.  [18]  However, spiro-OMeTAD has several disadvantages for commercialization; for example, other than high cost, it is susceptible to high temperatures, needs time-consuming oxygen soaking, has film deposition issues, and requires dopants that may trigger perovskite layer degradation.  [19] [20] [21]  However, several efforts have been invested in improving its properties, which include changing the doping methods (e.g., CO 2 bubbling) and engaging dopants themselves.  [22] [23] [24]  However, the other physical properties of spiro-OMeTAD, such as temperature sensitivity and high costs, are still a problem. Hence, P3HT can be used as an alternative HTL to spiro-OMeTAD. The P3HT is comparatively low cost, easy to fabricate, and does not necessarily require doping.  [25] [26] [27]  Despite these advantages, there are some associated challenges with P3HT. It is a lower bandgap semiconductor compared to spiro-OMeTAD, i.e., ≈1.9 eV, and its conduction band minimum (CBM) is relatively close to perovskite's CBM, which results in nonradiative recombination at the interface and negatively affects the open-circuit voltage (V OC ).  [28, 29]  As a strategy to reduce recombination and resolve energetic misalignment, the interface between perovskite and P3HT is modulated by a dipole-forming molecule n-hexyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (HTAB) to mitigate the interfacial charge recombination. These 2D structures forming long-alkyl chain molecules improve phase stability and reduce surface defects.  [12, 30, 31]  We revealed that HTAB acts as a mediator between CsPbI 3 and P3HT. We have achieved over 15% power conversion efficiency (PCE) for CsPbI 3 -based solar cells with P3HT as an HTM. This work does not provide a detailed study of the nonradiative recombination and chemical interaction. Nevertheless, it can be a good starting point for a study on how the interface can be engineered for P3HT as HTL, which can be improved in future work on CsPbI 3 . DOI: 10.1002/solr.202400329 The efficient functioning of perovskite solar cells largely depends on the interaction between perovskite halide materials and the hole-transport layer poly(3hexylthiophene) (P3HT). However, a high rate of nonradiative recombination often hampers this interaction, leading to poor performance of the solar cells. We have developed a technique to modify the interface using a long-chain alkyl halide molecule called n-hexyl trimethylammonium bromide to address this issue. This modification technique significantly improves hole extraction, leading to an impressive open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V and a power conversion efficiency of 15.8% for inorganic perovskite CsPbI 3 with P3HT as a dopant-free holetransport layer. This breakthrough can pave the way for developing more efficient and sustainable solar cells. 
 Results and Discussion We have prepared the β-CsPbI 3 film as reported in our recent work on CsPbI 3 .  [32, 33]  Conventionally, a long-alkyl chain molecule, i.e., n-octyl ammonium iodide (n-OAI), is used to improve stability. Here, we have introduced n-HTAB instead of n-OAI to passivate the interface. The chemical structure of n-HTAB and P3HT is shown in Figure  S1 , Supporting Information. We performed steady-state photoluminescence (stPL) emission spectroscopy. In the stPL spectra, we observed a peak emission at 732 nm for the bare CsPbI 3 film, whereas, for the HTAB-treated CsPbI 3 film, the emission peak shifted slightly to 729 nm, corresponding to a bandgap E g of CsPbI 3 , with the reported literature values of ≈1.69-1.70 eV for CsPbI 3  [34, 35]  (see Figure  1a ). The higher PL intensity and blueshift in the emission peak indicate surface defect passivation in the HTAB-treated film.  [11, [36] [37] [38]  Further, we have conducted stPL measurements for CsPbI 3 and HTAB-treated CsPbI 3 film capped with P3HT, deposited on quartz. We also observe a blueshift (at ≈729 nm) with HTL that indicates that HTAB largely passivates the interface and surface defects (see Figure  1b ). We observe a PL quenching (a decrease in PL intensity) for HTL-capped film. Both charge extraction at the interface and defects states can contribute to the PL quenching.  [39, 40]  The technique transient surface photovoltage (trSPV) helps us to differentiate the quenching due to charge extraction and defects states.  [41]  To validate and study the charge extraction at the interface (hole selectivity), we have measured trSPV. We have used trSPV measurements to characterize the charge selectivity at the interface. The trSPV signals are directly proportional to the separated charges (SPV(t) ≈ (n(t)-p(t)) Â 0.5L) at the buried interface of a device (L is the thickness of the light absorber layer, i.e., perovskite film in our study). In our recent work, we have employed this technique to study the charge extraction induced by the surface dipoles.  [32]  It is a state-ofthe-art technique to study the interfacial charge dynamics and nonradiative recombination at the interface.  [41] [42] [43] [44]  We have measured transient SPV for different samples, i.e., CsPbI 3 , CsPbI 3 /P3HT, CsPbI 3 /HTAB, and CsPbI 3 /HTAB/P3HT (all deposited on glass/FTO/TiO 2 ). In trSPV, an exponential rise in signals with a large amplitude shows an efficient charge extraction at the interface.  [41] [42] [43]  Nonradiative recombination or misalignment of the bands leads to deaccelerated rise and damping in amplitude.  [41, 44]  These two processes (extraction and recombinations) have been highlighted in Figure  2b . TrSPV measurements suggest a significant boost of hole extraction in the HTAB-treated sample, in the presence of adjacent HTL, ≈3 times higher in the SPV amplitude and much faster signal rise than that of the bare CsPbI 3 sample in contact with the HTL. We thus attribute the higher SPV amplitude to a greater concentration of extracted free holes. It is worth mentioning that CsPbI 3 with P3HT and CsPbI 3 treated with HTAB (without P3HT) show almost similar signals, meaning favorable band banding for free hole extraction in the HTAB-treated samples. Overall, the SPV measurements show that HTAB treatment positively affects charge extraction. Further, Figure  S2b ,c, Supporting Information shows the SPV spectral response with time as contour plots in the 0.8-3 eV photon energy range. We observe a clear signal below the bandgap (1.55 eV) related to the absorption of shallow and deep defects.  [45]  HTAB-treated samples have less pronounced signals from deep defects with activation energy around 1.0 eV. These results are in agreement with the increase of PL after HTAB treatment. It can be inferred that n-HTAB may interact chemically with mobile iodine ions to reduce the iodine defects. The HTAB molecule has a long-chain aliphatic chain (C 6 H 13 À ) connected to the functional group (N þ (CH 3 ) 3 À ) as shown in Figure  S1 , Supporting Information. The functional group interacts with the mobile iodine ions through the electrostatic interactions;  [28, 46]  however, the aliphatic chain templates the self-assembly of P3HT on the surface of perovskites.  [28, 47]  These long-chain molecules make a 2D layer, improving the stability of the PSCs.  [12, 30, 31]  The trSPV measurements indicate improved charge extraction at the interface. However, understanding the mechanism behind this enhanced extraction necessitates a closer examination of the energetics at the interfaces. We have employed the Kelvin probe (KP) method to measure the work function (WF), denoted as (Φ), which represents the energy difference between the vacuum level E vac and the Fermi level (E f ) of the material, as described in Equation (  1 )  Φ ¼ E vac À E f (1) The determination of the WF is crucial to explain free hole extraction enhancement from the point of view of energy-level alignments. It is known that the CBM of P3HT is very close to the perovskite CBM, which gives rise to nonradiative recombination due to the recombination of photogenerated electrons.  [28, 29, 48]  The energy levels of a material can be tuned by dipoles that cause a change in vacuum level (E vac ), CBM, and VBM as well.  [49]  To investigate the impact of the HTAB molecule on energy levels, we conducted KP measurements on CsPbI 3 , CsPbI 3 /P3HT, and CsPbI 3 /HTAB/P3HT (all deposited on glass/FTO) as shown in Figure  S3 , Supporting Information. Figure  3  illustrates that WF shifts downward in energy. The downward shift in the WF indicates the dipole formation at the HTL.  [49, 50]  This implies that HTAB acts as a Lewis base and its treatment induces a change in the interface that improves energy-level alignment. These results agree with enhanced charge extraction and improved band bending by HTAB at the interface. Further, we have used bare CsPbI 3 and HTAB-capped CsPbI 3 absorbers to fabricate n-i-p devices in the following architecture: glass/FTO/compact-TiO 2 /CsPbI 3 /P3HT/Au and glass/FTO/ compact-TiO 2 /CsPbI 3 :HTAB/P3HT/Au as shown in Figure  4a . Figure  4b  shows J-V curves for the champion devices with and without HTAB-treated CsPbI 3 films. The HTAB-treated absorber-based device exhibits a PCE of 15.8%, a V OC of 1.14 V, a current density ( J SC ) of 19.4 mA cm À2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 71.4%, clearly outperforming the champion device without HTAB, reaching a PCE of 12.9%, a V OC of 1.07 V, a J SC of 19.2 mA cm À2 , and an FF of 62.3% (Table  S1 , Supporting Information). It also shows that HTAB-treated devices show less hysteresis and better stability as compared to other devices and stabilize PCE for an initial 500 s at maximum power point, as  demonstrated in Figure  4c . Generally, it needs a light soaking for inorganic PSCs to achieve high efficiency.  [51]  There has been a lot of discussion about the "light soaking effect" and its mechanism in PSCs.  [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57]  Considering the higher PCE of target HTAB devices, it will need a longer soaking time to reach equilibrium. Additionally, formed dipoles can play a role in transient behaviour. We attribute enhancement in device performance to dipole formation at the interface and defect passivation that leads to an improved charge extraction.  [58, 59]  The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum tells the conversion efficiency of photons illuminated on a solar cell to collected electrons at individual wavelengths. Figure  4d  shows the EQE spectra of the champion devices with their J-V curves given in Figure  4b . It indicates that HTAB-treated devices exhibit an EQE of around 90% in broad wavelengths ranging from 400 to 590 nm, indicating a reduction in nonradiative recombinations.  [60]  It is reported that, for all compositions, open-circuit voltage loss (defined as E g ÀeV oc , whereas E g is the optical bandgap of the absorber, e is the elementary charge, and V oc is the measured open-circuit voltage of the device) is higher in inorganic PSCs than in organic-inorganic solar cells due to energy-level misalignment at the interfaces.  [48, 61]  Here, we see a clear improvement in V OC from 1.01 V to 1.14 V for our champion devices, which infers a better energy alignment at the interface due to this dipole molecule treatment. The significant increase in V OC and EQE indicates the reduction in nonradiative recombination at the interfaces due to less defects as revealed by PL and trSPV measurements.  [62, 63]   
 Conclusion Due to its low cost and temperature robustness, the organic dopant-free polymer P3HT can be an alternative to relatively temperature-sensitive spiro-OMeTAD as HTL in n-i-p devices. However, it requires improvement of nonradiative recombination losses and energetic alignment at the interface. We have employed a dipole molecule to mitigate these challenges. This dipole-forming molecule helps to improve the film quality by decreasing the surface defects. The molecule HTAB forms a layer on the CsPbI 3 surface and induces a surface dipole that leads to better energy levels at the interface. The trSPV measurements reveal that HTAB acts as a charge extraction mediator and also passivates the sub-bandgap defects in CsPbI 3 . We also observed PL quenching in HTL-capped samples, indicating a charge extraction. It further suggests a boost in charge extraction in HTAB-treated samples. With HTAB-treated CsPbI 3 film, over 15% efficiency was achieved for dopant-free P3HT-based devices. This work further suggests that dopant-free devices can endure the higher temperature under operational conditions.

 FTO substrates cleaning Patterned FTO substrates (TEC 15, Yingkou company, with dimensions 2.5 cm×2.5 cm) were numbered on the back side (glass side). These numbers were designated to every device. Substrates were cleaned with 2% Mucosal solution with a very fine brush to clean the FTO surface, then washed with distilled water to remove soap contents. Afterwards, cleaned with acetone and isopropanol for 15 min by sonication. After drying with a nitrogen gun, the substrates were placed in a UV-ozone cleaner for 15 minutes right before the titanium oxide layer deposition.

 Device Fabrication 
 I. TiO2 compact layer TiO2 compact layer was deposited by spray pyrolysis with oxygen as the carrier gas. 16 substrates were placed on a hot plate installed inside a fume hood. One edge of each substrate is covered by around 5 mm using a cover glass to keep the conductive FTO side exposed for low contact resistance. Then the substrates were heated up to 450 °C and were kept at this temperature for 15 min before and 30 min after the spray of the precursor solution. The whole solution was transferred into a spray nozzle and sprayed roughly 20 cm away from the substrates with an inclination angle of 45 degrees, with at least 20 seconds of delay between each spraying cycle. Afterward, substrates were left to cool down to room temperature and then put in an ozone chamber for 15 minutes before perovskite film deposition. 
 II. Deposition of control perovskite films After the ozone treatment, substrates were transferred into a glove box filled with nitrogen (O2 <0.1 ppm, H2O <0.1 ppm). The substrates were placed on a hot plate at 70 °C for 5 min before perovskite deposition. 80-100 µl perovskite solution was added and spin-coated quickly at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds. Then 350 µl MACl solution was dropped on the top and spin-coated for another 35 seconds. The wet films were then annealed in a dry air box with a relative humidity (RH) of ~ 1% for 1 min at 210 °C. Afterward, substrates were transferred back to a nitrogen-filled glove box, where 100 µl HTAB solution was dropped on the top and spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 seconds, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 1 min. 
 III. Deposition of HTAB molecule and P3HT A 1 mM solution of n-hexyl trimethylammonium bromide (HTAB) solution was prepared in a solvent mixture containing o-dichlorobenzene and isopropanol in a 97:3 v/v ratio. The solution was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 seconds on a perovskite layer and then the film was annealed for 1 minute at 150°C. The HTM layer of P3HT was deposited by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds, while its 5 mg/ml solution was made in a solvent mixture of chlorobenzene and diphenyl ether in a 97:3 ratio. 
 IV. Deposition of metal contact Gold was evaporated using a thermal evaporator under a vacuum of approximately 1*10 -6 pa. The deposition rate was at 0.02 Å/s for the first 1 nm, 0.1-0.2 Å/s for the following 5 nm, and then 0.5 Å/s until 20 nm and then 1Å/s for the rest of the deposition. Overall, it takes around 25 min for the deposition of 100 nm of gold. The active area of the device was 0.18 cm 2 defined by the shallow mask. 
 Solar cell characterization The light source was provided by an Oriel LCS-100 class ABB solar simulator (1Sun, AM1.5G, 100 mWcm -2 ) installed inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Before the light J-V measurement, the light intensity was calibrated with a silicon reference cell (Fraunhofer ISE). A Keithley power meter (2400 SMU) was used for the bias application to solar cells for the J-V scans, programmed by LabView. The bias was applied to scan from 1.25 V to -0.1 V back and forth, with a scan rate of 200 mV/s and a step size of 0.02 V. 
 EQE measurements EQE spectra were recorded with the TracQ-Basic software, connected to the light source (Oriel Instruments QEPVSI-b system integrated with a Newport 300 W xenon arc lamp) with an optical fiber. The spectrum of the light source was calibrated with a Si reference cell with a known spectral response before the measurement. The monochromatic light was provided by a Newport Cornerstone 260 monochromator with a chopping frequency of 78 Hz. 
 Absolute Photoluminescence Spectroscopy (PL) A 445 nm CW laser (Insaneware) was used as the excitation source for the PL measurements with an optical fiber connected to an integrating sphere where samples were loaded. Samples for the PL measurements were encapsulated with a cover glass before being taken out of a nitrogen-filled glovebox. 
 Kelvin probe measurement for Work Function The measurement of WF was performed by the non-contact and non-destructive Kelvin probe method, in which the sample and probe form a parallel plate capacitor. 
 Transient surface photovoltage (tr-SPV) measurements Charge extraction in the time range of 5 ns up to 0.5 s was studied by non-contact SPV measurements exited by 5 ns above bandgap laser (1.8 eV). We used fluences of 0.072 µJ, which corresponds to a carrier concentration of 3×10 15 cm -3 close to 1 sun operation conditions. Detailed SPV setup description is given in our previous study  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]  . Contour plots were recorded with a tunable laser in the range 0.6-3 eV using fluences of 72 µJ to ensure a good signal-tonoise ratio.
