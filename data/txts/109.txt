Conformal quantum dot-SnO 2 layers as electron transporters for efficient perovskite solar cells
suggesting that PAA played a key role in forming the uniform and contiguous layer of paa-QD-SnO 2 ETL, as shown in fig.  S3 . Element mapping with energy-disperse x-ray spectroscopy of Ti (Fig.  1 , C and D) and Sn (Fig.  1, E  and F ) revealed a coverage of TiO 2 and SnO 2 over the FTO surface for both QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 and paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayers. The selected-area electron diffraction generated by TEM for the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer (fig.  S4 ) showed that both QD-SnO 2 and c-TiO 2 were polycrystalline. The paa-QD-SnO 2 had a particle size of ~4 nm (fig.  S4C ), which is also confirmed by the TEM images (fig.  S5, A to C ) and dynamic light scattering analysis (fig.  S5, D  and E ). The interactions between PAA and QD-SnO 2 were studied by the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (fig.  S6 ) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements (fig.  S7 ). It is clear from the XPS measurements that both QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 and paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayers showed characteristic peaks attributed to Sn (fig.  S6A ); however, the Sn 3d peaks of paa-QD-SnO 2 shifted to high binding energy by ~0.2 eV compared with that of QD-SnO 2 , indicating that PAA was bonded to the QD-SnO 2 . No obvious difference was observed for the O 1s characteristic peaks (fig.  S6 , B to D). FTIR measurements showed
Improvements to perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have focused on increasing their power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability and maintaining high performance upon scale-up to module sizes. We report that replacing the commonly used mesoporous-titanium dioxide electron transport layer (ETL) with a thin layer of polyacrylic acid-stabilized tin(IV) oxide quantum dots (paa-QD-SnO 2 ) on the compact-titanium dioxide enhanced light capture and largely suppressed nonradiative recombination at the ETL-perovskite interface. The use of paa-QD-SnO 2 as electron-selective contact enabled PSCs (0.08 square centimeters) with a PCE of 25.7% (certified 25.4%) and high operational stability and facilitated the scale-up of the PSCs to larger areas. PCEs of  23.3, 21.7 , and 20.6% were achieved for PSCs with active areas of 1, 20, and 64 square centimeters, respectively. E fforts to realize metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of >23% have focused on formamidinium-rich lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) formulations (1-7) because their narrower bandgap is closer to the Shockley-Queisser optimum than for methylammoniumbased or mixed-halide perovskites  (8) . By fully using the broad absorption spectrum of FAPbI 3 , a certified PCE of 25.21% with a short-circuit current density (J sc ) of >26 mA/cm 2 was obtained for the mesoporous-structure PSCs  (7) . However, the mesoporous-TiO 2 (m-TiO 2 ) electron transport layer (ETL) may show unwanted photocatalytic effects under ultraviolet (UV) light illumination, and the low electron mobility of m-TiO 2 limits the charge transport  (9) (10) (11) . Among alternative metal oxide ETLs (10-17) for PSCs, SnO 2 -based PSCs could potentially be more efficient and stable given that SnO 2 is UV resistant and has a higher carrier mobility than TiO 2 , which facilitates electron extraction and transport  (10) (11) (12) . Several techniques, such as spin coating  (11, 16) , atomic layer deposition  (1) , and chemical bath deposition (CBD)  (12, 17) , have been used to deposit the SnO 2 ETLs. Spin-coated SnO 2 ETL from a SnO 2 colloidal quantum dot (QD-SnO 2 ) solution onto the indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) substrate enabled a certified PCE of >23% for the corresponding planar-structure PSCs  (2, 16) . Recently, a thin SnO 2 ETL on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) deposited with a well-controlled CBD method enabled PSCs with a certified PCE of 25.19%, because of the improved carrier properties of SnO 2 ETL  (17) . However, compared with the m-TiO 2 -based PSCs, the SnO 2 -based PSCs still suffered from a relatively low J sc of <26 mA/cm 2 , which is attributed to the optical losses arising from reflection and destructive interference of the incident light waves at the interfaces. One approach to reduce these optical losses is to use the textured surface of FTO as the front contact that scatters the incoming radiation, destroying the coherence of the incoming light and affording light trapping by increasing the optical path length  (18) . The enhanced light absorption by the perovskite benefits the photocurrent delivered by the photovoltaic (PV) cell. Similar strategies have been used for textured crystalline silicon-based PSCs  (19) . However, early efforts to deposit a thin, uniform, and high-quality SnO 2 ETL using a solution process were incompatible with the underlying textured FTO surface  (1, 12, (20) (21) (22) , causing optical losses. The highest reported J sc of SnO 2 -based PSCs of ~25.2 mA/cm 2   (17, 20)  still limits the overall PV performance. Here we introduce an architecture for the ETL of PSCs that consists of a compact-TiO 2 (c-TiO 2 ) blocking layer covered by a thin layer of polyacrylic acid (PAA)-stabilized QD-SnO 2 (paa-QD-SnO 2 ) deposited in a contiguous and conformal manner on the textured FTO. The uniform bilayer of paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 largely improved the perovskite's absorption of sunlight and formed an outstanding electron-selective contact with the perovskite film. The quantum size effect increased the bandgap of the QD-SnO 2 from 3.6 eV for bulk SnO 2 to ~4 eV  (21, 23)  and produced a corresponding upward shift of its conduction band edge energy. This shift aligned it well with the conduction band edge of the perovskite so that electron capture by the SnO 2 -based ETL proceeded with minimal energy losses  (5, 11, 16, 21) . PAA, a polymer binder, was added to the SnO 2 QD solution to attach the colloidal QD-SnO 2 firmly to the c-TiO 2 surface, providing a contiguous, thin, and conformal SnO 2 layer that fully covered the c-TiO 2 layer underneath. The carboxyl groups of PAA undergo strong hydrogen and coordinative bonding with the metal oxide surface, facilitating the lamination process, especially for production on a large scale  (24) (25) (26) . By choosing FTO substrates with suitable diffuse transmittance and reflectance, the textured paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer enabled a PCE of 25.7% (certified 25.4%) with a J sc of 26.4 mA/cm 2 and high stability for the corresponding PSCs. We further demonstrate that the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer could be applied to realize large PSC modules with an active area up to 64 cm 2 while maintaining a PCE of >20%. We investigated the microstructures of the spin-coated QD-SnO 2 layer on the c-TiO 2 using commercially available SnO 2 colloidal QDs with and without PAA. Unless otherwise noted, the QD-SnO 2 solution was diluted by deionized water  (1:20)  in this study. Figure  S1 , A to C, shows the top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the c-TiO 2 , QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 , and paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 , respectively. Because of the textured surface, the c-TiO 2 layer was not fully covered by the spin-coated QD-SnO 2 (fig.  S1B ). In contrast, a uniform, conformal paa-QD-SnO 2 layer was formed (fig.  S1C ). Atomic force microscopy images (fig.  S1 , D to F) further confirmed the uniform morphology of the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 (fig.  S1F ), which is different from that of the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 (fig.  S1E ). Figure  1 , A and B, shows the cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 and paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayers on FTO substrates, respectively. The QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer presented an ununiform distribution over the FTO surface with a thickness that varied from ~30 (vertex region) to ~70 nm (valley region), while the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer had a uniform and conformal distribution over the FTO surface with a uniform thickness of ~30 nm. The different distribution between QD-SnO 2 and paa-QD-SnO 2 layers can also be seen clearly from the cross-sectional SEM images (fig.  S2, A  and B ), peaks at ~2954 and ~1716 cm -1 that arise from C-H and C=O stretching vibrations of PAA (fig.  S7A ) and a characteristic peak at ~574 cm -1 of the Sn-O vibration (fig.  S7B ). The Sn-O peak shifted to ~594 cm -1 for the paa-QD-SnO 2 , and the C-H and C=O stretching vibrations shifted to ~3012 and ~1628 cm -1 , respectively (fig.  S7C ), demonstrating that PAA interacted with QD-SnO 2  (27) . We chose FAPbI 3 as the perovskite layer, and details of its fabrication can be found in the supplementary materials (SM) or a previous report  (3) . Top-view SEM images of the FAPbI 3 films spin-coated on different ETLs, including c-TiO 2 , m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 , QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 , and paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 , are shown in fig.  S8 , A to D, respectively. Compact and dense surface morphologies were observed for all the perovskite films. Figure  S9A  showed identical x-ray diffraction (XRD) peak positions for all samples at 14.1°and 28.2°, which correspond to the (001) and (002) crystal planes of a-FAPbI 3  (3) (4) (5) . All the perovskite films had identical full width at half maximum for the main (001) peak (fig.  S9B ). We conclude that the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films are not affected substantially by the different ETLs. The PSCs with an active area of 0.08 cm 2 were fabricated in a conventional n-i-p structure, FTO/ETL/perovskite/OAI/spiro-MeOTAD/Au, where OAI is octylammonium iodide and spiro-MeOTAD is 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene. We performed the quasi-steady-state current-voltage (QSS-IV) measurement (Fig.  2A ), which was used for the certification of PSCs by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Newport Inc. Details of the QSS-IV measurements are given in the SM. All the PSCs were fully aged in the ambient condition for 100 hours before the measurements. The c-TiO 2 -based cell had a low PCE of 17.27% under the QSS-IV measurement. For the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based PSC, a PCE of 23.74% with a J sc of 25.74 mA/cm 2 , an opencircuit voltage (V oc ) of 1.142 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 80.79% was obtained, which are consistent with the previous reports  (3, 7) . Compared with the mesoporous-structured devices, the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cell had a higher V oc of 1.164 V but a lower J sc of 25.12 mA/cm 2 , resulting in a PCE of 23.29%. The J sc of the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based PSC is similar to the values reported for the SnO 2 -based cells in the literature  (17, 20) . With the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 ETL, the PSC exhibited a high PCE of 25.18% with a considerably improved J sc of 26.28 mA/cm 2 , V oc of 1.177 V, and FF of 81.49%, matching the 25.39% efficiency certified by Newport Inc. (figs. S10 and S11). The conventional J-V measurements under both forward and reverse scans were also performed (fig.  S12 ). The detailed PV parameters are summarized in table  S1 . A substantially different PV value was obtained for the c-TiO 2 -based cell under QSS-IV (Fig.  2A ) and conventional J-V measurements (fig.  S12A ), whereas the other cells showed similar PV results, indicating that the c-TiO 2 -based cell is unstable and that the single c-TiO 2 layer is not a proper ETL for PSCs  (28, 29) . The contrasting feature of the c-TiO 2 -based cell compared with the other cells in Fig.  2A  and fig. S12A is discussed in note 1 of the SM. Hereafter, the c-TiO 2 -based cells will not be discussed. A statistical distribution of the PCE of all the PSCs (Fig.  2B ) shows that the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based PSC had the highest averaged values. Details of the statistical PV parameters of all different ETL-based cells are shown in fig.  S13 . The paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cell is the target of the discussions that follow. The J sc of the PSCs measured under the solar simulator was verified with external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. The target cell had slightly higher EQE than the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based PSC over the entire absorption spectrum (Fig.  2C ), resulting in a higher integrated J sc of 26.01 mA/cm 2 ; however, a relatively lower integrated J sc of 25.06 mA/cm 2 was obtained for the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based device than for the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cell (25.69 mA/cm 2 ). The high J sc of the target cell was attributed to the desired light scattering that prolongs the optical length, enhancing the light absorption by the perovskite with the conformal structured paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer over the FTO substrate. This is confirmed with the highest diffuse transmittance (haze) of paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 when compared with the other ETLs shown in fig.  S14A . The higher transmittance of paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 than the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 (fig.  S14B ) may be traced back to the thinner film thickness, as shown in the optical simulations (fig.  S14, C  and D ), which could also contribute to the high J sc . We further compared the J sc obtained for the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2based PSCs using different substrates (fig.  S15 ). The Asahi FTO glass with high diffuse transmittance was the most suitable substrate for achieving a high J sc . The effect of the ETL composition on the photon flux emitted by the PSCs measured in steady state at an excitation photon flux equivalent to 1 sun is shown in Fig.  2D . The investigated devices were complete solar cells without the Au back contact. Compared with the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2and QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2based devices, the target cell had much higher photoluminescence (PL) intensity, reaching a PL quantum yield (PLQY) of 7.5%. This indicates a reduced nonradiative recombination at the interface between perovskite and paa-QD-SnO 2 ETL. Details of the measurements and calculations of PLQY are shown in SM note 2. From the PLQY measurements, we derived the quasi-Fermi level splitting (DE F ) in the perovskite under 1 sun illumination (SM note 3) and compared the (DE F ) with the V oc measured from the same device. DE F and V oc showed the same trend, indicating that the V oc increase can be partly attributed to the reduced nonradiative recombination. The DE F / q-V oc offset (where q is the elementary charge), however, is different. For the target cell, it is 10 mV lower than that of the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2based cells, indicating a better energetic alignment at the interfaces  (30) . Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements on the surface of different ETLs (fig.  S16 ) showed that the conduction band of paa-QD-SnO 2 matched better with perovskite than the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 , which could facilitate the charge transfer from perovskite to the ETL (fig.  S17 ). Detailed analysis of the UPS data is shown in SM note 4. Figure  S18, A  and B , shows the time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of the perovskite films on different ETLs measured from both the perovskite and the glass sides. The perovskite film deposited on paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 had the fastest decay among all the samples. Because it has a low nonradiative recombination rate, the fast decay is dominated by the favored interfacial electron transfer. The electron mobility measurements (fig.  S18C ) revealed that the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 layer had the highest carrier mobility. All these results indicate a superior charge extraction from perovskite to the paa-QD-SnO 2 ETL. Regarding the reduced nonradiative recombination, we determined the EQE of electroluminescence (EQE EL ) on representative PSC devices. Figure  2E  shows an EQE EL of 12.5% for the target cell at an injection current density of 26 mA/cm 2 corresponding to the J sc under 1 sun illumination, whereas the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2and QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cells have an EQE EL of 2.5 and 8.3%, respectively, under the same conditions. Thus, the nonradiative recombination rate in the PSC was reduced by 80% simply by replacing the m-TiO 2 with a paa-QD-SnO 2 electron-selective contact layer. The highest obtained V oc of 1.22 V (fig.  S19 ), which is near the V oc predicted from EQE EL according to the reciprocity theorem  (31, 32) , measured without the metal mask reached 98% of the radiative limit V oc (1.25 V)  (2, 5) . We also conducted transient photovoltage measurements for the PSCs (fig.  S20A ). The target cell showed a slower V oc decay than the reference cells, indicating a slower charge recombination rate. The dark J-V curves (fig.  S20B ) showed the lowest reverse saturation current for the target cell, pushing the onset of the dark current to the highest voltages, which also reflected the lowest interfacial nonradiative recombination. Figure  2F  shows the light intensitydependent V oc measurements for the PSCs. For both the reference and target cells, the measured V oc was linearly dependent on the logarithm of the light intensity. The diode ideality factor n id , deduced from the slope described by n id k B T/q, where k B is the Boltzmann constant and T is temperature, was 1.83, 1.79, and 1.46 for the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2and QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cells and the target cell, respectively. The reduced n id contributed to the increased FF of the target cell, as the FF critically depends on the n id  (33) . The reduced n id is also consistent with the PLQY, TRPL, EQE EL , transient photovoltage decay, and dark J-V measurements, unambiguously supporting the conclusion of reduced nonradiative recombination of the target PSC using paa-QD-SnO 2 ETL. The decreased nonradiative recombination manifests itself by much stronger photoand electroluminescence (Fig.  2, C  and D ) as well as a lower ideality factor (Fig.  2E ) enabling very high fill factor of 83.8% to be reached by our target device (table  S2 ). Further strong support for our conclusion comes from the observation of a slower transient photovoltage decay (fig.  S20A ) and higher electron mobility (fig.  S20B ) as well as the dark J-V measurements of the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2based cell compared with the control devices. The substantial reduction of the trap-assisted nonradiative recombination is the main reason for the reduced V oc deficit of our target cell of ~310 mV as compared with ~350 mV for the mesoporous-structure cell [bandgap of our perovskite film was calculated to be 1.53 eV (3)], which is one of the lowest values reported in the field of PSCs. Scale-up of the PSCs to module size is another requirement for their commercial exploitation. We used paa-QD-SnO 2 @TiO 2 ETL to fabricate perovskite solar mini-modules with active areas up to 64 cm 2 . Details of the fabrication process for the solar modules can be found in the SM and movie S1. Figure  3A  shows the J-V curves and images of the perovskite mini-modules with different active areas. The highest PCEs achieved for the PSCs with active areas of 1, 20, and 64 cm 2 were 23.3, 21.7, and 20.6%, respectively. Movie S2 shows a typical measurement for the 64 cm 2 perovskite solar modules. Figure  S21A  illustrates a solar module with subcells connected in series with a magnified view of the contact connections, and a geometrical FF (GFF) was calculated to be 95.6% according to the SEM images (fig.  S21B ) of the interconnections. Details of the PV parameters are summarized in table  S2 . The decrease of the PCE with increased device size is mainly caused by a decreased FF. The V oc of the module (table  S2 ) divided by the number of stripes is 18.5 V/16 = 1.156 V, which is equal to the V oc of the 1 cm 2 cell. Hence, there is no additional V oc loss in the module. Therefore, we attribute the FF decrease to the increased series resistance, including transport layer resistances, contact resistances, and interconnect resistance. We sent the PSC modules to an independent laboratory (OMA Company, Republic of Korea) for certification. PCEs of 21.66% (fig.  S22 ) and 20.55% (fig.  S23 ) were confirmed for the PSC mini-modules with active areas of 20 and 64 cm 2 , respectively, which agreed well with the measurements in our laboratory, and are compared with other reported values in fig.  S24 . We further compared the statistical distribution of the PCEs for the mesoporous-based (Fig.  3B ) and target (Fig.  3C ) perovskite minimodules. For the perovskite modules with the same active area (1, 20, or 64 cm 2 ), the target modules had higher averaged PCE and narrower PCE distributions than the mesoporousbased modules. The averaged PCE of the 64 cm 2 PSC module increased by ~30% by simply replacing the m-TiO 2 with paa-QD-SnO 2 , indicating that the paa-QD-SnO 2 could be uniformly coated on the large-size substrates. The statistical distribution of the PV parameters (fig.  S25 ) further revealed that the V oc and FF of the mesoporous-based modules decreased significantly more than that of the target PSC modules. The shunt resistance of our solar modules retained a typical value of >4000 ohms•cm 2 (table  S3 ), indicating that losses from leakage currents across shunts produced during scale-up are negligible. We attribute the small decrease of V oc and FF for the target PSC modules to the low contact resistance (fig.  S26, A  and B ) because of the easier laser scribing as well as low series resistance and low interfacial defects of the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer. Figure  4A  shows the 1000-hour shelf life tested with unsealed devices in ambient air at 25% relative humidity (RH) and 25°C. The target PSC retained 80% of the maximum PCE (25.7%) after 1000-hour storage, whereas the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2and QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2based PSCs decreased to almost 30 and 40% of the initial efficiency, respectively, indicating that the target cell is more resistant to the moisture and oxygen than the widely used mesoporous structured PSCs. We also performed the operational stability test for the unsealed devices in a N 2 environment under maximum power point (MPP) tracking conditions using a light-emitting diode lamp with a calibrated light intensity of 100 mW/cm 2 . More details about the MPP tests can be found in the SM and in previous reports  (5, 7) . Figure  4B  shows that the target cell had higher PCE than the reference cell during the 350-hour MPP tracking test. From the detailed PV parameters during the MPP tracking measure-ments (fig.  S27 ), it is clear that the higher performance of the target PSC is due to the higher and rather stable V oc , which decreased less compared with the reference cells. The main degradation of the target cell is the decline of FF (fig.  S27 ), which is attributed to the de-doping of lithium from the hole-transport layer (HTL)  (5, 34) . We further tested the sealed devices under ambient conditions. Figure  S28  shows that 70.5% of the initial efficiency of the target cell was retained after 700-hour light-soaking test, whereas the efficiency of the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cell declined 45% over the same testing time. To assess the suitability of the cells for real applications, we performed an MPP stability test for the encapsulated target cell under ambient conditions. Figure  S29  shows that 95% of the initial efficiency was retained for the sealed target cell after 100 hours MPP tracking and 2 hours dark recovery under ambient conditions. The substantial decline of FF is still the main reason for the performance loss. Future studies of additive-free HTLs will be conducted to enhance the stability of PSCs. Improvements to perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have focused on increasing their power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability and maintaining high performance upon scale-up to module sizes. We report that replacing the commonly used mesoporous-titanium dioxide electron transport layer (ETL) with a thin layer of polyacrylic acid-stabilized tin(IV) oxide quantum dots (paa-QD-SnO 2 ) on the compact-titanium dioxide enhanced light capture and largely suppressed nonradiative recombination at the ETL-perovskite interface. The use of paa-QD-SnO 2 as electron-selective contact enabled PSCs (0.08 square centimeters) with a PCE of 25.7% (certified 25.4%) and high operational stability and facilitated the scale-up of the PSCs to larger areas. PCEs of 23.3, 21.7, and 20.6% were achieved for PSCs with active areas of 1, 20, and 64 square centimeters, respectively. E fforts to realize metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of >23% have focused on formamidinium-rich lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) formulations (1-7) because their narrower bandgap is closer to the Shockley-Queisser optimum than for methylammoniumbased or mixed-halide perovskites  (8) . By fully using the broad absorption spectrum of FAPbI 3 , a certified PCE of 25.21% with a short-circuit current density (J sc ) of >26 mA/cm 2 was obtained for the mesoporous-structure PSCs  (7) . However, the mesoporous-TiO 2 (m-TiO 2 ) electron transport layer (ETL) may show unwanted photocatalytic effects under ultraviolet (UV) light illumination, and the low electron mobility of m-TiO 2 limits the charge transport  (9) (10) (11) . Among alternative metal oxide ETLs (10-17) for PSCs, SnO 2 -based PSCs could potentially be more efficient and stable given that SnO 2 is UV resistant and has a higher carrier mobility than TiO 2 , which facilitates electron extraction and transport  (10) (11) (12) . Several techniques, such as spin coating  (11, 16) , atomic layer deposition (1), and chemical bath deposition (CBD)  (12, 17) , have been used to deposit the SnO 2 ETLs. Spin-coated SnO 2 ETL from a SnO 2 colloidal quantum dot (QD-SnO 2 ) solution onto the indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) substrate enabled a certified PCE of >23% for the corresponding planar-structure PSCs  (2, 16) . Recently, a thin SnO 2 ETL on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) deposited with a well-controlled CBD method enabled PSCs with a certified PCE of 25.19%, because of the improved carrier properties of SnO 2 ETL  (17) . However, compared with the m-TiO 2 -based PSCs, the SnO 2 -based PSCs still suffered from a relatively low J sc of <26 mA/cm 2 , which is attributed to the optical losses arising from reflection and destructive interference of the incident light waves at the interfaces. One approach to reduce these optical losses is to use the textured surface of FTO as the front contact that scatters the incoming radiation, destroying the coherence of the incoming light and affording light trapping by increasing the optical path length  (18) . The enhanced light absorption by the perovskite benefits the photocurrent delivered by the photovoltaic (PV) cell. Similar strategies have been used for textured crystalline silicon-based PSCs  (19) . However, early efforts to deposit a thin, uniform, and high-quality SnO 2 ETL using a solution process were incompatible with the underlying textured FTO surface  (1, 12, (20) (21) (22) , causing optical losses. The highest reported J sc of SnO 2 -based PSCs of ~25.2 mA/cm 2  (17, 20)  still limits the overall PV performance. Here we introduce an architecture for the ETL of PSCs that consists of a compact-TiO 2 (c-TiO 2 ) blocking layer covered by a thin layer of polyacrylic acid (PAA)-stabilized QD-SnO 2 (paa-QD-SnO 2 ) deposited in a contiguous and conformal manner on the textured FTO. The uniform bilayer of paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 largely improved the perovskite's absorption of sunlight and formed an outstanding electron-selective contact with the perovskite film. The quantum size effect increased the bandgap of the QD-SnO 2 from 3.6 eV for bulk SnO 2 to ~4 eV  (21, 23)  and produced a corresponding upward shift of its conduction band edge energy. This shift aligned it well with the conduction band edge of the perovskite so that electron capture by the SnO 2 -based ETL proceeded with minimal energy losses  (5, 11, 16, 21) . PAA, a polymer binder, was added to the SnO 2 QD solution to attach the colloidal QD-SnO 2 firmly to the c-TiO 2 surface, providing a contiguous, thin, and conformal SnO 2 layer that fully covered the c-TiO 2 layer underneath. The carboxyl groups of PAA undergo strong hydrogen and coordinative bonding with the metal oxide surface, facilitating the lamination process, especially for production on a large scale  (24) (25) (26) . By choosing FTO substrates with suitable diffuse transmittance and reflectance, the textured paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer enabled a PCE of 25.7% (certified 25.4%) with a J sc of 26.4 mA/cm 2 and high stability for the corresponding PSCs. We further demonstrate that the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer could be applied to realize large PSC modules with an active area up to 64 cm 2 while maintaining a PCE of >20%. We investigated the microstructures of the spin-coated QD-SnO 2 layer on the c-TiO 2 using commercially available SnO 2 colloidal QDs with and without PAA. Unless otherwise noted, the QD-SnO 2 solution was diluted by deionized water (1:20) in this study. Figure  S1 , A to C, shows the top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the c-TiO 2 , QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 , and paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 , respectively. Because of the textured surface, the c-TiO 2 layer was not fully covered by the spin-coated QD-SnO 2 (fig.  S1B ). In contrast, a uniform, conformal paa-QD-SnO 2 layer was formed (fig.  S1C ). Atomic force microscopy images (fig.  S1 , D to F) further confirmed the uniform morphology of the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 (fig.  S1F ), which is different from that of the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 (fig.  S1E ). Figure  1 , A and B, shows the cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 and paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayers on FTO substrates, respectively. The QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer presented an ununiform distribution over the FTO surface with a thickness that varied from ~30 (vertex region) to ~70 nm (valley region), while the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer had a uniform and conformal distribution over the FTO surface with a uniform thickness of ~30 nm. The different distribution between QD-SnO 2 and paa-QD-SnO 2 layers can also be seen clearly from the cross-sectional SEM images (fig.  S2, A  and B ), suggesting that PAA played a key role in forming the uniform and contiguous layer of paa-QD-SnO 2 ETL, as shown in fig.  S3 . Element mapping with energy-disperse x-ray spectroscopy of Ti (Fig.  1, C  and D ) and Sn (Fig.  1, E  and F ) revealed a coverage of TiO 2 and SnO 2 over the FTO surface for both QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 and paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayers. The selected-area electron diffraction generated by TEM for the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer (fig.  S4 ) showed that both QD-SnO 2 and c-TiO 2 were polycrystalline. The paa-QD-SnO 2 had a particle size of ~4 nm (fig.  S4C ), which is also confirmed by the TEM images (fig.  S5, A to C ) and dynamic light scattering analysis (fig.  S5, D  and E ). The interactions between PAA and QD-SnO 2 were studied by the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (fig.  S6 ) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements (fig.  S7 ). It is clear from the XPS measurements that both QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 and paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayers showed characteristic peaks attributed to Sn (fig.  S6A ); however, the Sn 3d peaks of paa-QD-SnO 2 shifted to high binding energy by ~0.2 eV compared with that of QD-SnO 2 , indicating that PAA was bonded to the QD-SnO peaks at ~2954 and ~1716 cm -1 that arise from C-H and C=O stretching vibrations of PAA (fig.  S7A ) and a characteristic peak at ~574 cm -1 of the Sn-O vibration (fig.  S7B ). The Sn-O peak shifted to ~594 cm -1 for the paa-QD-SnO 2 , and the C-H and C=O stretching vibrations shifted to ~3012 and ~1628 cm -1 , respectively (fig.  S7C ), demonstrating that PAA interacted with QD-SnO 2  (27) . We chose FAPbI 3 as the perovskite layer, and details of its fabrication can be found in the supplementary materials (SM) or a previous report  (3) . Top-view SEM images of the FAPbI 3 films spin-coated on different ETLs, including c-TiO 2 , m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 , QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 , and paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 , are shown in fig.  S8 , A to D, respectively. Compact and dense surface morphologies were observed for all the perovskite films. Figure  S9A  showed identical x-ray diffraction (XRD) peak positions for all samples at 14.1°and 28.2°, which correspond to the (001) and (002) crystal planes of a-FAPbI 3  (3) (4) (5) . All the perovskite films had identical full width at half maximum for the main (001) peak (fig.  S9B ). We conclude that the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films are not affected substantially by the different ETLs. The PSCs with an active area of 0.08 cm 2 were fabricated in a conventional n-i-p structure, FTO/ETL/perovskite/OAI/spiro-MeOTAD/Au, where OAI is octylammonium iodide and spiro-MeOTAD is 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene. We performed the quasi-steady-state current-voltage (QSS-IV) measurement (Fig.  2A ), which was used for the certification of PSCs by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Newport Inc. Details of the QSS-IV measurements are given in the SM. All the PSCs were fully aged in the ambient condition for 100 hours before the measurements. The c-TiO 2 -based cell had a low PCE of 17.27% under the QSS-IV measurement. For the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based PSC, a PCE of 23.74% with a J sc of 25.74 mA/cm 2 , an opencircuit voltage (V oc ) of 1.142 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 80.79% was obtained, which are consistent with the previous reports (3, 7). Compared with the mesoporous-structured devices, the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cell had a higher V oc of 1.164 V but a lower J sc of 25.12 mA/cm 2 , resulting in a PCE of 23.29%. The J sc of the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based PSC is similar to the values reported for the SnO 2 -based cells in the literature  (17, 20) . With the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 ETL, the PSC exhibited a high PCE of 25.18% with a considerably improved J sc of 26.28 mA/cm 2 , V oc of 1.177 V, and FF of 81.49%, matching the 25.39% efficiency certified by Newport Inc. (figs. S10 and S11). The conventional J-V measurements under both forward and reverse scans were also performed (fig.  S12 ). The detailed PV parameters are summarized in table  S1 . A substantially different PV value was obtained for the c-TiO 2 -based cell under QSS-IV (Fig.  2A ) and conventional J-V measurements (fig.  S12A ), whereas the other cells showed similar PV results, indicating that the c-TiO 2 -based cell is unstable and that the single c-TiO 2 layer is not a proper ETL for PSCs  (28, 29) . The contrasting feature of the c-TiO 2 -based cell compared with the other cells in Fig.  2A  and fig  The J sc of the PSCs measured under the solar simulator was verified with external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. The target cell had slightly higher EQE than the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based PSC over the entire absorption spectrum (Fig.  2C ), resulting in a higher integrated J sc of 26.01 mA/cm 2 ; however, a relatively lower integrated J sc of 25.06 mA/cm 2 was obtained for the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based device than for the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cell (25.69 mA/cm 2 ). The high J sc of the target cell was attributed to the desired light scattering that prolongs the optical length, enhancing the light absorption by the perovskite with the conformal structured paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer over the FTO substrate. This is confirmed with the highest diffuse transmittance (haze) of paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 when compared with the other ETLs shown in fig.  S14A . The higher transmittance of paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 than the QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 (fig.  S14B ) may be traced back to the thinner film thickness, as shown in the optical simulations (fig.  S14, C  and D ), which could also contribute to the high J sc . We further compared the J sc obtained for the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2based PSCs using different substrates (fig.  S15 ). The Asahi FTO glass with high diffuse transmittance was the most suitable substrate for achieving a high J sc . The effect of the ETL composition on the photon flux emitted by the PSCs measured in steady state at an excitation photon flux equivalent to 1 sun is shown in Fig.  2D . The investigated devices were complete solar cells without the Au back contact. Compared with the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2and QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2based devices, the target cell had much higher photoluminescence (PL) intensity, reaching a PL quantum yield (PLQY) of 7.5%. This indicates a reduced nonradiative recombination at the interface between perovskite and paa-QD-SnO 2 ETL. Details of the measurements and calculations of PLQY are shown in SM note 2. From the PLQY measurements, we derived the quasi-Fermi level splitting (DE F ) in the perovskite under 1 sun illumination (SM note 3) and compared the (DE F ) with the V oc measured from the same device. DE F and V oc showed the same trend, indicating that the V oc increase can be partly attributed to the reduced nonradiative recombination. The DE F / q-V oc offset (where q is the elementary charge), however, is different. For the target cell, it is 10 mV lower than that of the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2based cells, indicating a better energetic alignment at the interfaces  (30) . Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements on the surface of different ETLs (fig.  S16 ) showed that the conduction band of paa-QD-SnO 2 matched better with perovskite than the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 , which could facilitate the charge transfer from perovskite to the ETL (fig.  S17 ). Detailed analysis of the UPS data is shown in SM note 4. Figure  S18, A  and B , shows the time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of the perovskite films on different ETLs measured from both the perovskite and the glass sides. The perovskite film deposited on paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 had the fastest decay among all the samples. Because it has a low nonradiative recombination rate, the fast decay is dominated by the favored interfacial electron transfer. The electron mobility measurements (fig.  S18C ) revealed that the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 layer had the highest carrier mobility. All these results indicate a superior charge extraction from perovskite to the paa-QD-SnO 2 ETL. Regarding the reduced nonradiative recombination, we determined the EQE of electroluminescence (EQE EL ) on representative PSC devices. Figure  2E  shows an EQE EL of 12.5% for the target cell at an injection current density of 26 mA/cm 2 corresponding to the J sc under 1 sun illumination, whereas the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2and QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cells have an EQE EL of 2.5 and 8.3%, respectively, under the same conditions. Thus, the nonradiative recombination rate in the PSC was reduced by 80% simply by replacing the m-TiO 2 with a paa-QD-SnO 2 electron-selective contact layer. The highest obtained V oc of 1.22 V (fig.  S19 ), which is near the V oc predicted from EQE EL according to the reciprocity theorem  (31, 32) , measured without the metal mask reached 98% of the radiative limit V oc (1.25 V)  (2, 5) . We also conducted transient photovoltage measurements for the PSCs (fig.  S20A ). The target cell showed a slower V oc decay than the reference cells, indicating a slower charge recombination rate. The dark J-V curves (fig.  S20B ) showed the lowest reverse saturation current for the target cell, pushing the onset of the dark current to the highest voltages, which also reflected the lowest interfacial nonradiative recombination. Figure  2F  shows the light intensitydependent V oc measurements for the PSCs. For both the reference and target cells, the measured V oc was linearly dependent on the logarithm of the light intensity. The diode ideality factor n id , deduced from the slope described by n id k B T/q, where k B is the Boltzmann constant and T is temperature, was 1.83, 1.79, and 1.46 for the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2and QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cells and the target cell, respectively. The reduced n id contributed to the increased FF of the target cell, as the FF critically depends on the n id  (33) . The reduced n id is also consistent with the PLQY, TRPL, EQE EL , transient photovoltage decay, and dark J-V measurements, unambiguously supporting the conclusion of reduced nonradiative recombination of the target PSC using paa-QD-SnO 2 ETL. The decreased nonradiative recombination manifests itself by much stronger photoand electroluminescence (Fig.  2, C  and D ) as well as a lower ideality factor (Fig.  2E ) enabling very high fill factor of 83.8% to be reached by our target device (table  S2 ). Further strong support for our conclusion comes from the observation of a slower transient photovoltage decay (fig.  S20A ) and higher electron mobility (fig.  S20B ) as well as the dark J-V measurements of the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2based cell compared with the control devices. The substantial reduction of the trap-assisted nonradiative recombination is the main reason for the reduced V oc deficit of our target cell of ~310 mV as compared with ~350 mV for the mesoporous-structure cell [bandgap of our perovskite film was calculated to be 1.53 eV (3)], which is one of the lowest values reported in the field of PSCs. Scale-up of the PSCs to module size is another requirement for their commercial exploitation. We used paa-QD-SnO 2 @TiO 2 ETL to fabricate perovskite solar mini-modules with active areas up to 64 cm 2 . Details of the fabrication process for the solar modules can be found in the SM and movie S1. Figure  3A  shows the J-V curves and images of the perovskite mini-modules with different active areas. The highest PCEs achieved for the PSCs with active areas of 1, 20, and 64 cm 2 were 23.3, 21.7, and 20.6%, respectively. Movie S2 shows a typical measurement for the 64 cm 2 perovskite solar modules. Figure  S21A  illustrates a solar module with subcells connected in series with a magnified view of the contact connections, and a geometrical FF (GFF) was calculated to be 95.6% according to the SEM images (fig.  S21B ) of the interconnections. Details of the PV parameters are summarized in table  S2 . The decrease of the PCE with increased device size is mainly caused by a decreased FF. The V oc of the module (table  S2 ) divided by the number of stripes is 18.5 V/16 = 1.156 V, which is equal to the V oc of the 1 cm 2 cell. Hence, there is no additional V oc loss in the module. Therefore, we attribute the FF decrease to the increased series resistance, including transport layer resistances, contact resistances, and interconnect resistance. We sent the PSC modules to an independent laboratory (OMA Company, Republic of Korea) for certification. PCEs of 21.66% (fig.  S22 ) and 20.55% (fig.  S23 ) were confirmed for the PSC mini-modules with active areas of 20 and 64 cm 2 , respectively, which agreed well with the measurements in our laboratory, and are compared with other reported values in fig.  S24 . We further compared the statistical distribution of the PCEs for the mesoporous-based (Fig.  3B ) and target (Fig.  3C ) perovskite minimodules. For the perovskite modules with the same active area (1, 20, or 64 cm 2 ), the target modules had higher averaged PCE and narrower PCE distributions than the mesoporousbased modules. The averaged PCE of the 64 cm 2 PSC module increased by ~30% by simply replacing the m-TiO 2 with paa-QD-SnO 2 , indicating that the paa-QD-SnO 2 could be uniformly coated on the large-size substrates. The statistical distribution of the PV parameters (fig.  S25 ) further revealed that the V oc and FF of the mesoporous-based modules decreased significantly more than that of the target PSC modules. The shunt resistance of our solar modules retained a typical value of >4000 ohms•cm 2 (table  S3 ), indicating that losses from leakage currents across shunts produced during scale-up are negligible. We attribute the small decrease of V oc and FF for the target PSC modules to the low contact resistance (fig.  S26, A  and B ) because of the easier laser scribing as well as low series resistance and low interfacial defects of the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 bilayer. Figure  4A  shows the 1000-hour shelf life tested with unsealed devices in ambient air at 25% relative humidity (RH) and 25°C. The target PSC retained 80% of the maximum PCE (25.7%) after 1000-hour storage, whereas the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2and QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2based PSCs decreased to almost 30 and 40% of the initial efficiency, respectively, indicating that the target cell is more resistant to the moisture and oxygen than the widely used mesoporous structured PSCs. We also performed the operational stability test for the unsealed devices in a N 2 environment under maximum power point (MPP) tracking conditions using a light-emitting diode lamp with a calibrated light intensity of 100 mW/cm 2 . More details about the MPP tests can be found in the SM and in previous reports  (5, 7) . Figure  4B  shows that the target cell had higher PCE than the reference cell during the 350-hour MPP tracking test. From the detailed PV parameters during the MPP tracking measure-ments (fig.  S27 ), it is clear that the higher performance of the target PSC is due to the higher and rather stable V oc , which decreased less compared with the reference cells. The main degradation of the target cell is the decline of FF (fig.  S27 ), which is attributed to the de-doping of lithium from the hole-transport layer (HTL)  (5, 34) . We further tested the sealed devices under ambient conditions. Figure  S28  shows that 70.5% of the initial efficiency of the target cell was retained after 700-hour light-soaking test, whereas the efficiency of the m-TiO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cell declined 45% over the same testing time. To assess the suitability of the cells for real applications, we performed an MPP stability test for the encapsulated target cell under ambient conditions. Figure  S29  shows that 95% of the initial efficiency was retained for the sealed target cell after 100 hours MPP tracking and 2 hours dark recovery under ambient conditions. The substantial decline of FF is still the main reason for the performance loss. Future studies of additive-free HTLs will be conducted to enhance the stability of PSCs.  
 Materials and Methods 
 Materials: Formamidine acetate salt (99%) and the SnO2 colloidal QDs solution were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Hydroiodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in water), 2-methoxyethanol (2ME, anhydrous 99.8%), titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate), 2-propanol (IPA, anhydrous, 99.5%), chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, >99.5%), Li2CO3 and polyacrylic acid (PAA, Avg. MW = 450000) were purchased form Sigma Aldrich. Methylammonium chloride (MACl, 98%) was purchased from Acros Organics. Fluorine-doped tin oxide on glass (FTO glass, 7 Ω sq -1 ) was purchased from Asahi and Pilkington. Ethanol (absolute, 99.9%) and diethyl ether (extra pure grade) was purchased from Duksan. The m-TiO2 paste (SC-HT040) was purchased from ShareChem. The lead iodide (PbI2, 99.9985%) was purchased from TCI. 
 Materials synthesis: Formamidinium iodide (FAI) was synthesized as reported elsewhere  (35) . Briefly, 25 g formamidine acetate was mixed with 50 mL HI in a 250 mL round-bottomed flask under vigorous stirring first. Powder with light-yellow color was synthesized after evaporating the solvent at 80 °C for 1 h under vacuum condition. The resultant powder was redissolved in absolute ethanol and precipitated using diethyl ether. This procedure was repeated three times until white powder was finally obtained. The white powder was recrystallized from a mixed ethanol and diethyl ether solution (1:1) in a refrigerator. The final white powder was collected with a glass filter and dried at room temperature for 24 h. FAPbI3 black powder was synthesized as reported previously  (36) . In detail, PbI2 and FAI (1:1 molar ratio) were dissolved in 2ME (0.8 M) first and then filtered using a polyvinylidene fluoride filter with 0.45 μm pore size. The filtered solution was placed in a flask incubated in an oil bath at 120 °C for 1 h under slow stirring. The resulting black powder was filtered using a glass filter and dried at 60 °C for 24 h. 
 Fabrication of small size PSCs: FTO glass (Asahi or Pilkington) was cleaned using the RCA-2 (H2O2/HCl/H2O = 1:1:5) procedure for 15 mins in an ultrasonic bath and then washed sequentially with acetone and IPA for 10 mins each. For fabricating the c-TiO2 layer, 40 mL of a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)/ethanol (1:10) solution was sprayed using a spray gun at 450 °C for 20 mins with oxygen at a speed of 4 L/min. After completing the c-TiO2 layer, the substrates were stored at 450 °C for 1 hour. The thickness of c-TiO2 is about 20 nm. Long time and low concentration spray coating process is recommended for a well-defined c-TiO2 layer. The c-TiO2 which had a thin and uniform thickness is key for high-efficiency PSCs. For fabricating the m-TiO2, the m-TiO2 paste was spin-coated onto the c-TiO2 layer pre-treated with oxygen plasma at 3000 rpm for 50 s. The m-TiO2 paste was dispersed in 2-ME/terpineol (78:22, w:w) at a concentration of 15%. The resulting substrate was heated at 500 °C on a hotplate for 1 hour to remove organic compounds and then slowly cooled down to 200 °C. In case of paa-QD-SnO2 layer, SnO2 QDs (from Alfa Aesar) were diluted 20 times with DI water and then mixed with PAA (1mg/mL) under stirring at 80 o C for 2 hours. The resulting solution was spin-coated onto the c-TiO2 layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The substrates were heated at 100 °C for 30 mins under a vacuum condition. Before spin-coating the perovskite layer, the substrate was treated with Li2CO3 (0.5 mg/mL) and annealed at 100 ℃ for another 30 mins under a vacuum condition. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 1550 mg FAPbI3 and 61 mg MACl with 1mL DMF/DMSO (4:1). The perovskite solution was filtered with a PVDF filter (0.2 μm) and then 70 µL of the filtered perovskite solution was spread onto different ETLs at 8000 rpm for 50 s. Before coating, the substrates were treated with plasma for 5 mins. During the spin-coating, 1 mL diethyl ether was dropped on the perovskite film at 10 seconds using a home-made pipette. The resulting film was annealed at 150 °C for 15 mins and 100 °C for 30 mins on a hotplate. After the substrates cooling down, octylammonium iodide/IPA solution (15 mM) was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. For the hole transport layer, the Spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Spiro-OMeTAD (90 mg/mL in CB) was doped with 39 µL 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP), 23 µL Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) (520 mg/mL in acetonitrile) and 5 µL tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III)-tris(bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide) (180 mg/mL in acetonitrile). All these processes were carried out in ambient environment at strictly controlled 25% RH and at 25 °C. Finally, the Au electrode was deposited onto the Spiro-OMeTAD layer using a thermal evaporation system. 100 nm thick Au was deposited at 2 Å/s under a pressure of 10 -6 Torr. 
 Fabrication of large-size PSCs: In case of the 1 cm 2 size PSC, it was prepared under the same way as for the 0.08 cm 2 cells. For the 20 and 64 cm 2 large-size perovskite modules, TCO etching, including P1, P2 and P3 processes, was conducted. For the P1 process, 6 cm × 6 cm and 9 cm × 9 cm size FTO substrates were patterned by a picosecond laser (Advance Optowave, AMT 532, 1.7 W power) with a scribing width of 15 μm with 10 and 16-strip connected in series. For fabricating the ETL, the spray-coating of c-TiO2 and spin-coating of paa-QD-SnO2 or m-TiO2 were conducted the same as for the small size cells. For the perovskite layer deposition, 1329.3 mg FAPbI3 and 49.6 mg MACl was dissolved in 1 mL DMF/DMSO (4:1). For each sample, 150 µL of the filtered solution was spread onto the substrate and spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 50 s. The coated perovskite layer was baked at 150 ℃ for 10 mins. The hole transport layer was deposited with the same method described above. For the P2 process, laser scribing (0.8 W power) with width of 60 µm was conducted. The distance between P1 and P2 was about 170 µm. Finally, the Au counter electrode was deposited with a thickness of 100 nm. For the P3 process, the Au layer was scribed with 30 µm width. The distance between P2 and P3 was about 150 µm. A full structure of the large-size PSC is shown in Fig.  S21a . 
 Photovoltaic measurements: The solar cells were measured using a solar simulator (Newport-Oriel 94083A, Class AAA) together with a Keithley source meter 2400 under ambient conditions (25% RH at 25 ℃). The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW/cm 2 using a Si-reference cell certified by NREL for the measurements. The conventional J-V curves were measured under both forward and reverse scans. The small sized PSCs were masked using a shadow metal mask to limit the active cell area to 0.0803 or 1 cm 2 and epoxy resin was used for the encapsulation. For 20 and 64 cm 2 size mini modules, the voltage ranges were fixed with 13 to 0 V and 20 to 0 V, respectively. For the PSC mini module, we cut it with a laser to the desired size and black tape was used to cover the edges. The stabilized power output was measured at the maximum power point using a Xenon lamp light source. 
 Quasi-steady-state IV (QSS-IV) measurements: QSS-IV was measured with a home-made program from the OMA company. A QSS-IV sweep was carried out by fixing a bias voltage (0 to 1.25 V) until the measured current was stabilized (within 0.07% change). The time interval between current readings is approximately 10 seconds, and 20 voltage points were used. The QSS-IV was measured under a forward scan (0 to 1.25 V). 
 EQE measurements: EQE measurements were carried out for the PSCs using a QEX7 system (PV Measurement, Inc.) 
 EQE of the electroluminescence (EQEEL) measurements: For the ELEQE measurements, different bias voltage was applied to the PSCs with a Bio-logic SP300 potentiostat. The emitted photon flux from the PSCs was recorded using a calibrated, large area (1 cm 2 ) Si photodiode (Hamamatsu S1227-1010BQ). All measurements were achieved in the ambient environment with 25% RH at 25 ℃. 
 Long-term stability measurements: The operational stability measurements were performed with a Bio-logic potentiostat under a LED lamp (LXM3-PW51, Lumileds) which was calibrated to be 100 mW/cm 2 using a silicon reference cell. The stability test was achieved for the devices without encapsulation. The PSCs were masked and put inside a homemade sample holder purged with continuous nitrogen flow. The PSCs were aged under a MPP tracking condition under the continuous illumination. The temperature was set to 20 ℃ during the measurements. Reverse scanned J-V curves were measured every 30 mins. For the operational stability of the encapsulated devices, the cells were measured under MPP tracking condition in the ambient condition (25% RH at 25 ℃). 
 FE-SEM and TEM measurements: The morphologies of the c-TiO2, QD-SnO2@c-TiO2 and paa-QD-SnO2@c-TiO2 ETLs were assessed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi) and a high-angle annular dark-field transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnal G2F30S-Twin, FEL). 
 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements: AFM images were obtained using the non-contact mode of an XE7 Atomic Force Microscopy (Park Systems, South Korea). The fast response of the decoupled Z and XY scanners allows a prompt retraction of the cantilever when the tip encounters topographic features and keeps tipsample interaction in the attractive force regime. The tip (OMCL-AC160TS, Olympus) was used for the AFM measurements. 
 X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements: XRD patterns of the perovskite films were measured with a D8 Advance (Bruker) diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.1542 nm). 
 FTIR measurements: Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted with IRAfinity-1S (Shimadzu) under N2 environment. 
 Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements: DLS measurements were performed using a spectrophotometer (Zetasizer, Malvern Instruments). Each single measurement lasts 70 seconds of duration time. 
 UV-Vis absorption, UPS, and XPS measurements: The absorption spectra were performed with a UV-2600 spectrometry (Shimadzu) with halogen and deuterium lamps. ESCALAB 250XI (Thermo Fisher Scientific) multi-technique platform was used for UPS and XPS measurements. UPS was performed with an ultraviolet He I lamp. The UPS spectra were collected at 2 eV pass energy with 3 V bias voltage. XPS spectra were recorded at a base pressure of 1.0 × 10 -9 Torr using a monochromic Al-Kα X-ray source. 
 Note 1:Reasons of the low PCE of c-TiO2 based PSCs under QSS-IV method. The contrasting J-V curves of c-TiO2 based PSCs shown in Fig.  2A  and Fig.  S12a  is due to different testing method. For Fig.  2A , a quasi-steady-state I-V (QSS-IV) method was used, which is now employed for the certification at the accredited Newport PV test laboratory. This was conducted by fixing the voltage measuring the photocurrent until it stabilized within 0.07%. By contrast, the J-V curve reported in Fig.  S12a  was measured by scanning the voltage. The c-TiO2 layer is known to be unstable under UV light. Thus, the low performance of c-TiO2 based PSCs shown in Fig.  2A  represents the unstable feature of c-TiO2 based PSCs. We note that this is a known phenomenon that there is a difference between stabilized power output and the maximum power output from a J-V scan, especially for unstable devices. 
 Note 2: PLQY measurements and calculations Photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was measured using an integrating sphere (Gigahertz-Optik), an Andor Kymera 193i spectrograph and a 660 nm continuous-wave laser (OBIS, Coherent) set at 1-Sun equivalent photon flux (790 µm beam full-width half-maximum, 330 µW). The absorbed photon flux calculated by multiplying the EQE spectrum with the AM1.5G spectrum is 1.63 ×10 21 1/(s m 2 ). The EQE at 660 nm is 93.8%, so the 660 nm laser photon flux has to be 1.74 ×10 21 1/(s m 2 ) to have the same absorbed photon flux as under 1 sun. This is very close to the above bandgap (Eg = 1.53 eV) photon flux of AM 1.5G, which is 1.75 ×10 21 1/(s m 2 ) used for the measurements. The photoluminescence signal was collected at normal incidence using an optical fiber. For the calibration of the PLQY measurements, we used a halogen lamp (BN-LH250-V01, Gigaertz-Optik). To proof the correctness of the calibration, we measured PLQY of a dye solution of indocyanine green in DMSO in the same setup and measured PLQY values within 15% deviation from the literature values. 
 Note 3: Calculation of the quasi-Fermi level splitting ∆𝐸 𝐹 To calculate ∆𝐸 𝐹 we used the PLQY measurements and the following equation  (37) : ∆𝐸 𝐹 = 𝑞 𝑉 𝑜𝑐,𝑟𝑎𝑑 + 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 ln(𝑃𝐿𝑄𝑌) where 𝑞 is the elementary charge, 𝑉 𝑜𝑐,𝑟𝑎𝑑 is the radiative limit of 𝑉 𝑜𝑐 , 𝑘 𝐵 the Boltzmann constant and T = 25 °C the sample temperature. 𝑉 𝑜𝑐,𝑟𝑎𝑑 is calculated by the equation (  31  is derived from the PL spectra 𝛷 𝑃𝐿 (𝐸) by applying the detailed balance principle  (38, 39) : 𝛷 𝑃𝐿 (𝐸) ∝ 𝑎(𝐸)𝛷 𝐵𝐵 (𝐸). The calculated ∆𝐸 𝐹 for PSCs with m-TiO2@c-TiO2, QD-SnO2@c-TiO2 and paa-QD-SnO2@c-TiO2 ETLs are 1.17 V, 1.17 V and 1.19 V, respectively. The stabilized Voc for the PSC with m-TiO2@c-TiO2 , QD-SnO2@c-TiO2 and paa-QD-SnO2@c-TiO2 are 1.13 V, 1.14 V and 1.16 V, respectively.

 . S12A is discussed in note 1 of the SM. Hereafter, the c-TiO 2 -based cells will not be discussed. A statistical distribution of the PCE of all the PSCs (Fig. 2B) shows that the paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based PSC had the highest averaged values. Details of the statistical PV parameters of all different ETL-based cells are shown in fig. S13. The paa-QD-SnO 2 @c-TiO 2 -based cell is the target of the discussions that follow.
