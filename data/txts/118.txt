 P erovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on three-dimensional (3D) perovskite absorbers have achieved rapid progress with PCE values of over 25% due to the outstanding optoelectronic properties of 3D perovskites. Nevertheless, their poor stability, particularly their susceptibility in humid environments, lack of thermal stability and light-soaking degradation, is a major shortcoming that limits their further practical application. As the bandgap-voltage offset values of PSCs are still higher than that of GaAs cells (W OC ≈ 0.3 V),  1  reducing the W OC and pushing the open-circuit voltage of PSCs towards the Shockley-Queisser V OC limit (where there is radiative recombination loss only) is of great significance for boosting the PCE, as well as for understanding the fundamental science more deeply  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]  . Several studies have shown that non-radiative recombination via defects at the interfaces between the perovskite and charge-transport layers is the main source of voltage losses for PSCs  [7] [8] [9]  . Strategies such as surface passivation or the use of processing additives have been explored to minimize non-radiative recombination losses at interfaces and thus improve the open-circuit voltage of devices  10, 11  . For example, surfaces and grain boundaries with potassium passivation have been shown to enable the substantial mitigation of non-radiative recombination losses (ΔV OC,nr ), pushing the V OC value up to 1.17 V with a low W OC of 0.39 V (ΔV OC,nr = 0.11 V) for a 1.56-eV-bandgap 3D perovskite system. However, there are still substantial non-radiative losses produced from trap states within the perovskite bulk film, which limits the performance and stability of the perovskite device  12  . In addition, the energy-level alignment at the interface is also a key factor for minimizing the interfacial non-radiative recombination, which requires careful interface design  13  . Thus, a simultaneous interface and bulk trap passivation strategy as well as interface engineering are required to further reach the full thermodynamic potential of the open-circuit voltage. In this work, we introduced a multifunctional (bulk and interface) 2D perovskite passivation approach and graded interface design to reduce the photovoltage loss of the PSC and enhance the device stability. n-Butylammonium bromide (BABr) was first coated on top of a 3D perovskite film, and through thermal driving we simultaneously achieved a relatively uniform distribution of self-passivated 2D/3D perovskites in the bulk, covered by graded mixed-dimensional, wider-bandgap 2D perovskite layers. We name it the dimensionally graded perovskite formation (DGPF) approach. This multifunctional approach effectively suppresses the non-radiative recombination loss in both the bulk and at the interface of the perovskite. Via this DGPF technique, we demonstrate a hysteresis-free maximum PCE of 21.54% with a high V OC of 1.24 V in a 1.63 eV perovskite system, and the W OC is only 0.39 V, which is equivalent to a non-radiative recombination V OC loss (ΔV OC,nr ) of only 0.11 V. In particular, a minimum W OC of 0.38 V and a ΔV OC,nr of 0.10 V was achieved in a 20.15% PCE device. We further decrease the W OC to as low as 0.326 V in an approximately 1.53 eV perovskite

 Metal halide perovskite solar cells have demonstrated a high power conversion efficiency (PCE), and further enhancement of the PCE requires a reduction of the bandgap-voltage offset (W OC ) and the non-radiative recombination photovoltage loss (ΔV OC,nr ). Here, we report an effective approach for reducing the photovoltage loss through the simultaneous passivation of internal bulk defects and dimensionally graded two-dimensional perovskite interface defects. Through this dimensionally graded perovskite formation approach, an open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.24 V was obtained with a champion PCE of 21.54% in a 1.63 eV perovskite system (maximum V OC = 1.25 V, W OC = 0.38 V and ΔV OC,nr = 0.10 V); we further decreased the W OC to 0.326 V in a 1.53 eV perovskite system with a V OC of 1.21 V and a PCE of 23.78% (certified 23.09%). This approach is equally effective in achieving a low W OC (ΔV OC,nr ) in 1.56 eV and 1.73 eV perovskite solar cell systems, and further leads to the substantially improved operational stability of perovskite solar cells. system (ΔV OC,nr = 74 mV), with a maximum V OC of 1.21 V and a champion PCE of 23.78% (a certified PCE of 23.09%). The DGPF approach is also validated by examining hybrid PSCs with bandgaps of 1.56 eV and 1.73 eV, where very low W OC (ΔV OC,nr ) and high V OC values were both achieved. At the same time, the 2D perovskite components in the bulk and at the interface provide superb stability under illumination, ensuring that the DGPF device can maintain 91% of its initial efficiency over 500 h of 1-Sun illumination under maximum power point (MPP) conditions. 
 Design strategy and characterization of DGPF perovskite films Figure  1a  shows the schematic illustration of our DGPF method, and Fig.  1b  shows a cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the DGPF perovskite film deposited on the SnO 2 -coated indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, verifying the homogeneity of the 2D perovskite layer on the top of the 3D perovskite film  14  . The RbCsMAFA quadruple-cation 3D perovskite film, where MA is methylammonium and FA is formamidinium, was formed using an antisolvent-assisted one-step method  15  ; this four-component system has demonstrated a state-of-the-art device performance in several studies reported by researchers at EPFL  [15] [16] [17]  . The quadruple-cation perovskite system has shown not only a high efficiency, but also a higher V OC value (1.16-1.18 V) than a triple-cation (~1.13 V) counterpart (both have a bandgap of around 1.63 eV)  [15] [16] [17]  . The detailed fabrication method of the device is given in the Methods section. Here, to form the mixed 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction films, long-chain BABr molecules were first dissolved in isopropyl alcohol, at different concentrations, and then spin coated directly onto the top of the as-prepared 3D RbCsMAFA perovskite film to form a thin film; this was then followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. This approach leads to the perovskite vertical composition distribution shown below. To investigate the distribution of ions inside the perovskite films after the introduction of BABr, we conducted time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurements on the DGPF perovskite films. The ToF-SIMS depth profile shown in Fig.  1c  reveals the gradient distribution of BA + with the initial sputtering time, which indicates that the ultrathin 2D perovskite film was formed on the surface of the 3D perovskite layer. In the bulk (originally pure 3D) perovskite film, we now observe a relatively uniform distribution of BA + with an intensity of over two orders of magnitude lower than that on the surface, indicating a clear diffusion process. Therefore, it is evident that the bulk film contains both 3D and 2D perovskite with an increasing 2D concentration towards the surface. Owing to the gradient distribution of BA + , the number of layers (n) of the 2D perovskite might increase from the surface to the bulk, creating a tendency for bandgap narrowing (as illustrated in Fig.  1a  and Supplementary Fig.  10b ). The grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) technique was used to study the crystal orientation of the control and mixed DGPF perovskite films  18  . The scattering patterns of the perovskite films with various concentrations of BABr are shown in Fig.  2a . The corresponding radial intensity profiles averaged over the whole images are presented in Fig.  2b . The standard pure 3D perovskite film (0-BABr) displays uniform diffraction rings, indicating the formation of perovskite polycrystals with a randomly oriented cubic structure. For the perovskite films with the BABr post-treatment, sharp diffraction peaks emerged at scattering vector q values of 0.32, 0.64 and 0.96 Å -1 along the z direction (Fig.  2c ), which are indexed as the (020), (  040 ) and (060) planes of layered 2D perovskite crystals parallel to the substrate with a layer spacing, d, of ~20 Å (n = 2)  19  . The parallel 2D perovskite orientation is surprising as it is commonly considered to be unfavoured for overall vertical charge transport in solar-cell devices. However, the high-efficiency PSC in this study indicates that the 2D perovskite layer with a relatively larger bandgap is thin enough for carrier transport and can act as an effective electron-blocking layer to suppress the interfacial charge recombination. The BABr GIWAXS peak appearing at q z = 0.41 Å -1 in the pure BABr film (Supplementary Fig.  1a ) and the excess PbI 2 peak appearing at q z = 0.92 Å -1 in the 3D perovskite film were both absent, suggesting that 2D perovskite layers are partially formed from the reaction of BABr with excess PbI 2 . When the concentration of BABr is increased, the 2D perovskite peaks become more intense, as the higher order (080) peak appears with the 5 mg ml -1 BABr treatment. To provide more detailed evidence of the graded 2D perovskite from the surface to the bulk, we conducted GIWAXS analysis at different X-ray incident angles to elucidate the vertical structure of the surface and internal perovskite layers with depth-dependent characterization, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  2 . The structure information of the perovskite film surface was recorded at a small incident angle of 0.1°, which shows the formation of a 2D perovskite layer with n = 2 only. When the angle of incidence was increased to 0.3°, we clearly observed some additional diffraction peaks, which are assigned to be the (0k0) plane of the 2D perovskite with n = 3. With increasing the incident angle and penetration depth, the diffraction peak intensity of the 2D perovskite with n = 2 and 3 gradually increased. We can also clearly distinguish the (222) plane of the 2D perovskite with n = 2, 3 and 4 at an incident angle of 1°. Thus, the depth-dependent GIWAXS results are in good agreement with our hypothesis of graded top 2D perovskite layers with increasing n values for top-down distribution. To further evaluate the structural properties of the DGPF perovskite films, we performed HRTEM measurements using the focused ion beam (FIB) lift-out technique shown in Supplementary Fig.  3 , which allows the crystal structure to be probed throughout the perovskite film. Here, we selected two regions (1 and 2), which correspond to the top surface and the bulk, respectively. Region 1 (the top surface) shows lattice fringes with a characteristic d spacing of 13 Å, which can be ascribed to 2D perovskite phases with n = 1. In Region 2 (the bulk film), we can observe the characteristic d spacing of the 3D perovskite phase (3.2 Å). Besides, it is worth noting that the 2D perovskite phases with n = 2 and 3 were embedded within the 3D perovskite phases, which are probably located at the grain boundary. The influence of the annealing time on the perovskite film was also investigated, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  1 . The 2D perovskite signals remain almost the same for the samples with and without annealing, whereas the 3D perovskite signals become stronger with a longer annealing time. The diffraction peaks shift towards larger q values, indicating a slight lattice contraction  20  . This is attributed to substitution of the larger I -ions with the smaller Br -ions in the 3D perovskite crystals. The longer the annealing time, the more BABr diffuses into the bulk film, causing a larger lattice contraction, which is consistent with the ToF-SIMS results. Therefore, as illustrated in Fig.  2d , upon BABr post-treatment, BA + and Br -ions tend to fill the vacancies at the grain boundaries of the 3D perovskite due to the strong reactivity of the introduced BA + and Br -ions with existing dangling bonds  21  . In this case, the 2D perovskite phases are most likely to form at the grain boundaries surrounding the 3D perovskite phases. The 2D perovskite will heal and passivate the 3D perovskite defects, notably reducing the non-radiative recombination, which is in agreement with the observed lower V OC loss presented in the following text. The perovskite film morphology is another critical factor for the photovoltaic performance. Top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the control and DGPF perovskite films are shown in Fig.  2e . The morphology of the control RbCsMAFA perovskite film is uniform and compact with well-crystallized grains, which is in good agreement with a previous study  15  . With BABr treatment, an obvious grain-coarsening process is observed, that is, the original small perovskite grains were merged into larger ones via a thermodynamically spontaneous Ostwald ripening process  22  . We expected that the BABr molecules would gradually penetrate into the existing 3D perovskite crystalline structure, resulting in the formation of thin 2D perovskite phases on the top and in the bulk of the mixed 2D/3D perovskites film. When a low concentration of BABr solution is used (1 or 2 mg ml -1 ), we observe both large and small grains. It is reasonable to expect that in the low-concentration cases, the amount of BABr is not sufficient for recrystallizing all of the small-grain-sized 3D perovskite crystals. With a further increase in the BABr concentration to 5 mg ml -1 , the surface morphology becomes smoother with uniformly distributed grain sizes. 
 Device performance and characterization Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using spiro-OMeTAD as a hole-selective layer and gold as the counter electrode. The current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the champion control and DGPF PSCs are shown in Fig.  3a . The control RbCsMAFA-based planar PSC device shows a decent champion PCE of 19.61% with a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 22.25 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.161 V and a fill factor (FF) of 75.92%. Compared with the data on mesoporous PSCs reported by the researchers at EPFL, the V OC and J SC values are very similar, whereas the FF is lower (0.76 versus 0.81). After BABr treatment, the DGPF PSC shows a clear performance enhancement, yielding a champion PCE of 20.24% when using 1 mg ml -1 BABr and 21.54% when using 2 mg ml -1 BABr, with an impressive V OC of 1.24 V (Fig.  3a  and Supplementary Fig.  4 ). We fabricated 20 individual devices for both control and DGPF PSCs at 2 mg ml -1 BABr. The statistics of two types of devices are shown in Supplementary Fig.  5 , which indicates good reproducibility in the DGPF PSCs with an improved PCE of 20.38% (± 0.38%) on average compared with 18.80% (± 0.31%) in the control PSCs. There is a much enhanced average V OC of 1.22 V (± 0.02 V) in the DGPF PSCs, compared with 1.15 V (± 0.02 V) in the pure 3D PSCs, and this is the major factor contributing to the overall efficiency enhancement. Considering the very similar optical bandgap values for the control and DGPF perovskite films, the driving force of the high V OC value with a small W OC for the DGPF PSCs is of great interest. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) data of the PSCs with different BABr concentrations are shown in Supplementary Fig.  4b . As expected, the EQE spectrum is slightly blue shifted when BABr is incorporated, although this is very small and does not lead to a reduction of the J SC . We observed a better photoresponse in the long-wavelength range for the devices treated with BABr solutions, which may originate from enhanced charge transport  23  . For the RbCsMAFA system, when using an optimized BABr solution concentration of 2 mg ml -1 , the cell is hysteresis-free (as shown in Fig.  3a ) with a PCE of 21.54%, and the stabilized PCE is 21.27% (as shown in Supplementary Fig.  6 ). Here, we also compared the results of some PSCs with a PCE of over 21%, where Fig.  2  | Crystallinity and morphology of the perovskite films. a, 2D GIWAXS patterns of the control (0 mg ml -1 BABr) and DGPF perovskite films with BABr solutions of various concentrations (1, 2 and 5 mg ml -1 ). b, Radial intensity profiles averaged over the entire 2D GIWAXS image. c, Intensity profiles along the q z axis. d, Schematic of 2D/3D perovskite film formed via the DGPF method. A thin 2D perovskite capping layer with mixed-dimensionality is formed on top of the 3D perovskite film, and the 2D perovskite phase can be further produced between the grain boundaries of the 3D counterparts leading to the formation of the mixed 2D/3D perovskite. e, Top-view SEM (upper) and surface AFM (lower) images of the control and DGPF perovskite films with different BABr concentrations. the W OC varies from 0.39 to 0.48 V, and where our DGPF device compares favourably amongst them (Supplementary Fig.  7  and Supplementary Table  3 )  15, 24  . 
 elucidating DGPF PSC V oC loss mechanisms To understand the reason of the high V OC in these PSCs in a quantitative manner, the accurate determination of the perovskite band- 1.0 q z (Å -1 ) q r (Å -1 ) q r (Å -1 ) q r (Å -1 ) q r (Å - gap is critical. As shown in Supplementary Fig.  8 , the determination of optical bandgap (E g ) values was conducted using two widely recognized methods: (1) using the maximum point of the derivative of the EQE spectrum (that is dEQE/dE)  25  and (2) using the Tauc plot  26  . The E g values from the two methods agree very well. We first examine the electroluminescence (EL) efficiency. The reciprocity relation can describe the relationship between the photovoltaic quantum efficiency (EQE PV ) and the external quantum efficiency of the electroluminescence (EQE EL ), which can be used to quantify the V OC loss in photovoltaic devices  27  . According to Rau, Φ EL (E) = φ BB (E) EQE PV (E) [ exp ( qV kT ) -1 ] , where φ BB (E) is the black-body emission flux density, Φ EL (E) is the EL spectral photon flux (Φ EL (E) = J inj (V) q EQE EL (E)), J inj (V) is the injected current, V is the applied internal voltage, k is the the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and q is the elementary charge. As shown in Fig.  3b , the extracted EQE PV exhibited a nearly exact dependence on the energy as the measured EQE PV , implying that the reciprocity relation holds. Herein, we identify the origins of the increased open-circuit voltage in the DGPF PSCs by quantifying the dominating recombination mechanisms. The V OC,rad describes the radiative limit of V OC , which is determined by  6  ). V OC,rad = kT q ln [ J SC ∫ ∞ 0 EQE PV (E)φ BB (E)dE + 1 ] (ref. The calculated V OC,rad value is 1.35 V for both the reference control and DGPF perovskite devices, both with almost the same 1.63 eV bandgap  28  . Therefore, the difference in the non-radiative recombination losses is the source of the V OC enhancement. We then quantify the non-radiative recombination voltage loss (ΔV OC,nr ), which in principle can be estimated from the measured EQE EL using the relationship ΔV OC,nr = V OC,rad -V OC = -kT q ln EQE EL . An EQE EL value of 0.85% was measured for a DGPF PSC device under light-emitting diode (LED) mode with a forward-bias current density of 22.22 mA cm -2 (Fig.  3c ). This EQE EL value is very close that of the most efficient silicon solar cell (~0.5%)  29  . This is also one of the highest values obtained in PSCs. The 0.85% EQE EL corresponds to a ΔV OC,nr value of 0.12 V (refs.  15, 30  ), which agrees well with the device parameter (V OC = 1.23 V for the tested device). For the champion efficiency device with a V OC of 1.24 V, the EQE EL value should be higher and the ΔV OC,nr will be 0.11 V. The maximum V OC of 1.25 V with the 20.15% PCE for the DGPF PSC device indicates a ΔV OC,nr value of 100 mV (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). On the other hand, the control PSC has a V OC of 1.16 V. Under the forward-bias LED mode with the same injected current density of 22.22 mA cm -2 , the PSC delivers an EQE EL of 0.065% (corresponding to a ΔV OC,nr value of 0.19 V from the equation), which also agrees well with the device V OC loss analysis. The extraordinarily low non-radiative recombination losses in DGPF PSCs are the dominating reason behind the high V OC as well as the high efficiencies in these PSC devices. Generally, these non-radiative recombination losses arise from defects (charge-carrier traps) either in the bulk photovoltaic materials or at the interfaces. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) on the 3D perovskite films with different BABr concentrations was carried out to understand the electronic properties of the films. Supplementary Fig.  10a  shows the cutoff energy (E cutoff ) in the high-binding-energy region and the valence band with respect to the vacuum level derived from the UPS spectra. With the increase in BABr concentration, the E cutoff shifts to a higher binding energy, indicating that the ion-exchange-induced 3D to 2D phase transition can reduce the Fermi level of RbCsMAFA  19  . The valence-band edges determined from the linear portion in the low-binding-energy region for 0-BABr, 1-BABr, 2-BABr and 5-BABr are located at 5.86, 5.80, 5.74 and 5.70 eV, respectively. Here, to mimic a similar situation, thinner 3D perovskite films (at around 100 nm) with and without

 Nature PhotoNics BABr treatment are used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. The absorption spectra of the thin control and DGPF perovskite films are shown in Supplementary Fig.  11 . It is noteworthy that the absorption peaks can be observed at 2.27, 2.05 and 1.81 eV, which are assigned to 2D perovskites with n = 2, 3 and 4, respectively. As discussed above, the depth-dependent GIWAXS data also confirmed this graded distribution. The top-down structure information shows that the 2D perovskites with a small n value (n = 2) are prone exist near the surface. Owing to the graded distribution of BA + in the 2D perovskite region (Fig.  1c ), the energy diagram at the perovskite/hole-transport layer interface can be estimated  31  . As shown in Supplementary Fig.  10b , the energy diagram of a perovskite with a gradient energy structure distribution for the 2 mg ml -1 BABr-treated case is depicted. Compared with the pure 3D perovskite device, the graded 2D perovskites lead to a graded energy-level transition from the bulk 3D perovskite to the 2D perovskite. The energy-level shift is not linear, as envisioned from the BA + spatial distribution. We can expect that the energy-level gradient is smooth close to bulk perovskite, but the gradient is much faster when reaching the spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport layer side. Therefore, the aforementioned graded 2D perovskite layer can be regarded as having the same function as the graded window layer in traditional thin-film solar cells, which provides a potential barrier for the electrons  32  . The electrons moving towards the perovskite top surface (where the trap-state density is higher than that in the bulk) will be reflected back close to the interface. Hence, this energy-level alignment will further eliminate the surface recombination effectively. In the meantime, the mildly graded valence-band energy-level-alignment transition can also facilitate efficient hole transport from the perovskite to the hole-transport-layer material. Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL measurements were conducted for the various perovskite films to examine the defect-passivation effect (Supplementary Fig.  12 ). For the DGPF perovskite films, in addition to a notable PL intensity enhancement, we observed a slight blue shift of the PL peaks, which agree with the scenario of the substitution of I -with Br -and the resulting shrinkage of the 3D crystal lattice. The carrier lifetime of the control perovskite film was substantially increased in the self-passivated DGPF perovskite films. All DGPF perovskite films exhibit a long exponential PL decay tail with PL lifetimes of above 1 µs (in particular, a PL lifetime of 1.86 µs was obtained for the 2-BABr sample), in contrast with the shorter lifetime (0.76 µs) for the control perovskite film. This is consistent with the higher voltages shown in Fig.  3c  for the DGPF perovskite device in which the defects were effectively passivated  33  . Furthermore, we measure the external PL quantum efficiency (PLQE) for the perovskite films with different contacts. The geometry of the PL measurements is shown in Supplementary Fig.  13 , in which the light excitation is either from top-or bottom-side. Here we used an incident laser with a wavelength of 485 nm, which has a penetration depth of less than 100 nm according to Snell's law, and which implies that we can mainly collect the PL signal near the top surface of the perovskite film under the front excitation  34  . The PLQE of the DGPF perovskite film deposited on the glass reaches a value of 13.58%, whereas it is only 4.65% for the control perovskite film. In the presence of charge-selective contacts (electrons or holes), the PLQE values for both the control and DGPF perovskite films decrease, which can be ascribed to the quenching effect and the introduction of non-radiative channels at the contact interface  35  . We again observe that the DGPF approach enables a less notable reduction in PLQE in the presence of selective contacts. In the case of light excitation from either the top or the bottom, the higher PLQEs for the DGPF perovskite samples suggest that the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite film as well as its related interfaces and surfaces can be optimized via the DGPF method. The highly sensitive photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) technique was used to study the sub-bandgap/trap-state absorption and energetic disorder in these samples  36  . A decrease in sub-bandgap absorption determined using PDS is clearly seen in the DGPF perovskite films, indicating reduced sub-bandgap states (trap states). The presence of electronic sub-bandgap trap states is one of the origins of non-radiative recombination pathways  37, 38  . The internal passivation derived from participation of the 2D perovskite in the final DGPF perovskite film can effectively suppress non-radiative recombination to incur minimal voltage losses. The PDS results come with a characteristic Urbach energy. The Urbach energy values, estimated from the PDS spectra, are 20.55, 19.7, 19.9 and 23.21 meV for samples treated with BABr concentrations of 0, 1, 2 and 5 mg ml -1 , respectively (Supplementary Fig.  14 ). The lower Urbach energy indicates a lower level of electronic disorder in the perovskite films with a low concentration of BABr treatment, which agrees with the enhancement of V OC (ref.  39  ). When increasing the BABr concentration to 5 mg ml -1 , we observe a slight band-edge absorption rise, indicating increased energy disorder. As the inherent Urbach energy in a 2D perovskite is higher compared with its 3D counterpart, this is expected and is also consistent with the decreasing device performance when treating with a higher BABr concentration. The PDS results for a 2D perovskite are shown in Supplementary Fig.  15 , which shows that the Urbach energy of the 2D perovskite is 38.4 meV. 
 Generality of DGPF strategy in PSCs We further performed electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the passivation mechanism at the BA/perovskite interface. The surface terminated with the (110) plane was used for the calculations. Charge-density .IP, inflection point. b ΔV OC,SQ (the recombination photovoltage loss at the Shockley-Queisser limit) was calculated, as a function of the bandgap, using the detailed balance principle. c ΔV OC,rad = E g /q - V OC,rad , and this is only available for the 1.63 eV perovskites shown in this table. d ΔV OC,nr was calculated from W OC and ΔV OC,SQ or ΔV OC,rad . PSCs, the post-burn-in lifetime T 80 value (that is, the time taken to lose 20% of the initial PCE) is 700 h under 0.8-Sun illumination. However, the T 80 post-burn-in lifetimes for the pure 3D PSC devices are much shorter, at around 300 h. To exclude the effects of interface layers (particularly the spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport-layer material) and the electric load (under MPP or OC conditions) on the operational stability of the device, we fabricated perovskite devices with a planar p-i-n structure (Supplementary Fig.  30a, b ) and tested the long-term stability of encapsulated devices illuminated under continuous 1-Sun irradiation using an LED lamp at a temperature of ~60 °C in air, as shown in Fig.  4b  45 . Under MPP conditions, we found that both the control and DGPF devices showed clearly decreased degradation rates compared with those under OC conditions, which can be ascribed to the role of the excess charge carrier  47, 48  . In concusion, our DGPF devices can retain 91% of their initial efficiency after 516 h of operation under continuous illumination in ambient air. In comparison, the control device retained only 16% of the original PCE under the same conditions. In summary, we developed a simple DGPF self-passivation strategy for high-performance PSCs, which achieved the simultaneous passivation of both bulk and interface 2D perovskites of the PSCs. The DGPF strategy dramatically boosts the PCE of 1.63 eV quadruple-cation PSCs to 21.54%, with a superb V OC of 1.24 V; we further improved the PCE to 23.78% (certified 23.09%) with the maximum V OC of 1.21 V in a ~1.53 eV perovskite system, that is, a W OC value as low as 0.326 V. Non-radiative recombination losses in the perovskite materials and devices can be reduced to as low as 74 mV (from EQE EL measurements), which is one of the lowest reported so far. The method is universally applicable to PSCs of different bandgaps. Moreover, substantially enhanced operational stability is achieved via the simultaneous passivation of 2D perovskites in the bulk and at the interfaces. The DGPF approach paves the way to further approach the theoretical PSC efficiency limit via the elimination of non-radiative recombination decay, and is a step forward in achieving highly efficient PSCs with long-term operational stability.
