Deuterated cholorobenze-d5: 7.14 (s), 6.99 (s), 6.96 (s); impurity: 1.03 (s, H2O); Pure DDT: 2.30 (q), 1.44 (m), 1.30-1.13(m), 0.88(t); Pure didodecyl disulfide: 2.62 (t), 1.65 (m), 1.34-1.21(m), 0.89(t); Spiro-OMeTAD: 7.18-7.16(d), 6.95-6.72(m), 6.90-6.87(m), 3.46(s); tBP: 8.44(s), 7.00(s), 1.09(s); CH3CN: 1.21(s). The DDT-treated sample after thermal evaporation and the DDS-treated sample before thermal evaporation both exhibit radical cations' peak at 520 nm, whereas this characteristic peak does not appear in neither the control sample nor the DDT-treated sample before thermal evaporation, well agreeing with NMR results.  When preparing the DDT-LiTFSI mixture (mole ratio 0.7:1), we observe the low solubility of LiTFSI powder in DDT and thence extracted the supernatant for characterization. For both control and DDT spiro-OMeTAD precursor, the incorporation of tBP significantly boosts the dissolution of LiTFSI salt in chlorobenzene. From FTIR results, we observe that the symmetric stretching vibration mode for S-N and the asymmetric stretching vibration mode for S-N in tBP-LiTFSI mixture and in DDT-LiTFSI mixture have nearly the same peak positions (1009 cm  -1  and 829 cm -1 vs 1008 cm -1 and 830 cm -1 ), suggesting the coordination between DDT and LiTFSI is similar to that between tBP and LiTFSI. In other words, the stretching vibration modes for S-N in DDT-LiTFSI are overlapped with that in tBP-LiTFSI upon incorporating tBP into samples. When comparing the modes of C-S in different complex mixtures, the overlapping of stretching vibration modes exists as well. Therefore, the difference in the coordination interaction can be hardly observed when comparing more complex mixtures. from the reverse J-V scan curves of about 15 cells for each condition w and w/o air activation (aperture size: 0.16 cm 2 ). The mole ratio of DDT/LiTFSI ranges from 0 to 1.4. Before air activation, (i) the average PCEs of control, DDT (0.34), DDT (0.7), DDT (1.4)           The best control cell shows a decrease as large as about 40% at 50°C after 450 hours. In contrast, the best DDT-treated device has a high PCE retention up to 94% over the same measurement period.         Spiro-OMeTAD, one of the most widely used hole-transport materials (HTMs) in optoelectronic devices, typically requires chemical doping with a lithium compound (LiTFSI) to attain sufficient conductivity and efficient hole extraction. However, the doping step requires an activation process that comprises exposure of the blend films to an ambient atmosphere. Additionally, the lithium dopant induces crystallization, and its hygroscopic nature negatively impacts device performance and lifetime. Here we report a facile approach based on the incorporation of a low-cost alkylthiol additive (1-dodecanethiol, DDT) in the spiro-OMeTAD HTM. We discover that DDT provides a more efficient and controllable doping process with significantly reduced doping duration, enabling the HTM to achieve comparable performance before air activation. The coordination between DDT and LiTFSI increases the concentration of dopants in the HTM bulk, reduces their accumulation at interfaces, and enhances the structural integrity of the HTM under wetting, heat and light stress. We fabricate perovskite solar cells using DDT-treated spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. Our best devices exhibit a certified power conversion efficiency of 23.1%. Furthermore, the devices can retain 90% of peak performance under continuous illumination for 1,000 h. Our findings represent an important step forward in the production of doped spiro-OMeTAD, as well as its reliable application and future d ev ice c ommercialization. The deliberate addition of impurities (doping) can modify the electronic properties of organic semiconductors. The discovery of this effect has contributed to the dramatic development of the electronic devices that pervade today's society  1  . Doped organic semiconductors are used to facilitate the transport of holes-positively charged quasiparticles produced as part of a solar cell's power-generating mechanism. The organic semiconductor 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-dip-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is one of the most widely used hole-transport materials (HTMs), and is typically accompanied by the lithium salt lithium bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide (LiTFSI) as its p-dopant. Such blend films have laid the foundation for the development of many optoelectronic technologies, such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)  2  , perovskite solar cells (PSCs)  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]  and antimony chalcogenide (Sb 2 (S,Se) 3 ) solar cells  [8] [9] [10]  , and have continuously delivered record-breaking power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in PSCs  4, 6   LiTFSI mediates the reaction between the O 2 and spiro-OMeTAD, producing a TFSI-stabilized radical cation  28  . The HTM is then p-doped once a critical concentration of radical cations is trapped. In stark contrast to the control, which requires air activation, the DDT-treated films exhibit obvious p-doping character before the air process. Nevertheless, DDT often acts as the electron donor rather than the electron acceptor. We thus performed 1 H NMR analysis to unravel the underlying mechanism and the associated trigger conditions for the reaction. The NMR results (Supplementary Fig.  3a ) show that the DDT sample before Au-contact thermal evaporation shows very sharp and distinct spiro-OMeTAD peaks of δ 3.46 (s, -OMe), 6.9-6.7 (-fluorene, -Ph) and 7.2 ppm (-Ph). However, after thermal evaporation of the Au contact, all three characteristic peaks are broadened, confirming the formation of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD •+ (refs.  29, 30  ). We observe an emerging chemical species with a triplet at δ 2.62 ppm for the DDT-treated spiro-OMeTAD sample after thermal evaporation of the Au contact (Supplementary Fig.  3b ). This new peak can be assigned to the protons of methylene (-CH 2 -S-S) in didodecyl disulfide (DDS)  31  . Thiols can couple into disulfide upon illumination, heat or alkaline stimuli, with the generation of the hydrogen as by-product  [32] [33] [34] [35]  . In this case, moderate thermal irradiation during Au-contact evaporation and alkaline additives (4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) and acetonitrile) in the doped spiro-OMeTAD precursor facilitate DDT coupling into DDS. Unlike thiol, disulfide is an oxidant that can be reduced by accepting electrons, like O 2 . By proton integrations, the molar ratio of [DDS]/[residual DDT] was calculated to be ~2.5:1. UV-vis absorption data (Supplementary Fig.  4 ) agree with the NMR results. 
 The impact of DDT on HTM structure Contact-angle measurements, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were carried out. The water droplet contact angle on the DDT-treated film (101.2°) is much larger than that on the control (32.3°) (Fig.  1c, d ), indicating markedly reduced hygroscopicity. A starkly reduced pinhole size as a result of the incorporation of DDT is also observed in the AFM results (Fig.  1e, f ), but DDT has a negligible impact on the film thickness (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). We tracked unencapsulated samples of indium tin oxide (ITO)/perovskite/ spiro-OMeTAD HTM in ambient air (relative humidity (RH) = 35-70%). No discolouration is observed with the DDT-treated sample, even after 2,880 h (Supplementary Fig.  6 ). Obviously, the increased hydrophobicity and the reduced pinhole size create kinetic barriers that slow down the intrusion of moisture. 
 The impact of DDT on the lithium compound Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed to investigate the formation of coordination bonds between the DDT and LiTFSI. From the FTIR results (Fig.  2a ), S-N in pure LiTFSI shows a typical symmetric stretching vibration mode at 800 cm -1 and an asymmetric stretching vibration mode at 1,056 cm -1 (ref.  36  ), which shift to 832 cm -1 and 1,008 cm -1 , respectively, when mixed with DDT. The downward shift of the S-N asymmetric stretching vibration frequency of 48 cm -1 may result from electron delocalization when a Lewis base-acid adduct is formed, demonstrating a strong interaction between DDT and LiTFSI. Supplementary Fig.  7  shows the FTIR results for more samples. The strong interaction between DDT and LiTFSI was further confirmed by time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). In Fig.  2b, c , DDT shows a homogeneous distribution throughout the doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM, accompanied by the desired significantly improved distribution of LiTFSI. Lithium cations show an enhanced intensity throughout the DDT-treated HTM (Fig.  2d ), approximately one order of magnitude higher than that of the control. This greatly improved Li + -TFSI -distribution is believed to be beneficial to the performance of the spiro-OMeTAD HTMs and their devices, because dopant accumulation at interfaces and a dopant gradient in the bulk usually result in poor electrical properties  18, 37, 38  . cells  10  (Supplementary Table  2 ). The recipe for this blend film has rarely changed over the past decade. Despite the demonstrated exceptional achievements, the controllability of the doping process and stability (lifetime) of doped spiro-OMeTAD under external stimuli remain largely untapped. The doping process for spiro-OMeTAD HTM requires air/oxygen activation, so the doping results depend greatly on the ambient conditions  11  . More challengingly, the lithium compound reduces the lifetime of the HTMs 12 because (1) it has a hygroscopic nature, which leads to film instability in moisture  13, 14  , (2) it induces crystallization of the films under heat  15  and (3) mobile lithium ions may diffuse into and impact other functional materials  16  . Alternative doping approaches  17, 18  and dopant-free HTMs  19, 20  have been developed to address these shortcomings, but none of the resulting solar cells have matched the performances of record-setting solar cells. Thiol and thiol-derived compounds have been driving the rapid progress in lithium-sulfide batteries  21  . The formation of stable coordination bonds between lithium and thiol/thiol-derived compounds can maintain the structural integrity of such batteries during their redox reactions  21, 22  . Inspired by this character of thiols, in this Article we explore a low-cost additive-1-dodecanethiol (DDT)-in an attempt to overcome the limitations of the classic doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM. DDT was incorporated into PSCs to systematically investigate its impact on the classic spiro-OMeTAD HTM. First, unlike previous studies of DDT on modifying the topography of functional layers in organic solar cells  23, 24  , our results show that some thiol groups in DDT can couple into disulfide groups under certain conditions. These disulfide groups can act in a similar role to O 2 , oxidizing the spiro-OMeTAD HTM. The DDT-treated spiro-OMeTAD HTMs and associated solar cells therefore achieve good performance before air activation. Second, DDT not only increases the films' hydrophobicity, but also reduces their pinhole size, creating kinetic barriers in the doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM against the ingression of moisture. Third, DDT coordinates with lithium compounds, maintaining the HTM's structural integrity, locking the lithium dopants into the HTM, and preventing the HTM film from crystallizing under a range of stimuli. Finally, DDT-treated films impede ion migration from other stacks. Device stabilities are therefore markedly improved under ambient air, wetting, thermal and continuous illumination stimuli. The price of DDT is less than US$0.033 per gram  25  , ensuring negligible add-on cost for future commercialization. 
 Results and discussion 
 The impact of DDT on p-doping We first analysed spiro-OMeTAD HTMs in complete devices. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were performed. The characteristic peak at 520 nm for the DDT-treated sample (Fig.  1a ) confirms the generation of radical cations, that is, spiro-OMeTAD •+ (refs.  2, 18  ), before air activation. Using KPFM (Fig.  1b  and Supplementary Fig.  1 ), we observe a pronounced shift of work function, with the DDT-treated sample showing a higher work-function value (4.55 eV) than the control (4.46 eV), which is very close to that (4.52 eV) of the control after air activation. Although both control and DDT samples give further-increased work-function values after air activation, more significant enhancement is observed in the DDT-treated sample, increasing to 4.74 eV. This indicates that the DDT-treated sample has a lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level than the control, in light of the Fermi level for the doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM lying very close to the edge of the HOMO level  26  , which also implies an enhanced p-type character  27  . In UPS measurements (Supplementary Fig.  2 ), the Fermi level is seen to shift closer to the HOMO level of the spiro-OMeTAD HTM, further confirming the p-type character induced by DDT. In the case of the control, O 2 in air binds with pristine spiro-OMeTAD to form a donor-acceptor complex, spiro-OMeTAD •+ O 2 •-(refs.  11, 28  ).

 The impact of DDT on charge transport and recombination Space-charge-limited current, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed to investigate charge transport and recombination in the spiro-OMeTAD HTMs before air activation. DDT enhances the hole mobility by approximately one order of magnitude from 2.7 × 10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 to 1.1 × 10 -2 cm 2 V -1 s -1 (Supplementary Fig.  8a ). The PL intensity of perovskite in the DDT-treated sample quenches more than in the control, indicating more efficient hole injection from perovskite to the spiro-OMeTAD HTM (Supplementary Fig.  8b ). The fitted series resistance (R S ) value for the DDT-treated sample (1.2 Ω cm 2 ) is lower than that of the control (3.9 Ω cm 2 ), whereas the fitted recombination resistance (R REC ; 1,927 Ω cm 2 ) is higher than that of the control (589 Ω cm 2 ) (Supplementary Fig.  8c ). The lower R S and higher R REC indicate faster charge transport and reduced recombination within the DDT-treated samples. We exclude a possible role of DDT in passivating the perovskite surface underneath, because the PL intensity measured when DDT is directly deposited on the perovskite surface remains almost identical to that of the control (Supplementary Fig.  8d ), thus showing the unique role of DDT when in the HTM. 
 The impact of DDT on device performance For Cs 0.05 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 PSCs prepared by solvent engineering and with a mole ratio of DDT/LiTFSI = 0.34 in the spiro-OMeTAD precursor, we observed markedly improved PCEs before air activation (Fig.  3a , Supplementary Fig.  9  and Supplementary Table  3 ). The DDT-treated cell shows a PCE of 20.0%, with an open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.15 V, a short-circuit photocurrent density (J SC ) of 22.0 mA cm -2 and a fill factor (FF) of 79.4%. Further air activation gives a comparable and slightly higher performance, with a PCE of 21.2%, V OC of 1.16 V, J SC of 22.5 mA cm -2 and FF of 81.5%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) results are shown in Supplementary Fig.  10 . In contrast, the control cell  
 Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41566-022-01111-x  before air activation only exhibits a poor initial PCE of 8.7%. This jumps to 20.2% after air activation, with a V OC of 1.13 V, J SC of 22.7 mA cm -2 and FF of 78.5%. The average values for the photovoltaic parameters of all the Cs 0.05 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 PSCs are shown in the caption of Supplementary Fig.  9 . The champion DDT-treated device shows a PCE of 21.8% with a V OC of 1.16 V, J SC of 23.0 mA cm -2 and FF of 81.6% after using an anti-reflection film, with little hysteresis (Fig.  3b ; the certified PCE is 21.63%). Figure  3c  presents stabilized-power-output (SPO) results at the maximum power point (MPP). Our in-house-measured fresh devices show little hysteresis, although an increased hysteresis was observed for the certification. This might be due to degradation of the device during shipping and queuing for the certification. Similar hysteresis enlargement has been reported elsewhere  39  . This DDT strategy was also applied to Br-free Cs 0.05 FA x MA 1 - x PbI 3 PSCs prepared by sequential deposition. In control devices, the best PCE is 22.7%, along with a V OC of 1.171 V, J SC of 25.8 mA cm -2 and FF of 75.2%. Superior performance is observed for the DDT-treated cells, as expected, yielding a champion PCE of 24.6% (certified PCE of 23.1%) with a V OC of 1.198 V, J SC of 25.9 mA cm -2 and FF of 79.2% (Fig.  3d ), although there is hysteresis (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). This hysteresis usually originates from unbalanced charge extraction and ion migration, which in the current case of sequential deposition is related to its slow nucleus formation and crystallization  40  . Supplementary Fig.  12  shows the EQE results for the cell. The average values for the photovoltaic parameters of small-area Cs 0.05 FA x MA 1 - x PbI 3 PSCs (0.09 cm 2 ) are presented in Supplementary Table  4 . We also fabricated PSCs with larger areas, and our best-performing large-area cell (1.0 cm 2 ) demonstrates PCEs of up to 23.1% (Supplementary Fig.  13 ; certified PCE of 21.72%). Note that the certified cells were measured after a three-month waiting period (stored in a N 2 -purged desiccator) for certification. The average values for the photovoltaic parameters of the large-area PSCs (1.0 cm 2 ) are shown in Supplementary Table  5 . To investigate the uniqueness of DDT, we fabricated solar cells using the aforementioned DDS-treated spiro-OMeTAD HTMs by incorporating DDS into the spiro-OMeTAD precursor. Both the champion (18.3%) and average (14.8%) performances of the DDS-treated cells are inferior to those of their DDT-treated counterparts (Supplementary Fig.  14 ; more results are shown in Supplementary Fig.  15 ). Although the best DDS-treated cells demonstrate a reasonable performance degradation (13.2%) after 1,000 h in ambient air (<10% RH, 25-30 °C, open-circuit condition), the best DDT-treated cells show decent stability (6.4%) over 2,200 h, as shown in Supplementary Fig.  15  and Supplementary Table  6 . We observe undesired denser pinholes for the DDS-treated sample compared with the DDT counterpart, although DDS did reduce the pinhole sizes compared to the control (Supplementary Fig.  16a-c ). The length of the alkyl chain is also important to the film's morphology. Article  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41566-022-01111-x  Octadecanethiol (ODT), which has a longer alkyl chain than DDT, leads to a larger pinhole size (Supplementary Fig.  16d  and Supplementary Table  7 ). Larger and denser pinholes may lead to inferior carrier extraction in the HTMs due to reduced coverage on absorbers, which may provide more pathways for the ingression of moisture and O 2 . On the other hand, the reducibility of residual DDT in DDT-treated samples is beneficial in preventing the soft crystal lattice of perovskite from deforming when exposing to O 2 (ref.  41  ). Supplementary Tables  8  and 9  show the performances of the control and DDT-treated Cs 0.05 FA x MA 1 - x PbI 3 cells before and after ageing in ambient air. 
 The impact of DDT on stabilities We use Cs 0.05 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 devices for all stability measurements, and all samples are air-activated for 48 h to attain peak efficiency. Wetting stability. We investigated the impact of DDT on wetting stability by conducting wetting stress experiments (RH = 50%, open circuit, air atmosphere and ambient lighting) on unencapsulated PSCs. Figure  4a  shows that the best control cell demonstrates a slow PCE degradation during the first 100 h, followed by a quick degradation, decreasing to 68% of peak PCE after another 430 h. By contrast, the best DDT-treated cell demonstrates greatly improved wetting stability, retaining a high PCE of up to 97% over the same measurement period. More cell wetting results are provided in Supplementary Table  10 . In XRD measurements (Fig.  4b  and Supplementary Fig.  17 ), the perovskite absorber in the control device is observed to undergo clear deterioration, yielding many impurity peaks after 530 h, whereas such changes are not observed in the DDT-treated devices. In the AFM results, the spiro-OMeTAD HTMs in control devices exhibit enlarged pinholes (Fig.  4c ) and cracks (Supplementary Fig.  18 ) after 530 h, but less morphological change is observed in the DDT-treated samples (Fig.  4d ). In the microscopic results, the spiro-OMeTAD HTMs in control devices are seen to have some crystallization (Fig.  4e ), but this is not observed in the DDT-treated samples (Fig.  4f ). From TOF-SIMS (Fig.  4g ,h and Supplementary Fig.  19 ), severe compositional interdiffusion between the HTM and perovskite is observed in the control device because of the poor resistance of the lithium compound and perovskite to water. In contrast, each functional layer maintains clear edges in the DDT-treated device. Thermal stability. We investigated the impact of DDT on thermal stability by conducting thermal stress experiments (50-85 °C, open circuit, N 2 atmosphere and ambient light) on unencapsulated PSCs. Figure  5a  shows that there is an increase as large as 63% with respect to the peak PCE at 50 °C after 120 h for the best control device, agreeing with the reported degradation results in the literature  42, 43  . In contrast, the best DDT-treated device has a high PCE retention of up to 95% over the same measurement period. We subsequently allowed the device temperature to rise to 85 °C and re-evaluated the device stability. ) J SC (mA cm -2 ) J SC (mA cm -2 ) V OC (V) V OC (V) Fig.  3  | The impact of DDT on device performance. a, J-V curves of Cs 0.05 FA x MA 1 - x PbI 3 devices produced by solvent engineering with and without air activation, measured from the reverse-bias scan direction under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight (aperture size of 0.16 cm 2 ). b, J-V curves of the champion DDTtreated Cs 0.05 (FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 cell produced by solvent engineering with air activation, measured from the reverse-and forward-bias scan directions, respectively (aperture size of 0.16 cm 2 ).

 Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41566-022-01111-x   We observed a faster degradation, with another 16% drop, for the control device after 24 h, whereas the DDT device shows a slower degradation with only another 5% drop. More test results on thermal stability are provided in Supplementary Table  11 . In XRD measurements (Fig.  5b ), no impurity peaks in either the control or the DDT-treated device are observed after 144 h, suggesting that the drop in performance is probably related to deterioration of the doped HTMs rather than the perovskite. This was confirmed by AFM, where we observe the formation of a crystalline fibril structure with valleys after 144 h in the control samples (Fig.  5c ). In comparison, DDT-treated films excel by largely retaining their initial morphological features, although with some enlarged pinholes (Fig.  5d ). In microscopy results (Fig.  5e, f ), the DDT film exhibits a suppressed crystalline coverage with smaller domain sizes. Crystallization of doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM films has a negative influence on device performance  44  , leading to decreased adhesive and cohesive fracture resistance  45  and the formation of an undesired layer that causes an energy barrier for charge extraction  46  . In the TOF-SIMS results (Fig.  5g ,h and Supplementary Fig.  20 ), the control device shows more Li + and TFSI -accumulation at the Au/ HTM interface. Lithium cations have been reported to migrate into the perovskite stack via bulk or domain boundaries  13, 18  . Contrastingly, the DDT-treated sample maintains overall good dopant homogeneity and higher concentration across the HTM. Capturing mobile lithium ions is critical for improving the thermal stability of HTMs  47  . We attribute the better results for capturing mobile lithium ions in DDT-treated samples to the strong interaction between DDT and the lithium compound. To confirm that the performance loss is arising mainly from the deteriorating HTM rather than the perovskite stack, we redeposited new doped spiro-OMeTAD HTMs on aged samples. The device performance could be recovered to ~19% (Supplementary Fig.  21 ). We also applied DDT-treated spiro-OMeTAD HTMs to FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 PSCs. Thermally Article  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41566-022-01111-x  stable FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 could avoid the degradation factor from the perovskite absorber  48  . Supplementary Fig.  22  and Supplementary Table  12  further confirm the benefits of DDT for thermal stability. Illumination stability. We investigated the impact of DDT on illumination stability by conducting continuous illumination stress experiments (AM 1.5, 30-35 °C, N 2 atmosphere, open-circuited, and SPO at MPP) on unencapsulated PSCs (Fig.  6a, b ). The best control device shows a decrease as large as 90% with respect to the peak performance after 2,000 h while open-circuited. In great contrast, the best DDT device has a high performance retention of up to 93% over the same measurement period. The DDT device also demonstrated a good stability result for SPO at MPP, retaining 90% of its peak performance after 1,000 h. More results on the light stability test are shown in Supplementary Table  13 . Continuous illumination deteriorates both the perovskite stack and the HTM in the control device, but the DDT-treated samples demonstrate improved stability. From XRD measurements (Fig.  6c ), the control devices are seen to exhibit a much stronger impurity peak (PbI 2 ) after 2,000 h than the DDT devices. The appearance of a PbI 2 peak could be ascribed to the loss of organic cations. Using AFM, small crystalline grains and valleys are observed for the control HTM after 2,000 h (Fig.  6d ), whereas most regions retain the initial amorphous characteristic in the DDT-treated sample, although with a few small crystalline grains on the surface (Fig.  6e ). Unlike the large crystalline domains caused by thermal stress, the crystalline grains caused by illumination stress are too tiny to be observed in the microscopy results. Nevertheless, apparent cracks can be observed for the control (Fig.  6f ), but not the DDT-treated sample (Fig.  6g ). From TOF-SIMS (Fig.  6h ,i and Supplementary Fig.  23 ), Li + and TFSI -ions are observed to accumulate severely at the interfaces in both control and DDT-treated devices. We notice the appearance of MA + cations at the Au/spiro-OMeTAD interface after 2,000 h in the control devices, which can be ascribed to ion migration of MA + from the perovskite to the Au contact via spiro-OMeTAD HTM; however,    
 Preparation of spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution The classic spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 72.5 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 28.5 µl tBP and 17.5 µl lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide solution (520 mg ml -1 in acetonitrile) in 1 ml of chlorobenzene. DDT with different mole ratios to LiTFSI, including 0:1, 0.34:1, 0.7:1 and 1.4:1, was incorporated into the doped spiro-OMeTAD precursor, respectively. The optimal mole ratio of DDT/ LiTFSI was 0.34:1. The spiro-OMeTAD precursor solutions were stirred in a glovebox overnight and filtered (0.22 µm, PTFE) before use. The spiro-OMeTAD films were fabricated on top of different substrates by spin coating at 4,500 r.p.m. for 30 s. 
 Preparation of substrate ITO glass substrates were cleaned with a 2 vol% solution of Hellmanex cuvette-cleaning detergent, then washed with deionized water, and acetone, and dried with dry nitrogen. The substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 20 min before use. The SnO 2 electron-transport layer was fabricated as described in the literature  49  . The KCl passivation layer was fabricated as described in our previous work  50, 51  . The RH in the lab was 50-65%. 
 Preparation of perovskite precursor For the Cs 0.05 FA 0.81 MA 0.14 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45 device, triple-cation perovskite precursor solution (1.25 M) was prepared by dissolving CsI, PbI 2 and PbBr 2 , FAI, and MABr in a DMF/DMSO mixture (vol/vol = 4/1). The perovskite precursor solutions were stirred in the glovebox and filtered (0.22 µm, PTFE) before spin-coating. For the Cs 0.05 FA x MA 1 - x PbI 3 device, PbI 2 precursor solution (1.5 M) was prepared by dissolving PbI 2 in a DMF/DMSO mixture (vol/vol = 9/1) with the addition of CsCl (5 mol%). The PbI 2 -CsCl precursor solutions were stirred at 70 °C in the glovebox and filtered (0.22 µm, PTFE) before use. In parallel, we prepared organic cation precursor solution by dissolving 90 mg FAI, 6.4 mg MAI and 9 mg MACl in IPA. The organic cation precursor solutions were stirred in the glovebox and filtered (0.22 µm, PTFE) before spin-coating. 
 Fabrication of PSCs The PSCs had an n-i-p structure: glass/ITO/SnO 2 /KCl/perovskite/ PMMA/spiro-OMeTAD HTM/Au contact. For the Cs 0.05 FA 0.81 MA 0.14 PbI 2.55 Br 0.45 device, we used ITO (transmittance, >84%; sheet resistivity, 6 Ω sq -1 ) as substrate. Perovskite films were deposited in the glovebox with anisole as the antisolvent. In detail, the perovskite precursor solution was dropped onto the SnO 2 /KCl substrates and spin-coated at 2,000 r.p.m. for 10 s and 4,000 r.p.m. for 20 s. We quickly dropped 250 µl of anhydrous anisole onto the substrates 10 s before the end of the program. The samples were immediately placed on a preheated hot plate and annealed at 100 °C for 45 min. For the Cs 0.05 FA x MA 1 - x PbI 3 device, we used ITO (transmittance, >94%; sheet resistivity, 15 Ω sq -1 ) as substrate. The PbI 2 -CsCl precursor solution was spin-coated onto the SnO 2 /KCl substrates at 1,500 r.p.m. for 45 s, then annealed at 70 °C for 10 s. The organic cation precursor solution was then spin-coated onto the PbI 2 -CsCl at 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15 min in ambient air (RH, 20-30%). Sodium fluoride was incorporated into the devices for better results when undergoing continuous illumination measurements, as described in the literature  52  . A PMMA solution (1 mg ml -1 in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated onto the perovskite film as described in the literature  53, 54  . The spiro-OMeTAD film was deposited on top of the perovskite film by spin coating at 4,500 r.p.m. for 30 s. The samples were then placed in a humidity-controlled box filled with air (RH, <10%, 25-30 °C, ambient light) for 48 h to ensure sufficient oxidation of the doped spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport layer before evaporation of the Au contact. A 100-nm layer of Au film was thermally evaporated as the contact electrode using a shadow mask. The mask temperature was above 50 °C at the end of the Au-contact evaporation because of thermal irradiation. Note that the moderate thermal irradiation during Au-contact evaporation is critical for inducing the coupling reaction between DDT molecules. Sn metal was soldered onto the ITO substrate before J-V measurements. To deposit fresh spiro-OMeTAD over aged devices after thermal and illumination stresses, we (1) peeled off the Au contact of completed cells using Kapton tape, (2) spun the samples at 2,000 r.p.m. while dropping 1 ml of chlorobenzene over the samples to wash away the aged spiro-OMeTAD films (three times), (3) dried the samples with N 2 gas and (4) dropped fresh spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution (72.5 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 28.5 µl tBP and 17.5 µl LiTFSI solution (520 mg ml -1 in acetonitrile) in 1 ml of chlorobenzene) on top of the perovskite, followed by spin coating at 4,500 r.p.m. for 30 s. 
 Characterizations Absorption spectra were obtained using an UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600 Plus). We peeled off the Au contact of completed cells using Kapton tape, dissolved the doped spiro-OMeTAD films using clean chlorobenzene, and then collected the corresponding solution for UV-vis absorption characterization. All samples were prepared and stored inside a N 2 -filled glovebox until characterization, without any intended aging in oxygen or in air. KPFM measurements were performed using a Si-coated Ti/Ir tip (work function of 4.27 eV as measured using a highly oriented graphite (HOPG) reference sample) with a 25-nm radius of curvature (ASYELEC.02, Oxford Instruments) as the probe, in non-contact mode with an a.c. voltage of -1 to +1 V. All KPFM measurements were performed immediately after the samples were fabricated, and all the measurements were performed in the dark in an enclosed N 2 -purging environment. For each sample, a 25-µm 2 sized map was obtained with a scan rate of 1 Hz and pixel density of 256 × 256. UPS measurements were carried out with an ESCALAB250Xi system (Thermo Scientific) in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber with a base pressure of <2 × 10 -9 mbar. UPS was performed with the He I (21.22 eV) photon lines. Contact-angle measurements were conducted on a KRUSS Drop Shape Analyser-DSA25 with a drop of ultrapure water (1 µl). AFM was performed using a Bruker Multimode 8 microscope in tapping mode.  1  H NMR analysis was performed using a liquid-phase NMR system (Avance III 600-MHz NMR, Bruker). For NMR spectra, deuterated chlorobenzene-d 5 was used as the solvent, referenced to the residual proton from chlorobenzene-d 5 (calibrated at 6.96, 6.99 and 7.14 ppm). We use Kapton tape to peel off the Au contact of completed devices, dissolved the doped spiro-OMeTAD films using deuterated chlorobenzene, and then collected the corresponding solution for 1 H NMR tests. All samples were prepared and stored inside a N 2 -filled glovebox until characterization without any intended aging in oxygen or in air. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. S1.
