Minimizing buried interfacial defects for efficient inverted perovskite solar cells

Controlling the perovskite morphology and defects at the buried perovskite-substrate interface is challenging for inverted perovskite solar cells. In this work, we report an amphiphilic molecular hole transporter, (2-(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-1-cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid, that features a multifunctional cyanovinyl phosphonic acid group and forms a superwetting underlayer for perovskite deposition, which enables high-quality perovskite films with minimized defects at the buried interface. The resulting perovskite film has a photoluminescence quantum yield of 17% and a Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime of nearly 7 microseconds and achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of  25. 4% with an open-circuit voltage of 1.21 volts and a fill factor of 84.7%. In addition, 1-square centimeter cells and 10-square centimeter minimodules show PCEs of 23.4 and 22.0%, respectively. Encapsulated modules exhibited high stability under both operational and damp heat test conditions. P erovskite solar cells (PSCs) have reached power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) >25%, approaching the PCEs of stateof-the-art crystalline-silicon solar cells  (1) (2) (3) . Further improvements to the performance and stability of PSCs will require delicate management of the interfaces between the perovskite absorber and charge transport layers  (4) (5) (6) . Intensive studies of the top surface of perovskite films, as well as its interface with the charge transport layer, have led to improvements in PCEs for PSCs of both regular (n-i-p) and inverted (p-i-n) structure  (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . However, manipulation of the morphology and defects at the buried perovskite-substrate interface is more challenging  (4, (12) (13) (14) , especially in the case of inverted-structured PSCs that have been demonstrated with simplified and low-temperature fabrication procedures and improved device stability  (15, 16) . In inverted PSCs, the perovskite absorber is deposited on a hole-transport layer (HTL), which plays an important role for the perovskite nucleation and heterojunction formation  (17, 18) . Commonly used solvents for solution-processing metal halide perovskites are amphiphilic small molecules such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)  (19) , but many commonly used HTLs, such as polytriarylamine (PTAA), NiO x , PEDOT:PSS, or self-assembled monolayers (SAM) for inverted PSCs, are either too hydro-phobic with respect to the perovskite precursor solution, or chemically unstable when in contact with the perovskite  (18, 20) . Both factors can generate morphological, compositional, or electronic defects at the buried perovskitesubstrate interface that limit photovoltaic performance as well as stability. In most cases, the HTL lowers the radiative efficiency of the perovskite absorber layer and increases the overall nonradiative recombination losses  (21) (22) (23) , so HTLs are needed that can support highquality perovskite deposition with a low density of nanovoids and deep-level electronic defects at buried interfaces. On the basis of the principle of "like attracts like" and considering the amphiphilic nature of perovskite precursor solution, we demonstrated the efficacy of an amphiphilic molecular hole transporter, [(2-(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino) phenyl)-1-cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid, or MPA-CPA, Fig.  1A ] with a multifunctional cyanovinyl phosphonic acid group for minimizing the buried interfacial defects through enhanced perovskite deposition and passivation. A mixedcation and mixed-halide perovskite with bandgap of 1.56 eV deposited on such an amphiphilic underlayer achieved a Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime of 7 ms, a 17% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), and an unprecedentedly high quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) of 1.24 eV for the given bandgap. Without any modification layer on the HTL, the resulting inverted PSCs achieved a certified PCE of 25.4% for a mask area of 0.08 cm 2 with simultaneous improvement in open-circuit voltage (V OC ) and fill factor (FF). We used this improved perovskite deposition to fabricate large-area devices and modules with a high PCE of 23.4% (1 cm 2 ) and 22.0% (10 cm 2 ). 
 Developing an amphiphilic molecular hole transporter The chemical structure of MPA-CPA is shown in Fig.  1A , whereas the molecular design, synthesis, and characterizations can be found in the supplementary materials. This amphiphilic molecule has a hydrophilic CPA anchoring group and a hydrophobic methoxyl-substituted triphenylamine (MPA) hole-extraction group. Unlike PTAA that can be only dissolved in lowpolarity solvents such as toluene and chlorobenzene, MPA-CPA can be dissolved in both high-and low-polarity solvents, including water, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, isopropanol, ethyl acetate, chlorobenzene, and toluene (fig.  S1 ). We also tested the solubility of the well-known SAM, [2-(9H-carbazol-9yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (2PACz), in different solvents  (24)  and found that it has a lower amphiphilicity than MPA-CPA. This difference likely results from the designed CPA group having enhanced hydrophilicity arising from a polar and electron-withdrawing cyano group adjacent to the phosphonic acid  (25) . We expected that after spin-coating a MPA-CPA solution onto the glass-indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a bilayer stack would form (Fig.  1B ) consisting of a chemically anchored SAM plus an unadsorbed, disordered overlayer. The overlayer composed of amphiphilic MPA-CPA (unadsorbed) displayed superwetting characteristics with regard to the perovskite precursor solution and had a small contact angle (~5°) that was beneficial to the perovskite deposition, in particular for larger-area substrates. In comparison, the contact angles of the perovskite solution on PTAA and 2PACz HTLs were 33.5°and 17.9°, respectively (Fig.  1 , C to E, and movie S1). The presence of the overlayer was important for the superwetting properties. The contact angle decreased after increasing the concentration of MPA-CPA in the spin-coating solution (fig.  S2  and movie S2); however, the spreading of perovskite solution was suppressed after washing the overlayer with a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO, which pointed to the formation of a bilayer. 
 Interfaces of MPA-CPA with perovskite films A triple-cation perovskite with a nominal composition of Cs 0.05 (FA 0.95 MA 0.05 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 , in which FA is formamidinium and MA is methylammonium, with a bandgap of 1.56 eV (fig.  S3 ), was then deposited on different HTLs of MPA-CPA, PTAA, and 2PACz, without any prewetting treatment. The superwetting capability of MPA-CPA led to highly uniform perovskite films that could be readily fabricated, in contrast to PTAA, with which attaining full coverage was quite difficult (movie S3). As shown in Fig.  1F  and fig. S4, all 10 perovskite films fabricated on MPA-CPA displayed full coverage (~100% production yield; table  S1 ), whereas on PTAA-and 2PACz-coated substrates, the yields were only ~50 and ~83%, respectively. The fabrication yield for the PTAA-based substrate could be improved with some prewetting treatments, such as DMF washing or hydrophilic interlayer coating  (26) . However, an intrinsic superwetting HTL without the need of prewetting treatments is more favorable for practical applications. We infer that the amphiphilic overlayer was partially dissolved into the perovskite solution, which facilitated the spreading of the solution, whereas the chemically anchored SAM layer was preserved as an ultrathin hole-extraction layer because it could not be dissolved by the perovskite solution (fig.  S5 ). Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurement indicated that the MPA-CPA was distributed across the entire perovskite bulk but with higher concentration near the buried interface (fig.  S6 ). Considering the large molecular size of MPA-CPA with respect to that of FA and MA, the embedded molecules should lie at the perovskite grain boundaries. The dissolved MPA-CPA also played an important role for the passivation of the perovskite, as discussed below. The absorption spectra of perovskite films deposited on different HTLs were almost identical (fig.  S7 ), but the films exhibited differences in their PL properties. Consistent with previous reports  (26) , perovskite films on PTAA exhibited a low PLQY (<1%) that we attributed to severe nonradiative recombination loss (Fig.  1G ). A much higher PLQY of 17% was reached for perovskite films on MPA-CPA, which is twice the value obtained on 2PACz. The dis-solution of unadsorbed MPA-CPA is necessary to reach such high PLQY values, as confirmed by fig.  S8 . We added 4-fluorophenethylammonium iodide (F-PEAI) to the antisolvent to process the perovskite film, which likely passivated the surface, the perovskite bulk, or both  (17, 27) . This PLQY value was higher than that on a glass substrate (~10%), further underlining the high quality of the MPA-CPA/perovskite interface. This PLQY would translate into a maximum potential PCE of ~27% if the recombination and transport loss at the electroselective contact can be eliminated (fig.  S9  and table  S2 ). Even after capping with the C 60 -based electron transport layer (ETL), the MPA-CPA-based samples could preserve a PLQY of ~5%, versus ~2% with 2PACz, which demonstrated the high optoelectronic quality of the overall stack. QFLS of perovskite on MPA-CPA before and after capping with C 60 are 1.24 and 1.20 eV, respectively (fig.  S10 ). The Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime of perovskite on MPA-CPA is around 7 ms, which is also much longer than those on PTAA and 2PACz (Fig.  1H  and fig.  S11 ). These results suggest that the deposited underlayer impacted the electronic quality of perovskite, and that nonradiative recombination could be suppressed by changing the nature of the underlying surface layer. Top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the microstructure of the perovskite deposited on different HTLs appears to be very similar (fig.  S12 ). To understand the huge difference of PL, we carefully characterized the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite near the bottom interface. We first peeled off the perovskite films with an epoxy encapsulant (4) and examined the morphology of the exposed bottom surface (Fig.  2A ). There were many nanovoids at the bottom surface of the perovskite grown on PTAA that likely formed because hydrophobicity led to insufficient wetting (Fig.  2 , B to D). There were fewer nanovoids when the perovskite was deposited on the 2PACz layer, but when the perovskite was deposited on the MPA-CPA substrate, a more compact and homogeneous morphology formed without observable voids. We further examined the bottom interfacial structure with cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) (fig.  S13 ), energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy mapping, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). PTAA formed a thin layer (~10 nm) between the perovskite and ITO and a morphologically defective contact was observed (Fig.  2 , F and G, and fig.  S14 ). These nanovoids not only hampered the extraction of photogenerated holes, but also triggered the degradation of perovskite film  (4, 17) . The perovskite deposited on MPA-CPA had very intimate contact with the ITO substrate, and we could not distinguish a clear HTL (Fig.  2 , H to J, and fig.  S15 ), which confirmed the ultrathin character of the SAM. This nanovoid-free, tight, and intimate contact between the perovskite and the SAMcoated ITO substrate correlates well with the suppressed recombination observed above with the electro-optical measurements. To gain further understanding of the influence of the substrate on the crystallization of perovskite, we performed depth-resolved grazingincidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements on the peeled-off perovskite films (fig.  S16 ). Fig.  S17  displays the azimuthal intensity profiles of the (100) reflection of perovskite layers deposited on different HTLs with incident angles of 0.2°, 0.4°, and 1.0°, respectively. However, the diffraction intensity showed a similar distribution for different substrates and different incident angles, which indicated a random crystallite orientation of the perovskite deposited on the different substrates in the bulk and surface. 
 Buried-defect passivation In addition to the improved perovskite deposition and interfacial contact, the designed CPA group in the amphiphilic overlayer could passivate defects in the buried interfacial region as well as in the perovskite bulk. We performed first-principles electronic structure calculations to investigate the passivation effect of MPA-CPA on typical deep-level defects produced on the perovskite grain surface such as interstitial lead (Pb i ) and lead-iodide antisite (Pb I ) defects  (28, 29) . Both Pb i and Pb I induced deep defective states within the band gap that would act as nonradiative recombination centers (Fig.  3  and fig.  S18 ). However, with the MPA-CPA molecule introduced, the Pb i and Pb I defective states were effectively passivated and moved to inside the valence or conduction bands, or near the band edges (Fig.  3B  and fig.  S18C ). Emerging chemical bonds formed between Pb and O from the phosphonic acid (Pb-O') group and between Pb and N from the cyano (Pb-N') group (Fig.  3A  and fig.  S18A ) that complemented the local octahedral chemical environment of Pb and was consistent with the passivation mechanism of the phosphonic acid group in 2PACz  (30) . The calculated Pb-N' bond length (2.47 Å) was somewhat shorter than the experimentally measured Pb-N bond lengths in lead acesulfamates (~2.58 to 2.75 Å), but the Pb-O' bond length (2.68 Å) was within the experimentally measured range (~2.484 to 2.914 Å)  (31) . The existence of a chemical bond between Pb and N' and Pb and O' was also consistent with the calculated electron localization function results (Fig.  3C ). Compared with the passivation caused by a single group, such as the phosphonic acid in the case of 2PACz  (30) , the synergistic passivation effect created by two types of bonds increased the thermodynamic stability of the passivation sites (table  S3 ) and was more effective at passivating deep-level defect states. Experimentally, the consequent reduction of the nonradiative recombination at the buried interface for perovskite films on MPA-CPA enabled high PLQYs (up to 17%) in the half-stacks. The interactions between CPA and Pb were confirmed by x-ray photoelectron (XPS) measurement (fig.  S19 ). We measured the frequencydependent capacitance in devices with different HTLs by using thermal admittance spectroscopy  (32, 33) . Figure  3D  shows that the device based on MPA-CPA exhibited a lower apparent trap density of states (tDOS) at around 0.4 eV, which should be related to the reduction of electronic defects or the lower number of ionic charges in perovskite  (34) . The decrease in the apparent tDOS is consistent with the higher PLQY and the longer Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime for perovskite film deposited on MPA-CPA. Additionally, bias-assisted charge extraction (BACE) measurements revealed that the population of mobile ions is decreased in the MPA-CPA-based devices (fig.  S20 ). Therefore, the chemical passivation might decrease both ionic and deep-level electronic defects that affect the radiative efficiency of the cells. The almost constant PLQY between 50°and 100°C (fig.  S21 ) for the perovskite deposited on MPA-CPA or 2PACz was consistent with robustness passivation. 
 Photovoltaic performance To study the photovoltaic performance of different HTLs, we first fabricated small-area inverted PSCs (~0.1 cm 2 ) with a configuration of ITO/HTL/perovskite/C 60 /BCP/Ag. The concentration of MPA-CPA was optimized to be 1.0 mg/ml (in ethanol) to obtain the best performance (fig.  S22 ). Further fabrication details can be found in the supplementary materials. The current density-voltage (J-V) curves of champion devices based on different HTLs are shown in Fig.  4A , and the average performance parameters are discussed further below. The PTAA-based device showed a PCE of 22.6% with a moderate V OC of 1.13 V and a FF of 81.7% (Table  1 ). The 2PACz-based devices achieved a higher PCE of up to 23.4% that was mainly the result of the increased V OC of 1.17 V. However, the champion device of MPA-CPA exhibited a PCE of 25.2% with a V OC up to 1.20 eV (for a bandgap of 1.56 eV), a FF of up to 84.5%, and a shortcircuit current density (J SC ) of 24.8 mA cm -2 . This device had negligible hysteresis between the forward and the reverse J-V scan at a scan speed of 10 mV s -1 (fig.  S23 ). After setting up a reasonable model in SCAPS simulations  (35) , we can well reproduce the J-V curves as well as the PLQY values (fig.  S24 ). The stabilized power output measured near the maximum power point (MPP) with an applied voltage of 1.07 V resulted in a stabilized PCE of 24.7% without decay in 300 s (fig.  S25 ). Fig.  S26  shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of MPA-CPA based champion device, and the integrated current density of 24.3 mA cm -2 agreed well with the value from J-V measurement and was consistent for the perovskite with an optical band gap of 1.56 eV. We sent one of the MPA-CPA-based devices to an independent laboratory (Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, SIMIT, Shanghai, China) for certification, where a PCE of 25.4% (with V OC =1.21 V, FF = 84.7%, and J SC = 24.8 mA cm -2 ) was confirmed (fig.  S27 ). This value is among the highest reported PCEs for inverted PSCs (table  S4 ). Figure  4B , S28 and Table  S5  summarizes the statistical distribution of PCEs and related parameter values for PSCs based on different HTLs. The average PCEs were gradually enhanced from PTAA (21.6%) to 2PACz (23.1%) to MPA-CPA (24.6%), with the main contribution stemming from the simultaneous improvement   S5 ), which can be related to the highly reproducible fabrication of perovskites films arising from the superwetting properties of the HTL. For MPA-CPA-based devices, the highest V OC exceeds 1.21 V and the highest FF exceeds 85%. Compared with other reported high-performance inverted PSCs, our devices achieved the highest V OC -FF product (Fig.  4C ), which reflects the low nonradiative recombination and the low resistive losses in the MPA-CPA-based devices. We achieved the high-performance PSCs by using alcohol solvents for the amphiphilic MPA-CPA HTL (Fig.  4D , fig.  S30 , and table  S6 ). The universal effectiveness of MPA-CPA was further verified in other perovskite compositions such as a wide-bandgap (1.68 eV) triple cation relevant for tandem applications and a CsFA doublecation perovskite (fig.  S31  and table  S7 ). The amphiphilic hole transport bottom layer favors wetting and spreading of perovskite )    precursor solutions and enabled fabrication of 1 cm 2 PSCs (fig.  S32 ). The champion device had a PCE of 23.4% with a V OC of 1.19 eV, a FF of 80.9%, and a J SC of 24.27 mA cm -2 (Fig.  4E ). Additionally, we successfully fabricated a PSC minimodule with an active area of around 10 cm 2 and tested its J-V characteristics (Fig.  4F ). The PCE of the minimodule with 4 subcells reached 22.0%, with a J SC of 6.11 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 4.68 V, and a FF of 76.9%. The stability of solar modules based on different HTLs was evaluated under acceleratedaging conditions according to the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols  (36) . Under continuous air mass 1.5 G 100 mW cm -2 illumination in ambient air in 30 to 40% relative humidity (RH) at ~45°C (ISOS-L-1, light only), the PCEs of all modules were almost unchanged within 500 hours of continuous operation (Fig.  4G ), and the MPA-CPAbased module retained >90% of its initial PCE after 2000 hours (fig.  S33 ). In addition to the operational stability, we conducted the damp heat stability test following the IEC61215:2016 standard (Fig.  4H ). The MPA-CPA-based modules retained >95% of their initial performance for 500 hours under the damp heat test (85°C and 85% RH). Voltage (V) Forward Reverse V OC (V) 1. 
 Discussion We have addressed a long-standing issue of how to control defects at the buried interface for inverted PSCs by developing an amphiphilic molecular hole transporter. The MPA-CPA molecule not only formed an efficient hole-selective SAM on the ITO substrate but also enhanced the perovskite deposition by providing a superwetting underlayer. The designed CPA group exhibited improved hydrophilicity and defect passivation capability arising from the synergistic coordination of the cyano and phosphonic groups with lead ions. The reduction of buried interfacial defects results in efficient, stable, and scalable production of inverted PSCs as well as modules. We believe that the strategy of amphiphilic underlayer design is universally useful for other perovskite-based optoelectronic devices. Future research will be focused on managing the nonradiative recombination and the energy alignment at the perovskite-ETL interface to realize the full efficiency potential of the MPA-CPA/perovskite stack. 
 Materials and Methods 
 Materials All the chemicals and reagents were purchased and used directly without further purification. Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass, organic halide salts (FAI and MABr), PbI2, PbBr2 and C60 were purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd. CsI was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PTAA and F-PEAI was purchased Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. 2PACz, MACl and BCP were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry. All the anhydrous solvents were purchased from Acros Organics. Cs0.05(FA0.95MA0.05)0.95Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3-based device fabrication Glass/ITO substrates were sequentially cleaned with soapy water, deionized water, and ethanol, by sonication for 20 min in each solution. Then the cleaned substrates were treated with UV ozone for 15 min before used. The PTAA solution was prepared with a concentration of 2.5 mg mL -1 in chlorobenzene. The 2PACz and MPA-CPA were dissolved in anhydrous ethanol at a concentration of 1.0 mg mL -1 (other solvents and concentrations were also used for MPA-CPA). The as-prepared solution was spin coated on the glass/ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s in a nitrogen filled glovebox. After 10 min annealing on a hotplate at 100 ℃, the HTL coated substrates were cooled down to room temperature. The "FAMA" perovskite precursor was prepared by mixing 1.4 M FAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 perovskite precursor in DMF: DMSO (4:1 volume ratio, v:v) with 9 % PbX2 excess respectively (X = I or Br) in a volume ratio of 95:5. Then, 40 μL of CsI solution in DMSO (1.5 M) was mixed with 960 μL of the above-mentioned "FAMA" solution. Additionally, 15 mol% MACl was added to the perovskite precursor solution resulting in triple cation perovskite precursor. 70 μL of the perovskite precursor were spin coated onto the HTL coated ITO substrates (1.5 cm × 2.0 cm) at 4000 rpm for 40 s (5 s acceleration to 4000 rpm). 200 μL mixed antisolvent (chlorobenzene: isopropanol = 9:1, v:v, containing 0.5 mM F-PEAI) was slowly dripped onto the center of the film at 7 s before the end of spinning program. The perovskite film was obtained by annealing at 100 ℃ for 60 min. After the perovskite deposition, 20 nm of C60, 7 nm of BCP and 100 nm of silver electrode were thermally evaporated. One square centimeter device and mini module fabrication For one square centimeter devices fabrication, 150 μL of the Cs0.05(FA0.95MA0.05)0.95Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3-based perovskite precursor was spin coated onto the substrates (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) at 4000 rpm for 40 s (5 s acceleration to 4000 rpm). 300 μL mixed antisolvent (chlorobenzene: isopropanol = 9:1, v:v, containing 0.5 mM F-PEAI) was slowly dripped onto the center of the film at 7 s before the end of spinning program. Other processes are the same as the preparation method of small area devices. For minimodule fabrication, the cleaned glass/ITO substrates (6.0 cm × 6.0 cm) were first laser scribed to form P1 with width of 30 μm, using a 1064 nm nanosecond beam with power of 2 W and scan speed of 500 mm s -1 . The hole-transporting layer and perovskite layer were deposited by spin-coating method with similar procedures for small area devices but with increased solution volume. In particular, for the PTAA coated substrates, DMF washing was required to improve wettability. The Cs0.05(FA0.95MA0.05)0.95Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3-based perovskite precursor (500 uL) was spin coated onto the substrates at 4000 rpm for 40 s (5 s acceleration to 4000 rpm). A tube of 500 μL mixed antisolvent (chlorobenzene: isopropanol = 9:1, v:v, containing 0.5 mM-F-PEAI) was slowly dripped onto the center of the substrate at 7 s before the end of spinning program. After the deposition of the BCP layer, the sample was scribed to form P2 with a width of 100 μm, using a 532 nm laser with power, scan speed and laser frequency of 0.3 W, 300 mm s -1 and 100 kHz, respectively. Then a Bi (20 nm)/Cu (100 nm) based metal electrode was deposited. Finally, monolithically interconnected modules were formed by laser scribing to form P3 with a width of 80 μm, using the same laser for P2. P4 is an etching procedure for cleaning the edge of the modules, and the laser used in P4 is the same with P2. The fabricated modules typically have 4 sub-cells, and each sub-cell has a width of 7.5 mm and a length of 3.5 cm. 
 Encapsulation For modules encapsulation, the tinned copper ribbons were soldered to the electrodes by indium wire ultrasonic welding to extend the connections. And the device was encapsulated by a cover glass with edges sealed by butyl tape with 1 cm in width. The stack was vacuum laminated in an industrial laminator at 120 ℃ for 20 min. 
 Absolute photoluminescence measurements Excitation for the PL measurements was performed with a 520 nm CW laser (Insaneware) through an optical fiber into an integrating sphere. The intensity of the laser was adjusted to a 1 sun equivalent intensity by illuminating a 1 cm 2 -size perovskite solar cell under short-circuit and matching the current density to the 𝐽SC under the sun simulator (25.0 mA cm -2 at 100 mW cm -2 , or 1.56 × 10 21 photons m -2 s -1 ). A second optical fiber was used from the output of the integrating sphere to an Andor SR393iB spectrometer equipped with a silicon CCD camera (DU420A-BR-DD, iDus). The system was calibrated by using a calibrated halogen lamp with specified spectral irradiance, which was shone into to integrating sphere. A spectral correction factor was established to match the spectral output of the detector to the calibrated spectral irradiance of the lamp. The spectral photon density was obtained from the corrected detector signal (spectral irradiance) by division through the photon energy (ℎ𝑓), and the photon numbers of the excitation and emission obtained from numerical integration using MATLAB. The PL was measured in air with encapsulated samples. For the encapsulation, we dripped UV-glue on top of the perovskite film, followed by covering a glass sheet (1 mm thick) which has the same size with the substrate. After the glue was totally spread out and completely sticked the substrate and covering glass with no bubble in between, we irradiated the sample with a UV lamp for 2 mins to solidify the glue. We note that the glue had been proved to be harmless to perovskite via checking the performance of devices with/without the glue. The whole encapsulation process was done inside a glovebox 
 Calculation of the internal electron-hole quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) To quantify the open-circuit voltage potential for every individual stack, we calculated the internal electron-hole quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) from PLQY results by using the equation (  26 ): QFLS = k B T × ln(PLQY × J G /J 0 , rad ) where JG is the generated current density at 1 sun, it is approximated with the short-circuit current density of the complete solar cell. J0,rad is the radiative recombination current in the dark, it is estimated by integrating the overlap of the external quantum efficiency of the full device (EQE) with the black body radiative spectrum at 300 K over the energy. 𝐽 0,𝑟𝑎𝑑 = ∫ EQE ∅ BB 𝑑𝜖 ∅ BB = 1 4 2 ℎ 3 𝑐 2 𝐸 2 exp ( 𝐸 𝑘 B 𝑇 ) -1 Where E is the photo energy, h is the Plank constant, and c is the light speed in Vacuum. The value of J0,rad is 9.72 × 10 -20 A m -2 according to the EQE spectrum of the full device and the blackbody radiative spectrum. 
 First-principles calculations Electronic structure calculations were carried out within the framework of density functional theory using plane-wave pseudopotential method as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package  (37, 38) . The electron-ion interactions were described by using the projected augmented wave pseudopotentials  (39) . The 6s 2 6p 2 (Pb), 4s 2 4p 5 (Br), 5s 2 5p 5 (I), 2s 2 2p 2 (C), 2s 2 2p 3 (N), 3s 2 3p 3 (P), 2s 2 2p 4 (O) were treated explicitly as valence electrons. We used the generalized gradient approximation formulated by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof  (40)  as exchange correlation functional. The alloy of FA0.9375MA0.0625Pb(I0.9375Br0.0625)3 perovskite was constructed to simulate the Cs0.05(FA0.95MA0.05)0.95Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3 perovskite fabricated experimentally. The random alloys were generated by the Special Quasi-random Structure method  (41, 42) , which can produce the best approximated periodic ordered structure to mimic the actual disordered state. To simulate the deep-level defects on the perovskite surfaces, we constructed the 2×2×4 supercells of the cubic perovskite in the slab structures with a vacuum layer thickness of 15 Å. Structure optimization (including lattice parameters and internal atomic positions) was performed using the conjugate gradient technique  (43)  until the energies converged to 10 -4 eV. A kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV was used for wave-function expansion and the Γ point was used for electronic Brillouin zone integration. To properly take into account the long-range van der Waals (vdW) interaction that is non-negligible for hybrid perovskites involving organic molecules, the optB86b-vdW (44) functional was adopted. 
 Other measurements The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded with the Bruker AM 400 spectrometer. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was performed on Thermos Fisher Scientific Q EXACTIVE Plus. The cyclic voltammograms were measured with a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China) using a three-electrode cell with a glassy carbon working electrode, a Pt wire auxiliary electrode, and a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) in saturated KCl solution, 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexaflourophosphate (TBAPF6) was used as the supporting electrolyte in tetrahydrofuran. TOF-SIMS was performed with an instrument from ION-TOF GmbH (TOF-SIMS 5-100). A Bi 3+ ion beam (30 keV) was used as the ion beam to peel off the PSCs with an analysis area of 150 × 150 μm 2 . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a Thermo ScientificTM K-AlphaTM + spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV) operating at 100 W. The time-resolved photoluminescence decay lifetimes were determined with the single photon counting technique by Edinburgh FLS1000 spectrometer by using EPL picosecond pulsed diode lasers (510 nm). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed in an ultrahigh vacuum surface analysis system equipped with SCIENTA R3000 spectrometer with a base pressure of 10 -10 mbar. UPS employed the He I 21.22 eV as the excitation source with an energy resolution of 50 meV. SEM images were obtained by using a Helios G4 UC scanning electron microscope. The EDX mapping of the cross-sectional cells were investigated in Titan Cs Probe TEM equipped with EDX and HAADF detector in STEM mode at 300 kV operating voltage. The cross-sectional lamella was prepared first in a SEM, equipped with an EasyLift nanomanipulator with the help of a Ga focused ion beam (FIB). To protect the sample, the protective carbon layers were deposited under electron and ion beams. TEM and scanning TEM (STEM) characterization were performed using ThermoFisher Talos F200X (FETEM, 200 kV). High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-STEM images were recorded using a convergence semi-angle of 11 mrad and inner and outer collection angles of 59 and 200 mrad, respectively. GIWAXS studies were performed at the BL17B1 beamline of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), Shanghai, China, using beam energy of 10 keV (λ = 1.24 Å) and a Mar 225 detector. The grazing-incidence angles for all films were 0.2° ,0.4° and 1.0°, respectively. GIXGUI Matlab toolbox was utilized for necessary corrections of GIWAXS raw patterns and collecting the azimuth angle  (45) . Apparent trap density of states was performed on Keysight 4980A at frequencies between 20 Hz to 2,000 kHz, and analyzed by using the thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) method. In bias-assisted charge extraction (BACE) measurements, the device was initially held at a voltage close to the opencircuit voltage where the injected charge equals the short circuit current. After a pre-set delay time of around 30 seconds, a bias of 0 V was applied to extract the ion charges in the device. To obtain ion charge density, a 2-wire source-sense configuration with a Keithley 2400 was used. Ion chargers occur at around 1 ms which matches well with the resolution of Keithley 2400. The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under standard AM 1.5G illumination (Oriel, model 9119), and the light intensity was calibrated using a standard silicon reference cell (Enlitech). The 0.08 cm 2 and 1.0 cm 2 size devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under a sweep mode of reverse scan (from 1.25 V to -0.1 V) and forward scan (from -0.1 V to 1.25 V) with the scan rate of 10 mV s -1 . For minimodule measurements (active area of 9.66 cm 2 ), the voltage range was fixed with 5 to 0 V and the scan speed was 20 mV s -1 .The stabilized output of the devices was measured by recording the current output of the illuminated device while holding it at a constant voltage near the MPP extracted from the J-V curve. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were measured by Newport-74125 system (Newport Instruments). To perform the damp-heat test of the encapsulated devices, we kept the modules at 85℃ and 85% relative humidity (RH) in the environmental test chamber. The encapsulated devices were measured periodically after 20 min cooling in ambient air. The operational stability of the encapsulated PSCs was measured by a home-made multichannel stability test system operating in the MPP tracking mode. The illumination was provided by a commercial xenon lamp chamber with AM 1.5G filter with controlled humidity (30-40% RH) and black body temperature (45 ± 5 ℃, equal to cell temperature). The light intensity was calibrated to achieve the same JSC from the PSCs measured under a standard solar simulator (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm -2 ). During MPP tracking, J-V characteristic curves of the devices were periodically measured every 24 hours. .0 and 1.0 mg/mL, respectively. PTAA can only be dissolved in low polar solvents of toluene (TL) and chlorobenzene (CB). MPA-CPA can be dissolved in both high and low polar solvents, suggesting a good amphiphilic character. 2PACz also shows a certain degree of amphiphilicity, but lower than that of MPA-CPA, as the former cannot be dissolved in water, TL and CB. This can be rationalized by the presence of additional polar and electron-withdrawing cyano group adjacent to the phosphonic acid group in the molecular structure of MPA-CPA. Owing to the conjugated donor-acceptor molecular structure of MPA-CPA, the solvent polarity and intermolecular aggregations affect the color of MPA-CPA solutions. 
 Fig. S2. The contact angles of the perovskite solution on MPA-CPA based HTLs deposited with using ethanol as solvent. The upper row shows the effect of MPA-CPA concentration on the wetting. At low concentration (such as 0.3 mg/mL), the spin-coated HTL mainly comprised a chemically anchored SAM layer with the hydrophobic head pointing out, thus the wetting of perovskite solution was not perfect with a contact angle of 13.7 o . With increasing concentration of MPA-CPA, a disordered and unadsorbed overlayer will form, and the contact angle of perovskite solution decreases obviously. The bottom row shows the effect of solvent washing of the HTLs with a mixed solution of DMSO and DMF (volume ratio of 4:1, similar to the deposition process of perovskite) before the contact angle measurement. After washing, the contact angle of the perovskite solution on the MPA-CPA of different concentrations tends to be consistent, which confirms that the overlay can be dissolved by the perovskite solution, but also proves the presence of a robust SAM layer at ITO surface. These results prove that the overlayer is sensitive to solution wetting and spreading, while the chemically anchored SAM layer is robust to perovskite solution and thus preserved as an ultrathin hole-extraction layer.  
 Fig. S4. Photographs of perovskite films deposited on different HTLs. We note that we did not use any pre-wetting treatment (such as DMF washing or coating a hydrophilic interlayer) for all these HTL substrates. Due to the poor wetting of the perovskite solution on PTAA, it is difficult to obtain a fully covered perovskite film on PTAA. The wetting of perovskite solution on 2PACz is improved relative to PTAA, but it is still difficult to fabricate perovskite films with complete coverage. On the contrary, due to the superwetting capability of MPA-CPA, it is easy to prepare a fully covered perovskite film on MPA-CPA. Fig.  S5 . X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra of MPA-CPA based HTL on ITO, with focus on the P 2p region. The bare ITO substrate does not show any P 2p signal. The as-prepared HTL sample (deposited with 1.0 mg/mL MPA-CPA in ethanol) shows strong P 2p signal. After washing the HTL with the mixed solvent of DMSO and DMF (volume ratio of 4:1), the intensity of the P 2p signal was decreased, but a distinct P 2p signal was still detectable, proving the robustness of the chemical anchored SAM layer. After washing, the decrease in P 2p signal intensity can be attributed to the dissolution of partial overlayer by the mixed solvent, which is consistent with the contact angle measurement results. According to the signal of InO2 -, the sputter time of 0-250 s mainly corresponds to the etching of perovskite layer. Fig.  S6  F shows the plot of normalized intensity of PO3H2 -anion (counts of PO3H2 -divided by the total counts of ions) against the sputter time for perovskite deposited on ITO substrate with or without MPA-CPA coating. For the PVK/ITO sample, the normalized intensity of PO3H2 -anion was lower than that of PVK/MPA-CPA/ITO sample by one order of magnitude. To investigate the baseline level of PO3H2 -anion by TOF-SIMS, we further compared the mass spectra of both samples collected for the sputter time duration of 80-240 s (Fig.  S 6 G and H) . The m/z of PO3H2 -is 80.9644 that is close to that of Br -(80.9168). The PVK/MPA-CPA/ITO sample show distinguishable peak of PO3H2 -, while the PVK/ITO sample did not show any signal of PO3H2 -(m/z of 80.9644). Therefore, the green line in Fig.  S6  F represent the baseline of PO3H2 -in this equipment, and the detected PO3H2 -in PVK/MPA-CPA/ITO sample should be from MPA-CPA.  Compared with perovskite films deposited on different HTMs, the PLQY of the devices were significantly reduced, due to the nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface. However, even after capping with the C60, the MPA-CPA based samples can preserve a highest PLQY of 5% compare that of PTAA and 2PACz, with a corresponding QFLS of more than 1.20 eV, implying reduced non-radiative recombination loss.    We extracted the EDX spectra of different areas in the cross-sectional mapping image (white rectangles in Fig  S15 E ). The EDX spectra are almost the same, and the phosphorous signal (2.0 eV) and Pb (2.3 eV) are not overlapped (Fig.  S15 F ). Therefore, the larger intensity of Pb at the ITO interface is not due to an incorrect assignment of phosphorous signal. Alternatively, it might be due to the strong affinity between MPA-CPA and Pb, which increase the amount of Pb near the ITO interface, or the FIB and STEM induced damage.       If we intentionally remove the overlayer by solvent washing before perovskite deposition, both of the PCE and reproducibility will decrease. Therefore, the overlayer is crucial for achieving high performance as well as reproducibility.    Starting from our previous model for a 1.63 eV triple cation perovskite  (46) , we lowered the bandgap to 1.56 eV. To set up a device model for these high efficiency cells, we first orientated us on the PLQY measured on the glass/perovskite sample (10%). We reproduced this value by assuming a perovskite bulk lifetime of 15 µs and a recombination of 30 cm s -1 at the buried perovskite surface and 10 cm s -1 at the top surface. We then assume that the MPA-CPA SAM lowers the recombination velocity at the buried interface to 10 cm s -1 and these settings readily reproduced the PLQY of the cell (5%). We were also able to reproduce the PLQY of the HTL/perovskite stack (17%) upon leaving out the electron transport layer which we considered to have an energy offset of 50 meV with respect to the perovskite valence band. We note that mobile ions are not considered in this preliminary model which we expect to lower the fill factor slightly and SCAPS does not consider the finite out coupling efficiency. We expect the model will be improved in the future and we provide the simulation file as supplementary materials.         TPA-CPO 3 Et 2 . In a 50 mL round-bottomed flask, TPA-CHO (500 mg), 2diethoxyphosphorylacetonitrile (500 μL), toluene (20 mL) and piperidine (0.5 mL) were added under argon protection.
