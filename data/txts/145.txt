General Nondestructive Passivation by 4-Fluoroaniline for Perovskite Solar Cells with Improved Performance and Stability

Introduction Organic-inorganic halide perovskite arises as one of the best low-cost candidates for solar cell in the future.  [1]  The record perovskite solar cells (PSCs) increased fast  [2]  and reached certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 22%,  [3]  which was comparable to that of commercial silicon/thin film photovoltaic (PV) devices.  [4]  Besides, the perovskite film can be easily fabricated using solution processes on substrates,  [5]  and thus it can be massively deposited by the roll-to-roll process on flexible substrates.  [6]  These merits offer commercial viability in PV market. However, stability issue is still an obstacle for the practical application and commercial viability.  [7]  Some efforts have been done to improve the stability. First, 2D perovskites (2DPs) exhibit improved stability in comparison to the 3D counterparts when they are subjected to light, humidity, and heat stress tests.  [8]  Due to combination of the high stability of 2D Hybrid perovskite thin films are prone to producing surface vacancies during the film formation, which degrade the stability and photovoltaic performance. Passivation via post-treatment can heal these defects, but present methods are slightly destructive to the bulk of 3D perovskite due to the solvent effect, which hinders fabrication reproducibility. Herein, nondestructive surface/interface passivation using 4-fluoroaniline (FAL) is established. FAL is not only an effective antisolvent candidate for surface modification, but also a large dipole molecule (2.84 Debye) with directional field for charge separation. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the nondestructive properties are attributed to both the conjugated amine in aromatic ring and the para-fluoro-substituent. A hot vapor assisted colloidal process is employed for the post-treatment. The molecular passivation yields an ultrathin protection layer with a hydrophobic fluoro-substituent tail and thus enhances the stability and optoelectronic properties. FAL post-treated perovskite solar cell (PSC) delivers a 20.48% power conversion efficiency under ambient conditions. Micro-photoluminescence reveals that passivation activates the dark defective state at the surface and interface, delivering the impact picture of boundary on the local carriers. This work demonstrates a generic nondestructive chemical approach for improving the performance and stability of PSCs. component and the high efficiency of 3D structure, 2DP/3DP is probably the ideal candidate for PSCs.  [9]  Second, different types of alkyl ammonium halides or ligand modification are employed to crosslink and/or passivate perovskite grains with enhanced stability.  [9c,d,10]  In the above-mentioned two cases, 3D component and/or 3D-like edge states play the important role in the PV performance but the slight increase of the 2DP/ ligand will degrade the performance greatly using direct mixing approach.  [11]  Hence, to keep the quality of 3DP for high PCE, it is ideal to employ post-treating technology with controllable incorporation of these stable components but without destructiveness to the bulk of pristine perovskite. In general, there are two types of post-treating methods. The first is solvent/vapor annealing, such as using N,N-dimethylmethanamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), CH 3 NH 2 (MA), and pyridine-based vapor post-treatment,  [4a,12]  it can facilely improve the film quality, performance, and the stability of perovskite. However, due to solvent/coordination effect, these reagents are destructive and the process causes recrystallization. Therefore, one should control the solvent/vapor amount and/or partial pressure precisely to avoid the unrecoverable film destructiveness. Besides, the optimized parameters for one perovskite may not be applicable for another perovskites. The second is solution treatment, using alkyl amine, polymer, and halide salt in the isopropyl alcohol (IPA) or chlorobenzene solution to passivate traps and to enhance performance.  [13]  Similar to the former, the concentration should be as low as possible to reduce the destructiveness on the morphology and/or optoelectronic properties. In terms of stability, we revealed that the lattice vacancies would provide the channel for moisture penetrating in and organic species releasing out, and vacancy-free MAPbI 3 can significantly retard the degradation.  [12c]  Namely, the molecular vacancy is probably a general issue that hinders the stability and renders ion motion. Therefore, it is interesting and meaningful to develop a nondestructive post-treating method that is general for different kinds of perovskites to fill the vacancy, passivate the grain surface, heal the film morphology, increase the fabrication reliability, and enhance the stability and efficiency under different circumstances. The key steps toward these targets are whether there is a nonsolvent or antisolvent reagent and how to implement passivation reaction in a well-controlled process. Besides, the passivation is expected to bridge the interface and facilitate the charge transfer as well. Herein, we identified that 4-fluoroaniline (FAL) was not only nondestructive for surface passivation but also a large molecular dipole to direct the charge transfer. Conjugated amine by aromatic ring and the para-fluoro-substituent reduce alkaline property, making FAL as an antisolvent for the perovskite in a wide temperature and time range. The passivation process is implemented by vacuum-free hot vapor assisted colloidal process (HVACP). Through slightly increasing the temperature, the passivation reaction occurs controllably and allows the molecular exchange with MA/FA (NH 2 CHNH) at the interface and surface. The most important point is that this post-treating technology will not hinder the bulk quality of pristine 3DP but heal the grain boundary at interface. Microphotoluminescence (PL) reveals that passivation activates dark defective state at the surface and interface, and the impact picture of microstructure on the local carriers is well investigated. The passivation modification not only improved the luminescent properties but also enhanced the stability and charge transfer, delivering 20.48% power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSC in the ambient condition. This passivation approach is suitable for different kinds of PSCs and general enough to be implemented in high-performance PSCs. 
 Results and Discussion 
 Molecular Design and Insight In previous post-treatment, the reagents are destructive to modify the surface and interface, induce recrystallization to change the quality of perovskite better or worse, and/or yield new phases.  [9a]  The large molecular size and/or thick passivation layer will retard the charge transfer from perovskite to charge transporting layer. It will sacrifice the PV performance due to reduced charge extraction. As a reagent for post-treating technology, FAL is different from previous compounds, waiving controlling the destructiveness. We first compared FAL, aniline (AL), 4-fluorobenzylamine (FBA), and benzylamine (BA) molecules to identify the uniqueness of FAL. We employed the density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the electronic distributions for the four molecules in more detail. FAL and AL display planar electronic properties. The amine is nearly planar owing to conjugation of the lone pair with the aryl substituent. The CN distance is correspondingly shorter. The CN and CC distances are close to 1.39 Å, indicating the π-bonding between N and C and promoting charge transport. [9b] The large π-bonding orbital can be verified from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) by Figure  1a . Therefore, they have reduced alkaline properties compared to common amines, such as MA and BA. We compare the basic dissociation constant (pK b , as shown in Table  1 ) values between these amines. The aromatic amine endows weaker basic property. Fluorination has effect on the large π-bonding, so the conjugated amine with fluoro-substituent delivers even larger pK b value, leading to the antisolvent properties of FAL. Second, according to our calculation (Figure  1a  and Table  1 ), the fluoro-substituent will have 1.66-1.81 times increase of electric dipole moment (EDM), thus FAL molecule is a large molecular dipole in combination with the nitrogen atom. The increased EDM benefits the hole transfer from the perovskite due to the alignment of these molecules, which provides a dipole field for charge separation. Moreover, reminiscent of basic chemistry knowledge, fluorination will endow the hydrophobic properties that can resist water erosion, which is beneficial for the humidity stability.  [14]  BA and FBA have stronger basic properties that are still similar to normal amines. Therefore, they are still destructive for 3DP. Namely, the small concentration range and narrow treating-time window make them difficulty in the post-treatment. In terms of thermodynamics, it seems to be impossible to modify the perovskite for passivation using BA, FBA, AL, and FAL, because all these amines have larger pK b values than MA (3.88). In the kinetics, the modification is possible, depending on reaction temperature and time. Therefore, BA, FBA, and MA, as stronger bases, decompose the perovskite more quickly, while FAL and AL, as much weaker bases (≈10 5 weaker than BA), do not decompose the bulk 3DP. Namely, FAL has the widest time window and the most nondestructive property to treat perovskite film. Therefore, FAL molecules only replace the sites of MA/FA vacancies at the surface and grain boundary with an ultrathin stable layer, as illustrated in Figure  1b .  [12c]  Figure  1c  displays post-treating method in HVACP. There are three advantages of vapor treatment. First, it can be performed for large amounts of substrates and offer mass production viability.  [15]  Second, we can control the reaction facilely in the antisolvent atmosphere. Namely, there is not solvent effect and thus the quality of pristine 3DP is retained. The molecular exchange just occurs in ultrathin depth at the interface and surface. Third, the FAL can reduce the traps. Many reports revealed that the surface and interface of hybrid perovskites have lattice vacancies due to the removal of the organic species and FAL will fill the vacancies. It is not only nondestructive to the bulk thin film, but also reduces the whole traps through surface modification in large scale.  [16]   
 Antisolvent Properties and Surface Passivation In order to display the antisolvent and nondestructive properties visually, we put a drop of amine solution on the perovskite thin films and compare the solution destructiveness among FAL, AL, FBA, and BA via optical images. We can see that there are no changes for FAL and AL in 60 s, but the FBA and BA damage the film seriously after 10 s, with transparent circular area in which the perovskite is fully dissolved (Figure  2a  and Figure  S1 , Supporting Information). We further use FAL solution to process the perovskite at 100 °C, and find that it produces a little tighter, smoother, and more uniform surface as well (Figure  S2 , Supporting Information). The strong amines have coordination effect while FAL just has the weakest coordination effect judging from first appearance of precipitation when adding these amines into 0.8 m PbI 2 solution (Figure  S3 , Supporting Information). We also have interest to compare FAL with IPA solution on the perovskite thin films. Solution effect of IPA can be identified without coordination from the appearance of yellow PbI 2 (Figure  S1 , Supporting Information). In terms of solubility of organic component, FAL and IPA have low solubility (≈5 wt% MAI). Then, we performed the vapor post-treatment using these molecules and observed the microscopic morphology. We can see FBA and BA will cause serious recrystallization and produce dendritic-like structure (Figure  2b ).  [17]  From the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure  2c ) at 2θ = 5.65°, 7.11° of the control BA-and FBA-treated films, we verify the 2DPs are produced, probably corresponding to (002 ) facets of n = 3, 4 of 2D A 2 B n-1 Pb n X 3n+1 (A = long chain ion, B = MA + /FA + , n = 1, 2, … ∞), respectively.  [18]  Global PL spectra support that there are 2DP phases of BA-(FBA-)treated films judging from the blue-shifted PL peaks (Figure  2d ). The formation is shown by Equation (  1 ) n n n FBA MAPbI FBA MA Pb I byproduct 3 2 1 3 1 + → + - + (1) FAL and AL can bring more uniform surface coverage (Figure  2b ). The XRD films indicate there is no 2DP phase yielded (Figure  2c ). Furthermore, we further check that the 2DP would not appear even after vapor post-treatment at 140 °C for 10 min by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAX) (Figure  S4 , Supporting Information). It is noticed that this does not mean FAL(AL) cannot modify the surface. If we directly mix the FAL with perovskite precursor, the 2DP can be produced as well (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information). Therefore, FAL just modifies the surface of Small 2018, 14, 1803350  as-prepared 3DP but not enter the bulk using HVACP due to the weakest basic property. The antisolvent effect retards the penetration to the bulk interior. FAL surface modification can be expressed by Equation (  2 ) taking the MAPbI 3 as an example.  [19]  The higher boiling point of FAL (180.5-182.5 °C) than MA (-6 °C) makes the reaction occur controllably and reaches a more thermodynamically stable equilibrium under heating ( ) + → + - (2) We can see that FAL-treated perovskite has the even better PL intensity than AL-treated perovskite, suggesting better passivation reaction occurs (Figure  2d ). Therefore, FAL passivation not only retains the advantage of the bulk 3DP, but also enhances the optoelectronic property, which ensures that it is not going to sacrifice the photo-to-electron converting process. 
 Improved Film Quality and Optoelectronic Properties Figure  3a ,b presents the UV-vis absorption and XRD patterns, respectively. After 40 s treatment at 100 °C, we can see that FAL perovskite has better absorption and the crystalline quality of 3D component is also improved. The perovskite diffraction peak at 2θ = 14.15° is 6.9 times as intense as that of the peak from the fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) at 2θ = 37.73°, which is even higher than the reported large-area device prepared by VASP,  [5d]  whereas the ratio is only 5.8 for pristine films. This distinct difference arises from the much superior shielding of the FTO (Figure  3b ) by the highly crystalline perovskite capping layer passivated by the HVACP. The enhanced crystallinity is probably induced by the antisolvent annealing and surface passivation. The FAL annealing rearranges the internal of grain and the passivation enhances the surface/interface quality, respectively.   images of the pristine and passivated perovskites with slight incorporation of Pb(SCN) 2 that could help to produce large grain for observation of microstructure.  [20]  Through comparison, we observed the boundary passivation indeed greatly healed the surface and increased the compactness afterward. In addition, atomic force microscope (AFM) image of passivated film shows smaller roughness difference, which is consistent with the SEM images (Figure  S6 , Supporting Information). The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of pristine and FAL passivated perovskite films is 26.6 and 28.2 nm, respectively. The pristine cracks and pinholes can be recovered by the expansion after the incorporation of FAL molecules and thus the surface/interface vacancies are fully passivated. The anchorage of FAL can be demonstrated by the infrared spectroscopy. Figure  3e  reveals the following spectral features and peak positions for the FAL passivation. Aromatic CC stretching at 1736 cm -1 and aromatic CN stretching at 1689 cm -1 , and CF peak at 1262 cm -1 greatly increase, illustrating that the increasing amount of FAL molecules were gradually deposited on the surface.  [21]  This passivation yielded a compact shielding layer to resist water penetration in the final perovskite thin film. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) results suggest there is chemical adsorption in the HVACP. In order to ascertain the improving optoelectronic properties, we first employ global PL to characterize the film quality (Figure  4a ). In this part, the perovskite is deposited on the nonconductive glasses and covered with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) for encapsulation to facilitate the measurement. PL displays 10 nm narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) after FAL treatment, which indicates the reduction of surface/interface defects in combination with the nondestructive process. Then we further employ micro-PL using correlated confocal PL/fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to study microstructure-performance relationships in perovskite films. For pristine perovskite films, we found substantial local PL heterogeneity of intensity at the grain boundary, interface, and surface, which suggests that there are considerable nonradiative recombination sites in these films, as shown in Figure  4b . Importantly, we found that boundaries quenched the PL to the greatest extent, which was consistent with previous reports.  [12d]  Micro-PL revealed post-treatments that could activate previously dark regions at surface and enhance the overall film quality (Figure  4c ). The PL lifetimes are also mapped and substantially increased lifetime profiles after FAL treatment can be verified by the uniform green in comparison to the nonuniform light blue in the same color bar in Figure  4d, e . Although there are some PL heterogeneities between different grains, probably due to the size effects on the micro-PL, the PL inside the grain is extremely homogeneous after FAL treatment. FAL-treated perovskite has longer PL lifetime by a factor of 7 than pristine thin film (Figure  4f ), indicating the optoelectronic enhancement by FAL post-treatment. We calculated by slope = 2/(eεN t ) in Mott-Schottky plot and one can see that the trap density (N t ) of FAL-passivated PSC is only 68% as high as that of pristine PSC (Figure  S7 , Supporting Information). 
 PV Performance and Dipole Alignment The PV devices are deposited in p-i-n configuration on the FTO glasses. The SnO 2 layers are first deposited on the FTO glass via spin-coating SnCl 2 •2H 2 O precursor prepared at room temperature (RT, measured as 25 ± 1 °C) as the n-type electron transport layer (ETL).  [22]  After calcination at 180 °C for an hour, Small 2018, 14, 1803350 pristine perovskites are deposited by the antisolvent method and then heated for 1 h at 100 °C. FAL treatment is performed at 100 °C with a drop of solution on the hot plate. We found the post-treatment had wide time window up to several minutes and 40 s were enough for the post-treatment, which increased the technical viability and facilitated the fabrication. The crosssection view of the post-treated device is shown in Figure  5a  and the perovskite layer thickness is around 520 nm. The perovskite crystal grain boundaries are closely packed without crack. The grain size is around 1 µm. The FAL passivation can allow perovskite thin films have excellent PV properties both in bulk interior and at grain boundaries. We further examined the photovoltaic performance and found that the post-treatment significantly improved PSCs' performance. Figure  5b  shows the current density-voltage (J-V) curves of mixed-cation/halide Cs 0.05 (MA 0.17 FA 0.83 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 perovskite-based devices without/with post-treatment. The pristine PSC exhibited only a moderate efficiency of 17.08%, with J sc of 22.56 mA cm -2 , V oc of 1.02 V, and FF of 0.743, in reversed scan mode. After post-treatment, the largely improved device performance was obtained, achieving J sc of 23.33 mA cm -2 , V oc of 1.13 V, FF of 0.777, and PCE of 20.48%, which is 20% higher than the reference cell. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve (Figure  S8 , Supporting Information) has integrated value of 22.48 mA cm -2 , supporting the measured J sc value and J-V hysteresis is not obvious in the solar cell (Figure  5b ). Basically, the interface and the trap account for the hysteresis.  [23]  In our regular p-i-n-FTO planar PSC, FAL modification passivates the perovskite and bridges the p-side interface and thus the hysteresis is much reduced to great extent. The interface at n-side may still cause some hysteresis, which will be improved in the future work. In order to give more convincing comparison, we give the statistical data for pristine and FAL passivated cells, and we can see that the average V oc , J sc , FF, and PCE of reversed scanning mode are all improved, as shown in Figure  5c-f . In order to demonstrate the molecular dipole alignment, the surface potentials are tested by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) (Figure  6 ). The surface of FAL-passivated perovskite has ≈120 mV higher tip potential than that of pristine perovskite (Figure  6a, b ). This is due to the alignment of molecular dipoles through HVACP. We also measured the KPFM of solution-process-passivated perovskite in Figure  6c . Its surface potential is small (≈40 mV). Namely, in HVACP, the vapor molecules are chemically anchored and well aligned into dipole field (Figure  6d ). However, in the solution process, both physical and chemical adsorption occur during the dip-coating. The molecules through physical adsorption seem to be randomly distributed, reducing the net dipole field. The offset effect of random distribution was schematically illustrated in Figure  6e  and the antialigned configuration could counterbalance the dipoles. In the PSC device, the dipole alignment by HVACP can help to promote the charge separation. To evidence the improved charge separation via dipole field in PV devices, we resort to impedance spectroscopy to obtain the series resistance (R s ) and recombination resistance (R rec ). FALpassivated PSC has 15 times R rec lager than that of pristine PSC, while it has 0.5 times R s smaller than that of pristine PCS. This result is consistent with the previous PV performance and KPFM. 
 Stability Improvement Stability issue is the major obstacle to the commercialization, and more extensive stabilization of perovskite solar cell under atmospheric conditions is warranted. Importantly, we discovered that the post-treatment of FAL not only imparted better Small 2018, 14, 1803350 photovoltaic performance but also greatly enhanced photo, humidity, and thermal stability to the perovskite material. We compared the stability of pristine and FAL-modified bare perovskite films by exposing them in high relative humidity (85-95%).  [24]  We monitored perovskite degradation under this high humidity by recording thin-film XRD spectra at different exposure intervals (Figure  7a ) and found that the pristine perovskite was severely corroded by moisture. As well known, for CsFAMA-mixed cation perovskite, the yellow phase is the first degradation product. The final products of pristine perovskite contained large amounts of yellow phase, as evidenced by the appearance of the characteristic peak of yellow phase at 11.6°.  [25]  For the aged FAL-treated film, the yellow phase peak is much smaller, implying a much lower degree of decomposition. Therefore, the post-treatment of FAL will stabilize the perovskite phase and retard the appearance of yellow phase under ambient condition. After moisture-degradation at different intervals, the thin films are fabricated into solar cells and the performance is tested. The pristine perovskite decomposes to much lower PCE after exposure to moisture. However, the reversed scan PCE of FAL-treated PSC decreases small in high humidity (85%RH) (Figure  7b ) for 66 h. Besides, the photothermal stability of the bare thin films is greatly improved. We heat the thin film to 85 °C under a white light-emitting diode (LED) light source with an intensity of 200 mW cm -2 (Figure  S9 , Supporting Information) and keep for 100 h to check the surface morphology. We find that the pristine Small 2018, 14, 1803350  perovskite film showed decomposition according to the appearance of delta phase, while FAL-passivated perovskite film has no degradation (Figure  S10 , Supporting Information). FAL-passivated PSCs have better photostability than pristine PSCs under 1 sun illumination (Figure  7c ). The result shows that FAL-treated PSC can retain 75% of the initial efficiency after 95 h while the pristine PSC will quickly degrade 50% PCE in the same period for the unsealed device. FAL passivation can effectively enhance the humidity stability and optoelectronic properties for the bare thin film. Photoaging stability of the PSC is also related to the spiro-OMeTAD-based hole transport layer (HTL) and thus the degradation trend/mechanism under operation condition has similarities in the curves to each other. We infer that this may arise from electrode metal diffusion into the spiro-OMeTADbased HTL, as well as the instability of spiro-OMeTAD-based HTL itself, thus a shielding layer of metal oxide can be employed in the future work. 
 Universality Demonstration We found FAL passivation was nondestructive for different kinds of perovskites, such as MAPbI 3 , MAPbI 3-x Cl x , and Cs 0.17 FA 0.83 PbI 2.6 Br 0.4 . Using post-treating technology, there are not new kinds of phase yielded in the thin film (Figure  8a ) for different kinds of perovskites. Besides, after FAL passivation, the UV-vis absorptions of perovskite thin films suggest this passivation is nondestructive and has improvement of crystal quality (Figure  8b ). Besides, the performance of FAL-passivated device is also improved (Table  2 ). Therefore, FAL treatment is under control and the optimized procedure can be facilely transferred to post-treat other kinds of perovskite without adjustment. This provides viability as a general post-treating technology to enhance the stability and performance for different kinds of perovskite. However, the stronger amines (FBA, BA, etc.) are not general enough. The concentration, amount, and temperature should be adjusted from time to time to be compatible for different perovskites due to the destructiveness. For example, we employ 5 µL BA to treat the FAPbI 3 and find there is no 2DP phase. If we directly transfer this treatment to Cs 0.17 FA 0.83 PbI 2.6 Br 0.4 and it cannot avoid the formation of 2DP in the experiment. Even we adjust the amount of BA, it does not work. Moreover, the thickness of 2DP using BA treatment is highly related to the amount and treating time. Namely, the more precise control should be performed, which makes it difficult for large-scale fabrication. Hence, the major advantage of antisolvent treatment is the nondestructiveness to the bulk interior and effective passivation to the surface and grain boundary, leading to the improved PV performance and stability. 
 Conclusions In this work, we have demonstrated that FAL is a perfect antisolvent candidate for surface/interface passivation and employed HVACP to nondestructively post-treat the as-prepared 3DP with dual roles in defect passivation and charge transfer. The antisolvent and nondestructive properties are attributed by conjugated amine in aromatic ring and para-fluorine substituent. The molecular passivation has yielded an ultrathin protection layer due to hydrophobic fluorine tail and thus enhanced the stability and performance. The large streamlined molecular dipole enables facilitated charge separation along the molecular backbone by dipole field. FAL-passivated PSC has delivered 20.48% PCE in the ambient condition. Micro-photoluminescence has revealed that nondestructive passivation activates dark defective state at the surface and interface. FAL is suitable for posttreating different kinds of perovskite and heals the defects via easily controlled process, without destructiveness to pristine perovskite. Due to wide operation time window, this passivation process facilitates the fabrication. Therefore, this work demonstrates a generic nondestructive chemical approach for improving the performance and stability of PSCs.

Thin Film and Solar Cell Fabrication: FTO-coated glass was sequentially cleaned with deionized water, cleaning fluid, acetone, 2-propanol, and ethanol for 30 min, respectively. SnO 2 ETLs were prepared by spincoating precursor solutions of SnCl 2 •2H 2 O (0.1 m) in ethanol on clean FTO substrates. The thin films were heated in air at 180 °C for 1 h and then treated with a UV-ozone machine for 15 min.  [22]  For Cs 0.05 (MA 0.17 FA 0.83 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 perovskites, the mixed perovskite precursor solutions contained FAI (1 m), PbI 2 (1.1 m), MABr (0.2 m), and PbBr 2 (0.2 m) in anhydrous DMF:DMSO = 4: 1 (v:v). Then CsI (53 µL), predissolved as a stock solution in DMSO (1.5 m), was added to the mixed perovskite precursor solution (1 mL). The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated at 1000 and 6000 rpm for 10 and 30 s, respectively. Chlorobenzene (120 mL) was poured on the surface of perovskite 5 s before the end of the program. Films with Cs-containing perovskite turned dark immediately after spin-coating. The substrates were then annealed at 100 °C for 1 h in a nitrogen-filled glove box.  [26]  For MAPbI 3 perovskites, the mixed perovskite precursor solutions contained MAI (1 m) and PbI 2 (1 m) in anhydrous DMF. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated at 500 and 5000 rpm for 3 and 30 s, respectively. Chlorobenzene (120 mL) was poured on the surface of perovskite 10 s before the end of the program. Films turned dark immediately after spin-coating were then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min in a nitrogen-filled glove box. For MAPbI 3-x Cl x perovskites, the mixed perovskite precursor solution contained MAI (3.64 m) and PbCl 2 (0.88 m) in anhydrous DMF. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated at 500 and 3000 rpm for 3 and 30 s, respectively. The substrates were then annealed at 100 °C for 1 h in a nitrogen-filled glove box. For Cs 0.17 FA 0.83 PbI 2.6 Br 0.4 perovskites, the mixed perovskite precursor solutions contained CsI (106 mg), FAI (343 mg), PbI 2 (886 mg), and PbBr 2 (175 mg) in 1 mL anhydrous DMF/DMSO = 4/1 (v/v). The spin-coating and annealing process was the same as those of Cs 0.05 (MA 0.17 FA 0.83 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 perovskites. For vapor post-treatment, the perovskite film was put on a hotplate with different temperature (100 or 140 °C) and then 10 µL solvent (FAL, AL, FBA, or BA) was dropped near the film. A glass dish was put to cover them immediately. Hole transport layer solution was spiro-eMeTAD/ chlorobenzene solution (1 mL, 72 mg mL -1 ) added Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (20 µL, 520 mg mL -1 ) and tBP (30 µL). The solution was spin-coated on the top of perovskite at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 80 nm Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation under a high vacuum (<5.0 × 10 -4 Pa). Stability Experiments: For the photostability test, the unsealed PSCs were illuminated under an AM 1.5G filter at 100 mW cm -2 using a Newport Oriel 92192 Solar Simulator in nitrogen and tested at different intervals. For all of the humidity stability studies, the glass/FTO/ perovskite films with and without modification were stored at RT in controlled humidity cabinets with a transparent glass door. The relative humidity in the chambers was controlled to the desired humidity of ≈85%. After moisture-degradation at different intervals, the perovskite films were fabricated into solar cells and the performance was tested. The relative humidity in the cabinet was precisely measured periodically throughout the stability experiments by using a calibrated hygrometer. For the photothermal stability studies, the perovskite film was heated at 85 °C under a white LED light source with an intensity of 200 mW cm -2 and kept for 100 h. Other Characterizations: The XRD patterns of the samples were recorded using a Rigaku RU-300 diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα1 irradiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The film morphology was characterized using SEM (Quanta 400). The instrument uses an electron beam accelerated from 500 V to 30 kV, enabling operation at a variety of currents. AFM was performed using Bruker Dimension 5000 Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM) in "tapping" mode. The photovoltaic performance was characterized in N 2 glove box without any encapsulation under an AM 1.5G filter at 100 mW cm -2 using a Newport Oriel 92192 Solar Simulator, as calibrated using a certified silicon photodiode. The steady-state PL was characterized with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm and the laser power is 10 mW cm -2 , and the instrument is Horiba Raman spectrometer with photoluminescence. Global time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the perovskite samples were measured by a streak camera system (Hamamatsu) with picosecond resolution. Femtosecond pump pulses were provided by frequency-doubled Ti: sapphire laser system with average pump intensity of 28 µW at the sample. The laser has 150 fs pulses, 76 MHz repetition rate, and 400 nm output wavelength. The laser incident spot diameter is around 1 mm. The TRPL signal was collected by a TCPSC system. The PL lifetimes of the perovskite thin films deposited on glass were calculated by fitting the transient data to the single-exponential decay. The FLIM was carried out by a Leica TCS SP8 system with a timecorrelated single-photon counting (TCSPC) system PicoHarp 300. A 470 nm pulsed laser (pulse duration 5 ps) was used as the excitation source at 4 and 2 MHz repetition rate. The emission fluorescence of samples was detected from 745 to 775 nm.  [27]  Table  2 .

 Kinds of PSCs V oc [V] J sc [mA cm  -2   The extinction and UV-vis absorption spectra of samples were measured on a Hitachi U-3501 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. FTIR was tested by Bruker Tensor 27 at RT. Pristine and FAL-vapor-passivated Cs 0.05 (MA 0.17 FA 0.83 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.83 Br 0.17 ) 3 perovskite films were tested in air, respectively. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs), Mott-Schottky plot, and impedance spectra were measured on photocurrent spectra system of CIMPS (CIMPS-PCS) with tunable light source (TLS03).

 Figure Figure3c,dgives the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the pristine and passivated perovskites with slight incorporation of Pb(SCN) 2 that could help to produce large grain for observation of microstructure. [20]  Through comparison, we observed the boundary passivation indeed greatly healed the surface and increased the compactness afterward. In addition, atomic force microscope (AFM) image of passivated film shows smaller roughness difference, which is consistent with the SEM images (FigureS6, Supporting Information). The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of pristine and FAL passivated perovskite films is 26.6 and 28.2 nm, respectively. The pristine cracks and pinholes can be recovered by the expansion after the incorporation of FAL molecules and thus the surface/interface vacancies are fully passivated. The anchorage of FAL can be demonstrated by the infrared spectroscopy. Figure3ereveals the following spectral features and peak positions for the FAL passivation. Aromatic CC stretching at 1736 cm -1 and aromatic CN stretching at 1689 cm -1 , and CF peak at 1262 cm -1 greatly increase, illustrating that the increasing amount of FAL molecules were gradually deposited on the surface.[21]  This passivation yielded a compact shielding layer to resist water penetration in the final perovskite thin film. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) results suggest there is chemical adsorption in the HVACP.In order to ascertain the improving optoelectronic properties, we first employ global PL to characterize the film quality (Figure4a). In this part, the perovskite is deposited on the nonconductive glasses and covered with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) for encapsulation to facilitate the measurement. PL displays 10 nm narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) after FAL treatment, which indicates the reduction of surface/interface defects in combination with the nondestructive process.
