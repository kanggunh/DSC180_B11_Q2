Derivation of charge carrier mobility (μdc) from OPTP measurements Briefly, we analyzed the complex photoconductivity 𝛥𝜎 ̃(𝜔, 𝜏) using the Drude-Smith model,  
 Calculating the mobility of limiting carrier (𝜇 𝑒,ℎ ) and diffusion length (Ld) We measured the OPTP transients pumped at 3.1 eV and 1.55 eV, respectively. For the perovskite films covered with a C60 layer on top the pump pulses were excited from the C60 side. Since the surface carriers are extracted from the C60 layer, the decay of photo-induced THz signal can be observed within a 2-ns time window. We assume that the mobility does not change with time delay, then the concentration of photo-induced carriers is proportional to the photo-induced  1 ( 1 item is the Drude conductivity, while the second Smith term modifies the Drude model by accounting for the backscattering of carriers due to the influence of disorder in the films. The model consists of three free parameters: p  ,  , and 1 c which can be obtained by fitting the experimental data (see Supplementary Figure 13). The free charge density can be derived from the Drude plasma frequency p  as 𝑛 = 𝜀 0 𝜔 𝑝 2 𝑚 * /𝑒 2 with effective mass 𝑚 * = 0.2𝑚, 0  is the vacuum permittivity and e is the electron charge. The average time interval  between collision events described the carrier scattering rate which is related to the carrier mobility via the expression 𝜇 = 𝑒𝜏/𝑚 * . The parameter 𝑐 1 describes the strength of backscattering, ranging betweencomplete backscattering) and 0 (no backscattering). Hence the effective carrier mobility becomes 𝜇 dc = 𝑒(1 + 𝑐 1 ) 𝜏/𝑚 * , according the Drude-Smith model. 
 photo-induced carriers, Dam is the ambipolar diffusion coefficient and τB is the bulk carrier lifetime.
