Deep Surface Passivation for Efficient and Hydrophobic Perovskite Solar Cells

Note S1: Space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) technique. The trap densities (N t ) in perovskite films were figure out by the space-chargelimited-current (SCLC) technique.  1  An electron-only device with a glass/ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/PCBM/Ag architecture (Fig.  S2a ) and a glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag hole-only device (Fig.  S2c ) were fabricated. Fig.  S2b  illustrates the dark current-voltage (J-V) characteristics of the pristine and CF 3 PEAI 2D passivated electron-only devices, which shows a linear ohmic region, a trap-filling limited region, and a trap-free child's region. The electron trap density can be calculated with trap-filled limit voltage (V TFL ) from the following equation: (1) 𝑁 𝑡 = 2𝑉 𝑇𝐹𝐿 𝜀 𝑟 𝜀 0 𝑞𝐿 2 Where ε r is the relative dielectric constant of perovskite (ε r = 32), 2 ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, V TFL is the onset voltage of the trap-filled limit region, q is the elemental charge, and L is the thickness of the perovskite film (~ 800 nm). The electron trap density in the 2D passivated perovskite is figured out to be 2.25 10 15 cm -3 , which is × much lower than the pristine (4.5 10 15 cm -3 ) perovskite. Similarly, a hole trap density × of 3.75 10 15 cm -3 and 2.68 10 15 cm -3 are achieved for the pristine and 2D CF 3 PEAI × × passivated films (Fig.  S2d ). The reduced trap state density in the passivated film could be attributed to the high-quality perovskite crystals. It can improve performance and mitigate the hysteresis effect in PSCs. 
 Experiment section Materials: The SnO 2 colloid precursor was purchased from Alfa Aesar. N, Ndimethylformamide (DMF), isopropanol (IPA), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PbI 2 , formamidine iodide (FAI), methylamine hydrobromide (MABr), methylammonium chloride (MACl), PEAI, CF 3 PEAI, and Spiro-OMeTAD were purchased from Xian Polymer Light Technology Corp. All materials were used without any further purification. 
 Fabrication of PSCs: The ITO glasses were ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 10 minutes, respectively. Then the clean glasses were dried in the drying oven and then treated with UV-ozone for 10 min. The SnO 2 colloid precursor was diluted with deionized water in a volume ratio of 1: 6. The electron transport layer (ETL) layer was prepared by spin coating the SnO 2 precursor at 3,000 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 150 o C for 30 min. Before transferred into the glovebox, the substrates were treated with the UV-ozone again. For the perovskite layers, a two-step process was employed. Firstly, PbI 2 (654 mg) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (1 mL, volume ratio at 4:1). After complete dissolution, the PbI 2 solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm pore polytetrafluoroethylene filter and then was spin-coated onto the HTL layers at 1,600 rpm for 20 s and 4,000 rpm for 30 s successively. After then, the PbI 2 film was annealed at 72 o C for 2 min. Later, the mixed cations isopropanol solution (220 mg FAI, 22 mg MABr, and 23 mg MACl dissolved in 1,500 μL isopropanol) was spin-coated onto the PbI 2 layer at 2,000 rpm for 30 s. Then the perovskite films were annealed at 150 o C for 30 min in the ambient environment (40% relative humidity). For the passivation treatment, CF 3 PEAI solutions in isopropanol with different concentrations (1, 2, 5, and 10 mg/mL) were spin-coated onto perovskite films at 4,000 rpm for 30 s, and then the films were annealed at 100 o C for 10 min to form the 2D perovskite. The HTL was then deposited by spin coating at 3,000 rpm for 30 s, and it contains Spiro-OMeTAD (72.3 mg), bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) stock solution (17.5 μL, 520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile), 28.8 μL 4-tertbutylpyridine in the 1 mL chlorobenzene. At last, after being oxidized for 24 h in the desiccator, 80 nm Au film was thermal evaporated as the electrode. using 1 × 1 × 1 k-point grids for the ionic optimization and 3 ×3 ×3 for the density of state, respectively. The self-consistent total-energy difference and the convergence criterion for forces on atoms are set to 10 -4 eV and 0.01 eV/Å, respectively. In all the calculations, the first two layers on the FAPbI 3 slab surface under investigation are fully relaxed, while the positions of other layers at the bottom are kept fixed. A vacuum spacing > 15 Å is used to prevent inter-slab interactions.       Fig. S1 . S1 Fig. S1.
