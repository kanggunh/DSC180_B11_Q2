Revealing the Transient Formation Dynamics and Optoelectronic Properties of 2D Ruddlesden-Popper Phases on 3D Perovskites
What makes these interfaces so complex and interesting is the variety of chemical compositions and properties of the bulky cations with different molecular backbones and functional groups that are readily available commercial chemicals.  [23]  This versatility, however, makes it difficult to draw general conclusions regarding the formation and functioning of the 2D/3D Figure 1. a) Left to right: Lattice structure of the 3D perovskite, n = 1 of TMAI and PEAI, and n = 2 of TMAI.

DOI: 10.1002/aenm.202201490 are now often composed of a mixture of several cations and mixed halides,  [5, 6]  leading to devices with higher PCE, better stability, and simplified preparation.  [7, 8]  Recently, the use of bulky organic cations, generating 2D and quasi-2D perovskites with Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) and Dion-Jacobson (DJ) phases emerged to reduce non-radiative interface recombination and further improve the stability of 3D perovskite (3D-pvsk) thin films.  [9] [10] [11]  Figure  1a (i) shows schematics of the crystal structure of a pure 3D-pvsk (ABX 3 , where A is a monovalent cation, B is usually Pb  2+  or Sn  2+  , and X is a halide anion), as well as examples of 2D structures (Figure  1a -ii to iv). Conventionally, in a true 2D structure, the bulky cations (A′) separate individual slabs of BX 6 octahedra, i.e., the thinnest layer possible of the inorganic moiety (PEA 2 PbI 4 and TMA 2 PbI 4 in Figure  1a (ii) and (iii)). In quasi-2D structures, the number of BX 6 inorganic slabs (n) is higher than 1, and an A-site cation from the ABX 3 perovskite is necessary to balance the charges of these structures (e.g., TMA 2 [APbI 3 ]PbI 4 in Figure  1a (iv)). Therefore, if n = ∞ the material is precisely a 3D-pvsk and, for this reason, these 2D structures are commonly referred to as 2D-perovskites. The composition of the 2D perovskites can be generally described as A′ 2 A n-1 B n X 3n+1 (RP-phase) or A′A n-1 B n X 3n+1 (DJ-phase),  [12]  where A′ is the bulky cation that forms the organic bilayer separating the inorganic slabs. The RP-phases are formed by monoammonium cations (e.g., n-butylammonium) and the inorganic slabs are connected via van-der-Waals interactions between their hydrocarbon backbone. In the case of DJ-phases, a diammonium cation (e.g., 1,4-butanediammonium) is used instead, and the inorganic slabs are chemically connected to each other.  [13]  When incorporated in 2D/3D architectures, these bulky and hydrophobic cations (A′ cations) are frequently deposited on already formed 3D-pvsk films and compete for the A-site,  [14] [15] [16] [17]  but their large backbones separate the BX 6 octahedra layers into 2D structures.  [18, 19]  Despite the significant interest of the community in the application of bulky cations in PSCs, a clear understanding of the 2D phase and 2D/3D interface formation with dependence on the nature and concentration of the bulky molecule and its implication on the device performance is still limited.  [20] [21] [22]  Using in situ photoluminescence measurements during the spin-coating and annealing steps, this study probes the formation of 2D layers on 3D triple cation perovskite films comparing phenylethylammonium and 2-thiophenemethylammonium iodide bulky cations. This study elucidates the formation mechanisms of the surface layers for both cases and reveals two regimes during 2D layer formation: a kinetic-driven and a thermodynamic-driven process. These driving forces result in different compositions of the 2D/3D interface for each treatment, namely, different ratios of pure 2D (n = 1) and quasi-2D (n > 1) structures. This study shows that a higher ratio of quasi-2D phases is more beneficial for device performance, as pure-2D layers may hamper current extraction. Due to a more evenly distributed formation energy profile among 2D and quasi-2D phases, highly concentrated 2-thiophenemethylammonium iodide appears to be more suited for effective surface passivation than its phenylethylammonium analog. 
 Introduction Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have dominated photovoltaic (PV) research in recent years due to the fast increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE), now nearing 26%, and their ease of fabrication.  [1]  The enormous interest and excitement from the community brought this technology to a stage close to commercialization. However, the next major challenge for PSC technology, along with manufacturing upscaling,  [2, 3]  is improving their long-term operational stability.  [4]  Various approaches have been engaged to improve their stability. For instance, perovskites Adv. Energy Mater. 2023, 13, 2201490   
 (3 of 14) interfaces. Several properties of these bulky cations and their salts influence the 2D film formation, as well as incorporation into 2D/3D structures and, therefore, device performance. For instance, the length of the alkyl chain of the bulky molecule,  [18, 24, 25]  the choice of its halide anion,  [16, 26, 27]  and the choice of its aromatic backbones and their substituted analogues.  [11, [28] [29] [30]  Furthermore, there is an ongoing debate about the optimal way of incorporating the bulky molecules into the 3D-pvsk film.  [12]  Depending on the choice of the molecule, and its exact deposition procedure the dimensionality of the 2D structure can be altered, which can affect the properties of the resulting devices.  [26]  Some recent works have scrutinized the formation mechanisms of 2D perovskites with a variety of different bulky cations.  [18, 21, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32]  Liu et al.  [21]  treated the FA 1-x MA x PbI 3 3D-pvsk with neo-pentylammonium halide salts (neoPAX; X = Cl, Br, and I). They found that the choice of the halide can influence the type of RP-phase formed. The treatment with neoPACl, for instance, leads to the formation of both pure 2D and quasi-2D phases, while the Br and I analogs only result in pure 2D phase. Conversely, the post-treatment of 3D-pvsk with linear alkylammonium cations always seems to form n > 1 RP-phases, and this seems to be independent of the alkylammonium chain length.  [18, 29, 30]  In addition, Liu et al.  [31]  carried out a study with three different diamines: ortho-, meta-, and para-isomers of (phenylene)di(ethylammonium) iodide (x-PDEAI 2 ; x = ortho, meta, or para). They found that the only isomer capable of forming a n = 1 DJ-phase on the 3D-pvsk was the para-isomer, reflecting the strong steric hindrance of the ortho and meta counterparts. Another clear example of steric hindrance on the dynamic formation of 2D/3D perovskites is the work of Ghoreishi et al.  [32]  They modify MAPbI 3 perovskites with phenylethylammonium (PEA), benzylammonium (BZA), and phenylammonium iodide. The only difference between these three cations is the number of carbons they present in the alkylammonium chain attached to the aromatic ring, which affects the mobility and reactivity of these cations. As a result, PEA (2 carbons) forms 2D RP-phase with strong emission signature, BZA (1 carbon) forms RP-phases with poorer emission intensity, and no signal of phenylammonium (0 carbon) RP-phases could be found in both X-ray diffraction (XRD) and PL measurements. A constant observation regarding the PEA cation, whether explicit in the work or not, is that it tends to form mostly n = 1 RP-phases and, before thermal treatment, unreacted salt is detected by XRD.  [12, 15, 29, [32] [33] [34]  However, modified PEA molecules such as 4-hydroxy-phenylethylammonium and (3)4-fluoro-phenylethylammonium seem to change this tendency toward the formation of n ≥ 2 RP-phases.  [29, 30, 35]  In the work of Chen et al.,  [30]  the authors attribute this tendency of 3-fluoro-phenylethylammonium of forming n ≥ 2 RP-phases to a strain effect during the formation of the crystal. Finally, another class of commonly used bulky cation is the thiophenederivatives such as 2-thiophenemethylammonium (TMA) and 2-thiopheneethylammonium (TEA). 3D-pvsk treated with TMA tends to form n = 1 and higher-order phases and, upon prolonged annealing, the n = 1 phase is converted to n ≥ 2, with n = 2 RP-phase being the most prominent.  [15, 36]  This suggests that the n = 2 RP-phase for TMAI is the most thermodynamic stable phase. In the case of TEA, the post-treatment output is very similar to PEA: mostly n = 1 RP-phase is formed.  [36]  This similarity is apparently related to the number of carbon atoms between the thiophene ring and NH 3 + (two carbons) and steric hindrance effects, rather than the aromatic part of the molecule. All the above described were carried out with post-treatment methods using bulky cation salt solutions in common perovskite antisolvents such as isopropanol. In the present work, we investigated the formation mechanisms of 2D RP-phases on 3D-pvsk thin films comparing two different bulky cations with iodide as counterion, phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) and 2-thiophenemethylammonium iodide (TMAI, see Figure  1a ). The cations used here contain one ammonium group, which promotes the formation of RP-phases. Using in situ photoluminescence (PL) measurements during dynamic spin-coating and annealing of the 2D/3D-films, in combination with ex situ X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) measurements, we propose the formation pathways for the 2D RP-phases of each bulky cation and their influence on the optical properties of the 2D/3D-perovskite architectures. To obtain insights into the fundamental dynamics of these mechanisms, we vary the concentrations of the bulky cations and correlate our findings with the optoelectronic properties of corresponding solar cells. By elucidating the formation mechanisms of the 2D layers with a kinetic and thermodynamic regime during layer fabrication, different ratios of pure 2D (n = 1) and quasi-2D (n > 1) structures evolve for each treatment. Our results provide an understanding of the need to individually optimize the passivation strategy for each bulky molecule. 
 Results and Discussion 
 In Situ PL during Spin-Coating and Annealing To gain information about the formation mechanisms of 2D RP-phases as passivants on 3D perovskite thin films, we employed in situ PL measurements. A PL excitation energy of 3.06 eV (405 nm) was used, and the measurements were performed during the formation of the 2D phases on the already formed 3D-pvsk. Two distinct bulky iodide cations, PEAI and TMAI, were deposited on top of triple cation [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.87 (M APbBr 3 ) 0.13 ] 0.92 (CsPbI 3 ) 0.08 3D-pvsk thin films. To do so, we spun the glass/3D-pvsk samples for 30 s at 4000 rpm in an N 2filled glove box and dripped the respective bulky cation salts (1-80 × 10 -3 m dissolved in 2-propanol, IPA) after 7 s. After finishing the spin-coating step, we annealed the samples for 6 min at 100 °C. During both the spin-coating and the annealing steps, we monitored the evolution of the PL signal (see the Experimental Section for more details). Figure  1b ,d shows the resulting PL spectra for the cases of 80 × 10 -3 m TMAI and PEAI, respectively. The left panels show the spin-coating step, i.e., time t = 0 s marks the beginning of the spin-coating process, and the black bars around t = 7 s indicate the dynamic dripping of the bulky molecules. The right panels in Figure  1b ,d show the PL evolution during the subsequent annealing step. Individual PL spectra of crucial points in time are shown in Figure  S1  (Supporting Information). Before dropping the bulky cations, there is the expected 
 (4 of 14) PL emission of the 3D-pvsk visible around E 3D ≈ 1.62 eV in both cases. In the case of TMAI, this signal decreases and completely vanishes almost immediately after dropping the TMAI solution. At the same time, a second PL peak emerges at E TMAI,1 ≈ 2.37 eV, which we attribute to the n = 1 2D RPphase (see Figure  1a ).  [15]  During the remainder of the spincoating, no further evolution of the PL signal is observed. During the annealing step, the intensity of the n = 1 RP-phase gradually decreases, while the intensity of the 3D-pvsk gradually increases. Furthermore, almost immediately an additional peak appears around E TMAI,2 ≈ 2.20 eV, which we attribute to the n = 2 RP-phase.  [15]  Interestingly, XRD patterns taken before and after the annealing step show not only the n = 1 peak but also the peak attributed to the n = 2 RP-phase (see Figure  1c ).  [37]  Extending the PL measurements after the spin-coating, i.e., mimicking the drying process that likely continues during the sample transfer from spin-coater to the XRD measurement (a few minutes), we see that the n = 2 RP-phase forms rather quickly at room temperature, likely due to continued solvent evaporation (see Figure  S2 , Supporting Information). We interpret these results as follows: immediately after dropping the TMAI solution, the n = 1 RP-phase forms at the surface of the perovskite layer completely covering the 3D-pvsk film. We assume that the n = 1 layer is at least 50 nm thick and, therefore, absorbs the majority of the incoming photons due to the high absorption coefficient of metal halide perovskites of >10 5 cm -1 above their bandgap energy.  [38] [39] [40]  Then, during annealing, the RP-layer (n = 1) intermixes with the underlying 3D-pvsk and thereby gets partly converted into the n = 2 RP-phase. In addition, some TMAI molecules may diffuse into the perovskite film (e.g., via the grain boundaries  [41, 42]  ) possibly reducing the absorption in the RP structure leading to increased excitation of the 3D-pvsk. The latter two processes might be accelerated and/or accompanied by a slight degradation of the RP-phases due to constant laser illumination at the elevated annealing temperature. In the case of PEAI, the film evolution after dropping the molecules is retarded and more gradual (see Figure  1d ). The 3D-pvsk peak gradually decreases in intensity without completely vanishing during the spin-coating. Interestingly, however, the PEAI dripping leads not only to the formation of the n = 1 RP-phase, but also to the formation of the n = 2 and n = 3 phases within less than 10 s after PEAI dripping during spin-coating. It is interesting to note that we first observe the peak corresponding to the n = 1 RP-phase before the peaks corresponding to the n > 1 RP-phases appear. While this seems contradictory to a recent report from Sargent's group,  [11]  there are several differences in the experimental setup of both studies, which suggests that the formation dynamics of 2D RPphases are strongly sensitive to the exact deposition parameters of the bulky molecule. During annealing, the 3D-pvsk emission behaves similarly as in the case of TMAI: with ongoing annealing time, the peak intensity increases. However, the n = 1 RP-related peak does not diminish, as in the case of TMAI, but increases in intensity along with the n = 2 peak. Structural analysis was performed to find possible explanations for the different trends in the case of TMAI and PEAI (see Figure  1c, e ). By measuring XRD patterns of PEAI-and TMAI-treated films before and after annealing we find that, for PEAI, there is unreacted salt present on the surface of the 3D film,  [12, 33]  which is not the case for TMAI. During annealing, the intensity of the PEAI salt diffraction diminishes, while the intensity of the n = 1 ((PEA) 2 PbI 4 ) diffraction increases, in agreement with the in situ PL measurements. This indicates that, for PEAI treatment, the incorporation of the salt into the RP-phases is rather slow and still ongoing during annealing, while it is much faster and already completed during spin-coating in the case of TMAI. This may also be the reason for the stronger and more immediate suppression of the PL signal of the 3D-pvsk in the case of TMAI compared to PEAI. In addition, with prolonged annealing time (60 min), it is interesting to note that, in the case of PEAI, most of the RP-phase forming during annealing is present in the form of the n = 1 phase (compared to n > 1 RP-phases), while in the case of TMAI the ratio of n = 1 to n = 2 RP-phases seems to decrease (see Figure  1  and Figure  S3 , Supporting Information). In conclusion, using high concentrations of the bulky cation salts (80 × 10 -3 m), we see evidence that in the case of TMAI, an almost immediate reaction promotes the growth of a rather thick n = 1 RP-phase within <2 s after dynamically dripping TMAI solution, completely suppressing the PL emission of the 3D-pvsk. During annealing and following cool-down, this RP-phase intermixes with the 3D-pvsk forming n > 1 RP-phases and partly consuming the n = 1 phase. In the case of PEAI, we see a much slower and even incomplete conversion of the PEAI salt to the n = 1 RP-phase and direct conversion to n > 1 RP-phases during spin-coating, which seems to be partially reversed during annealing. Before identifying possible mechanisms for this behavior, two additional effects should be discussed here. First, in both cases (TMAI and PEAI), the in situ PL measurements during annealing do not show contributions from n > 2 RP-phases. In the case of PEAI this seems surprising given the fact that we see n = 3 during spin-coating and, also in the case of TMAI, there is evidence of n > 2 phases after the cool-down of the sample after annealing (this will be shown in Figure  3  and further discussed below). It is suggested that the PL signal is quenched at elevated sample temperatures,  [43]  and, therefore, likely suppresses the detection of the n > 2 phases, which show significantly lower intensity than n = 1 and n = 2 phases. Second, in the case of PEAI, there is no evidence of n > 1 RP-phases in XRD, although they are clearly detectable by PL, while we see a good agreement between XRD and PL in the case of TMAI. Here, we want to emphasize that the in situ PL provides information on radiative recombination processes and kinetics, but does not provide structural or phase information. Also, photogenerated charge carriers can relax into lower energy states and, predominantly, emit from these states.  [44, 45]  To elucidate this further, we measured quantified steadystate PL (SSPL) of the 2D RP-phases synthesized separately via solution-process method (see the Experimental Section for synthesis details).  [46]  The SSPL shows a much higher PL quantum yield (PLQY) for the PEAI n = 1 phase compared to the TMAI n = 1 phase (see Figures  S4  and S5 , Supporting Information). Therefore, although the XRD patterns confirm the presence of n = 1 in both cases, a PL signal is detectable in the case of PEAI even at low amounts of (PEA) 2 PbI 4 , for example, while larger quantities are needed in the case of TMAI-based RP-phases to show up in PL measurements. 
 (5 of 14) To get more detailed mechanistic insights into the formation of the 2D RP-phases on 3D-pvsk, in particular for the different cases of PEAI and TMAI, we varied their concentration in IPA from 1 to 80 × 10 -3 m. Figure  S6  (Supporting Information) shows the evolution of the PL spectra measured during spin-coating and annealing of 3D-pvsk films treated with 1, 4, 10, 40, and 80 × 10 -3 m. In the following, we will refer to these samples as TMAI-1, TMAI-4, …, TMAI-80 and PEAI-1, …, PEAI-80. After subtracting a linear background from the spectra, we fitted each spectrum with a combination of one to four Gaussians (see Figure  S7 , Supporting Information). The evolution of the respective fit parameters for all samples is shown in Figure  2  and Figure  S8  (Supporting Information). The left-hand side shows the PL parameters corresponding to the 3D-pvsk films and the right-hand side corresponding to the 2D, n = 1 RP-phase, respectively. Both are differentiated into spin-coating and annealing. The numberings (  1 )-(  8 ) label trends described below. First, we will focus on the evolution of the peaks corresponding to the 3D-pvsk (Figure  2a, c ), which are affected by the subsequent deposition of TMAI and PEAI in a very similar fashion. During spin-coating of the bulky cations, the 3D-pvsk position remains unchanged indicating likely no strong influence of the bulky molecules on the bandgap of the 3D-pvsk phase. In all ten samples, we see a PL position of E 3D ≈ (1.62 ± 0.01) eV showing the high reproducibility of the 3D-pvsk process used in this study. During annealing, we observe a blue shift of all the peak positions of about 0.02-0.03 eV (Number (1) in Figure  2a, c ), which we attribute to temperatureinduced bandgap-widening.  [47]  As for most of the samples, the PL-position stabilizes after about 10-20 s, which roughly coincides with the time it requires for the sample to reach the set temperature of 100 °C. The intensity of the 3D-pvsk related peaks, in both cases, drops gradually after the deposition of the bulky cations (Number (2) in Figure  2a, c ). As expected, this effect is generally stronger pronounced in samples with higher molecule concentrations. For example, the intensity of the 3D-pvsk peak of TMAI-1 and PEAI-1 is only temporarily decreased during the dropping of the bulky molecules but remains unchanged otherwise. On the other hand, the intensity of the PEAI-80 sample, for example, drops gradually during the spin-coating by more than 90% due to absorption by the evolving RP-phase. In addition, for the same concentrations, this effect is more strongly pronounced in the case of TMAI compared to PEAI, which is in good agreement with the discussion above. For both TMAI-80 and TMAI-40, the intensity of the 3D-pvsk completely vanishes upon TMAI-dropping. During the annealing, the PL-intensity decreases again during heat-up of the samples (first ≈20 s, if not completely filtered by the RP-layer) due to thermal quenching (Number (3) in Figure  2a, c ). Here, it should be noted that the intensity is individually normalized for each panel in Figure  2  and, thus, can only be compared with each other relatively. After the samples reach the final annealing temperature, the intensity increases (Number (4) in Figure  2a, c ), which we attribute to a combination of several effects. First, an in-diffusion of bulky cations into the 3D-pvsk (i.e., via grain boundaries),  [41, 42]  mitigating the suppression of the excitation of the 3D-pvsk. Second, surface passivation due to the formation of the RP-phases, increasing the PLQY. Third, with increasing annealing time, the continuous laser illumination possibly first degrades the RP-phases and then the 3D-pvsk. Due to the latter effect, the intensity finally decreases-earlier for samples with lower concentrations of the respective RP-phases (i.e., a thinner "protection layer") due to the laser degradation. A more detailed assessment of the role of the laser illumination can be found in Figure  S9  (Supporting Information). Next, we analyze the evolution of the RP-related peaks (Figure  2b, d ) during spin-coating and annealing. It is interesting to note that in the case of TMAI, the formation of RP-phases during spin-coating occurs for all concentrations >4 × 10 -3 m, but only at 80 × 10 -3 m for PEAI (see Figure  1d, d ). The position of the PL peak associated with the n = 1 PR-phase is constant during spin-coating and undergoes a blueshift during annealing (Number (5) in Figure  2b, d ) in both cases. As this blueshift is much more gradual and slower than the one observed in the case of the 3D-pvsk (Number (1) in Figure  2a ,c), we do not attribute it dominantly to a temperature effect. In addition, the PL peak position is observed at lower energies with higher concentration (Number (6) in Figure  2b ), and its dependence on the concentration vanishes during the annealing-induced blueshift (Number (5) in Figure  2b, d ) with the PL peak reaching a value of ≈2.41 eV. To explain these trends in the PL peak position, we discuss a few possibilities and point out that they may occur concomitantly. In general, the bandgap of low-dimensional RP-phases is sensitive to BX 6 octahedral tilt, which is mostly controlled by the ion sizes and hydrogen bonding between the organic and halide ions.  [48, 49]  These distortions change the amplitude of the Pb-I orbital overlapping and, therefore, affect the bandgap of the RP-phase.  [48]  Second, with the annealing, the preferential alignment of the organic cations' chain may change, leading to a modification in crystal lattice and bandgap. Finally, bromine diffusion from the surface of the 3D-pvsk into the n = 1 RP-phase would also increase its bandgap without significantly changing the bulk bandgap of 3D-pvsk, as observed in Figure  2a . This effect would be more pronounced in lower concentrations of TMAI treatment since the Br/I ratio would be higher at constant diffusion rates. Focusing on the intensity of the n = 1 RP-phase now, it quickly increases and stabilizes after the dynamic deposition of the bulky cations (Number (7) in Figure  2b, d ). During annealing, we see different behavior for TMAI and PEAI. In the case of TMAI, we see a gradual decrease of the intensity (Number (4) in Figure  2b ) due to the same effects responsible for the increase of the intensity of the 3D-pvsk peak during annealing. In the case of PEAI, the evolution of the intensity of the n = 1 RP-phase switches from monotonically increasing (PEAI-80 and PEAI-40) to a combination of initial in-and subsequent decrease (PEAI-10) with decreasing concentration (Numbers (4) and (8) in Figure  2d ). Following the discussion above (Figure  1d ,e), we attribute the increase to the ongoing conversion of PEAI salt to the n = 1 RP-phase. In the case of PEAI-10, the salt is completely converted after 10 s, and subsequently the effects described under number (4) decrease the PL intensity. In summary, we interpret the in situ PL and ex situ XRD data presented in Figures  1  and 2  as follows. In the case of TMAI, 
 (6 of 14) the reaction from the TMAI salt to the n = 1 RP-phase seems to be very favorable (i.e., have rather low activation energy) and spontaneously occurs even at room temperature during spincoating for concentrations as low as 10 × 10 -3 m. Even for the highest concentration investigated here (80 × 10 -3 m), the salt is completely converted during the spin-coating process. However, there is no conversion from the n = 1 RP-phase to n > 1 phases during spin-coating, but only during annealing. On the other hand, in the case of PEAI, the conversion of the PEAI salt to the n = 1 RP-phase seems to occur much slower: for concentrations below 80 × 10 -3 m we observe it only during heat treatment and, for concentrations above 10 × 10 -3 m, not all of the salt is converted to the n = 1 RP-phase. However, we observe the reaction between PEAI and the 3D-pvsk (forming n ≥ 1) at room temperature during the spin-coating only for PEAI-80, indicating a much slower formation and, therefore, different formation mechanism as in the case of TMAI. During annealing, we do not see direct evidence of a conversion of the n = 1 phase to n > 1 phases, as in the case of TMAI, but rather an accelerated conversion of the PEAI-salt to the n = 1 phase. It is noteworthy that, in the case of PEAI, the in situ PL is more sensitive than the XRD to detect the RP-phases, as mentioned before. Therefore, we assume that the detection limit of the PEAI-related RP-phases is rather low and that its reaction on the 3D-pvsk film during spin-coating occurs only very slowly in concentrations below 80 × 10 -3 m. The different reaction mechanisms for TMAI and PEAI with the 3D-pvsk film will be addressed further below. To complement the picture of the RP-phase formation, we next analyze the 2D/3D stacks post-synthesis (after annealing) via ex situ XRD and SSPL. Figure  3a ,b shows the diffractograms for both TMAI-and PEAI-treated samples with different concentrations after annealing. The corresponding patterns before annealing are shown in Figure  S10  (Supporting Information). In both cases, as the concentration of the bulky cations increases, the intensity of the RP-phase diffractions increases proportionally, which is expected (note that the intensity scale is logarithmic). For TMAI (Figure  3a ) both n = 1 and n = 2 RP-phases are present (peaks marked with * for n = 1 phase,  [50]  and peaks marked with @ for n = 2 phase  [37]  ), with no evidence of unreacted TMAI salt, even before annealing. This agrees with the SSPL profile which is composed of the emissions from the 3D-pvsk, n = 1, and n = 2 RP-phase (Figure  3c ). For PEAI (Figure  3b ) the XRD shows evidence of PEAI salt and n = 1 phase (peaks marked with # and with *, respectively).  [12, 33]  Again, SSPL confirms the presence of the 3D-pvsk (≈1.6 eV) and n = 1 RP-phase (≈2.4 eV) but the PEAI salt is not detected (Figure  3d ). The peak positions marked with & and $ (Figure  3a, b ) are the PbI 2 and 3D-pvsk diffractions, respectively. Since both bulky cations react with PbI 2 , we observe a change in its diffraction intensity in both diffractograms. While for PEAI we see a monotonic decrease in PbI 2 peak intensity (Figure  3b ), which is less apparent for TMAI (Figure  3a ), it hints towards different reactivities of PEAI and TMAI with PbI 2 . Interestingly, for the TMAI-80 and TMAI-40 samples, there are PL emissions from n > 2 RP-phases (≈1.8-2.2 eV, see Figure  3c ). The appearance of these higher-order phases in SSPL (but not in diffraction) can be explained in terms of carrier funneling and energy transfer to lower energy states, which increase the emission intensity of the higherorder phases.  [45]  As already mentioned in the discussion of the in situ PL, it is noted that the ratio of n = 1 and n > 1 RP-phases depends on the concentration of the respective bulky molecule. This is very evident from the SSPL spectra of the TMAI samples, where the n > 1 RP-phases are dominant for low concentrations but, for the TMAI-80 sample, the dominating one is the n = 1 phase. In the case of PEAI, the trend appears to be more stable with n = 1 being the main phase for all concentrations > 4 × 10 -3 m. To refine our analysis, particularly on charge carrier funneling, we measured the photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra of the PEAI-80 and TMAI-80 samples in different emission wavelengths. This type of measurement allows us to isolate the species on the surface responsible for a specific emission. A PLE spectrum, therefore, can be seen as an absorption spectrum resolved by the emission: we vary the excitation energy while measuring the PL intensity at a fixed emission energy (wavelength). Since the emission from the RP-phases and 3D-pvsk are far apart in terms of energy, we can clearly measure the PLE profile for each phase. To successfully isolate the PLE profile of each species, the spectra were measured at 540 or 530 nm (2.30 or 2.34 eV) for the n = 1 phase, 585 nm (2.12 eV) for the n = 2 phase, and at 800 nm (1.55 eV) for the 3D-pvsk (see the Experimental Section for further details). The PLEs on the TMAI-80 sample are shown in Figure  3e , with well-defined PLE spectra for both the n = 2 and n = 1 RP-phases with strong excitonic resonances (top and middle panels, respectively), in accordance with reported thin-film absorption spectra of similar materials.  [39, 46]  The strong excitonic resonance in the PLE of the n = 2 phase indicates a rather high amount of this material on the surface of the film, in agreement with our findings with SSPL (Figure  3c ) and XRD (Figure  2c ). Also, a little influence of the excitonic state of the n = 1 RP-phase (red arrow in the top panel) can be observed, indicating some level of carrier funneling from n = 1 to n = 2 RP-phase. Finally, a strong bleaching effect in the 3D-pvsk PLE is observed (bottom panel in Figure  3e ), with two bleaching peaks in the same region of the excitonic resonances of the n = 1 and n = 2 RP-phases. Following a similar analysis, Figure  3f  shows the PLE spectra for all species present in the PEAI-80 sample. Only a discrete excitonic resonance close to 2.25 eV is observed in the PLE of the n = 2 phase (top panel in Figure  3f ) and, in addition, it shows a strong contribution of the excitonic state of the n = 1 RP-phase (blue arrow). As in the case of TMAI, but much stronger, this is clear evidence of energy transfer (probably resonant)  [51]  between these two phases, where the n = 1 (higher bandgap) transfers energy to the n = 2 (lower bandgap) RP-phase. This helps explain why we observe the n = 2 phase in the in situ PL during the spin-coating, but do not observe it in the XRD. Therefore, in agreement with our previous discussion, the n = 1 RP-phase is dominant in the case of PEAI, and the n = 2 RP-phase might be present only in small domains. Regarding the PLE at the n = 1 RP-phase emission, as expected, we see a well-resolved PLE profile with a strong excitonic resonance with a maximum at 2.48 eV (middle panel in Figure  3f ). Also, in the PLE from the 3D-pvsk (bottom panel), a strong bleach in the spectrum is observed right at the excitonic absorption of the n = 1 RP-phase (≈2.48 eV), which shows a similar filter effect as observed in the case of TMAI. It is noteworthy that, although this filter effect is significant, the PLE intensity of the 3D-pvsk does not completely vanish in energies ≤2.48 eV (i.e., the n = 1 RP-phase absorption region). Finally, Figure  3g  shows a comparison between all the PLEs from the 3D-pvsk on the PEAI-80, TMAI-80, and not-treated perovskite film. It is clear that there is no energy transfer from the RP-phases to the 3D-pvsk, since we observe bleach peaks instead of positive peaks in the absorption window of the RP-phases (i.e., ≤2.20 eV). In other words, if energy transfer occurred, the PLE spectra of the 3D-pvsk in this window should show an increase in intensity, like the one we see in the PLE spectrum of the n = 2 RP-phase in PEAI-80 sample (top panel in Figure  3f ). It does not mean, however, that energy/charge transfer does not occur in these systems under bias voltage, for example, in a solar cell device. A final remark on this comparison is that the bleaching effect of TMAI is much stronger than it is for PEAI samples; this finding is in close agreement with our in situ PL analysis during spin-coating (Number (2) in Figure  2a, c ), where the intensity of 3D-pvsk emission vanishes upon addition of TMAI solution, but the same does not happen with the addition of PEAI solution. Finally, we collected scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure  S11a , Supporting Information) of three representative concentrations of PEAI and TMAI solutions. For PEAI samples, we see a gradual and homogeneous coverage of the films through all conditions, and the 2D layers are visible for concentrations ≥ 10 × 10 -3 m, in agreement with the SSPL and XRD from Figure  3 . In the case of TMAI, we see a smooth coverage of the films for all the concentrations up to 40 × 10 -3 m. In the TMAI-80 sample, a significant morphological change occurs, and flake-like structures are formed on the surface of the film. Likewise, its PEAI analogue, the TMAI samples also show the PL emission and XRD diffraction characteristics of the RP-phases in samples prepared with concentrations ≥ 10 × 10 -3 m. Therefore, we conclude that a threshold concentration of the bulky cation solutions for RP-phase formation seems to lie between 4 and 10 × 10 -3 m. Also, in this low-concentration regime, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements revealed a decreased root mean square roughness (S q ) when compared to the control sample (see Figure  S11b , Supporting Information), which can benefit the interlayer contact between adjacent layers in a solar cell, for instance. The TMAI-treatment seems to impact more directly the square roughness compared to PEAI, which can be explained by the thicker layers and consequent change of morphology caused by the RP-phases formed in TMAI samples. 
 Reaction Dynamics and Energy Diagrams To provide some mechanistic understanding of the transient formation dynamics of 2D RP-phases, kinetic and thermodynamic considerations are discussed in the following paragraphs. In kinetically driven chemical reactions, the products are formed according to their relative rates of formation (rate-limitingstep); in the thermodynamic reactions, the products are formed according to their equilibrium of interconversion and/or conversion of intermediates, formed during the rate-limiting step, to their equilibrium products.  [52] [53] [54]  In our experiments the spin-coating is the rate-limiting step and the annealing is the thermodynamic step. We propose a qualitative energy diagram (Figure  4 ) of the reactions occurring during spin-coating and annealing considering two initial conditions: (i) salt (PEAI or TMAI) + 3D-pvsk and (ii) salt + PbI 2 . Given the available precursors, the products of the first initial condition (salt + 3D-pvsk) may include n = 1 and higher RP-phases, while only the n = 1 RP-phase can form following the second condition (salt + PbI 2 ). The activation  
 (10 of 14) energy for the reactions is labeled E P for PEAI and E T for TMAI. During spin-coating of the PEAI samples, we observe the formation of the RP-phases from n = 1 to n = 3 while some unreacted salt remains at the surface. The latter indicates that the activation energy for the reaction of PEAI + PbI 2 (E P1 , Figure  4a ) is higher than k B T and, therefore, does not occur during spin-coating. The formation of the RP-phases up to n = 3 (Figure  1d ), however, shows that the PEAI is partially reacting with the 3D-pvsk, suggesting that E P2 ≳ k B T. E P2 being slightly higher than k B T is consistent with the fact that we only observe the formation of RP-phases for PEAI-80 samples during spin-coating, but not for lower concentrations. We assume that the reason for this concentration dependence is that only molecules with rather high energy at room temperature (i.e., outliers in the kinetic energy distribution, compared to the median) have enough energy to react. As the absolute number of outliers increases with concentration, we are able to detect the reaction at high concentration. The energy profile is quite different for TMAI. During spincoating, a prompt formation of the n = 1 RP-phase is apparent by in situ PL, and no unreacted salt is detected by the XRD after spin-coating. The fact that the salt is completely converted to only the n = 1 RP-phase indicates a fast reaction between TMAI and PbI 2 , suggesting that E T1 < k B T (Figure  4b ). However, small amounts of n = 2 RP-phase also form during the drying process after spin-coating, which indicates that E T2 (TMAI + 3D-pvsk) is equal or slightly lower than k B T (E T2 ≲ k B T). After the spin-coating step (rate-limited-step) is complete, we have a mixture of different products with different local minima that depend on their individual formation energy. Once heat is supplied to the system during the annealing step, further reactions between unreacted precursors (PEAI case) and kinetic products to thermodynamic products take place. The final composition of the materials, therefore, will depend on the relative depth of the formation energy of each different RP-phase. Our experiments suggest that the energy profile for PEAI is quite uneven; namely, the formation energy for the n = 1 RP-phase is much lower than the higher order phases with n > 1, as represented in the energy diagram of Figure  4a . As supported by previous density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the formation of n = 1 RP-phase for PEAI is favored due to its large negative formation energy compared to the n = 2 and higher order phases; this is related to the increased van-der-Waals interaction between the organic molecules in the organic bilayer.  [55, 56]  As such, during annealing, both the unreacted salt and higher order phases tend to convert to the n = 1 phase, resulting in a final film composition that is mainly composed of (PEA) 2 PbI 4 and the 3D-pvsk. Only a relatively small signal of the n = 2 phase is found in the SSPL after annealing (Figure  3d , top), and absolutely no evidence of this phase is found in the XRD (Figure  3b, top) . Regarding the TMAI treatment, the resulting energy profile is more even with close energy minima for all RP-phases. In fact, previous reports suggest that the n = 2 RP-phase is thermodynamically more stable than the n = 1 RP-phase for TMAI, which is in good agreement with the results of our prolonged annealing experiment (see Figure  S3 , Supporting Information).  [15, 36]  This trend is also observed in analogue butylammonium-based RP-phases: the formation energy of the lower family members (i.e., n = 1 to n = 3) have similar, negative formation energies, with the n = 2 presenting the lowest among them.  [53]  This similarity makes it difficult to achieve pure-phase materials during the synthesis with butylammonium, which seems to be the case for TMAI as well. As discussed above, during spin-coating mostly the n = 1 phase is formed due to the lower activation energy for the reaction between TMAI and the readily available PbI 2 (E T1 ). After annealing, however, a mixture of several phases can be observed in the final composition of the film, showing evidence of even n = 3 and n = 4 RP-phases for high concentrations (Figure  3c , top). Furthermore, the corresponding XRD patterns (Figures  1c  and 3a ) show an increase in the intensity of the diffraction peaks related to the n = 2 RP-phase after annealing. This heterogeneous composition suggests that the formation energy of these RP-phases is very similar, with the n = 2 being possibly the most stable. Thus, the whole dynamics of the TMAI treatment can be summarized in the energy diagram of Figure  4b . Further discussion and details regarding this energy diagram can be found in Text S1 (Supporting Information). 
 Device Performance Finally, to close the loop between in situ observations and the proposed interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics, we assembled nip-type PSC with the architecture FTO/SnO 2 /3Dpvsk/RP-phases/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-dip-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD/Au). It is worth pointing out that, for all the samples in this experiment, we performed thermal annealing after the deposition of the bulky cation, following the same procedure as during the in situ PL experiments. Boxplots of all solar cell parameters are shown in Figure  5  and Figure  S12  (Supporting Information). They show that both salts can improve the PCE of the corresponding devices; however, the maximum of the PCE is reached at a much lower concentration in the case of PEAI (4 × 10 -3 m) than in the case of TMAI (40 × 10 -3 m). To understand this trend, we analyze each photovoltaic parameter individually, connecting them to the mechanistic insights discussed above. Up to concentrations of 10 × 10 -3 m, the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) is constant for TMAI and slightly improving for PEAI. For concentrations ≥ 40 × 10 -3 m, there is an (additional) increase of V OC for both bulky molecules, with the highest median for TMAI-80 and PEAI-40. The fill factor (FF) has the most dominant influence on PCE, i.e., FF and PCE show very similar trends: for low concentrations, FF is steadily increasing up to a maximum from which it quickly deteriorates with higher concentrations. This maximum is at 4 × 10 -3 m for PEAI and 40 × 10 -3 m for TMAI. Both the trends of FF and V OC can be explained by the formation mechanics unraveled by in situ and ex situ characterization above. Due to the differences in the energy profile of PEAI and TMAI (Figure  4 ), the final mixture of 2D and quasi-2D layers (i.e., the ratio of n = 1 to n > 1 RP-phases) is different for each molecule. In the case of PEAI, most of the reacted salt is present in form of the n = 1 RP-phase (see Figure  3d ), especially 
 (11 of 14) for concentrations above 4 × 10 -3 m. In addition, there is unreacted salt present at the surface of the film even after annealing of the PEAI-40 and PEAI-80 samples. In the case of TMAI, on the other hand, most of the reacted salt forms n = 2 and higher RP-phases with the exception for TMAI-80 (see Figure  3c ). Interestingly, for both molecules, FF drops at the concentration at which the n = 1 phase becomes dominant compared to n > 1 RP-phases (i.e., at PEAI-10 and TMAI-80, compare Figure  S12 , Supporting Information, and Figure  3c, d ). On the other hand, only samples showing a significant amount of the n = 1 RP-phase lead to improved V OC . We, therefore, propose the following integrated mechanism. The pure 2D phase (n = 1) provides better passivation of surface defects via reduction of nonradiative recombination,  [57]  increasing V OC and subsequently FF.  [58]  This is in good agreement with recent reports for inverted PSCs.  [30, 59]  However, the insulating character of the n = 1 phase  [12]  leads to a barrier for the current extraction, reducing FF if present in large amounts, i.e., higher concentrations of the salt leads to thicker insulating interface layers and, therefore, a more effective current barrier. Similar barriers for photocurrent extraction due to surface treatments have been proven for inorganic chalcopyrite thin-film solar cells, and a direct correlation between the thickness of a resistive surface layer and a detrimental effect on FF was shown.  [60, 61]  In the case of PEAI-40 and PEAI-80, the current barrier might be amplified by the unreacted salt present at the surface. The n > 1 RP-phases, on the other hand, are not as detrimental for the FF but also do not passivate the surface defects as effectively. As discussed above, the formation of n > 1 RP-phases requires the incorporation of organic cations from the 3D-pvsk, thereby facilitating an intermixing of the 2D and 3D phases. In contrast, the n = 1 phases may be formed by reactions of the salt and the excess PbI 2 on the surface, consequently lacking intermixing with the 3D-pvsk. Considering that the quantum and dielectric confinement of the charge carriers is higher in n = 1 RP-phases compared to the n > 1,  [62, 63]  and assuming charge and/or energy transfer from 3D to 2D phases,  [53]  we can conclude that the charge carriers in the n = 1 phases are more difficult to be separated. Consequently, we assume a higher electric resistivity and, therefore, poorer transport properties in the case of n = 1 RP-phases than in the case of n > 1 phases, which helps explain the FF trends. Taken together, there is a trade-off of a beneficial passivation effect (increasing V OC and FF) and a detrimental barrier effect (reducing FF)-depending on the amount of n = 1 and n > 1 RP-phases. The fact that the formation of the n = 1 RP-phase can be detrimental to the device's performance is in agreement with recent reports that the formation of PEA 2 PbI 4 hinders the charge transport, reducing FF and the overall performance.  [12, 57]  It might also explain why some groups achieve the highest PCEs using PEAI-treatment without any thermal annealing,  [12, 64, 65]  as this procedure might "freeze" the kinetic products (i.e., result in rather low amounts of the n = 1 RP-phase). The short-circuit current density (J SC ) stays constant without any clear trend for both salts, and only decreases drastically at 80 × 10 -3 m. We attribute this abrupt drop at PEAI-80 and TMAI-80 to the formation of large platelets of RP-phases resulting in a very rough morphology as observed in the SEM and AFM images (see Figure  S11 , Supporting Information). 
 Summary and Outlook In summary, we compared the formation dynamics of two different 2D RP-phases, TMAI and PEAI, using a combination of in situ PL as well as ex situ material and device characterization. We found that in the case of TMAI, the conversion from the bulky molecule to the n = 1 RP-phase occurs very fast and that, during annealing, a further conversion to higher-order phases takes place. In the case of PEAI, on the other hand, the conversion is slower (and even incomplete for high concentrations). In addition, we find that, for PEAI, the annealing rather leads to a conversion to the thermodynamically most stable n = 1 RP-phase than to higher-order phases. TMAI seems to be a promising candidate for optimization due to its even energy  
 (12 of 14) profile, enabling the targeted formation of mixtures of n = 1 and n > 1 RP-phases and making it a rather robust surface treatment. Due to these different formation dynamics, the interface properties of the 2D/3D perovskites depend strongly on the bulky molecule used, its concentration, and consecutive heat treatment after spin-coating. Subsequently, a careful, and individually tailored optimization of the deposition parameters are needed for each bulky molecule. These mechanistic insights also explain why recent studies found that un-annealed PEAI leads to higher PCE than annealed PEAI. Due to the insulating character of the n = 1 RP-phase and the pristine salts, we achieve better passivation effects using higher concentrations of TMAI than PEAI, making it a very promising molecule for high-efficiency devices. This study illustrates how mechanistic insights unveiling thermodynamic and kinetic contributions can guide the fine-tuning of 2D/3D architectures, avoiding an Edisonian trial and error approach. 
 Experimental Section Preparation of the 3D-perovskite Thin Films for Materials Characterization: The triple cation [(FAPbI 3 ) 0.87 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.13 ] 0.92 (C sPbI 3 ) 0.08 perovskite thin films were deposited in a N 2 -filled glovebox from a solution containing FAI (GreatCell Solar Materials), MABr (GreatCell Solar Materials), PbI 2 (TCI America), PbBr 2 (TCI America), and CsI (Sigma-Aldrich) with a concentration of 1.3 m. A slightly Pb-rich composition (Pb:(FA,MA,Cs) = 1.05:1.00) was used. The precursor was dissolved in a mixture of anhydrous N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma-Aldrich), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich) with a volume ratio of DMF:DMSO = 4:1 at room temperature. The 3D perovskite films were spin-coated using a one-step process, where 50 µL of the precursor solution was deposited on a 1.7 × 1.7 cm 2 sized glass substrate before starting the spin-coating process. Spin-coating was performed at a speed of 2000 rpm for 12 s followed by 5000 rpm for 30 s. 15 s before the end of the spin-coating, 150 µL of chlorobenzene were dropped on the spinning film. Subsequently, the samples were annealed for 60 min at 100 °C. The glass substrates were cleaned with soapy water, acetone, and isopropanol, and then plasma-treated for 5 min right before perovskite deposition. Preparation of the Polycrystalline RP-Phase for Materials Characterization: For n = 1 RP-Phases: 96 mg of PbI 2 (0.21 mmol) was dispersed in 5 mL of toluene and 1 mL of butyric acid. This dispersion was placed under magnetic stirring, and 0.5 mL of the amine (phenylethylamine or 2-thiophenemethylamine) was added to it. The flask was, then, allowed to stir at room temperature for about 3 min. After this time, the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 was formed (green luminescence under UV light) in the reaction with phenylethylamine, and a clear yellow solution was formed with 2-thiophenemethylamine. The later, upon gentle heat (≈60 °C), a slow precipitation of the (TMA) 2 PbI 4 occurs. The solid material was, then, separated by centrifugation (6000 rpm for 5 min), washed with neat toluene (5 mL), and centrifuged again in the same conditions. The toluene was discarded, and the yellow solid was dried under N 2 flow. This solid was used to perform the SSPL measurements in Figure  S5  (Supporting Information). For n > 1 RP-Phases: A separate formamidinium acetate [FA(OAc)] solution was prepared by dissolving 23 mg (0.22 mmol) of FAOac in 3 mL of toluene and 1 mL of butyric acid. This solution was transferred to a syringe and promptly injected into the reaction mixture obtained before the first centrifuge step of the above procedure (n = 1 RP-phase synthesis). In the case of (PEA) 2 PbI 4 , nothing occurs at first and, upon heating the mixture at 80 °C for a few minutes, the yellow powder slowly turns into a vibrant red color. In the case of (TMA) 2 PbI 4 , a rapid reaction took place upon injection of FAOAc solution, forming a dark-red/brown solid; upon heating at 80 °C for a few minutes, the product turned into a more vivid red color indicating the formation of n > 1 RP-phases (mostly n = 2 in both cases). The solids were separated via centrifugation as well (6000 rpm for 5 min) and washed once with neat toluene. These solids were used for the XRD measurements. Synthesis of the Ammonium Salts: Synthesis of PEAI: To a 50 mL round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, 6 mL of isopropanol and 1.04 mL (1 g, 8.25 mmol, 1 eq.) of phenylethylamine were added. The solution was stirred at 0 °C in an ice bath for 15 min and then 1.42 mL (1.34 g, 10.75 mmol, 1.3 eq.) of HI 57 wt% was added dropwise for 15 min. The reaction proceeded for 3 h, and it was gradually cooled to room temperature. In sequence, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The solid obtained was poured into the toluene (5 mL) and stirred under heating (80 °C) for ≈20 min. After reaching room temperature, diethyl ether was added and the solid was filtered. Following this, the product was recrystallized three times using absolute ethanol and diethyl ether. Finally, the white solid was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 8 h and transferred to an N 2 -filled glove box. Synthesis of TMAI: For the synthesis of TMAI, the same protocol described for PEAI was used, only changing phenylethylamine by 2-thiophenmethylamine. The PEAI and TMAI powders were then dissolved in IPA (varying from 1 to 80 × 10 -3 m concentration) and dynamically deposited onto the 3D perovskite films. Thereby, the spin-coating was performed at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The salt solution was dripped at 7 s after starting the spin-coating. Afterward, the films were annealed at 100 °C for 6 min. Preparation of Solar Cells: The FTO-coated glasses were cleaned by an ultrasonic bath in Hellmanex solution 2% in water (15 min), acetone (15 min), and isopropanol (15 min). The substrates were dried with compressed nitrogen. They were thereafter treated in UV-ozone cleaner for 20 min. A SnO 2 layer was deposited by 3.75% SnO 2 nanoparticle (SnO 2 , 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion, Alfa Aesar) in water at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and annealed in ambient air at 150 °C for 30 min. Before perovskite deposition, the substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 20 min and then transferred to the glovebox filled with nitrogen for perovskite deposition. The perovskite deposition was carried out similar to that described previously. The hole transport layer was prepared by dissolution of Spiro-OMeTAD, lithium bis(tri-fluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI, 1.8 m in acetonitrile), tert-butylpyridine (tBP), and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine) cobalt(III) tri[bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide] (FK209, 0.25 m in acetonitrile) in the proportion 1:3.3:0.5:0.05 in chlorobenzene. The HTM solution was spin-coated dynamically on a rotating substrate at 4000 rpm. A 70 nm-thick gold top electrode was deposited as a top contact electrode by thermal evaporation under high vacuum. Solar Cell Characterization: The J-V characteristic of the solar cells was obtained using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under simulated 1-sun AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm -2 ) with a solar simulator (Asahi, HAL-320). The light intensity was calibrated before each JV scan using a silicon pin photodiode previously calibrated by a KG5 filtered silicon reference cell. The devices were measured both in reverse scan (1.2 to 0 V) and forward scan (0 to 1.2 V) with steps of 0.01 V and a delay time of 100 ms. The cells were masked with a black metal mask limiting the active area to 0.16 cm 2 and reducing the influence of the scattered light. In Situ Photoluminescence Measurements: The in situ PL measurements were carried out using a home-built setup in an N 2filled glove box. Excitation was performed using a laser diode emitting at 405 nm and the PL emission was collected using an optical fiber coupled with an Ocean Optics spectrometer ("Flame") calibrated by the manufacturer. A Jacobian correction was applied to the data transforming them from wavelength-to energy-space and removed a linear background before fitting them using a combination of one to four Gaussians depending on the presence of RP-phases. Integration times of 250 ms were used during spin-coating and 500 ms during annealing. The spectra shown in Figure  3  were recorded with the same setup using integration times of 2 s. The in situ measurements were performed at least four times with each composition to verify that the described trends are reproducible. Scanning Electron Microscopy: SEM images were collected using a FEI Quanta FEG 250 and an electron beam acceleration of 10 kV. 
 (13 of 14) X-Ray Diffraction: The XRD patterns were taken with a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. Photoluminescence Excitation Spectra: All the spectra were collected in a Horiba-JOBIN YVON Fluorolog-3 with a xenon lamp as the excitation source. For the PLE at 800 nm (3D-pvsk), the film was placed at 45° with respect to the excitation and the detection was collected from the back-face of the substrate (glass side -film at 135° with respect to the detection axis), so that the influence of all the species on the surface of the 3D-pvsk on its PLE profile could be verifies. For the PLEs of the RP-phases, the spectra were collected in front-face position (at 45° with respect to the excitation axis and 45° with respect to the detection axis) to be able to resolve the PLE profile of the RP-phases. The emission wavelength for each species was different: 800 nm for 3D-pvsk; 530 and 540 nm for n = 1 RP-phase of PEAI and TMAI, respectively; and 585 nm for the n = 2 RP-phases. The excitation window was always from 300 to 15 nm before the emission wavelength (to avoid strong scattering artifacts). The integration time at each wavelength was 0.6 s and the step was 1 nm at a time.   Even though the color of the materials is red after the synthesis, the majority of the powder is composed by the n = 1 phase in both cases. For PEAI, the ratio n = 1/n = 2 is high, and only minimal amounts of n = 2 phases are present. In the case of TMAI, we see diffraction of the n ≥ 2 phases, and the ratio n = 1/n ≥ 2 is lower than in the case of PEAI. Note that, even in the powder, avoiding preferential orientation of these materials is difficult because of its 2D morphology; therefore, the Bragg reflections in the direction [00l] are very intense in comparison to the other diffractions. synthesized via adapted solution process method.  [1]  The inset photos show the materials in their reaction solution under UV light. The integrated PL intensity (I A ) of (PEA) 2 PbI 4 (1.5x10 5 ) is nearly one order of magnitude higher than I A for (TMA) 2 PbI 4 (1.7x10 4 ) when both are excited with the same power density set to 10 % of the maximum of the LED used (365 nm). Even increasing the LED power to 20%, the (TMA) 2 PbI 4 integrated intensity is much lower than the integrated intensity of (PEA) 2 PbI 4 at 10% power. b) Images of the samples and the measurement setup showing how the PL spectra were measured. The amount of material in both samples was 0.016 mmol (~15 mg each). The dual-band profile of the emission in these pure n = 1 RP-phases is due to strong exciton-phonon coupling in these materials. This emission profile has been thoroughly discussed in recent works.  [2] [3] [4]      Since the substrate is spinning under the laser during spin-coating, strongly reducing the illumination time for each spot on the illuminated circle, it is safe to assume that the effect of the laser on the PL-spectra is bigger during the annealing. Panel a) shows the evolution of the PL spectra of the TMAI-80 sample during spin coating (left) and measured on a second spot, which has not been illuminated, during the annealing of the same sample right after the annealing (right). Panel b) shows the same for the PEAI-80 sample. In both cases, the steady illumination with the laser does not lead to the appearance or disappearance of any PL peaks but induces a slight degradation of the sample surface. In the case of TMAI, where the salt has been completely converted to RP-phases during spin-coating, the laser accelerates the degradation of the RP-phases and the corresponding re-emerging of the 3D-pvsk-peak. In the case of PEAI, where the salt is not completely converted during the spin-coating, the laser reduces the intensity-increase of the RP-phases during annealing -presumably because part of the RP-phases is degrading under the constant illumination, while there is still salt being converted. It should be kept in mind, though, that lateral inhomogeneities might also influence the intensity of the PL peaks. In summary, we think it is reasonable to neglect the effect of the laser on the phenomena described in the main article.    with the characteristic green emission of this material. This visual experiment shows the equilibrium between all the precursors solubilized and the crystal formation. For PEAI, the equilibrium is highly shifted to crystallization, instead of all dissolved. For TMAI, the equilibrium is slightly shifted for all the precursors dissolved rather than crystallization. This shows that the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 has more negative formation energy compared to (TMA) 2 PbI 4 . For the entire video, see Supporting Video 1. We hypothesize that the origin of the different reactivity between PEAI and TMAI is in the steric effects. While the PEA + cation has two fully rotational bonds in the alkyl chain: the C-N and C-C; the TMA + has only a single rotational bond: the C-N (see Figure  S15 ). This higher rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of the alkyl chains influences their reaction dynamics. For instance, due to their similarity, one could expect that BZA + has similar reaction dynamics as the PEA + . However, the BZA + reactivity is very similar to the reactivity of TMA + . In the reaction conditions of Supporting Video 1, both TMA + and BZA + form a clear yellow solution by dissolving PbI 2 , rather than forming the n = 1 RP-phase, as in the case of PEA + . Also, in the reaction conditions of the Supporting Video 2, both form the darkbrown solid that, upon heating, develops to a vivid red solid, suggesting the formation of n = 2 and n = 3 RP-phases. These observations regarding BZA + reactions can be verified in the reference [1] of this material. In addition, following a similar reasoning, PEA + and TEA + show similarities in their reactivity. For instance, in the work of Sutano et al.,  [7]  the perovskite film treated with an IPA solution of TEAI leads to the formation of mostly n = 1 RP-phases with some evidence of n = 2. This is exactly what we observe for PEA + ; the n = 1 RP-phase remains the predominant phase even after prolonged thermal annealing, in close agreement to what we observe in this work and previous reports.  [7, 8]  Finally, the type of aromatic ring (benzene/thiophene) must also play a role, especially in the effectiveness of the van-der-Waals interactions in the bilayer of organic cations; however, the steric effects seem to be more important.

 Figure S2 . S2 Figure S2. Extended in situ PL measurements (TMAI-80 and PEAI-80) during and after the spin-coating including the drying process of the films. It is clearly visible that there is a conversion from n = 1 to n = 2 during the drying process in the case of TMAI. 
 Figure S3 . S3 Figure S3. Steady State PL (SSPL) spectra of TMAI (a) and PEAI (b) treated samples measured during a prolonged annealing step of 60 minutes at 100 °C. Note that the samples were treated with 80 mM of the respective molecule and all spectra were normalized to the intensity of the respective n = 1 peak. The initial measurements were taken about 10 s after the beginning of the annealing in order to let the sample heat up to 100 °C. 
 Figure S4 . S4 Figure S4. Powder XRD of the PEAI and TMAI RP-phases obtained in the solution-process synthesis. The yellow diffractograms are the experimental data. Even though the color of the materials is red after the synthesis, the majority of the powder is composed by the n = 1 phase in both cases. For PEAI, the ratio n = 1/n = 2 is high, and only minimal amounts of n = 2 phases are present. In the case of TMAI, we see diffraction of the n ≥ 2 phases, and the ratio n = 1/n ≥ 2 is lower than in the case of PEAI. Note that, even in the powder, avoiding preferential orientation of these materials is difficult because of its 2D morphology; therefore, the Bragg reflections in the direction [00l] are very intense in comparison to the other diffractions. 
 Figure Figure S5. a) Steady-state PL measurements of the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 and (TMA) 2 PbI 4 materialssynthesized via adapted solution process method.[1]  The inset photos show the materials in their reaction solution under UV light. The integrated PL intensity (I A ) of (PEA) 2 PbI 4 (1.5x105  ) is nearly one order of magnitude higher than I A for (TMA) 2 PbI 4 (1.7x10 4 ) when both are excited with the same power density set to 10 % of the maximum of the LED used (365 nm). Even increasing the LED power to 20%, the (TMA) 2 PbI 4 integrated intensity is much lower than the integrated intensity of (PEA) 2 PbI 4 at 10% power. b) Images of the samples and the measurement setup showing how the PL spectra were measured. The amount of material in both samples was 0.016 mmol (~15 mg each). The dual-band profile of the emission in these pure n = 1 RP-phases is due to strong exciton-phonon coupling in these materials. This emission profile has been thoroughly discussed in recent works.[2][3][4]

Note that not all samples show peaks related to the RP-phases (at all times) and they are consequently missing in some of these panels. 
 Figure S9 . S9 Figure S9.Influence of the laser illumination on the PL spectra taken during the annealing. Since the substrate is spinning under the laser during spin-coating, strongly reducing the illumination time for each spot on the illuminated circle, it is safe to assume that the effect of the laser on the PL-spectra is bigger during the annealing. Panel a) shows the evolution of the PL spectra of the TMAI-80 sample during spin coating (left) and measured on a second spot, which has not been illuminated, during the annealing of the same sample right after the annealing (right). Panel b) shows the same for the PEAI-80 sample. In both cases, the steady illumination with the laser does not lead to the appearance or disappearance of any PL peaks but induces a slight degradation of the sample surface. In the case of TMAI, where the salt has been completely converted to RP-phases during spin-coating, the laser accelerates the degradation of the RP-phases and the corresponding re-emerging of the 3D-pvsk-peak. In the case of PEAI, where the salt is not completely converted during the spin-coating, the laser reduces the intensity-increase of the RP-phases during annealing -presumably because part of the RP-phases is degrading under the constant illumination, while there is still salt being converted. It should be kept in mind, though, that lateral inhomogeneities might also influence the intensity of the PL peaks. In summary, we think it is reasonable to neglect the effect of the laser on the phenomena described in the main article. 
 Figure S10 . S10 Figure S10. X-ray diffraction patterns of samples treated with TMAI (a) and PEAI (b) taken after dynamic deposition of the respective molecule but before annealing. In the case of TMAI, there is no trace of unreacted salt present, even at the highest concentration, while in case of PEAI, there are traces of unreacted salt present for concentrations > 4 mM. The latter is in good agreement with the evolution of the PL-intensity of the n = 1 peak in Figure 2d.

 Figure S13 . S13 Figure S13. Selected images of the solution-process reaction between PbI 2 and the amines, phenylethylamine, and 2-thiophenemethylamine. After 2.40 minutes, the TMAI reaction is a clear yellow solution, while the PEAI reaction is completed and the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 (n = 1) RPphase is formed. The evidence for the reaction completion is the flask under UV light (inset) with the characteristic green emission of this material. This visual experiment shows the equilibrium between all the precursors solubilized and the crystal formation. For PEAI, the equilibrium is highly shifted to crystallization, instead of all dissolved. For TMAI, the equilibrium is slightly shifted for all the precursors dissolved rather than crystallization. This shows that the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 has more negative formation energy compared to (TMA) 2 PbI 4 . For the entire video, see Supporting Video 1. 
 Figure S14 . S14 Figure S14. Selected images of the solution-process reaction between (PEA) 2 PbI 4 and (TMA) 2 PbI 4 with formamidinium acetate [(FA)OAc]. This experiment shows how readily the (TMA) 2 PbI 4 reacts with FA + cations to form n > 1 RP-phases, characterized by the dark red colors. On the contrary, (PEA) 2 PbI 4 requires heat and time for the reaction to occur. The final product of these reactions is a mixture of RP-phases with different values of n, as we can verify from the XRD of the powders in Figure S4. In the case of PEA, the main product is the
