How Stable Is the 2D/3D Interface of Metal Halide Perovskite under Light and Heat?
A (PEA) 2 PbI 4 (2D) layer deposited on a MAPbI 3 (3D) film undergoes a transformation upon photoirradiation and thermal treatment. The decrease in absorption and emission of the 2D layer during light and heat exposure, which shows migration of the PEA + cation within the 3D film, points out the dynamic nature of the 2D/3D interface and intermixing of the two phases.
D espite the impressive breakthroughs in attaining photoconversion efficiencies, the long-term operational stability of perovskite solar cells remains a challenge.  1, 2  Surface treatments to passivate defects or use triple cations for metal halide perovskites have proven to be effective in improving the performance and stability.  [3] [4] [5]  More recently, the focus has shifted to the introduction of a 2D layer over the bulk 3D perovskite film.  [6] [7] [8] [9]  Creation of a 2D/3D interface is thought to significantly improve the stability of perovskite solar cells.  [10] [11] [12] [13]  Whereas the observation of performance stability achieved through the deposition of a 2D perovskite layer is an important development, the stability of the 2D/3D interface under operational conditions is yet to be understood fully. A few preliminary reports have indicated the transformation of the 2D layer deposited on a 3D perovskite film when it is subjected to elevated temperatures.  14, 15  Given the ability of cations and anions to diffuse within the perovskite film,  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21]  it is important to check the stability of the 2D/3D interface under long-term operational conditions, viz. exposure of light and heat. We have now probed photo-and thermal-induced changes in the 2D ((PEA) 2 PbI 4 ) layer deposited on a 3D film of MAPbI 3 through the changes in absorption, emission, and XRD spectra. Methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 , 3D) and phenylethylammonium lead iodide ((PEA) 2 PbI 4 , 2D) perovskite films were separately cast on glass slides using the procedure described in the Supporting Information (SI). 2D/ 3D interfaced layers in the perovskite film were obtained by spincoating 50 μL of 10 mM PEAI onto the warm MAPbI 3 film, just after annealing.  22  The films were coated with poly(methyl methacrylate) as a protective layer (see SI for additional details). Figure  1A  shows the absorption spectra of the MAPbI 3 film before and after deposition of 2D perovskite. Whereas the 3D perovskite's excitonic absorption at 750 nm is retained, a new peak at 515 nm emerges following the deposition of 2D perovskite through the exchange of PEA + ions. Comparison of the difference absorbance spectra with that of (PEA) 2 PbI 4 perovskite (Figure  S1 ) confirms the formation of 2D perovskite with layer n = 1 on the surface of the 3D film.  19  The emission spectrum (Figure  1B ) shows two distinct emissions arising from the 2D and 3D structures of the newly formed 2D/3D perovskite film (individual emission spectra of 2D and 3D perovskite films are shown in Figure  S2 ). Despite the intimate contact of these two layers, we continue to see uninterrupted emission from these two perovskites. Although energy transfer between different layers of 2D perovskites within the film has been reported,  23  we do not see any evidence for energy transfer between 2D and 3D phases. We then subjected the 2D/3D film to visible light irradiation (100 mW/cm 2 , λ > 400 nm) while monitoring changes in the emission and absorption spectra. With increasing irradiation time, we see a continuous decrease in the emission of the 2D perovskite emission at 515 nm, while the emission corresponding to the 3D layer shows only a small decrease (Figure  1C ). A small blue-shift in the onset of the 3D part (∼780 nm) of the spectrum was also noticeable. It is evident that the 2D layer is undergoing quick transformation on the 3D surface and losing its characteristics under photoirradiation. This aspect is further corroborated from the absorption spectra recorded under similar light irradiation conditions (Figure  1D ). These changes in the absorption are better visualized in the difference absorption spectra recorded in Figure  1E . We also separately irradiated 2D and MAPbI 3 films with visible light. No major changes in the absorption peak could be seen under similar irradiation times (Figure  S4 ). The emission and absorption changes during photoirradiation shown in Figure  1C ,D suggest that the 2D film deposited on the 3D perovskite is unstable under visible irradiation and undergoes transformation. This further indicates that the 2D/3D interface that we created initially disappears with continued irradiation. We attribute this unstable behavior of the 2D perovskite layer to the migration of larger cations (PEA + ) from (PEA) 2 PbI 4 into bulk MAPbI 3 , leading to homogenization within the 3D phase. We also probed the charge carrier lifetime of the 2D/3D films before and after photoirradiation using time-resolved absorption measurements in our femtosecond pump-probe set up. The difference spectra of these samples (Figure  S3 ) show the dominance of bleach signal corresponding to the 3D phase. We monitored the bleach recovery at 730 nm to track the charge carrier recombination. The average charge carrier lifetime increased from 8.7 to 51.7 ns as we subjected the film to photo and thermal treatment (Table  S1 ). The increase in lifetime is in agreement with the earlier report of stabilizing excited-state lifetime through emission measurements during thermal treatment.  22  The increase in charge carrier lifetime is indicative of the defect passivation as the organic cation dissipates within the 3D phase of the perovskite film. We further checked the stability of the 2D/3D interface to thermal variations. The films were maintained at a set temperature, and the absorption and emission spectra were recorded continuously. The changes in the absorption and emission spectra of the 2D/3D film subjected to 60 °C are shown in Figure  2A-C . The difference absorption spectra in Figure  2B  highlight the depletion of the absorbance of the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 in the 515 nm region like the one observed in the case of light irradiation (Figure  1D, E ). This disappearance of the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 absorption with thermal annealing time was also monitored at other temperatures (Figure  S5 ). We also separately annealed 2D and MAPbI 3 films at 60 °C. No major changes in the absorption peak could be seen under these annealing conditions (Figure  S6 ). The rate of change in the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 absorption increased with increasing temperature. The changes in the absorption recorded at 515 nm were taken as a measure of the disappearance of the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 in the 2D/3D film to track the impact of annealing temperature. The kinetic traces of the disappearance of (PEA) 2 PbI 4 as monitored from the absorption changes at different temperatures are compared in Figure  2D . It is interesting to note that, at temperatures >100 °C, it takes only a few minutes to introduce migration of PEA + cations into the bulk of the perovskite film. We fitted the traces in Figure  2D  to pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the rate constants are summarized in the Table  S2 . The plot of ln(k) versus 1/T gave an activation energy of 36.6 kJ/mol for the migration of PEA + ions in the 3D perovskite phase (Figure  2E ). To further assess the transformation of the 2D/3D film under thermal treatment, we carried out XRD measurements (Figure  2F ). The perovskite films of MAPbI 3 show characteristic peaks at ∼29.0°and 14.9°corresponding to (220) and (110) planes, respectively, in the diffractogram. The XRD patterns from the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 film show periodic reflections from the lattice. The freshly prepared 2D/3D film exhibits peaks corresponding to both components, thus confirming the presence of both phases in the film. The 2D/3D film after being subjected to 60 °C for 450 min does not exhibit XRD peaks corresponding to a (PEA) 2 PbI 4 phase. The XRD peaks corresponding to the 3D phase are retained with a small shift. The migration of PEA + ions into the bulk film is likely to cause this small shift. These XRD studies further support the unstable behavior of the 2D/3D interface as the PEA + from the (PEA) 2 PbI 4 phase diffuses into the 3D phase of MAPbI 3 , leading to the homogenization. The photoinduced and thermal changes observed through absorption, emission, and XRD measurements discussed here support previously proposed thermal instabilities of 2D/3D halide perovskite interfaces. The MAPbI 3 , (PEA) 2 PbI 4 , and 2D/ 3D perovskite films were found to be stable under dark conditions for 2 weeks (Figure  S7 ). Grancini and co-workers showed that under thermal treatment the emission of the n = 1 layer slowly transforms into n = 2 and higher layer numbers.  14, 22  Progressive reduction of the dimensionality of a 2D layer deposited on a 3D perovskite film has also been probed by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering.  9  These experiments, which probed the migration of a larger organic cation into the 3D bulk phase, were limited to short-term evaluation. For an outdoor photovoltaic operation, one needs to consider light and thermal exposure of solar cells for a longer duration. Whereas such a 2D/3D interface may be stable during short- term laboratory experiments, the migration of cations into the bulk phase is likely to alter the interface and the composition of the 3D perovskite phase. As shown recently, intercalating organic cations into MAPbI 3 has a profound effect in maximizing the overall film stability.  20  In addition, inorganic and organic reagents also provide grain boundary passivation and thus can contribute to the improved performance and stability of the cation.  4, 5, 10  Indeed, the increased charge carrier lifetime following photoirradiation and thermal treatment (Figure  1F ) confirms that the reformed perovskite phase increases the charge carrier lifetime. Hence, one needs to take into account a reformed phase through intercalation of organic cations in the 3D phase and not emphasize the 2D/3D interface as the primary contributor to the improved solar cell performance.

Square-shaped FTO-coated glasses (1 × 1 inch) were prepared first, which were employed as the substrates of film deposition. The FTO substrates were washed with soapy water and sonicated in an ethanol bath for 20 min. The substrates were subsequently rinsed with excess isopropanol and dried with an airstream under ambient conditions. The FTO substrates were further treated with a plasma cleaner for 10 min. The FTO substrates were then immediately transferred to a N 2 -filled glovebox for making lead halide perovskite films.  MAPbI 3 film: MAPbI 3 films were prepared following a modified procedure adapted from previous reports.  [1] [2]  The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving MAI and PbI 2 in 9:1 volume ratio of DMF:DMSO. The final concentration of MAI and PbI 2 was kept 0.30 M and 0.31 M respectively. The solution was left to stir 1 hour at room temperature and subsequently filtered through an inorganic membrane filter (0.2 µm pore size, G8549141, Whatman) prior to deposition. The MAPbI 3 films were obtained using static drop casting of 50 µL of precursor solution and subsequently spin coating at 1000 rpm for 10 s followed by 4000 rpm for 30 s with an acceleration of 1200 rpm. An antisolvent treatment step with chlorobenzene was used, with 100 µL being rapidly injected after 10 seconds. The films were immediately transferred to a preheated hotplate for 10 minutes at 100°C. After annealing the films were removed from the hotplate and left to cool down. After cooling, the films were again spin coated at 2000 rpm for 20 seconds. 100 µL of PMMA solution (10mg PMMA per mL chlorobenzene) was injected after 5 seconds, and the film was once again annealed on a hot plate at 100°C for 3 minutes.  PEA 2 PbI 4 film: The preparation of PEA 2 PbI 4 films follows a modified procedure adapted from previous reported literatures.  [3] [4]  The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving PEAI and PbI 2 in 9:1 volume ratio of DMF:DMSO. The final concentration of PEAI and PbI 2 was kept 0.4 M and 0.2 M respectively. The solution was left to stir 1 hour at room temperature and subsequently filtered through an inorganic membrane filter (0.2 µm pore size, G8549141, Whatman) prior to deposition. The PEA 2 PbI 4 films were obtained using static drop casting of 50 µL of precursor solution and subsequently spin coating at 1000 rpm for 10 s followed by 4000 rpm for 30 s with an acceleration of 1200 rpm. An antisolvent treatment step with chlorobenzene was used, with 100 µL being rapidly injected after 10 seconds. The films were immediately transferred to a preheated hotplate for 10 min at 100°C. After annealing the films were removed from the hotplate and left to cool down. After cooling, the films were again spin coated at 2000 rpm for 20 seconds. 100 µL of PMMA solution (10mg PMMA per mL chlorobenzene) was injected after 5 seconds, and the film was once again annealed on a hot plate at 100°C for 3 minutes.  2D/3D perovskite: The preparation of 2D/3D perovskites follows the procedure from previous literature.  5  MAPbI 3 films prepared without PMMA coating are used as the template. 50 µL of 10 mM PEAI is spin coated on to MAPbI 3 film while the film is still hot after annealing. The film was then left to cool. After cooling, the films were again spin coated at 2000 rpm for 20 seconds. 100 µL of PMMA solution (10mg PMMA per mL chlorobenzene) was injected after 5 seconds, and the film was once again annealed on a hot plate at 100°C for 3 minutes. Schematic representation of the film fabrication is shown below. Characterization Methods. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded using a Cary 50 Bio spectrophotometer (Varian). Emission measurements were collected using a fiber-based Ocean Optics USB2000 spectrometer. An integration time of 100 ms was used. A 365 nm laser diode was used to excite the samples and a 390 nm long pass filter was used to prevent the laser source from reaching the detector. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed by using D8 Advance Davinci, Bruker X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα X-ray (λ = 1.5406 Å) and for all the samples, the value of 2θ was varied from 10° to 70° with a scan rate of 0.3° min -1 . Transient Absorption Experiments. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements were carried out using a Spectra-Physics Solstice Ace laser system (800 nm fundamental, ~5 mJ/pulse, fwhm = ~30 fs, repetition rate of 1 kHz) with detection software from Ultrafast Systems (Helios). A small portion of the fundamental beam was frequency-doubled to 400 nm (using a 1 mm thick BBO crystal) to generate the pump beam, and another part of the fundamental beam was passed through an optical delay stage and focused onto a sapphire crystal to generate a white-light continuum probe pulse. The pump and probe beams are spatially overlapped onto the sample such that the probe is within the area of pump irradiation. The pump beam was sent through an iris of known diameter and the power was adjusted via a neutral density filter wheel to keep the power density at ~40 μJ/cm 2 for these experiments.
