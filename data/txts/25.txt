Detailed calculations for estimation of maximum release achievable per meter-square of FA based perovskite based solar cell and hydrogen cyanide instantaneous concentration observed during low temperature heating tests and. 
 Maximum release achievable per meter-square of FA based perovskite solar cell The weight of one thin-film of 1 m 2 of surface and 500 nm thickness of FAPbI 3 or FAPbBr 3 is 𝑊 𝐹𝐴𝑃𝑏𝑋 3 /𝑚 2 = 𝑉 𝑚 2 •𝜌 𝐹𝐴𝑃𝑏𝑋 3 Where is the weight of perovskite contained in the thin-film of 1 m 2 of surface and 500 The maximum HCN release achievable per meter-square of FA based perovskite solar cell is, 𝑊 𝐻𝐶𝑁/𝑚 2 = 𝑊 𝐹𝐴𝑃𝑏𝑋 3 /𝑚 2 •(% 𝐶𝐻𝑁) 𝐹𝐴𝑃𝑏𝑋3 •𝑀 𝑤 𝐻𝐶𝑁 /𝑀 𝑤 𝐹𝐴 The maximum observed hydrogen cyanide instantaneous partial pressure during low temperature heating tests was P HCN = 1.36 10 -7 torr at 85 ºC, see Figure  S6 .

Top panel shows a one-step type mass loss TG pattern (green line). Bottom panel shows the MS traces simultaneously recorded (1-100 amu) during the experiments. There is a concurrent process of sublimation of FAac obscuring clear observation of released products during degradation.

Top panels show the archetypal two-step type mass loss TG patterns (green line) for FAPbBr 3 . Bottom panels show MS traces simultaneously recorded (1-100 amu) during the experiments. Gray dash lines indicate the initial temperature (time) of the first detection of the released gases during the high-temperature thermal degradation.
