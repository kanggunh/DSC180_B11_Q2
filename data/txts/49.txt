T wo-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper layered metal-halide perovskites, with desirable optoelectronic properties and good environmental stability, have recently attracted extensive research interest as one of the most promising materials for the fabrication of long-term operationally stable and high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs)  [1] [2] [3]  . The general chemical formula of the layered perovskite is L 2 A n-1 M n X 3n+1 , where L is a long-chain organic cation (spacer), A is a short-chain organic cation, M is a divalent metal cation and X is a halide anion. The unique architecture, with n layers of inorganic [MX 6 ] octahedral sheets sandwiched by two long organic spacer layers, represents a natural quantum well (QW) due to a mismatch in the dielectric constants between the organic and inorganic layers  4, 5  . However, layered perovskites deposited using solution methods typically suffer from a mixture of multiple quantum wells with a random well width (n number) distribution (MQWs), which has severely hindered further progress in this field  [6] [7] [8]  . The component interaction in the solution generally controls the final assembly of the layered perovskite segment. The perovskite solution prepared with stoichiometric amounts of precursors, however, has been confirmed to be a complex mixture of colloid particles with a random size distribution in a mother solution of dissolved ions  9, 10  . Although the large particles can be easily filtered out, the small particles with a few unit cells persist in the solution, and could act as nucleation centres in forming QWs with different well widths. Therefore, the deposition of phase-pure QWs remains a key scientific challenge for the thermodynamic stability of compounds in solution. 
 Supplementary Here, we report phase-pure QW thin films by introducing a molten salt spacer n-butylamine acetate (BAAc), instead of the traditional halide spacers n-butylamine iodide (BAI). For strong ionic coordination between BAAc and the perovskite framework during the initial stage of solution processing, compounds with a uniformly distributed intermediate phase can be gelled from the precursor solution with near-monodisperse unit cell particles. We observe that the phase-pure QW films with microscale, vertically aligned grains can then be crystallized from their respective intermediate phases. Two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper layered metal-halide perovskites have attracted increasing attention for their desirable optoelectronic properties and improved stability compared to their three-dimensional counterparts. However, such perovskites typically consist of multiple quantum wells with a random well width distribution. Here, we report phase-pure quantum wells with a single well width by introducing molten salt spacer n-butylamine acetate, instead of the traditional halide spacer n-butylamine iodide. Due to the strong ionic coordination between n-butylamine acetate and the perovskite framework, a gel of a uniformly distributed intermediate phase can be formed. This allows phase-pure quantum well films with microscale vertically aligned grains to crystallize from their respective intermediate phases. The resultant solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency of 16.25% and a high open voltage of 1.31 V. After keeping them in 65 ± 10% humidity for 4,680 h, under operation at 85 °C for 558 h, or continuous light illumination for 1,100 h, the cells show <10% efficiency degradation. 
 Articles Nature eNergy improved stability with respect to their MQW counterparts under conditions of humidity, heat and light stress. After keeping them in 65 ± 10% humidity conditions for 4,680 h, under operation at 85 °C for 558 h, or under continuous light illumination for 1,100 h, the unencapsulated devices showed no significant degradation (<10%). 
 Properties of MQW and phase-pure QW films Phase-pure QW (BA 2 MA n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 ) films, with different well widths (<n> = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; <n> represents the designed n value), were prepared by introducing a molten salt spacer BAAc, instead of the traditional halide spacers such as BAI (Supplementary Fig.  1 )  [11] [12] [13]  . Here, n is the number of semiconducting [PbX 6 ] 4-octahedron slabs within the organic ammonium n-butylamine (BA) spacers. The number of these slabs determines the QW thickness and the degree of quantum confinement, leading to tunable exciton properties and band gaps. To probe the phase purity of the perovskite films deposited with BAAc, as well as the control films deposited with BAI, femtosecond transient absorption (TA) measurements were conducted on these films (Fig.  1a, b  and Supplementary Figs.  2  and 3 ). Upon a 3.1 eV photon pulse excitation, hot charge carriers are injected into all the perovskite QWs. These hot charge carriers subsequently cool to the band edge states or transfer to the adjacent QWs through quantum coupling. The cooled charge carriers in the band edge states induce pronounced photobleaching (PB) in the transitions associated with these states. The high energy level transitions, which dominate the linear absorption above the band gap, are almost invisible in this differential absorption spectrum. Therefore, even if the volume doping concentration of a QW (with n) in a film is very small, the band edge exciton transition associated with this QW (with n) can be identified in the white light probe spectrum, at the early probe delay times  3, 14, 15  . Although all the films were prepared with the desired precursor stoichiometry for single-phase perovskite QWs, Fig.  1a  clearly shows that the TA spectra of the QWs (<n> = 2, 3, 4, 5) deposited with traditional BAI are dominated by multiple PB peaks. The peaks located at 516, 572, 610, 644, 670 and 760 nm closely match with the band edge exciton transitions in n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and ∞ QWs, respectively. The multiple peaks indicate that the QW films deposited with traditional halide spacers are perovskite MQWs, which is consistent with previous publications  [4] [5] [6] [7] 14  . The deposition of phase-pure metal-halide perovskite QWs was a long-term challenge for the research community. By contrast, as shown in Fig.  1b , the TA spectra are dominated by single PB peaks, for all the QW films prepared with the molten salt spacer BAAc. The PB signals associated with the undesired phases in each film are almost negligible. These results reveal that near-single-phase perovskite QWs films could be deposited with a molten salt spacer. The phase-pure perovskite QWs show dramatically different linear absorption (Fig.  1c, d ) and photoluminescence (PL; Fig.  1e, f  and Supplementary Figs.  4  and 5 ) patterns from that of the perovskite MQWs. As presented in Fig.  1c , the MQW films (for <n> ≥ 2) show typical multiple exciton absorption peaks  4, 5, 16, 17  . Correspondingly, the PL spectra of these films are complicated with multiple peaks (Fig.  1e ). Owing to the volume doping concentration of the three-dimensional (3D) perovskite, the phase increases with increasing <n>. This increase combined with an efficient charge carrier funnelling from the thin to thicker QWs  3, 6, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21]  causes the PL of the MQW films with <n> > 2 to be dominated by the broad emission from 3D perovskite, with a slight contribution from thin QWs. By contrast, the linear absorption and PL spectra of phase-pure QW films exhibit a clear single peak (Fig.  1d, f ). Both the absorption and PL peak wavelengths increase monotonically with increasing designed well width <n>. The peak positions of film <n> matched well with the values determined for QW n  1, 3, 18, 19  . Furthermore, no obvious PL from 3D perovskite was observed for any of the films. These results further confirm that near-single-phase perovskite QW films were deposited with the molten salt spacer BAAc. In light of the above findings, as well as the results of a comparative optical investigation by probing from the top (QW side) and bottom (quartz side) surfaces, the schematic structures of the films deposited with BAI and BAAc are illustrated in Fig.  1g, h , respectively. MQWs with a graded vertical distribution are formed in the films deposited with BAI. Thin QWs were located near the substrate and thick QWs (including the 3D phase) were located on the top, which is consistent with previous reports  17, 19  . The 3D (n = ∞) phase on top of the films is subject to degradation, which is not good for perovskite stability. By contrast, the phase-pure QW films deposited with BAAc possess a continuous phase distribution, which not only ensures stability but also guarantees efficient carrier transport along the vertical direction  22  . The vertical alignment of the phase-pure QWs was proved with the following crystal structure characterizations. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the QW films deposited with BAI and BAAc are shown in Fig.  2a, b , respectively. In MQW films deposited with BAI, clear periodic two-dimensional (2D) crystallographic planes (00k) and (0k0) were observed for the <n> = 1 and <n> = 2 films, respectively. However, the 2D crystallographic planes disappeared in the films with <n> ≥ 3 for the largely mixed phases, which is consistent with previous reports 8,  12, 23  . By contrast, clear periodic 2D crystallographic planes (0k0) were observed in all the films (<n> = 2, 3, 4, 5) deposited with BAAc, which further confirmed their high phase purity. To further elucidate the crystal orientation of the QWs on the substrate, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed on the films (<n> = 4) deposited with BAI and BAAc (Fig.  2c, d ). The MQW film exhibited diffraction rings with the signal of the (111) plane, indicating considerable randomness of the polycrystalline orientation, which agrees well with the X-ray diffraction results. However, sharp, sporadic Bragg spots in the phase-pure QW films were observed, such as (060), (  080 ) and (0100) diffractions, suggesting superior crystallinity and preferential orientation with respect to the substrate and high phase purity. The aligned phase-pure QWs could build an efficient carrier-transport channel between the two electrodes, which is favourable for electronic devices  17, 24  . The surface morphologies of the films were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (Fig.  2e ,f and Supplementary Figs.  6  and 7 ). The results show that phase-pure QW films possess a smooth surface with a large average grain size of ~10 μm, while the MQW films possess much smaller grains (~1-2 µm) and obvious pinholes. The high quality of the phase-pure QW films was further confirmed by atomic force microscopy and photo-image measurements (Supplementary Figs.  8  and 9 ). These dense and pinhole-free perovskite films with smooth surfaces and excellent crystallinity are highly desirable for optoelectronic devices. 
 Probing the formation mechanisms of phase-pure QWs The introduction of BAAc into the precursor solution instead of the traditional BAI affected the perovskite sol-gel processes during spin coating. These processes may include solution formation, gelation and crystallization  9, 25, 26  . The solution, prepared with stoichiometric amounts of precursors, has been confirmed to be a complex mixture of colloid particles with random size distribution in a mother solution of dissolved ions  9, 10  . Although large particles are easily filtered out before spin coating, the small particles with one to a few unit cells persist in the solution, and can act as nucleation centres forming QWs with different well widths. Therefore, this random particle size distribution in the precursor solution is a fundamental limitation for depositing phase-pure QWs films. Here, particle size distribution in the precursor solutions prepared with BAI and BAAc was examined by dynamic light scattering (Fig.  3a ). In the solution prepared with BAI, the particles were randomly distributed, with separation varying from 1 nm to several micrometres, indicating different degrees of [PbI 6 ] 4-octahedron aggregation  9, 10, 25, 27  . Surprisingly, in the solution prepared with BAAc, the particles showed a very narrow size distribution (~0.6 nm). This narrow size distribution may originate from the strong interaction between Ac -and Pb 2+ , which prevents the aggregation of colloids with more than one unit cell. To prove this strong interaction between the carbonyl groups of acetate and Pb 2+ , attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectra were collected (Fig.  3b ). The asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration peaks of Ac -in pure BAAc are located at 1,557 cm -1 and 1,402 cm -1 , respectively. The corresponding peaks shifted to 1,548 cm -1 and 1,405 cm -1 upon interaction with the lead ions  28  . This strong coordination interaction may result in the formation of a stable and homogeneous precursor solution. In addition, the local coordination environment of Pb ions in the precursor solution was examined by X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy at the Pb L3 edge (Fig.  3c-e ). The extended X-ray absorption fine structure study showed that the coordination environment of Pb in BAAc precursor solution is distinctly different from that in the BAI precursor solution (Supplementary Table  1 ). In the solution with   BAI, a dominant peak at a distance R = 2.8 ± 0.01 Å was observed in the Fourier-transformed spectrum (Fig.  3d ), which corresponds to the Pb-I scattering path. However, in the solution with BAAc (Fig.  3e ), the peak of the Fourier-transformed spectrum is located at R = 1.8 ± 0.01 Å, which corresponds to the Pb-O scattering path. Therefore, the strong coordination interaction between Ac -and Pb 2+ was further confirmed by the results of the X-ray absorption near-edge structure. Furthermore, the 1 H NMR spectra (Fig.  3f ) show that there is a strong upfield chemical shift (Δδ ≈ 0.08 ppm) in the resonance signal of the -NH 3 + protons, by introducing BAAc (7.57 ppm) instead of BAI (7.49 ppm) into the perovskite precursor solution. This chemical shift is caused by the stronger shielding effect of N-H•••O=C-O -compared to the N-H•••I -hydrogen bond. For these strong coordination interactions between Ac -and the precursors as well as the high viscosity and negligible vapour pressure of BAAc (ref.  25  ), as the other solvents evaporate during the initial stage of spin coating, a uniformly distributed intermediate phase could be gelled from the precursor solution with near-monodisperse unit cell particles. Subsequently, a phase-pure QW film with microscale vertically aligned grains could be crystallized from the intermediate phase, by ejecting the coordinated molten salt and evaporating the by-product methylammonium acetate (MAAc). To more clearly illustrate the mechanisms of different QW films deposited with BAI and BAAc, the reaction formation enthalpies were also calculated using density functional theory from first principles. The results clearly show that MQW formation has the lowest enthalpy value in the case of BAI. However, the formation of phase-pure QWs is thermodynamically preferred by introducing BAAc (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Figs.  10  and 11 ). 
 Photovoltaic performance of solar cells To demonstrate the potential application of phase-pure QW films, efficient solar cells with remarkably high stability and high V OC were constructed. The device structure is made up of layers of indium tin oxide (ITO), SnO 2 nm), perovskite QWs (~500 nm), spiro-OMeTAD (2,2' ,7,7'-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine) -9,9'-spirobifluorene) (~200 nm), MoO 3 (~5 nm) and Au (~80 nm; Supplementary Fig.  12 ). Here, a value of <n> = 4 QWs is used for its balanced wide-band visible-light absorption and good stability (for other <n> QW devices, see Supplementary Fig.  13  and Supplementary Table  2 ). Scanning transmission electron microscopy cross-sectional images of a typical phase-pure QW device are shown in Fig.  4a . Compact multiple layers with clear contrast can be observed. The coloured energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental mapping exhibits a uniform distribution of lead and iodide across the perovskite layer, which is further confirmed by the intensity of lead and iodide elemental signals. The uniform element distribution in the phase-pure QW film is significantly different from the vertical gradient distribution of the elements in the MQW films  19  . A PCE of 16.25% was achieved for the phase-pure QW PSC, with a record high V OC of 1.31 V, a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 16.75 mA cm -2 , a fill factor of 74.07% and negligible J-V hysteresis (Fig.  4b  and Supplementary Table  3 ). By comparison, the MQW PSC demonstrated a PCE of 13.81%, with a V OC of 1.12 V, a J SC of 18.43 mA cm -2 , a fill factor of 66.95% and visible J-V hysteresis. The increased J SC in the MQW PSC was caused by the broadened visible-light absorption in the MQW film. However, with the large increases in V OC and fill factor, the phase-pure QW PSC presented a substantially higher PCE than the MQW PSC. The steady-state output powers, measured under the maximum power point voltages, are 16.14% and 12.97% for the champion phase-pure QW and MQW devices, respectively (Fig.  4c ). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and integrated J SC of the two champion devices are presented in Fig.  4d . The IPCE spectra closely match the corresponding linear absorption spectra (Fig.  1c, d ). The integrated J SC is also in good agreement with the value derived from the corresponding J-V measurements. The statistical results of the devices' performance are shown in Supplementary Fig.  14 . For each condition, 20 devices were fabricated. To explore whether the QW phase purity will affect stability, the long-term stability of the PSCs was recorded under various conditions without encapsulation. After storage under ambient conditions (65 ± 10% relative humidity) for 4,680 h, the phase-pure QW device retained 93.8% of its original PCE, while the MQW device showed a 49.4% PCE loss (Fig.  4e ). Under accelerated ageing tests in a N 2 -filled glovebox (Fig.  4f, g ), the phase-pure QW cells retained 95.7% of their original PCE after continuous heating at 85 °C for 558 h, and retained 96.2% of the initial PCE after continuous illumination at AM1.5G for 1,100 h. By contrast, the MQW device retained only 59.1% and 70.8% of its initial PCE after the corresponding ageing tests (Supplementary Table  4 ). Therefore, the phase-pure QW device possesses much better stability than the MQW device under varying conditions. This conclusion is also consistent with a previous publication  12  , which concluded that the stability of thin QWs is better than that of thick (or 3D perovskite). The long organic cation spacers between the inorganic slabs could be responsible for blocking the perovskite from reacting with moisture and oxygen, as well as inhibiting ion migration within the perovskite lattice  [29] [30] [31] [32]  . In phase-pure QW films, the inorganic slabs are uniformly protected by the spacer layers, whereas in the MQW films, there are substantial thick QWs and 3D perovskite crystals. Hence, QW phase purity is of crucial importance for device stability. 
 Conclusions Our findings show that the traditional constraints of deposition phase-pure QW films could be overcome by introducing a molten salt spacer. High-quality phase-pure QW films in 2D Ruddlesden-Popper layered perovskite with microscale vertically aligned grains were produced, yielding an efficient and stable PSC. Compared to the traditional all-inorganic QWs deposited with vacuum methods  33  , the hybrid organic-inorganic metal-halide perovskite phase-pure QWs offer several improvements, including solution processability, low-temperature fabrication and atomic layer accuracy. Considering the good stability, unique structure and optoelectronic properties, we anticipate that the phase-pure QWs will facilitate the development of solar cells and other perovskite-based optoelectronic devices, such as detectors, light-emitting diodes and lasers. 
 Methods Materials. Methylammonium iodide (MAI, 99.9%), butylammonium iodide (BAI, 99.9%) and poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA, 99.9%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology. Lead iodide (PbI 2 , 99.99%) and 4-isopropyl-4′-methyldiphenyliodonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (TPFB, 98.0%) were purchased from TCI Development. Spiro-OMeTAD (Lumtec, 99.5%), acetonitrile (ACN, 99.8% anhydrous), 4-tert-butylphenol (t-BP, 99%), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, 99.95% trace metals basis), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.99%), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, 99.5%), chlorobenzene (99.9%), BA (98%), hydriodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in H 2 O), acetic acid (HAc, 99.99%), ethyl alcohol, acetone and isopropyl alcohol were used as received from Sigma-Aldrich. The SnO 2 colloid precursor was obtained from Alfa Aesar (tin(iv) oxide, 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion), and the particles were diluted by H 2 O to 2.67% before use. Unless otherwise noted, all the reagents were used without additional treatment. 
 Synthesis of BAAc. First, 50 ml acetic acid and 71 ml butylamine were injected and stirred in a 250 ml round-bottom flask in an ice water bath for 2 h. After stirring at 0 °C for 2 h, the resulting solution was recovered by reduced pressure rotary evaporation at 80 °C for 1 h and produced synthesized liquid chemical BAAc. The liquid product was put into a refrigerator for 2 h to crystallize. The frozen product was washed three times with diethyl ether and then was dissolved in ethanol and recrystallized from diethyl ether three times. Then, the solid product was dissolved in ethanol again, and liquid product was collected by reduced pressure rotary evaporation at 80 °C for 1 h. Finally, the liquid product was cooled to room temperature. Synthesis of perovskite precursors. The BA 2 MA n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving BAI, MAI and PbI 2 , or BAAc, MAI and PbI 2 in DMF and DMSO (volume ratio is 4:1). For the n = 1-5 systems, the molar concentration of BAAc (liquid) was 0.58 mmol ml -1 , 0.31 mmol ml -1 , 0.21 mmol ml -1 , 0.16 mmol ml -1 and 0.13 mmol ml -1 , respectively. The obtained solution was stirred at 65 °C for 2 h in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. BAAc-based precursor (<n> = 1) was prepared with BAAc (76.86 mg, 0.58 mmol), HI (~66 µl, 0.58 mmol) and PbI 2 (133.14 mg, 0.29 mmol) in DMF and DMSO. For the <n> > 1 precursor, we provided additional MAI with the BAAc in the amount needed to make up for the insufficient iodine; for example, the <n> = 2 precursor contained BAAc (41.47 mg, 0.31 mmol), MAI (74.36 mg, 0.47 mmol) and PbI 2 (143.74 mg, 0.31 mmol); <n> = 3 precursor contained BAAc (28.39 mg, 0.21 mmol), MAI (67.90 mg, 0.43 mmol) and PbI 2 (147.65 mg, 0.32 mmol); <n> = 4 precursor contained BAAc (21.59 mg, 0.16 mmol), MAI (64.53 mg, 0.41 mmol) and PbI 2 (149.68 mg, 0.32 mmol); and <n> = 5 precursor contained BAAc (17.42 mg, 0.13 mmol), MAI (62.46 mg, 0.39 mmol) and PbI 2 (150.93 mg, 0.33 mmol). Device fabrication. The patterned ITO substrate was washed with deionized water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol successively, with drying under nitrogen flow. After 15 min ultraviolet-O 3 treatments, a SnO 2 nanocrystal solution was spin coated on the substrate at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s to form a 50-nm-thick electron-transporting layer, which was then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in air. For the persistent hot-casting process, the ITO/SnO 2 substrates were preheated at 100 °C on the spin coater for 5 min, and 50 μl of precursor solution was dropped onto the hot substrate. The spin coater was immediately started with a spin speed of 4,000 r.p.m. for 20 s with 4,000 ramp, and the substrate temperature was elevated from 100 °C to 110 °C by a program controller. The colour of the thin film turned from pale yellow to brown in a few seconds as the solvent escaped. After spin coating, the substrates were quickly removed from the spin coater and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min covered with a small Petri dish. The substrates were then transferred to a nitrogen glove box to complete the device fabrication. For the hole transporting layer, a spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (75 mg ml -1 ) solution was employed with the addition of 35 μl Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (260 mg ml -1 ) and 30 μl 4-tertbutylpyridine. For the stability test, PTAA solution was obtained by dissolving 40 mg PTAA powder in 1 ml chlorobenzene with 10% TPFB. Then 35 μl of the spiro-OMeTAD solution or PTAA solution was dropped onto the perovskite-coated substrate and spin coated at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The device was finished by the thermal evaporation of molybdenum trioxide (5 nm) and Au (80 nm) under vacuum with a shadow mask that kept an active area of 0.05 cm 2 . Characterization. The crystallographic structure information was characterized on a Rigaku (Smart Lab 3 kW) X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å) at a speed of 20 degrees per minute under the operation conditions of 40 kV and 30 mA. Scanning electron microscopy images were obtained via a field emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL-JSM7800F). UV-visiblenear-infrared absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV 1750  Fig. 1 | 1 Fig. 1 | Optical characteristics of layered perovskite films based on MQWs and phase-pure QWs. a,b, Chirp-corrected photo-induced changes in absorption (ΔA) spectra of the MQW films (a) and phase-pure QW films (b) with varied average well width <n> .
