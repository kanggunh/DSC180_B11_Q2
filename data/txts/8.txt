Perovskite Thin Film and Device Fabrication. For the preparation of FA-based (FAPbI 3 ) x (MAPbBr 3 ) 1-x perovskite (x equals to 0.94 in the precursor) thin film, the PbI 2 solution was prepared by dissolving 1.4 mM PbI 2 into 1 mL DMF/DMSO mixed solvent (v/v 94/6). The FAI/MABr/MACl solution was prepared by dissolving 70 mg FAI, 3 mg MABr and 11 mg MACl into 1 mL IPA. The solutions should be stirred overnight before use. the PbI 2 solution was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 70 °C for 1 min. And then, the FAI/MABr/MACl solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 1800 rpm for 30 s, followed by pre-annealing inside the N 2 glove box at 90 °C for 1 min and annealing outside the glove box at 150 °C for 10 min with 40% humidity. For the preparation of all-inorganic CsPbI 2 Br perovskite thin film, the precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.5 mM PbI 2 , 0.5 mM PbBr 2 and 1 mM CsI in 250 µL DMSO and 750 µL DMF. The perovskite solution was spin-coated on the preheated substrate (70 °C) at 2000 rpm for 35 s, to which 0.1 mL of IPA was dropped after 15 s. The spin -coated film was heat-treated at 65 °C for 1 min, followed by 260 °C for 10 min. To prepare perovskite thin films with the conjugated organic ammoniums, 5 mM PRA/IPA:CB, PRMA/IPA:CB or PREA/IPA:CB solution was drop casted at 4000 rpm on the as-fabricated perovskite thin film noted above. The volume ratio of IPA and CB is 1:1. The film was annealed at 100 °C for 3 min. Perovskite solar cells were fabricated with the following device structure: indium tin oxide (ITO)/SnO 2 /(FAPbI 3 ) x (MAPbBr 3 ) 1-x /Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag or Au. The ITO glass was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol and treated in ultraviolet-ozone for 20 min. A thin layer (ca. 30 nm) of SnO 2 was spin-coated twice onto the ITO glass and baked at 180 °C for 60 min. SnO 2 solution was diluted in water (2 mg mL -1 ) before spin-coating. After cooling to room temperature, the glass/ITO/SnO 2 substrates were transferred into a nitrogen glove box, followed by the deposition of the perovskite layer as noted above. For CsFAMAPbI 3 -based perovskite devices, the PbI 2 solution was prepared by dissolving 1.4 mM PbI 2 and 0.07mM CsI into 1 mL DMF/DMSO mixed solvent (v/v 94/6). The FAI/MACl solution was prepared by dissolving 80 mg FAI and 12 mg MACl into 1 mL IPA. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution [60mg Spiro-OMeTAD in 700 µL CB with 25.5 µL t-BP, 15.5 µL Li-TFSI (520 mg/mL in ACN) and 12.5 µL FK209 (375 mg/mL in ACN)], or PTAA solution for stability test [40 mg/mL; in CB with 10% TPFB] was spun onto the perovskite film as a hole conductor. The devices were completed by evaporating 100 nm gold or silver in a vacuum chamber (base pressure, 5 × 10 -4 Pa)

 Method DFT Calculations. All the optimization and single point energy calculation are performed with gamma point only, semi-local PBE functional implemented in CP2K.  (25, 26)  The basis set is double zeta valence polarization basis set optimized on molecular geometries (shorter range), (  27 ) and the energy cutoff is 600 Ry. We use a 5-layer 2*2 perovskite slab model for the pristine perovskite surface simulation, the surface and bottom layer of the model are both (001) FAI termination.
Materials Characterization and Spectroscopic Investigation. UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films were obtained using a U-4100 spectrophotometer (Hitachi) equipped with integrating sphere, in which monochromatic light was incident to the substrate side. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopic analysis was performed using Nicolet 6700 (Thermal Fisher) with Ge ATR plate. The chamber was purged with nitrogen gas during the measurement. XPS measurements were carried out on an XPS AXIS Ultra DLD (Kratos Analytical). An Al Kα (1,486.6 eV) X-ray was used as the excitation source. UPS measurements were carried out to determine the work function and the position of valence band maximum of materials. A He discharge lamp, emitting ultraviolet energy at 21.2 eV, was used for excitation. All UPS measurements were performed using standard procedures with a -9 V bias applied between the samples and detectors. Clean gold was used as a reference. Time of flight-secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) was measured by a TOF.SIMS 5 (ION TOF GmbH Germany, 225332). The detailed description of the transient reflection methods can be found in previously published literature.  (23)  Briefly, the TR/TA measurements were performed by a pump-probe spectrometer (Helios, ultrafast systems). A Ti:Sapphire amplifier (Libra, Coherent) is used to generate 800 nm light at 1kHz repetition rate. The fundamental pulse is split into two parts. One part is sent to an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS, Lightconversion) for the various pump wavelength generation. The pump is chopped at a frequency of 500 Hz and attenuated by neutral density filter wheels. The other part of the fundamental pulse is focused into a sapphire crystal to generate a visible continuum (450-850 nm) that is used as the probe. The probe pulses are delayed in time with respect to the pump pulses using a motorized translation stage mounted with a retroreflecting mirror. The pump and probe are spatially overlapped on the surface of the sample. The incident angle for pump is around 0° and probe is around 45°. The reflected probe pulses are directed to the multichannel complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor sensor. The size of the focused spot at the sample position for the probe and pump beams is around 200 µm and 600 µm, respectively. The total pump-photon flux is determined by measuring the pump power at the sample position. The average excitation density is calculated as the ratio of input photon flux to the pump penetration depth. The detailed description of the Transient THz method can be found in previously published literature  (20) . Briefly, the Transient THz measurements were performed by a pump-probe spectrometer. The fundamental laser pulse with wavelength at 800 nm is generated by a Ti:sapphire amplifier (Astrella, Coherent). The pulse repetition rate is 1 kHz. The fundamental pulse is then split into two parts by a beam splitter. One part is sent to an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS, Lightconversion) for the pump generation at 3.1 eV. The pump is chopped at a frequency of 500 Hz and attenuated by neutral density filter wheels. The average excitation density is calculated as the ratio of input photon flux to the pump penetration depth. The probe beam has two arms. The first arm generates freely propagating THz pulses that are focused onto a sample, transmitted, and refocused onto a detector crystal. It is overlapped spatially and temporally with the optical pump pulse at the sample position; the delay between the THz pulse and the pump pulse is controlled by a delay stage. The second arm of probe beam controls a gating near-IR pulse for free space electro optic sampling of the THz pulses. The gating pulse and the transmitted THz pulse are overlapped spatially and temporally at the detector crystal. Ellipsometry data was taken with incident angles of 60°, 65°, and 70° with (J. A. Woollam M-2000DI) ellipsometer and was modeled in CompleteEASE. The refractive indices and absorption coefficienct of the perovskites were fit to the sum of a Drude term, a parametric semiconductor oscillator ('PSemiM0'), and five Lorentzian distributions. To properly account for surface effects, the model divided the film into 11 slices and three nodes, allowing the Drude parameters and the PSemi-M0 amplitude to vary linearly from the surface nodes to a variable-position central node. The Drude term accounts for free carriers while the PSemi-M0 term is a flexible Kramers-Kronig consistent shape used to fit the band edge. The fitting routine uses the least squares method and for each film attained a root mean square squared error of less than 20.

 Supplementary Text S2 Characterizations of all-inorganic CsPbI 2 Br perovskite thin films with and without ammonium cations 
 Characterization of the location of PREA across the thin film In order to gain more insights into the PREA distribution across the thin film, we performed the Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) in an all-inorganic perovskite system CsPbI 2 Br which has similar structures and properties with the organicinorganic hybrid one. The CsPbI 2 Br system does not contain any organic ammoniums that will interfere with the detection of PREA. The spatial distribution of PREA across the perovskite film was characterized with a device structure of ITO/TiO 2 /perovskite/MoO x . As shown in Fig.  S5 , the C profile (normalized intensity) exhibits a very narrow depth distribution (similar to the depth profile of Mo) with little overlap with the depth profile of Pb, representative of perovskite film, thus confirming that PREA is located only on the surface of the perovskite film without penetrating into the bulk. Comparison of the amount of PRA and PREA attached to the surface Fig.  S6  showed the N profile across the perovskite devices with PRA and PREA. The amount of PRA and PREA attached to the perovskite surface was found to be almost the same. Therefore, the difference in the results of ATR and the significant V oc reduction in PRA-modified device was not resulted from the different amount of PRA attached. 
 Electronic contribution from PRMA and PREA to surface band edge We further evaluate the electronic contribution from the added organic ammoniums to the surface band edge in the case of the all-inorganic CsPbI 2 Br perovskite system. As revealed by ultra-violet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) in Fig.  S7 , additional electronic states near the tail of the valence band are also observed for the case of PRMA and PREA, while these additional states are absent in the case of PRA modification. This suggests the mechanism of the electronic contribution from PRMA and PREA to the perovskite surface band edge is also applicable to other perovskite system. Compared to (FAPbI 3 ) x (MAPbBr 3 ) 1-x perovskite, more distinct electronic features are observed in CsPbI 2 Br, which could be attributed to a lower VBM of CsPbI 2 Br. This suggests that the involvement of A-site ammonium cations in the band edge construction can be rationally regulated in different perovskite systems, bearing significant potentials in various electronic applications. 
 Supplementary Text S3 Additional characterizations of perovskite thin film with and without organic ammonium cations Two-dimensional Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (2D-GIWAXS) was performed to gain insights into the structure of the ammoniums on perovskite thin films. As shown in Fig.  S8 , no obvious signal at q z value below 0.9 Å -1 was observed for all the perovskite thin films with different ammoniums, indicating no 2D perovskite was formed in the thin films. We performed grazing angle (~70°) polarization dependent IR reflection absorption to investigate the molecular orientation of the ammonium cations on the surface. In the polarized IR method, the IR light is polarized parallel (s) or perpendicular (p) to the sample surfaces. By taking the difference of (p-s)/(p+s), we could identify molecular orientation component perpendicular to the surfaces. As shown in Fig.  S9 , when PRA, PRMA, PREA are attached to the perovskite surfaces, we observed a peak near 1240 cm -1 , which is possibly related to the C-N stretching. We have also examined near 1700 cm -1 (the C=N stretching in FA) to verify this method is not sensitive to bulk vibration (no peak near 1700 cm -1 ). Therefore, the polarized IR study confirms that the molecular orientation has a perpendicular component to the perovskite surfaces. The thermogravimetric analysis results for the perovskite thin films with PRA is shown in Fig.  S10 . Before the decomposition of perovskite at elevated temperature, there is no observed weight loss from other species, suggesting Pyren-1-aminium iodide did not decompose during the annealing. The significant different in the device performance of PRA-treated samples can be attributed to the mismatched energy level as discussed below. We performed UPS measurements on pure PRA, PRMA, and PREA. As shown in Fig.  S11 , none of these samples showed any signals, confirming the additional peaks observed around the band tail is due to the incorporation of these organic cations. On the other hand, these pyrene molecules are not conductive, so they are detectable in UPS measurement by themselves. This in turn can be regarded as further evidence that the new features observed is due to the incorporation of the cations in the lattice rather than physico-adsorption. Kramer-Kronig transformed transient reflection spectra is shown in Fig.  S12  to provide additional evidence. With the incorporation of PREA, the center of the excitonic bleach, which is related to the band-edge position shows a slight red shift in position. Such a shift can be an evidence showing the PREA slightly changed the band-edge position of perovskites which is consistent with Fig.  1D . The energy diagrams (Fig.  S13 ) of the modified and unmodified perovskite thin films are drawn by the UPS data (Fig.  S14 ). Perovskite surfaces modified with PRMA and PREA showed very similar band diagram. Since the drift current in a solar cell device is correlated with the carrier density, mobility, and the electrical field, the mobility enhancement would make nonnegligible contributions to the improved hole collection probability when the driving forces i.e. the energy offset between perovskite surface and hole transporting layer are quite similar. Time-resolved PL measurements were performed to further study the carrier dynamics of the perovskite thin films. As shown in Fig.  S15 , PREA and PRMA treated thin film showed similar PL decay profile to that of the reference film, indicating similar bulk carrier lifetime and electron-phonon interactions. PRA treated sample exhibited a much faster PL decay, suggesting a prominent carrier transfer, which is consistent with our UPS data showing an increase in the VBM after PRA treatment. This higher VBM resulted in a mismatched energy level with the hole transporting layer (Fig.  S16 ), leading to the significant V oc reduction as observed in the photovoltaic devices. We assessed the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite films prepared with and without the ammoniums by fabricating devices with the ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au configuration. Current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the photovoltaic devices with and without ammoniums are compared in Fig.  3D , and the photovoltaic parameters of best performing devices are summarized in Table  S2 . The PCE of the asfabricated perovskite solar cells with PREA exhibited the largest enhancement from 20.1 % to 23.0% with an obvious increase in the J sc (from 23.90 mA/cm 2 to 24.91 mA/cm 2 ) and FF (from 0.723 to 0.784) due to the largest enhancement of hole mobility. The lower PCE of PRMA based device (20.9%) was consistent with the less improved hole mobility, which could be attributed to the distorted intercalation configuration of the ammoniums generating energy disordering in the lattice. For the PRA based device, instead, a decreased PCE of 19.5% was obtained, due to the significantly reduced V oc (from 1.160 V to 1.066 V), which could be attributed to the unmatched energy level as revealed by the UPS results. (Fig.  S16 ) Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) was conducted to study the effect of the different ammoniums on the optical property of the perovskite films. As shown in Fig.  S18 , no obvious difference in the UV-Vis spectra was observed, which further supports that the enhancement of the photovoltaic performance originates from the improved hole mobility.

 Intercalation configuration of the ammoniums into Pb-I framework Polycrystalline two-dimensional perovskite thin film was prepared by mixing PbI 2 and the corresponding organic ammoniums, i.e. PRAI, PRMAI, PREAI (1:2 molar ratio) in DMF. The solution was spin-coated onto a glass substrate at a rate of 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 10 min for GIWAXS characterization. PREA 2 PbI 4 perovskite single crystals are prepared by dissolving PbI 2 and PREAI in gamma-butyrolactone followed by an anti-solvent diffusion method, which can be found elsewhere  (29) . The interplanar distance of the neighboring pyrene ring was determined to be 7.826 Å, the stacking of which could be assigned to the edge-on diffraction features around a Q xy value of about 1.06 (partly overlap with the signal of {011} planes) in the GIWAXS data. Noticeably, this edge-on diffraction features are much weaker in the case of PRMA-based layered perovskite, which could be attributed to a more distorted intercalation configuration of PRMA. A suitable crystal was selected on a 'Bruker D8 VENTURE' diffractometer. The crystal was kept at 170 K during data collection. Using Olex2  (30) , the structure was solved with the XT (31) structure solution program using Intrinsic Phasing and refined with the ShelXL (31) refinement package using Least Squares minimization.

 Supplementary Text S5 Kinetic models of carriers of perovskite (Scheme S4) Scheme S4. Transient reflection illustrations. The pump is exciting through the treated surfaces which generates the carriers. Then the probe reflects off the surfaces to probe surface carrier kinetics. 
 Transient reflection kinetics modelling-Interaction Region Model The measured surface carrier kinetics can be modelled with diffusion and surface recombination model, the detailed description of which can be found in previously published literature  (23) . Here, to gain insights into the different binding characters as suggested by XPS and FTIR through investigating the induced changes of surface carrier dynamics, we utilize a diffusion model where an interaction region L int is defined. The interaction region can reflect the degree of influence of different organic cations on the surface carrier dynamics. Within the L int , the carriers will experience different electronic potential which might lead to change in diffusion constant and surface recombination velocity. Since the TRS is done on films and there are no significant charge transfer happening within the few ns probe window as suggested by transient absorption (Fig.  S17 ), we can still assume the majority of the carriers within the interaction region follow one dimensional diffusion equation 𝜕𝑁(𝑥,𝑡) 𝜕𝑡 = 𝐷 𝜕 2 𝑁(𝑥,𝑡) 𝜕𝑥 2 - 𝑁(𝑥,𝑡) 𝜏 𝐵 (1) where N(x, t) is the carrier density as a function of depth x and time t, D is the ambipolar diffusion coefficient (D ab ) and τ B is the bulk carrier lifetime. Generally, in perovskite material, τ B is on the order of hundreds of ns, in the 5 ns probe window, it can be neglected. The initial condition for equation (  1 ) is then given by carrier generation profile 𝑁(𝑥, 0) = 𝑁 0 • exp(-𝛼𝑥) (2) where N 0 is the initial surface carrier density. If the traces are normalized, then N 0 is equal to 1. The values for the absorption coefficient at different pump-photon energies for both samples are known (taken from Fig.  S18 ). The boundary condition can be described by the followings, for the front surface, surface recombination will dominate (S F ), and it is defined as 𝜕𝑁(𝑥,𝑡) 𝜕𝑡 | 𝑥=0 = 𝑆 𝐹 𝐷 𝑁(0, 𝑡) (3) For the back part of the interaction region, we assume the carriers are extracted into the bulk film with effective extraction coefficient S int 𝜕𝑁(𝑥,𝑡) 𝜕𝑡 | 𝑥=𝐿 𝑖𝑛𝑡 = - 𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡 𝐷 𝑁(𝐿 𝑖𝑛𝑡 ,𝑡) (4) In this model, L int is allowed to vary to give the best fit. For untreated reference, the interaction region D is close to the film thickness around 0.775 um, and S F and S int are kept the same since the front and back surface recombination are similar. For PRA, PRMA and PREA treat samples, S F and S int are not the same since the extraction near the back of the interaction regions are now different. These set of equations are solved numerically by using a backward finite difference method. The fitted ambipolar diffusion constant (D ab ) can be related to ambipolar mobility (μ ab ) with Einstein relationship 𝜇 𝑎𝑏 = 𝑒𝐷 2𝑘 𝑏 𝑇 (5) Where k b is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature in K (298 in our case), and e is the elementary charge. By performing this calculation, the ambipolar mobility can be extracted. This method is used to model the kinetics shown in Fig.  3  of the maintext. 
 Transient THz spectra modelling The detail of THz spectrum modelling has been described in literature.(20) Briefly, the complex photoconductivity Δσ(ω) can be written as: ∆𝜎(𝜔) = -𝜀 0 𝑐 𝑑 𝑝𝑢𝑚𝑝 (1 + 𝑛 𝑠𝑢𝑏 ) ∆𝐸(𝜔) 𝐸 0 = 𝜇(𝜔)𝑒𝑁 (6) Where ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, c is the speed of light, d pump is the penetration depth of pump at 3.1 eV (~ 33 nm), n sub is the refractive index of substrate (quartz is used with value 2.19), ∆𝐸(𝜔) 𝐸 0 is the change in THz electric field amplitude. And this photoconductivity can be related to THz mobility µ(ω), carrier density N (~ 9 × 10 18 cm -3 ) and elementary charge e. From THz photoconductivity, the THz mobility can be obtained and modelled with 𝜇(𝜔) = ( 𝜇 𝑑𝑐 1+𝑐 1 )( 1 1- 𝑖𝜔 𝛤 ) (1 + 𝑐 1 1- 𝑖𝜔 𝛤 ) + ∑ 𝜀 0 𝜔 𝑝,𝑚 2 𝜔 𝑒𝑛[𝑖(𝜔 0,𝑚 2 -𝜔 2 )+𝜔𝛤 𝑚 ] 𝑁 𝑚=1  (7)  where 𝜇(𝜔) is the frequency dependent mobility and 𝜇 𝑑𝑐 is the DC mobility at zero frequency. The first two brackets in the first term represent the Drude model and the third bracket taking (-1 < c 1 < 0) is the Smith modification that parametrizes the degree of carrier localization. (-0.721 for reference, -0.74 for PRA, -0.717 for PRMA and -0.715 for PREA) The second term is the Lorentzian model, in which ω p,m , ω 0,m , and Γ m are plasma frequencies, phonon resonance frequencies, and the scattering rate of the m th oscillator, respectively. Here, we consider only two phonon peaks as previously reported at 0.9 and 1.8 THz. From the fitting, we can extract the µ dc . 
 Calculating individual electron and hole mobility In perovskite materials, the charge carriers are electron and holes. From TRS fitting, the ambipolar mobility can be extracted and from THz fitting, the DC mobility can be extracted. These two terms can be related to electron (µ e ) and hole (µ h ) mobility in the following way: 𝜇 𝑎𝑏 = 𝜇 𝑒 𝜇 ℎ 𝜇 𝑒 +𝜇 ℎ (8) 𝜇 𝑑𝑐 = 𝜇 𝑒 + 𝜇 ℎ (9) By solving equations 8 and 9, individual mobilities can be extracted.

 Enhanced efficiency and stability by PREA The details of the enhanced efficiency and stability are summarized in Fig.  S19  and Table  S3 . Fig.  S19A  displayed the photovoltaic properties under both reverse and forward scan directions of devices with and without PREA. A substantially reduced hysteresis was observed in PREA-based device. The effect of the PREA concentration was studied as shown in Fig.  S20 . 5 mM of PREA showed the best PCE of the solar cell devices. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices were compared in Fig.  S19B . An integrated J sc of 24.42 mA/cm 2 from the PREA-based device matched well with the value measured from the J-V scan (<5% discrepancy), while a reference device showed an integrated J sc of 23.73 mA/cm 2 . The enhanced photocurrent was attributed to the improved carrier extraction, which was confirmed by the transient photocurrent decay (Fig.  S21 ). An increased stabilized PCE of 22.4% was achieved in the PREA-based device when biased at 1.00 V, while that of the reference device was 19.3% when biased at 0.92 V (Fig.  S19C ). The histogram of solar cell efficiencies for 40 devices is shown in Fig.  S19D , which demonstrates the high reproducibility of the performance improvement with PREA (an average PCE was improved from 19.46±0.46% to 22.40±0.45% with the incorporation of PREA). Notably, we observed a remarkably enhanced operational stability of encapsulated devices based on PREA. At ambient atmosphere ca. 40 °C, after 2,000 hours exposure to continuous light (90 ± 10 mW cm -2 ) without UV-filter under open-circuit condition, the PREA-based device maintained over 85% of its original PCE, while the reference device degraded to around 60% of its initial PCE. (Fig.  S19E ) The enhanced the stability could be attributed to the insertion of the ammonium head into the framework and thus the exposure of the hydrophobic polycyclic aromatic tail. We also managed to introduce PREA into another perovskite system i.e. CsFAMAPbI 3 . As reported  (32) , multi-cation perovskite could prevent the carrier reflection from grain surfaces and lead to higher PCEs. Therefore, we further optimized the composition of perovskite made via a two-step method by adding 5 mol% Cs into the precursor. The reference PCE of CsFAMAPbI 3 -based devices was improved to 21.7%, and for the PREA treated perovskite, the PCE could be achieved up to 23.5% (Fig.  S22 ). This also justified the generality of this strategy in improving the device performance.

 Table S1 The extracted mobility from transient reflection kinetics (interaction distance model) and transient THz spectra Sample D ab (cm 2 s -1 ) µ ab The band edges of metal-halide perovskites with a general chemical structure of ABX 3 (A, usually a monovalent organic cation; B, a divalent cation; and X, a halide anion) are constructed mainly of the orbitals from B and X sites. Hence, the structural and compositional varieties of the inorganic B-X framework are primarily responsible for regulating their electronic properties, whereas A-site cations are thought to only help stabilize the lattice and not to directly contribute to near-edge states. We report a p-conjugation-induced extension of electronic states of A-site cations that affects perovskite frontier orbitals. The p-conjugated pyrene-containing A-site cations electronically contribute to the surface band edges and influence the carrier dynamics, with a properly tailored intercalation distance between layers of the inorganic framework. The ethylammonium pyrene increased hole mobilities, improved power conversion efficiencies relative to that of a reference perovskite, and enhanced device stability. (cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) µ DC (cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) µ h (cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) µ e (cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) T he band-edge electronic structure of hybrid metal-halide perovskites (ABX 3 , where A is usually a monovalent organic cation, B is a divalent cation, and X is a halide anion) develops from the orbitals of B and X sites (1) and can be tuned through the compositional and structural flexibility of the B-X framework  (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . By contrast, the A-site cations are generally not thought to directly affect electronic structure near the band edges because their electronic states lie far from the inorganic band edges  (13) . Instead, different A-site cation sizes can induce indirect effects by causing structural deformation of the inorganic B-X framework, such as unit volume variation, octahedral distortion, and dimensional reduction  (14) (15) (16) (17) . We now show that the electronic states of the A-site cations can be extended and directly contribute to the frontier orbitals of the hybrid perovskite through a combination of a large p-conjugated structure and a tailored intercalation distance between layers of the inorganic framework, which provides additional degrees of electronic tunability to near-edge electronic configuration. The carrier dynamics could be rationally tuned in accordance with the device architecture by modifying the A-site organic structure. We designed a polycyclic aromatic tail with large p-conjugation that was attached to an ammonium A-site cation. The chemical structures of the as-synthesized organic cations featured different lengths of the tethering alkylammonium group-namely PRA, PRMA, and PREA for pyrene-based ammonium, methylammonium, and ethylammonium, respectively (Fig.  1A ; see synthesis details in supplementary text S1). When these organic cations were assembled with the inorganic framework, the extent to which the positively charged ammonium head group intercalated into the octahedral cavity depended on the length of the bridging alkyl chain. Electron delocalization in the large conjugated pyrene structure lowered the frontier orbital separation of the organic molecule and enabled orbital overlap with the inorganic moiety  (18) . The alkyl chain length affected the electronic interaction between the two moieties. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy of PRMA and PREA cations assembled onto the surface of the Pb-I framework of a formamidiniumbased perovskite thin film (Fig.  1B ) revealed additional electronic states near the tail of the valence band (the Fermi energy has been aligned for better comparison). However, a perovskite thin film with the PRA moieties attached exhibited similar band-tail characteristics to that of the reference, indicating a lack of electronic contribution from PRA to the surface band edges. First-principles calculations of the partial density of states revealed electronic states near the surface band edges (Fig.  1C ). As the alkyl chain of the ammonium group became longer, the electronic states from the organic components at the valence band were pushed to a higher energy level. The electronic states from PRA were as much as 0.34 eV below the valence band maximum (VBM), but PRMA and PREA had electronic states near the VBM. The distribution of the electronic states of the organic ammonium cations with respect to the inorganic band structure (Fig.  1D ) showed that the orbitals of PRMA and PREA greatly overlapped with the inorganic VBM, with the highest unoccupied orbitals only 0.02 eV below and 0.01 eV above the VBM, respectively. Thus, the band structure of PRA resembled that of the reference film, with the VBM consisting of I 5p and Pb 6s orbitals. However, for PRMA and PREA, the VBM had contributions from the orbitals of both inorganic and organic components. The participation of PRMA and PREA in the surface band-edge construction was also observed in all-inorganic CsPbI 2 Br perovskite (supplementary text S2), indicating the generality of this concept. The discrepancy in the surface band-edge configuration originated from different chemical interaction modes between the inorganic framework and the ammonium cations with different alkyl chain lengths; theoretical modeling of the assembly of these organic ammoniums on the surface of the Pb-I framework is shown in Fig.  2A . We used time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry and grazingangle polarization-dependent infrared reflectionabsorption spectroscopy to verify the vertical assembly of the ammonium cations on the surface (supplementary text S2 and S3). Both PRMA and PREA could anchor into the octahedral cavity through electrostatic interactions between the ammonium cations and the PbI 6 2-octahedra. However, PRMA, which has a shorter alkyl chain length between the ammonium head and the pyrene tail, exhibited a distorted intercalation configuration because of the structural rigidity and pronounced steric hindrance induced by the pyrene ring. The elongated alkyl chain in PREA enabled more flexibility with less steric hindrance and displayed almost vertical intercalation of PREA into the inorganic layers. The conjugated tails of PREA were stacked nearly perpendicular to the plane of the inorganic layer. With a reduction in the length of the tethering alkylammonium group, the orientation of PRMA tilted away from the vertical direction by ~30°, which disrupted the p-p stacking and reduced the electronic delocalization. By contrast, PRA, which lacked a flexible alkyl chain, failed to relieve the steric hindrance of the pyrene group when anchoring into the Pb-I framework. Its binding mode to the inorganic surface would be more accurately described as adsorption rather than anchoring, as also evidenced by the vertically oriented pyrene tail in PRA stacking. With a shallow interaction depth, the steric hindrance from the large pyrene tail no longer affects the intercalation configuration, enabling a molecular orientation driven by the surface energy and p-p stacking. We used attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy to investigate the chemical binding between the organic cations and the Pb-I framework. Difference ATR-FTIR spectra of perovskite films with PRA, PRMA, and PREA with respect to the reference film are shown in Fig.  2B . Distinctive vibration features from the reference and PRA samples were observed in PRMA and PREA samples between 900 to 1100 cm -1 . Both PRMA and PREA showed substantially reduced absorption near 930 cm -1 and increased absorption near 1060 cm -1 , which we attributed to the change of the outof-plane N-H wagging and C-N stretching   
 RESEARCH | REPORT Downloaded from  https://www.science.org  at University of California San Diego on November 07, 2024 modes, respectively. The absence of distinctive vibration features in PRA samples indicated a different binding mode with a weak interaction. High-resolution x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) of the Pb 4f orbital for the perovskite film with different ammonium cations (Fig.  2C ) showed two main peaks at ~138 and ~143 eV, corresponding to the Pb 4f 7/2 and Pb 4f 5/2 orbitals, respectively  (19) . The peaks from Pb 4f shifted to higher binding energies in the film with PRMA and PREA, whereas the spectra of PRA samples remained almost identical to that of the reference sample. This difference suggested a stronger interaction between PRMA or PREA and Pb, as well as a more profound influence on the bonding character of Pb in the inorganic framework, compared with that in the case of PRA. The dense and periodic insertion of the pyrene-based ammoniums into the Pb-I framework was further evaluated by grazing-incident wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and the growth of two-dimensional (2D) perovskite single crystals. The GIWAXS patterns of perovskite thin films generated by stoichiometrically mixing PbI 2 and PRA, PRMA, or PREA salt to form a 2D perovskite phase are shown in Fig.  3 , A to C, respectively. Both PRMA-and PREA-based perovskite samples exhibited outof-plane diffraction patterns of {100} planes, indicating the formation of 2D perovskite phases, but this diffraction feature was absent for PRA, confirming that it failed to anchor into the Pb-I framework. The PREA-based 2D perovskite showed much higher crystallinity and preferred out-of-plane crystallographic orientation than PRMA perovskites (Fig.  3D ), further verifying the distorted intercalation configuration of PRMA. Single crystals of PREAbased 2D perovskite showed the periodic stacking mode of the pyrene-based ammonium cations, and the pyrene rings had an edge-on packing with the Pb-I framework (Fig.  3E ; see details of the crystal structures and the growth of single crystals in supplementary text S4). The reconfiguration of the surface bandedge electronic structures involving A-site organic cations and the alkylammoniumcontrolled intercalation distance were also reflected in the change of surface carrier dynamics, which were probed by transient reflection spectroscopy (TRS) and time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy (TRTS)  (20, 21) . By modeling the measured surface carrier kinetics with a de-fined surface interaction distance (see the modeling details in supplementary text S5), we could determine the binding configuration because the electronic interaction distance was related to the binding character between the organic ammonium cations and the inorganic moieties (Fig.  4A ). The surface carrier kinetics probed by transient optical reflection for the cases of reference, PRA, PRMA, and PREA (Fig.  4B ) revealed a ~33% increase in the interaction distance for PRMA or PREA relative to that for PRA (the absolute values may be longer than expected in the model, owing to the effects of film roughness). This increase in the interaction distance was consistent with the interaction mode between the organic ammonium cations and the perovskite lattice, where PRMA and PREA inserted into the lattice, unlike PRA. The photoinduced electron and hole carrier mobilities are extracted by combining TRS and TRTS results. The surface photogenerated carrier transport was measured with the reflected optical probe  (22)  and provided information on the ambipolar diffusion coefficient (D ab )  (23, 24) , whereas the terahertz probe pulse was sensitive to the sum of the   S1 . Because the orbitals of the organic ammonium cations mainly interacted with the valence band of the inorganic lattice, the hole mobility was most substantially affected. The largest increase in hole mobility was observed for PREA; electron mobilities remained almost invariant across all samples. The enhancement in hole mobility benefited the carrier collection in perovskite photovoltaic devices, as reflected by an increase in the shortcircuit current (J sc ) and fill factor (FF). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the asfabricated perovskite solar cells with PREA exhibits the largest enhancement, from 20.1 to 23.0% (Fig.  4D ). A smaller enhancement of hole mobility, and thus J sc and FF, was observed for PRMA, which we attributed to the distorted intercalation of the ammonium cations generating energy disorder in the lattice. However, PRA actually led to a decrease in PCE because of a reduced open-circuit voltage that resulted from an unmatched energy level with the hole-transporting layer (supplementary text S3). Thus, rational control of the intercalation distance regulated by the tethering alkyl ammonium enabled electronic contribution of A-site cations to the near-edge band structure and, in turn, modified the carrier kinetics within devices. The insertion of the ammonium head into the framework, and thus the exposure of the hydrophobic polycyclic aromatic tail, further increased the stability of the devices. After 2000 hours of exposure to continuous light under open-circuit conditions, the device with PREA maintained more than 85% of its original PCE, whereas the reference device degraded to only 60% of its initial PCE (supplementary text S6).  14), a = 25.266(2) Å, b = 7.8784(7) Å, c = 8.3974(8) Å, β = 94.157(3)°, V = 1667.2(3) Å 3 , Z = 2, T = 170 K, μ(MoKα) = 8.792 mm -1 , Dcalc = 2.397 g/cm 3 , 16865 reflections measured (4.85° ≤ 2Θ ≤ 50.036°), 2818 unique (R int = 0.0674, R sigma = 0.0438) which were used in all calculations.
