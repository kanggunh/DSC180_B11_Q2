Polymer-templated nucleation and crystal growth of perovskite films for solar cells with efficiency greater than 21%

O magnitude faster than the homogeneous nucleation due to the lowering of the nucleation free energy barrier  16  . On the other hand, PMMA slows down the perovskite crystal growth by forming an intermediate adduct with PbI 2 to allow the randomly formed nuclei to adjust their orientation to minimize the total Gibbs free energy and grow in the thermodynamically preferred orientation  17  . The cooperation of these two effects results in smooth perovskite films with fewer defects and larger oriented grains, enabling us to fabricate perovskite solar cells with a PCE over 21%. 
 Polymer-templated nucleation and crystal growth Although PMMA has been widely used as a moisture protection barrier on top of the back contact of PSCs or mixed with carbon nanotubes to form the hole collection layer  18  , it has so far not been employed to affect the formation of the perovskite itself during solution processing. We produce the mixed cation perovskite films in a single step from a solution of formamidinium iodide (FAI), PbI 2 , methylammonium bromide (MABr) and PbBr 2 in a mixed solvent of dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)  13, 19  . During the spin-coating of the perovskite solution, we introduce PMMA in a chlorobenzene/toluene mixture to template crystal formation and growth of the perovskite. The PMMA serves as a support to induce nucleation of small perovskite crystals and directs the ensuing growth of these crystals. By using this technique for film deposition we fabricate perovskite solar cells with the structure Au/ Spiro-OMeTAD[2,2,7,7-tetrakis(N,N -di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine) 9,9-spirobifluorene]/perovskite/mesoporous TiO 2 /compact TiO 2 / fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of which is shown in Fig.  1a . Employing this solar cell configuration, we achieve the best PCE of 21.6% with a PMMA concentration C PMMA = 0.6 mg ml -1 . The photovoltaic metrics of the device are as follows: short- circuit current density (J SC ) = 23.7 mA cm -2 , open-circuit voltage (V OC ) = 1.14 V, and fill factor (FF) = 0.78 (Fig.  1b ). One of the devices was sent for certification to Newport Corporation Technology and Application Center PV Lab, an accredited PV testing laboratory, confirming a PCE of 21.02% (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). The commonly observed hysteresis  20  is virtually negligible in our devices, as confirmed by J-V curves shown in Fig.  1b . A histogram of two batches of cells (Supplementary Fig.  2  and Table  1 ) indicates excellent reproducibility with an average PCE of 21.0%. Preliminary stability investigations show that the unsealed devices containing PMMA are stable, showing only a 3.3% decay in PCE during exposure to ambient air for two months in the dark (Supplementary Fig.  3  and Tables  2  and 3 ). The photovoltaic metrics of the PSCs fabricated from the PTNG method varying C PMMA are summarized in Fig.  1c . Upon increasing the PMMA concentrations (C PMMA , mg ml -1 ) in mixed chlorobenzene and toluene (volume ratio of chlorobenzene and toluene is 9:1) solution, the PCE first augments and subsequently decreases with a peak at C PMMA = 0.6. Upon increasing the C PMMA from 0 to 0.6 mg ml -1 , the V oc rises from 1.10 V to 1.14 V, and the FF from 0.74 to 0.78. Figure  2  shows the SEM images of perovskite films deposited on m-TiO 2 /bi-TiO 2 /FTO substrate by varying C PMMA . As illustrated in Fig.  2a , the morphology of the pre-perovskite intermediates  21  present before annealing changes from a mixture of randomly distributed nanoparticles into homogeneous nanorods. Figure  2b  and c  show the perovskite film after annealing, indicating that the grain size of the perovskite film produced by the PTNG method increases with C PMMA and most of the grain boundaries become perpendicular to the substrate, benefiting a reduction in the surface area of the grain boundaries. Hence, the PMMA is expected to uniformly trigger heterogeneous nucleation over the perovskite precursor film, improving the grain size and facilitating the perovskite to grow in a preferred direction, with reflection of the facet with (111) indices being dominant because of the low symmetry of the trigonal perovskite (p3m1) phase, as indicated in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in Fig.  3a . Whereas numerous grain boundaries exist in cross-sectional SEM of the reference film, no obvious boundary exists in the PTNG-treated film. On the other hand, for C PMMA > 0.6 mg ml -1 , new species appeared on the surface of the perovskite grains, which we attribute to PMMA particles, as the brighter signal indicates charge accumulation resulting from poor conductivity. This phenomenon accounts for the deterioration of the PV metrics when C PMMA exceeds 0.6 mg ml -1 PMMA because the excess of PMMA will impair charge carrier collection. 
 Material characterization To further examine the crystal structure, we conducted thin-layer XRD measurements for perovskite films deposited on mp-TiO 2 /bl-TiO 2 /FTO substrates (Fig.  3a ). The peak at 12.5 • arises from the (001) lattice planes of hexagonal (2H polytype) PbI 2 . The excess PbI 2 is believed to passivate surface defects, increasing the solar cell performance  13, 22  . All the samples show the same trigonal perovskite phase with the dominant (111) lattice reflection. We speculate the (111) plane to exhibit the smallest surface energy because the majority of grains exhibit this orientation to minimize the total Gibbs free energy of the system. With increasing C PMMA , the (111)-oriented grains grew faster by consuming neighbouring nonoriented crystals, either by regular grain growth or grain attachment, as evidenced by the increased ratio between the (111) and (123) peak at 13.9 • and 31.5 • in the presence of PMMA. By taking the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the (111) reflection, we calculate the crystallite size using Scherrer's equation. Their dimension increases from 41 to 55, 70, 94 and 112 nm on increasing C PMMA from 0 to 4 mg ml -1 . We attribute the larger crystal sizes to the templating effect of PMMA on the crystal growth. The carbonyl groups in PMMA form an intermediate adduct with PbI 2 , as revealed by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra in Fig.  3b . The stretching vibration of C=O bond in pure PMMA appears at 1,735 cm -1 , while it shifts to 1,723 cm -1 upon interaction with PbI 2 . The shift of the C=O vibration in PMMA to lower wavenumber upon interaction with PbI 2 is indicative of the formation of an intermediate PMMA-PbI 2 adduct, since it is a consequence of a weakened C=O bond strength caused by interaction with the Lewis acid PbI 2 . The formation of such an adduct 7 is expected to retard the crystal growth and improve the crystallinity of the perovskite film. 
 Time-resolved photoluminescence decay To analyse the dynamics of recombination, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay measurements (Supplementary Figs  4  and 5 ). The PL decays for perovskite films with C PMMA = 0 and 0.6 mg ml -1 deposited on a m-TiO 2 /c-TiO 2 / FTO substrate are shown in Fig.  3c , revealing a much faster PL decay for the reference than the PMMA-treated film. The PL decay curves were fitted to a bi-exponential rate law: Y = A 1 exp(-t/τ 1 ) + A 2 exp(-t/τ 2 ) + y 0 (1) where A 1 and A 2 are the relative amplitudes and τ 1 and τ 2 are the lifetimes for the fast and slow recombination, respectively  23  . The decay is attributed mainly to trap-assisted recombination at defects. The film with the PMMA treatment exhibits fast and slow phase lifetimes of τ 1 = 23.9 ns (fraction A 1 = 0.37) and τ 2 = 259.3 ns (fraction A 2 = 0.63), respectively. In contrast, the sample without the PMMA treatment gives τ 1 = 18.7 ns (fraction A 1 = 0.66) and τ 2 = 123.6 ns (fraction A 2 = 0.34), respectively. This indicates a lower defect concentration and hence superior electronic quality for the PMMA-containing perovskite polycrystalline film, consistent with the higher V oc of the corresponding PSC  13  . 
 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in Fig.  3d  shows Pb 4f spectra. There are two main peaks Pb 4f 7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 at 138.0 and 142.8 eV, respectively. We attribute the two small peaks located at 136.4 and 141.3 eV to the presence of metallic Pb (ref. 24). The presence of a substantial amount of atomic Pb is an indication of the existence of iodide vacancies in the perovskite lattice of the control sample. The metallic lead species in the film are likely to act as non-radiative recombination centres which impair solar cell operation. Thus, elimination of the metallic lead content is critical to realize perovskite films of better electronic quality  23  . Interestingly, the atomic Pb peak is greatly reduced in the PMMA-treated films, probably due to a lower level of iodide vacancies in the crystal lattice of the PMMA-treated films. A lower level of Pb defects can reduce the non-radiative recombination and increase the PL lifetime, in line with the TRPL results. 
 Conclusion In conclusion, we introduce a method for preparing perovskite films of high electronic quality and implement it for the fabrication of PSC with an excellent performance and certified PCE attaining 21%. Future development of the method will enable further performance gains. 
 Methods 
 Solar cell preparation. A 30 nm TiO 2 blocking layer was deposited on the pre-cleaned FTO (NSG) by spray pyrolysis using O 2 as the carrying gas at 450 • C from a precursor solution of 0.6 ml titanium diisopropoxide and 0.4 ml bis(acetylacetonate) in 7 ml anhydrous isopropanol. A 150 nm mesoporous TiO 2 layer was coated on the substrate by spin-coating at a speed of 4,500 r.p.m. for 10 s with a ramp of 3,000 r.p.m. s -1 , from a diluted 30 nm particle paste (Dyesol) in ethanol (the weight ratio of TiO 2 (Dyesol paste) and ethanol is 1:6), then the substrates was sintered at 500 • C for 20 min. The perovskite film was deposited by spin-coating onto the TiO 2 substrate. The [(FAI) 0.81 (PbI 2 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 ] precursor solution was prepared in a glovebox from 1.35M Pb 2+ (PbI 2 and PbBr 2 ) in a mixed solvent of DMF, NMP and DMSO (where the molar ratio of DMF/DMSO is 5:1, and the molar ratio of Pb 2+ /[(DMSO) 0.8 (NMP) 0.2 ] is 1:1). The spin-coating procedure was done in a dry air flow in a glove box at a spin-coating speed of 6,500 r.p.m. for 30 s. At 15 s before the last spin-coating step, PMMA solution with different concentrations from the mixed solvent of chlorobenzene and toluene (volume ratio of chlorobenzene and toluene is 9:1) was pipetted onto the substrate. Thereafter, the substrate was put onto a hotplate for 1 h at 100 • C. After cooling down to room temperature, the solution with the hole-transporting material spiro-OMeTAD was deposited on top by spin-coating. The spin-coating procedure was done in a dry air flow in a glove box at a spin-coating speed of 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The spiro-OMeTAD solutions were prepared dissolving the spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 60 mM, with the addition of 30 mM bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide from a stock solution in acetonitrile, 200 mM of tert-butylpyridine. Finally, 80 nm of gold was deposited by thermal evaporation using a shadow mask to pattern the electrodes. Characterization. Current-voltage characteristics were recorded by applying an external potential bias to the cell while recording the generated photocurrent with a digital sourcemeter (Keithley Model 2400). The light source was a 450-W xenon lamp (Oriel) equipped with a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter (Praezisions Glas and Optik GmbH) to match the emission spectrum of the lamp to the CFigure 1 | 1 Figure 1 | Device structure and performance. a, A coloured high-resolution cross-section SEM image of a complete solar cell fabricated by the PTNG method, where a smooth and compact perovskite capping layer fully covers the mesoporous TiO 2 layer (mp-TiO 2 ) infiltrated with perovskite.

 , Anders Hagfeldt 2 and Michael Grätzel 1 * The past several years have witnessed the rapid emergence of a class of solar cells based on mixed organic-inorganic halide perovskites. Today's state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employ various methods to enhance nucleation and improve the smoothness of the perovskite films formed via solution processing. However, the lack of precise control over the crystallization process creates a risk of forming unwanted defects, for example, pinholes and grain boundaries. Here, we introduce an approach to prepare perovskite films of high electronic quality by using poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as a template to control nucleation and crystal growth. We obtain shiny smooth perovskite films of excellent electronic quality, as manifested by a remarkably long photoluminescence lifetime. We realize stable PSCs with reproducibility showing a power conversion e ciency (PCE) of up to 21.6% and a certified PCE of 21.02% under standard AM 1.5G reporting conditions.
