Experimental section 
 Chemicals The commercial chemical materials used were listed as follows: acetone (AR Beijing Chemical Works), ethanol (AR Beijing Chemical Works), isopropanol (99.99%, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), SnO 2 colloid precursor (Alfa Aesa, tin(IV) oxide, 15% in H 2 O colloidal dispersion), Aminomethane (CP Beijing Chemical Works), Hydrogen iodide (57%, Alfa Aesar), PbI 2 (99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich), N,N-dimethylformamide (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), dimethyl sulfoxide (AR Beijing Chemical Works), isopropanol (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), spiro-OMeTAD (Lumtec), and ITO substrates (Shanghai B-Tree Tech. Consult.). 
 Perovskite precursor solution preparation The methylammonium iodide (MAI), methylammonium iodide (MACl), methylammonium iodide (MABr) and formamidine iodide (FAI) were dissolved in isopropanol (IPA) at a concentration of 70 mg/mL and PbI 2 was dissolved in DMF at a concentration of 500 mg/mL (in a mixture of DMF and DMSO (12:1, v/v). 
 Solar cell device fabrication The ITO substrate was sequentially washed with distilled water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol. Then treated using UV/O 3 for 30 min. The ETL was subsequently coated on ITO
30 min in air. Then the perovskite films fabrication began with the PbI 2 which was spin coated on ITO/SnO 2 with 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 70 C for 20 min in nitrogen glovebox. After the PbI 2 coated substrates cooling to room temperature (25 C) in nitrogen glovebox, mixed organic cation solution was spin coated with 3000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 150 C for 15 min in air. Then the HTM solution was deposited by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The HTM solution, spiro-OMeTAD, doped with 4-tert-butylpyridine and lithium bis (trifluoromethylsulphonyl) imide in ACN in chlorobenzene. Finally, the device was finished by thermal evaporation of Au (100nm) under vacuum. 
 Characterization One dimensional X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra was obtained by using Rigaku D/MAX 2400 diffractometer with Cu K˛ radiation. A cold field-emission scanning electron microscope equipment (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) was adopted to characterize top view morphology of perovskite thin films with different MA ratio. Two-dimensional synchrotron radiation grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) were performed at BL14B beamline, Shanghai synchrotron Radiation Facility with a wavelength of 0.6887 Å to analyze the crystallinity and orientation within the perovskite films. 2D GIWAXS data were acquired by using a MarCCD with a distance c.a. 450mm from the samples. PL testing was based on the FLS980 (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd) with an excitation at 470 nm. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the samples was obtained by an UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer (UV-vis DRS, Japan Hitachi UH4150). The J-V characteristics of photovoltaic devices were measured by using a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated sunlight from an Oriel 300 solar simulator. The effective area of cells discussed in this work was 0.102 cm 2 defined by a mask and the light intensity was calibrated by means of a KG-5 reference silicon solar cell. The IV curve for SCLC measurements was performed with the Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system in the dark and room temperature. The top of perovskite films was deposited 100 nm Au to form the hole-only device. The transient photovoltage or photocurrent (TPV or TPC) decay measurements were obtained by using a pulsed double frequency Nd:YAG laser (Brio, 20 Hz), at 532 nm with an ultra-low light intensity and a sub-nanosecond resolved digital oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO 7104) with input impedances of 1 MW and 50 W, respectively. The dynamics curves were recorded on a digital oscilloscope at a 50-Ω (short-circuit condition for TPC) resistor and a mega Ω (opencircuit condition for TPV). 
 Calculation The bulk and surface calculations were performed using the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method, as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.  [1]  The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) formulated by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof   (PBE) was chosen as the exchange-correlation functional.  [2]  The plane-wave cut-off energy was set to 500 eV. Considering the molecular-rotation-induced uncertainties of organic MA and FA, we use Rb and Cs to replace them in order to further simplify the model following previous reported method.  [3]  Cs 0.5 Rb 0.5 PbI 3 was modeled using the 2×2×2 supercell (40 atoms). The k-point meshes of 5×5×1 and 3×3×1 were used in the calculations of PbI 2termiated surfaces for the CsPbI 3 , RbPbI 3 , and Cs 0.5 Rb 0.5 PbI 3 , respectively (see Figure  S1 ). About 15 Å vacuum was added on the top of the slab surface to minimize the interaction between the adjacent slabs. During the structural relaxation, the innermost three atomic layers were fixed at their bulk values, while the other layers were well optimized under sufficient convergence criteria (0.01 eV/Å). The surface energy (E surf ) was calculated on the basis of the bond cleaving and surface relaxation approach,  [4]  following the Equation S1. ( ) ( ) (1) where E cl is bond-cleaving energy and E rel (t) is surface-relaxation energy of a slab with t termination. A detailed explanation for E cl and E rel can be found in the literature.  [5]  Table  S1  The calculated surface energy of PbI 2 -termiated (  001 ) and (  111              A Thermodynamically Favored Crystal Orientation in Mixed Formamidinium/Methylammonium Perovskite for Efficient Solar Cells Ziqi Xu, Zonghao Liu, Nengxu Li, Gang Tang, Guanhaojie Zheng, Cheng Zhu,  Yihua Chen, Ligang Wang, Yuan Huang, Liang Li, Ning Zhou, Jiawang Hong,  Qi Chen, and Huanping Zhou* DOI: 10.1002/adma.201900390 In the past few years, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been widely investigated and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) rocket-boosted from 3.8% to 23.7%,  [1]  originating from the excellent properties of perovskite materials such as appropriate and adjustable bandgap, high absorption coefficient, good charge carrier mobility, long carrier diffusion length, low recombination rate, and high tolerance of chemical defects.  [2]  Among various compositions, hybrid organic-inorganic PSCs based on mixed-cation formamidinium/methylammonium (FA/MA) perovskites have been attractive not only due to higher efficiency, but also better thermal stability, higher phase stability and more robust long-term stability than the FA cation or MA cation only counterparts.  [3]  For instance, MA cation only perovskite, i.e., MAPbI 3 , has a very low tetragonal-to-cubic phase transformation temperature of about 60 °C. FA Crystal orientation has a great impact on the properties of perovskite films and the resultant device performance. Up to now, the exquisite control of crystal orientation (the preferred crystallographic planes and the crystal stacking mode with respect to the particular planes) in mixed-cation perovskites has received limited success, and the underlying mechanism that governs device performance is still not clear. Here, a thermodynamically favored crystal orientation in formamidinium/methylammonium (FA/MA) mixed-cation perovskites is finely tuned by composition engineering. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the FA/MA ratio affects the surface energy of the mixed perovskites, leading to the variation of preferential orientation consequently. The preferable growth along the (001) crystal plane, when lying parallel to the substrates, affects their charge transportation and collection properties. Under the optimized condition, the mixed-cation perovskite (FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl)) solar cells deliver a champion power conversion efficiency over 21%, with a certified efficiency of 20.50 ± 0.50%. The present work not only provides a vital step in understanding the intrinsic properties of mixed-cation perovskites but also lays the foundation for further investigation and application in perovskite optoelectronics. cation only perovskite, i.e., FAPbI 3 , can be easily transformed from a black photo-active perovskite cubic phase to an undesirable yellow photo-inactive nonperovskite hexagonal phase at room temperature.  [4]  As promising candidates to replace MA or FA only perovskites, mixed FA/MA cation perovskites have been widely studied from the perspective of: 1) bandgap tuning;  [4a,5]  2) thermal stability;  [4]  3) phase stability;  [4a,6]  4) morphology,  [7]  leading to the optimized film property and device performance. Apart from the above macroscopic properties, the microstructure of the mixed perovskites especially for the preferred orientation, shows great influence on the properties of charge carrier, such as the recombination, diffusion length, mobilities,  [8]  etc, and the charge transfer at the interfaces.  [9]  Fortunately, the preferred crystal orientation is also expected to be tuned by the MA/FA composition engineering, however, an exquisite control and systematic investigation on the crystal orientation are required to better understand the origin of the crystal orientation and its impacts on optoelectronic properties.  [10]  Efforts were documented to reveal the origin of the crystal orientation, where MAPbI 3 , FAPbI 3 , and MA/FA mixed perovskite were examined intuitively. Take the tetragonal MAPbI 3based perovskite film for example, it was observed that the diffraction intensity along (  110 ) or (  112 ) direction was substantially increased, by employing a facile one-step roll-imprinting method,  [11]  or thermal-gradient-assisted directional crystallization method.  [10]  For the FAPbI 3 perovskite film, the diffraction intensity along (001) direction was substantially increased in most case, as a result of its cubic phase. With respect to MA/FA mixed perovskites, a preferred orientation along (100) and excellent crystallinity were obtained through Sn doping,  [12]  Br doping,  [13]  or the templating effect associated to the specific beneath layer.  [14]  Besides, a preferred orientation along (021) or (012) in mixed FA/MA perovskite film could be achieved by altering organic cation concentration,  [15]  or meniscus-assisted solution printing strategy.  [16]  These suggested that a delicate control of crystal orientation of perovskite was a promising way to modulate the properties of mixed FA/MA cation perovskite films and device performance. However, most of the studies failed to explore the origin of the preferable crystal orientation in FA/MA mixed perovskites. Only recently, a versatile x(FA-PbI 2 )-(1-x)(3MAI-PbCl 2 ) precursor was proven to be able to grow highly oriented perovskite films, which was attributed to the effect from the formation of chlorine-containing intermediates during a topotactic transformation, which was kinetically controlled.  [17]  Still, it is of considerable interest to explore the preferred crystal orientation in the context of thermodynamics, and its effect on film quality and device performance of mixed FA/MA cation perovskites. Different from the impact of kinetics, we systematically investigated the crystal orientation of mixed FA/MA cation perovskites fabricated through a two-step interdiffusion method via composition engineering, and illuminated an unexplored preferred crystal orientation controlled by thermodynamics. The combination of experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicated that the change in the surface energy of FA/MA mixed-cation perovskites was primarily account for the preferable crystal orientation. By systematically investigating the effect of composition engineering on the structure, morphology, crystal orientation and optoelectronic properties of perovskites, we found that the preferable growth along (001) crystallographic plane with 90° azimuth angle, significantly improved their charge transportation and collection properties in the resultant devices. With an optimized composition, the relevant PSCs achieved a PCE over 21%, with a certified efficiency of 20.50%. Here, we fabricated perovskite film by a modified two-step inter-diffusion method.  [18]  First, the lead iodide (PbI 2 ) precursor solution was prepared by dissolving PbI 2 in a mixture of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), where the latter acted as Lewis base to interact with PbI 2 , and thereby control the morphology of the resultant perovskite thin films.  [19]  And then the mixed organic cations precursor solutions were made by dissolving different ratios of formamidine iodide (FAI), methylammonium iodide (MAI), methylammonium bromide (MABr), and methylammonium chloride (MACl) in isopropanol (IPA), where all these components were frequently used to fabricate highly efficient PSCs.  [20]  We intentionally controlled the composition of FA 1-x MA x Pb(I,Br,Cl) 3 perovskites by increasing the concentration of MAI while decreasing the concentration of FAI in the mixed-cation precursor solution without varying precursor concentration and ratio of I, Br, and Cl. The Br and Cl concentration did not increase in the films, as MABr and MACl in the processor solution were fixed. The small amount of MACl was considered to have negligible impact on the perovskite crystal structure, but probably playing a role of optimizing the optoelectronic characteristics for high performance.  [1c]  We accordingly used FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) to denote the chemical formula of perovskite with different MA ratios in this study. The molar ratio of MA and (MA+FA) in the mixed organic cation precursor solution, defined as MA ratio (x), was adjusted from 0.13 to 0.65 for further investigation. The detailed fabrication of perovskite films could be found in the Experimental Section in the Supporting Information. We first investigated the influence of composition engineering on the film quality from the perspective of crystallography. Figure  1  shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the obtained FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskite films with different FA/MA ratios. It was observed that the major peaks of perovskite films were mainly located at 13.98°, 24.36°, 28.20°, and 31.63° that were assigned to (001), (  111 ), (002), and (012) crystal planes of cubic perovskite, respectively. All the perovskite films exhibited black perovskite phase rather than yellow phase, regardless of the varied ratios of FA/MA, which further suggested that the introduction of MA into FAPbI 3 could stabilize its black phase.  [6]  In addition, a slightly shift of the (  001 ), (111), and (002) peaks to higher 2θ value was also observed in the films with higher MA ratios, as shown in Figure  S2  in the Supporting Information, which was likely due to that the substitution of FA + with smaller MA + could shrink the crystal lattice. The difference in full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of all the three crystal planes was negligible with MA ratio increased, as shown in Figure  S3  in the Supporting Information, indicating the comparable crystal size in all samples. To further explore the influence of composition on crystals orientation, we checked the ratios of peak intensity, i.e., (002)/ (001), (  111 )/(001), (  111 )/(002) for FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) films as shown in Figure  1b . It was found that the peak intensity ratio of (002)/(001) almost remained unchanged, and the absolute intensity of both peaks gradually increased upon the MA ratio increasing, indicative of the better crystallinity of the film. In contrast, by increasing the MA ratio from 0.13 to 0.65, the peak intensity ratios of (  111 )/(  001 ) and (  111 )/(002) varied from 1.1 and 1.7, respectively, to almost 0. This observation indicated an apparent preferable growth along (  001 ) and (  002 ) crystallographic planes for mixed FA/MA cation perovskite by increasing the MA ratio. Furthermore, we calculated the microstrain in our perovskite films by analyzing the FWHM in the diffraction patterns according to the modified Williamson-Hall method.  [21]  As shown in Figure  1c , the microstrain in perovskite films decreased with the increase of MA ratio. We confirmed that the introduction of smaller MA + ions into FAPbI 3 could release the lattice strain to enhance phase stability, which was in agreement with previous report.  [22]  To further assess the crystal microstructure of above FA/ MA mixed-cation perovskite samples, especially the crystal orientations in multiple orders,  [23]  we used 2D synchrotron radiation grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement (Figure  2a-h ). As shown in Figure  2a -h, the bright rings at q = 10, 17, and 20 nm -1 (where q was the scattering vector, q = 4π sin θ/λ) were the diffraction patterns for (001), (111), and (002) crystal planes, respectively. The red color regions indicated strong diffraction signals for corresponding crystal planes with a preferred orientation and the light blue colored regions indicated a relative weak diffraction intensity for corresponding crystal planes. It was clearly observed that the diffraction intensities of preferred planes, including both (  001 ) and (  002 ), varied significantly with different MA ratios, according to Figure  2a -h. To better visualize and compare the difference, we calculated the intensity of different crystal planes along different azimuth angles exhibited in GIWAXS, as shown in Figure  3a  and Figure  S4  in the Supporting Information. It was confirmed that the intensity of (001) plane was much higher than those of (  002 ) and (  111 ) plane. Apparently, by increasing MA ratio from 0.13 to 0.57, the intensity of (001) plane was enhanced accordingly, suggesting that crystallization of the crystallographic plane along (001) plane was strengthened. It is noteworthy that a dramatic increase occurred when we enhanced the MA ratio from 0.38 to 0.43. Besides, the intensity of (002) crystal plane also showed an increasing trend promoted by MA ratio enhancement. This GIWAXS result was consistent with XRD result shown in Figure  1b . While further increasing the MA ratio over 0.57, the intensity of (001) plane decreased, which was slightly different from XRD results, as would be discussed later. Nevertheless, the intensity of (111)/(001) remained decreased upon MA ratio increasing in the range of interest, from 0.13 to 0.65 (Figure  3a ). It confirmed the  preferred facet orientation along (001) crystal plane could be achieved by tuning the MA/FA ratio in mixed perovskites. We further attempted to assess the variation of the crystal plane stacking pattern with respect to a certain crystallographic plane in FA/MA perovskite film. Here, the GIWAXS pattern azimuthally along the ring at q = 10 nm -1 in Figure  2 , which was assigned to (001) plane, the dominant diffraction peak of corresponding perovskite structure, was considered as an example. It was observed clearly that when the MA ratio was increasing from 0.13 to 0.65, the stacking patterns changed distinctly. As shown in Figure  3c , with MA ratios from 0.13 to 0.38, the diffraction ring displayed three peaks at around 37°, 90°, and 143°, indicating a relatively disordered stacking as from their identical peak intensities. When the ratio of MA was increased, the peak intensity located at azimuth angle 90° increased significantly, while the intensities of the other two peaks (around 37° and 143°) decreased accordingly. In particular, when MA ratio was increased to 0.43, the diffraction mottling at the azimuth angle of 90° became overwhelming, with other two peaks disappeared. This suggested the occurrence of preferred facet orientation of (001) crystal plane dominantly stack along the face-up direction and also indicated an enhanced long-range crystallinity of perovskite film. The possible crystal stacking pattern of the presented hybrid perovskite materials was illustrated in Figure  3e . This preferred crystal orientation would benefit charge transport process and consequently device performance, as would be discussed later.  [9b,10,17]  We also tried to explore the underlying mechanism for the growth of perovskite films with strengthened preferred crystal orientation induced by MA/FA ratios, which had not been explored. From thermodynamics point of view, we examined the surface energy with respect to the corresponding crystallographic planes to understand whether it impacted the crystal orientation in mixed FA/MA cation perovskites. The surface energies of (  001 ) and (111) planes of perovskites with formula of FAPbI 3 , MAPbI 3 , and FA 0.5 MA 0.5 PbI 3 were evaluated based on DFT calculations (see details in Supporting Information). We simplified the model by using single halide I, as all the mixed perovskite films having the same ratio of Br/I/Cl. The calculation results are shown in Figure  3b  and Table  S1  in the Supporting Information, which are further illustrated in Figure  3d . It was found that when we introduced the MA + cation into FAPbI 3 perovskite, the surface energy of (001) plane was significantly reduced. This decrease indicated the (001) planes were more energetically favorable during crystal growth. It was also in agreement with the above XRD and  GIWAXS results, which indicated that MA incorporation in the FA + -based perovskite could facilitate the crystal growth in (001) plane and thus assisted preferred orientation. However, when the ratio of MA was close to 1, this energy was gradually increased as compared to the lowest surface energy at certain MA ratio. This also supported the mentioned opposite trend of intensity variation with respect to (001) plane by increasing MA ratio over 0.57, as displayed in GIWAXS study (Figure  3a ). In addition, we also derived the surface energy ratio of (  001 )/(111), as shown by the blue line (Figure  3b ). It was observed that this ratio kept deceasing, even the MA ratio was increased to 1. The decreased surface energy ratio of (  001 )/(111) further suggested that the (001) plane became an energetically favorable plane when compared with (111) plane. The results implied that an appropriate ratio of MA incorporation in the FA + based perovskite could promote the crystal growth along (001) plane. This further pointed out that the preferred orientation in the perovskite film was primarily governed by the surface energy, which was controlled by thermodynamics. This was also confirmed that the facilitated grain growth along (001) direction presented in the perovskite films with desired FA/MA ratio during the entire crystallization (Figure  S5 , Supporting Information). The reduction of surface energy by MA incorporation is speculated to be related to the following three aspects: 1) Planar density of atoms: The cation radius of MA + (2.17 Å) is smaller than that of FA + (2.53 Å). According to Bragg's law 2d sin θ = nλ,  [24]  compared to the larger FA + , the smaller MA + ion is more likely to facilitate (001) plane with higher planar density, which leading to a stabilized crystal structure. 2) Crystal symmetry: The tetragonal MAPbI 3 , in contrast to isotropic and symmetrical cubic FAPbI 3 crystal,  [25]  might have a decreased tendency to grow along [111] direction.  [4b]  Thus, the incorporation MA-into FA-based perovskite may effectively facilitate the preferred orientation along (001) plane. 3) Orbital interaction: The partial substitution of FA + with smaller cation MA + would reduce cubo-octahedral volume and thus increase the orbital interaction between Pb and I atoms and modify the local structure of perovskite.  [26]  Specifically, it would adjust the degree of [PbI 6 ] octahedral tilting and induce FA + cation orientation change.  [26b,27]  All these effects may collectively contribute to the increased crystallinity and strengthened preferred orientation in perovskite. Furthermore, the preferred (001) orientation would favor the transport of charge carrier in the bulk perovskite and across the interfaces. The perovskite thin films are anisotropic, and the effective mass of the materials varies obviously with respect to the crystal orientation space axes. Notably, the electron effective mass shows the smallest value along the Z-direction, which is perpendicular to the perovskite (001) plane, suggesting that the most efficient electron transport occurs along the [001] direction in the perovskite film.  [9b]  With respect to charge transport at perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD interface, there is a large electrostatic potential increase and preferential holes distribution at the interface of Spiro-OMeTAD and perovskite along (001) preferred orientation, attracting more holes than electrons and yielding stronger electronic cloud overlapping, which benefits interfacial electron-hole pair dissociation and enhance the efficiency of hole transfer.  [9a]  Furthermore, the re-arrangement of the orientation along the face-up direction (azimuth angle 90°) could also enlarge the effective contact area between (001) plane of perovskite film and carrier transport layers, which could be beneficial for the charge extraction process. Therefore, the combination of preferred growth over (001) planes, and crystal stacking mode with respect to (001) plane were expected to lead to improved device performance, as discussed later. To further investigate whether the introduction of MA + into FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) affected other film qualities, e.g. morphology, coverage and grain size, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed. Figure  4a-h  show the top view SEM images of all the FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskite films with different MA ratios. It was observed that all films were uniform, highly crystalline with almost similar compact texture. Moreover, we compared the grain sizes of all the films, as shown in Figure  S6a  in the Supporting Information. It was found that all the FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskite films showed nearly identical statistic grain size. Besides, we measured the thickness of perovskite films with different MA ratios, as illustrated in Figure  S6b  in the Supporting Information, which did not show any obvious variation. This observation ruled out the apparent film morphological influence on the resulting film quality, and also suggested that the grain size of the FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskite films here was not the key factor that would possibly govern the device performance. Apart from above crystal and morphology properties, we further investigated the influence of introduction of MA + into the FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskites on their optoelectronic properties. As shown in Figure  4i , the ultraviolet-visible (UVvis) spectra showed a 20 nm blueshift upon increasing the ratio of MA in perovskite films from 0.13 to 0.65. This indicated the bandgap increased from 1.51 to 1.54 eV obtained in Figure  4i . The normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskite thin films are also presented in Figure  4j . Accordingly, a blueshift of the emission peak of the FA 1-x MA x PbI 2.87 Br 0.13 (Cl) perovskites was observed upon increasing the ratio of MA, which derived from the substitution of FA + with MA + in the perovskite lattice.  [6]  In addition, we further checked the Urbach energy (Eu) of the perovskite films with different MA ratios, which would probe the sharp onset of absorption at the direct bandgap, exhibiting significant information about disorders in shallow energy level.  [28]  As shown in Figure  S7  in the Supporting Information, we observed a consistent decrease of Eu values with MA ratio increase to 0.43, which indicated a smaller degree of electronic disorder at the band edge. This variation trend of Eu value obtained was in good agreement with the exhibited preferred orientation by increasing MA ratio, suggesting that the preferred orientation of perovskite film could reduce the disorder and benefit the charge transportation and device performance we exhibited below. Furthermore, we estimated the carrier lifetime of fresh perovskite films with different MA ratios by using time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. All the TRPL spectra of perovskite films could be fitted by biexponential decays (as shown in Figure  S8a , Supporting Information) and the corresponding lifetimes and diffusion lengths were summarized in Table  S2  in the Supporting Information, according to the calculation method.  [29]  The perovskite film with 0.43 MA ratio showed the longest PL lifetime and diffusion length, suggesting that the preferred orientation could effectively suppress the trap-assisted recombination in the bulk and the surface. We further investigated the quenching effect of different perovskite films with electron-transport layer (ETL) SnO 2 , and hole-transport layer (HTL) Spiro-OMeTAD. Similarly, all the TRPL spectra could be fitted by biexponential decays (as shown in Figure  S8b ,c in the Supporting Information) and the corresponding lifetimes and diffusion lengths  [30]  are summarized in Tables  S3  and S4  in the Supporting Information. It was found that the 0.43 MA ratio perovskite film/ SnO 2 sample showed the shortest average PL lifetime (τ avg ), indicating the best carrier extraction capability from perovskite to ETL. For perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD samples case, 0.43 MA ratio perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD sample showed an obvious quenching effect and respectable hole diffusion length. Overall, 0.43 MA ratio perovskite film was considered with excellent carrier extraction capability at both ETL and HTL interfaces, indicating that the preferred orientation could effectively facilitate the carrier extraction. To reveal how crystal orientation of perovskites with different MA ratios in this work interfered the device performance of solar cells, we fabricated devices with configuration of ITO/SnO 2 /perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au as illustrated in the cross-sectional SEM images in Figure  S9  in the Supporting Information. All fabrication details could be found in Supporting Information. The photovoltaic parameters of PSCs with different MA ratios are shown in Figure  5a  and Figure  S10a-c  in the Supporting Information. Remarkably, the PCEs increased with the MA ratios varied from 0.13 to 0.43, and decreased when further increasing MA ratios from 0.43 to 0.65. Also, the open-circuit voltage (V oc ), short-circuit current density (J sc ) and fill factor (FF) had similar variation trend with PCEs. These changes were consistent with the variation trend of (111)/(001) crystal planes intensity ratio when MA ratio was lower than 0.43. When MA ratio was larger than 0.43, the performance decreased originated from deteriorated optoelectronic properties as discussed later. It had been reported that the spatial heterogeneity of perovskite polycrystalline could significantly affect J sc and V oc of the resulting solar cell devices due to the fact that anisotropic distribution of trap states was orientation dependent.  [8c]  Besides, the mobility of perovskite films is also closely related to the crystal texture, especially the crystal orientation.  [31]  Here, we speculate that the enhanced device performance for MA ratio of 0.43 case mainly originated from the preferable growth along (001) crystalline plane and face-up crystal stacking. This preferred crystal orientation would lead to enhanced long-range crystallinity which was beneficial for the charge transportation across the perovskite bulk layer and also the charge collection at the perovskite/charge selective layer interfaces.  [9b]  Interestingly, the PCEs decreased for the MA ratio larger than 0.43, indicating that the smaller increase of intensity ratio of (001)/(111) crystal planes mentioned above had less impact on device performance of solar cells. This would be explained by the superior intrinsic properties of FAPbI 3 than MAPbI 3 , such as longer carrier lifetime, higher mobility, and larger ion movement barrier for higher performance.  [32]  Therefore, we suggested that preferable growth along (001) crystalline plane with the proper MA ratio around 0.43 would improve the performance of devices. To further confirm the effect of preferred crystal orientation on the charge carrier dynamic within the devices, we carried out transient photovoltage decay (TPV) and transient photocurrent decay (TPC) measurements on the PSCs, and the results are shown in Figure  S11  in the Supporting Information. It was found that the lifetime for device with MA ratio of 0.43 was longer than those for other devices with rest MA ratios. This suggested a substantially suppressed recombination in this perovskite absorber with MA ratio of 0.43, which was consistent with its higher V oc than other cases (Figure  S10a , Supporting Information). It was also observed that the device with MA ratio of 0.43 showed a faster photocurrent decay than devices based on other MA ratios. This observation confirmed that the MA ratio of 0.43 based device possessed a much more efficient charge transportation process, leading to a higher output photocurrent, which was consistent with the higher Jsc than other cases (Figure  S10b , Supporting Information). The better performance on TPV and TPC results with 0.43 MA ratio was probably caused by the preferred orientation that enabled improved carrier flow between perovskite and carrier transport layers, while proper MA ratio (not too high as 0.57) would take advantage of the high carrier mobility of FAPbI 3 . In addition, to further study the charge transportation and charge recombination behavior in the devices, we conducted electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. As shown in Figure  S12  in the Supporting Information, all devices showed a semicircle feature in the Nyquist plots, which were ascribed to the transport resistance of the devices.  [33]  It was observed that the device based on perovskite with the appropriate MA ratio (0.43) showed almost the lowest transport resistance, which further supported that the preferable orientation and proper MA ratio could benefit the charge transport process, leading to the J sc enhancement. Meanwhile, we also calculated the defects density and chargecarrier mobility of perovskite films with different MA ratios from space change limited current (SCLC) measurements as shown in Figure  S13  in the Supporting Information. The perovskite films with MA ratio of 0.43 showed the lowest defects density of 9.2 × 10 14 cm -3 , which was at most 10 times lower than the other perovskites, e.g. with 2.3 × 10 16 cm -3 of 0.2 MA ratio. As discussed above, the reduced defects density was ascribed to that a highly preferred orientation with enhanced long-range crystallinity would reduce the probability of defects formation. Meanwhile, the perovskite with MA ratio of 0.43 also exhibited the highest charge-carrier mobility (0.122 cm 2 V -1 s -1 ) than other cases. This improved carrier mobility would also originate from the preferred orientation with enhanced long-range crystallinity enabled a fast charge transport path facilitating the charge transportation, while proper MA ratio (around 0.43) would benefit from the high carrier mobility of FAPbI 3 . Given the above, the improved conductivity combined with suppressed recombination guaranteed an effective carrier transportation and collection in the devices enabled such improved device  performance. These results also further confirmed that a preferential crystal orientation in perovskite films induced by MA incorporation could benefit device performance enhancement. Accordingly, the champion device with MA ratio of 0.43 achieved a best PCE of 21.21% under reverse scan and 20.26% under forward scan, as shown in Figure  5b . One of our devices with MA ratio of 0.43 also achieved a certified efficiency of 20.50 ± 0.50% (Figure  S14 -S18, Supporting Information). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) is shown in Figure  5c , exhibiting an integrated Jsc of 23.7 mA cm -2 , which was in good agreement with the J-V measurements. In addition, the device also showed a stabilized PCE exceeding 20.3% in Figure  5d , which was in good agreement with the J-V scans. In Figure  S10d  in the Supporting Information, we also compared the hysteresis of devices by presenting the Hysteresis-index (H-index) defined as the previous work.  [34]  All the devices with three different MA ratios showed relative low H-index, indicating that hysteresis could be also suppressed by fine tuning the orientation of the perovskites. In summary, we systematically investigated the crystal orientation of mixed FA/MA perovskites fabricated through a two-step interdiffusion method via composition engineering. We also illuminated the origin of preferred crystal orientation from the perspective of thermodynamics by DFT calculation, where the reduction of surface energy for FA/MA mixed-cation perovskites results in the preferable crystal orientation. To our best understanding, this is the first study that reveals the origin for the thermodynamically favored crystal orientation in mixed FA/MA cation perovskites. By systematically investigating the effect of composition engineering on perovskite crystal structure, morphology, bandgap, and crystal orientation, we found that the preferable growth along (001) crystal plane, as well as the face-up crystal stacking of the perovskite crystals significantly affected the charge transportation and collection properties within the devices. With the optimized composition, the mixed-cation PSCs achieved a PCE over 21% and a certificated efficiency of 20.50 ± 0.50% under one sun illumination. It thus sheds light on understanding the intrinsic properties of mixedcation perovskites, which guides further investigation and application in perovskite optoelectronics.
