Recent efforts to reduce these interfacial defects have focused mainly on surface passivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> . However, passivating the perovskite surface that interfaces with the electron-transporting layer is difficult, because the surface-treatment agents on the electron-transporting layer may dissolve while coating the perovskite thin film. Alternatively, interfacial defects may not be a concern if a coherent interface could be formed between the electron-transporting and perovskite layers. Here we report the formation of an interlayer between a SnO 2 electron-transporting layer and a halide perovskite light-absorbing layer, achieved by coupling Cl-bonded SnO 2 with a Cl-containing perovskite precursor. This interlayer has atomically coherent features, which enhance charge extraction and transport from the perovskite layer, and fewer interfacial defects. The existence of such a coherent interlayer allowed us to fabricate perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 25.8 per cent (certified 25.5 per cent)under standard illumination. Furthermore, unencapsulated devices maintained about 90 per cent of their initial efficiency even after continuous light exposure for 500 hours. Our findings provide guidelines for designing defect-minimizing interfaces between metal halide perovskites and electron-transporting layers.</p><p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) consist of α-formamidinium lead tri-iodide (FAPbI 3 ) perovskite sandwiched between charge-separation and charge-transporting layers. The high efficiency of PSCs is achieved by efficient charge extraction and transport without non-radiative recombination at the charge-selective interface with the uniform perovskite layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> . Recombination at interfaces may be reduced by minimizing the interfacial area between the perovskite and charge-transport layers. For smaller interfacial areas, planar electron-transporting layers (ETLs) and coated, very flat perovskite thin films are essential. A planar configuration is also required to achieve excellent charge extraction and transfer at the interface with low interfacial recombination loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . PSCs with planar electrodes have primarily been studied using a SnO 2 ETL, because of the many advantages of SnO 2 , such as a high electron mobility and good energy-level alignment with perovskite and electrodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . SnO 2 for planar PSCs has been deposited using various methods, including thermal oxidation of Sn(iv) isopropoxide <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , deposition of SnO 2 nanoparticles <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , atomic layer deposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and chemical bath deposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . In addition to these methods of depositing SnO 2 electrodes, numerous studies have been conducted to reduce the interfacial recombination losses through surface passivation and to control the energy level and increase charge transport by doping <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</p><p>Interfacial passivation may further reduce non-radiative recombination between the perovskite and charge-transporting layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . Passivation of the perovskite surface with long organic salts has been shown to substantially reduce interfacial defects between the hole-transporting layer (HTL) and FAPbI 3 perovskite <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . SnO x -Cl colloids derived from Sn(iv)Cl 4 solution have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> to form methylammonium tin iodide (MA 2 SnI 6 ) and SnO 2 , with spontaneous exchange reactions between Cl -and I -ions when methylammonium iodide (MAI) co-existed. It has also been reported that a perovskite precursor containing Cl -ions resulted in a large number of Cl -ions being retained at the interface between the perovskite and ETL electrode <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . We thus note that when the halogen-bonded SnO 2 and the perovskite precursor come into contact they form a chemically interconnected interface.</p><p>Here we report the formation of a coherent interlayer between a perovskite thin film and a Cl-bonded SnO 2 (Cl-bSO) electrode coated with a Cl-containing FAPbI 3 perovskite precursor (Cl-cPP) solution. We explore the presence of this interlayer by using the surface-sensitive grazing-incident X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), synchrotron-based grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GI-WAXD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). From these analytical characterizations, we infer the formation of a crystalline FASnCl x phase as an atomically coherent interlayer between the perovskite and SnO 2 . This interlayer between the perovskite and ETL reduces the interfacial charge recombination loss and contact resistance, enabling the fabrication of a PSC with a power conversion efficiency of 25.8%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interlayer formation</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref> depicts multilayered thin films of ETL (n), perovskite (i) and HTL (p), along with an interlayer formed by the reaction between the Cl-cPP solution and a Cl-bSO ETL. Energy levels based on experimental <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> and theoretical (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) values for each component in the n-i-p architecture are also shown. We expected the interlayer to play a part in substantially reducing the back-recombination of extracted carriers that remain in the interfacial region, without greatly disturbing the carrier transport of photogenerated electrons.</p><p>One of the main roles of the ETL on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) is to effectively block the holes generated by light absorption of the perovskite while transferring electrons quickly across the interface between the ETL and perovskite. This means that the ETL must be densely coated to prevent direct contact between the FTO substrate and the perovskite, while maintaining a sufficiently small thickness to prevent direct contact between the ETL and perovskite. Therefore, we deposited a Cl-bSO ETL on FTO, using either spin-coating <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> or chemical bath deposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> after dissolving either SnCl 2 ⋅2H 2 O in ethanol or SnCl 4 in deionized water. In Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, we provide a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a representative device using SnO 2 as the ETL, and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra and X-ray diffraction patterns of perovskites coated on various ETLs.</p><p>We investigated the inclusion of Cl -ions in the SnO 2 layer using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>, the SnO 2 layer coated on the FTO substrate using SnCl 2 ⋅2H 2 O contained a considerable number of residual Cl -ions, consistent with previously reported results <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . In comparison, the TiO 2 thin film, obtained via a similar process using a TiCl 4 aqueous solution, contained a relatively small number of Cl -ions. In the case of SnO 2 , all layers contained a large number of Cl -ions when coated with chlorides as the starting materials (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The large number of Cl -ions found in SnO 2 may be associated with two common oxidation states of Sn (Sn 2+ and Sn 4+ ). Because the Sn 2+ oxidation state is common in SnO 2 , Z is the stacking direction of the multilayer thin film, E is the energy level, E VAC is the electron energy outside the solid surface, E LUMO is the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and E HOMO is the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital. b, Analysis of the Cl -ions in the Cl-bSO (red dash-dotted line) and TiO 2 (blue solid line) electrodes using ToF-SIMS. c, ToF-SIMS depth profiles for the perovskite and Cl-bSO on FTO. d, Simulation of the formation of the interlayer between perovskite and SnO 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Article</head><p>Cl -ions may easily enter the O vacancy sites, and the O sites may also be substituted in some cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . However, in the case of TiO 2 , only Ti 4+ can be stably present, even if it is prepared under conditions in which a large number of Cl -ions are present; Cl -ions may be contained only at the impurity level. Here, Cl-cPP was prepared by dissolving FAPbI 3 with 35 mol% methylammonium chloride (MACl) as a source of Cl - ions and 3.8 mol% methylenediammonium dichloride as an α-FAPbI 3 phase stabilizer. When MACl is added as a source of Cl -ions, it eventually volatilizes and almost disappears from the perovskite, leading to crystallization, grain formation and preferred orientation of the perovskite <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> . The perovskite layer on the Cl-bSO electrode was obtained by spin-coating a Cl-cPP solution and then annealing at 120 °C for 1 h.</p><p>We analysed the residual Cl -ions for the perovskite on SnO 2 ETL via depth profiling using ToF-SIMS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>). We observed a relatively large number of Cl -ions, distributed mainly with a certain thickness near the SnO 2 electrode; the number of Cl -ions that remained in the perovskite was very small. These results suggest the formation of a FASnCl x layer at the interface between the perovskite and the SnO 2 . However, even when a SnO 2 electrode that does not bind with Cl -ions was used, a large number of Cl -ions were detected near the electrode, with a sharper distribution (more distinct in Cl 2 -) near the interface than for Cl-bSO (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). Before experimentally investigating the formation of a new phase between the perovskite and SnO 2 electrodes, we theoretically examined whether the FASnCl x layer at the interface between the SnO 2 ETL and halide perovskite could be formed by an interfacial reaction between Cl-bSO and the Cl-cPP solution. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate the possibility of generating a very stable FASnCl 3 interlayer between FAPbI 3 perovskite and SnO 2 without notable lattice distortion (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). However, when TiO 2 was used as an electrode, a stable interface could not be formed, owing to a large difference in electronegativity between Ti and Sn, even when Cl-binding TiO 2 was used (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). This is related to the easy formation of Sn-based perovskites in the presence of halides and organic cations, such as FA with Sn 2+ (refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterization by grazing-incident XAFS</head><p>To find out whether Cl-bSO is a key factor in the formation of the FAS-nCl x interlayer, we used surface-sensitive grazing-incident XAFS to investigate the vicinity of the interface between SnO 2 and FAPbI 3 perovskite. In the Sn K-edge XAFS analysis, we used a 100-μm-wide vertical beam and a grazing incidence of 0.5° to observe the local geometric environments around Sn atoms at the interface between the ETL and FAPbI 3 perovskite. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref> shows the Fourier-transformed spectra for the pristine Cl-bSO and the Cl-bSO coated with either Cl-cPP or a perovskite precursor without Cl -ions and then annealed at 120 °C for 1 h. The highest peak is indicative of the first nearest-neighbour shell, which corresponds to the O atoms surrounding the central Sn atom. We assign the second-highest peak, which appears at approximately 2.2 Å, to the Sn-Cl chemical bond. This indicates that SnO 2 deposited in the presence of a large number of Cl -ions contained a large number of Cl -ions bound directly to Sn cations. In addition, the peak height corresponding to the Sn-Cl bond substantially increased when the Cl-cPP solution was coated on Cl-bSO and then annealed at 120 °C. The increase in the number of Cl -ions relative to Cl-bSO may be due to the formation of a FASnCl x layer in which FA + and Cl -ions in the Cl-cPP solution combine with Sn-Cl of SnO 2 , increasing the number of Cl -ions bound to Sn. In Cl-bSO coated with a Cl --ion-free perovskite precursor solution and annealed at 120 °C, the Sn-Cl peak shifted to higher r-space by 0.3 Å, which corresponds to the partial formation of the Sn-I bond. Here r and k are the phase-shift-uncorrected interatomic distance from Sn atoms and the photoelectron wavenumber, respectively. This is consistent with a report <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> that the spontaneous exchange with I -ions of MAI occurred when Cl -ions in Cl-bSO prepared by hydrolysis of SnCl 4 came into contact with MAI.</p><p>As a comparison, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref> shows the Fourier-transformed features of Sn K-edge XAFS before and after applying the Cl-cPP solution to pure SnO 2 thin layers derived from isopropanol-dissolved Sn(iv) isopropoxide and commercial SnO 2 colloids on a glass substrate. In both cases, no meaningful peaks for the Sn-Cl chemical bond are visible before or after the Cl-cPP solution was applied to the SnO 2 , as in the above. This implies that the Cl -ions applied on the pure SnO 2 did not cause the formation of Sn-Cl bonds. To better visualize the atomic distributions of the Cl atoms at the interface, we used wavelet-transform XAFS (WT-XAFS) of the correlation between the peaks with k-space data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2c-e</ref>). The spectral comparison of WT-XAFS for Cl-bSO and pure SnO 2 ETL layers clearly shows the local structural change in space at this interface. The highest-intensity lobes in the centre (k = 6 Å -1 , r = 1.6 Å), which are all visible in the WT-XAFS, correspond to the O atoms towards the core ETL layers. At higher radial distances, the lobe (k = 9.6 Å -1 , r = 2.25 Å) is attributed to the Cl atom in the ETL surface region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2c</ref>). When a Cl-cPP solution was applied on Cl-bSO, the lobe caused by the Cl atom appears wide and strong after annealing at 120 °C. By contrast, the WT-XAFS results for the two pure SnO 2 layers are constant irrespective of annealing under a Cl-cPP solution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>). Also, the WT-XAFS results for the application of the Cl --ion-free perovskite precursor clearly show that Sn-I (k = 10.5 Å -1 , r = 2.55 Å) was generated by Cl --I - exchange (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confirmation of the coherent interlayer</head><p>To further confirm the formation of the FASnCl x layer at the interface between SnO 2 and the FAPbI 3 perovskite in contact with Cl-bSO and the Cl-cPP solution, we performed a synchrotron-based GI-WAXD experiment. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>, b shows two-dimensional GI-WAXD patterns at a grazing incidence of 0.12° for the same glass/SnO 2 /FAPbI 3 as the XAFS measurements, using perovskite coated on SnO 2 layers with and without Cl -ions on a glass substrate. The background of the glass substrate was subtracted to make the diffracted image clearer.</p><p>In the two-dimensional GI-WAXD patterns, the perovskite shows very good crystallinity and strong texturing. The crystallinity and texturing of a full-cell perovskite layer more than ten times thicker than the current perovskite layer were reduced substantially (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). Such excellent crystallinity and texturing are believed to correspond to approximately monocrystalline properties in the heterogeneous nucleation and initial growth of perovskite on SnO 2 . Most of the diffraction patterns are in good agreement with results simulated using the diffraction pattern calculator toolkit <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> with a cubic α-FAPbI 3 structure 31 and hexagonal PbI 2 structures 32 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). When comparing the GI-WAXD patterns of perovskites coated on isopropoxide-derived SnO 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>) and Cl-bSO (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>), new diffraction spots elongated in the vertical direction (red dotted rectangles) are clearly observed at the Cl-bSO electrode. The out-of-plane (along the q z direction, where q z is the out-of-plane scattering vector) and in-plane (along the q xy direction, where q xy is the in-plane scattering vector) one-dimensional GI-WAXD profiles (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>) do not match any types of FAPbI 3 or SnO 2 . Considering q z -cut (out-of-plane) and q xy -cut (in-plane) profiles of the elongated diffraction spots, d spacings (λ = 2dsinθ), where λ is wavelength, d is the crystal lattice planar spacing and θ is the angle of incidence, of 3.94 Å and 1.97 Å in the q xy profile and of 5.29 Å and 2.64 Å in the q z profile were obtained for the first and second peaks, respectively. The fact that the d spacing of the second peak is almost twice that of the first peak indicates that both peaks belong to the same family of diffraction planes. These diffraction spots support the idea that the newly formed structure is composed of highly textured crystallites of approximately 2 nm and 8 nm size in the out-of-plane and in-plane directions, respectively, with crystallite size estimated from the diffraction-peak widths using the Scherrer equation. These results suggest the formation of FASnCl 3 or its analogues between the perovskite and the SnO 2 electrode.</p><p>For a more quantitative analysis, we compared the diffraction patterns with previously reported cubic FASnCl 3 (a = 5.69 Å, where a is the lattice constant in the a axis) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . However, the results of GI-WAXD are inconsistent with the cubic structure. On the basis of the GI-WAXD analysis, we infer that the interlayer has a tetragonal structure with a = b = 5.56 Å and c = 5.29 Å (b and c are the lattice constants in the b and c axes), and that the characteristic diffraction peaks observed in the structure belong to the (11l) and (22l) families; (111), ( <ref type="formula">112</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">221</ref>) and (222) diffraction peaks are clearly observed in Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. Given that the interlayer is a thin film that connects the two heterostructures between the perovskite and SnO 2 , it may be more reasonable for the lattice to have a tetragonal structure with a lower symmetry than that of a cubic structure. Nevertheless, we label the interlayer as FASnCl x rather than FASnCl 3 , because it is not fully defined.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3c</ref> shows a HR-TEM image of the vicinity of the interface, which was formed by coupling Cl-bSO and a Cl-cPP solution. The interface between SnO 2 and FAPbI 3 contacted very well, and the boundaries could not be distinguished from each other. We expected this interface to effectively extract the charge generated from the perovskite. To obtain additional information on the crystal properties of each region, we determined the interplanar spacing and fast Fourier transform patterns. The interplanar spacings of about 0.33 nm and 0.37 nm in the region of SnO 2 and FAPbI 3 correspond well with SnO 2 (110) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> and α-FAPbI 3 (111) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> domains, respectively. The interplanar spacing in the interfacial region is smaller than that of α-FAPbI 3 , indicating the presence of a new interlayer.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3d</ref> shows a comparison of the photoluminescence spectra measured by excitation with a 520-nm laser for a thin film annealed at 120 °C after coating a Cl-cPP solution on SnO 2 or TiO 2 electrodes formed using various methods on FTO substrates. The combination of Cl-bSO and Cl-cPP solution exhibited substantially lower photoluminescence intensity than did the planar SnO 2 and planar TiO 2 electrodes, alongside mesoporous TiO 2 (mp-TiO 2 ). Comparing the photoluminescence of the perovskite layer with and without the SnO 2 or TiO 2 electrode on the glass substrate, we found that the photoluminescence of the perovskite coated on the SnO 2 or TiO 2 layer was substantially lower (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>). This reduction in photoluminescence suggests an increase in interfacial non-radiative recombination and/or a decrease in radiative recombination through non-radiative recombination channels (charge transfer to ETLs) of photo-generated electron holes. Interfacial non-radiative recombination of the perovskite layers deposited on SiO 2 (glass), TiO 2 or SnO 2 oxides using the same process does not make much difference because these materials form similar interfacial contacts. Cl-bSO, which forms a unique interlayer with the perovskite even with the same SnO 2 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2c</ref>), further reduces the photoluminescence.   a, Fourier-transformed radial distribution function of Sn K-edge extended XAFS spectra for pristine Cl-bSO (grey) and Cl-bSO coated with Cl-cPP (blue) or a perovskite precursor without Cl -ions (red), followed by annealing at 120 °C for 1 h (a.u., arbitrary units). b, Fourier-transformed features before (red) and after (blue) applying the Cl-cPP solution to the pure SnO 2 thin layers, deposited using Sn-isopropoxide (top) and commercial SnO 2 colloids (bottom). c-e, Normalized WT-XAFS for the correlation between r-space and k-space data for Cl-bSO (c), pure SnO 2 from Sn-isopropoxide (d) and commercial colloidal SnO 2 (e) before and after annealing with Cl-cPP at 120 o C for 1 h.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Article</head><p>We investigated the origin of the reduced photoluminescence through charge recombination by using time-resolved photoluminescence (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10</ref>) to monitor the charge-carrier dynamics of perovskite <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> , with the same specimens used for photoluminescence measurements. We analysed the fast (τ 1 ) and slow (τ 2 ) decay components of the bi-exponential decay function y = a 1 exp(-t/τ 1 ) + a 2 exp(-t/τ 2 ), where a n is the amplitude components and t is the time constant; parameters are listed in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The fast decay component results from trap-assisted charge recombination of the perovskite and free-carrier transport to the electrode. The slow decay component results from radiative charge recombination <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> . The fast decay lifetime is the shortest for Cl-bSO, for which the photoluminescence is the most reduced; the weight fraction of that lifetime is also more pronounced. This implies that the combination of Cl-bSO and Cl-cPP solution not only reduces non-radiative interfacial recombination but also allows photogenerated charges to move to the electrode more rapidly.</p><p>In general, SnO 2 enables faster charge extraction from perovskites owing to a lower conduction band than that of TiO 2 14,24,25 . Nevertheless, it is interesting that a planar TiO 2 electrode containing a small amount of Cl, prepared with an aqueous TiCl 4 solution, exhibited lower photoluminescence intensity than did a planar SnO 2 electrode. Because the difference in the charge extraction of the ETL is related directly to the characteristics of the PSC, we compared the efficiency of all performance parameters (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) and the photostability between the electrodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Photovoltaic performance</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>, the efficiencies, on average, coincided with the intensity trend of the photoluminescence, giving the lowest efficiency for the SnO 2 (isopropoxide) ETL with the highest intensity, and the highest efficiency for the lowest intensity of Cl-bSO. The efficiencies of Cl-bSO and the TiO 2 ETL obtained from chloride compounds did not vary substantially; however, the number of bound Cl -ions was different, and high compared to Cl --ion-free SnO 2 ETLs. Nevertheless, Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref> shows that the stability under the maximum power tracking condition was substantially different. The efficiency of PSCs based on a planar TiO 2 ETL decreased substantially over time, even within an hour, in contrast to those based on Cl-bSO. This indicates that the interfacial binding between the perovskite and electrode in the planar structure had a substantial influence on the stability, rather than being a unique property of TiO 2 , because the mp-TiO 2 electrode exhibited excellent light stability.</p><p>The difference in interfacial bonding is evident from the measurement of the thermally stimulated and dark currents for the PSCs fabricated with planar Cl-bSO and TiO 2 ETL (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). The PSC based on planar Cl-bSO had a very low defect concentration compared to that of the TiO 2 ETL. Because the difference between the PSC prepared with planar Cl-bSO and a TiO 2 ETL is due to only the interface, we conclude that Cl-bSO formed a coherent interface with the perovskite, with fewer defects compared to TiO 2 ETL.</p><p>The importance of this interfacial bonding is supported by the fact that PSCs fabricated using SnO 2 as electrodes, which does not bind Cl -ions, photodegraded faster than PSCs fabricated with a Cl-bSO ETL. Even if an interface with excellent charge extraction and transfer without defects was formed, an electrode with a pinhole-free, uniform and appropriate thickness was required to produce a high-efficiency PSC. Therefore, PSCs were fabricated with Cl-bSO electrodes, obtained by spin-coating either a SnCl 2 ⋅2H 2 O solution dissolved in ethanol <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> PbI 2 (001) t q xy (Å -1 ) or a SnCl 4 solution dissolved in deionized water <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> on a SnO 2 primary layer coated using Cl --ion-free Sn-isopropoxide. In addition, Cl-bSO deposited using chemical bath deposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> was used to fabricate PSCs. Although similar Cl-bSOs were used as the electrodes, the average efficiency of the PSCs varied slightly depending on the coating method (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). A relatively high efficiency was obtained from the Cl-bSO electrode coated with an SnCl 4 -derived SnO 2 colloid and the Cl-bSO electrode formed by chemical bath deposition in an SnCl 2 ⋅2H 2 O aqueous solution.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">q z (Å -1 ) q z (Å -1</formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4c</ref> shows the current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of the reverse and forward bias sweeps with an antireflective film attached to the device surface for one of the best-performing PSCs.

The external quantum efficiency for the one of the best-performing devices is provided in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.

Although we could not identify the exact crystal structure, we believe it functions as a coherent interlayer with rapid charge extraction and minimal charge recombination at the interface between the SnO 2 electrode and the perovskite thin film. This coherent interlayer made it possible to manufacture PSCs with a power conversion efficiency of 25.8% (25.5% certified), with high stability under maximum power point tracking for 500 h. This result may inform the development of new strategies for the fabrication and design of photoelectrodes for PSCs with high efficiency and stability.</p></div>
