<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calculation of Bandgap from Tauc Plot</head><p>The bandgap of perovskite is calculated from the UV-vis data. Tauc et al. introduced the Tauc plot in 1966 to determine the optical bandgap of amorphous germanium. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">1</ref> A linear region can be found in the Tauc plot which indicates the onset of the optical absorption. Therefore, the optical bandgap of the material can be deduced by fitting the x-axis of the linear region. The bandgap is calculated by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">αℎν = B (ℎν-Eg) n ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ (S2)</formula><p>where α is the absorption coefficient, ℎν is the energy of the incident photons, B is a constant depends on the transition probability, n depends on the nature of the transition while n is 1/2 for the direct allowed transitions and 2 for indirect allowed transitions. For perovskite (n = 1/2), we can plot the (αℎν) 2 vs ℎν thus the bandgap can be fitted in a straight-line region to the x-axis, which is 1.50 eV for the perovskite film in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calculation of V OC loss:</head><p>According to Rau's work, the V OC of a solar cell can be described as the equation listed below: 2, 3</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝑉 𝑂𝐶 = 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 𝑞 ln ( 𝐽 𝑆𝐶 𝐽 0 ) ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ (S3)</formula><p>where 𝑞 is element charge, 𝑘 𝐵 is Boltzmann constant, 𝑇 is temperature, J SC is short-circuit current, J 0 is dark saturation current. The expressions of J SC and J 0 are given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝐽 𝑆𝐶 = 𝑞 ∫ 𝐸𝑄𝐸 𝑃𝑉 (𝐸)𝜙 𝐴𝑀1.5 (𝐸) 𝑑𝐸 ∞ 0 ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ (S4) 𝐽 0 = 𝑞 𝐸𝑄𝐸 𝐸𝐿 ∫ 𝐸𝑄𝐸 𝑃𝑉 (𝐸)𝜙 𝐵𝐵 (𝐸) 𝑑𝐸 ∞ 0 ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ (S5) 𝜙 𝐵𝐵 (𝐸) = 2𝜋𝐸 2 ℎ 3 𝑐 2 1 exp( 𝐸 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 )-1 ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ (S6)</formula><p>where 𝐸𝑄𝐸 𝑃𝑉 is photovoltaic external quantum efficiency, 𝐸𝑄𝐸 𝐸𝐿 is electroluminescence external quantum efficiency, 𝜙 𝐴𝑀1.5 is solar cell radiative spectrum, 𝜙 𝐵𝐵 is black-body radiative spectrum, 𝑐 is light speed in vacuum.</p><p>In Schokley-Queisser limit (S-Q limit): (1) The 𝐸𝑄𝐸 𝑃𝑉 is described with Heaviside step function, where 𝐸𝑄𝐸 𝑃𝑉 (𝐸) = { 1, 𝐸 ≥ 𝐸 𝑔 0, 𝐸 &lt; 𝐸 𝑔 ;</p><p>(2) only the photos with energy larger than bandgap (𝐸 𝑔 ) are absorbed;</p><p>(3) all recombination is radiative (𝐸𝑄𝐸 𝐸𝐿 = 1).

In experiment, the 𝐸𝑄𝐸 𝑃𝑉 extends into the sub-bandgap region, where the black-body radiation increases with the photo energy lowering <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">4</ref> .

The lattice interference and perturbation of atomic periodicity at the perovskite surfaces often significantly affect the material properties and device efficiencies. By tailoring the terminal groups on the perovskite surface and modifying the surface chemical environment, the defects can be reduced to enhance the photovoltaic performance and stability of derived PVSCs. Here, we report a rationally designed bifunctional molecule, piperazinium iodide (PI), containing both R 2 NH and R 2 NH 2 + groups on the same six-membered ring, behaving both as an electron donor and an electron acceptor to react with different surface-terminating ends on perovskite films. The resulting perovskite films after defect passivation show released surface residual stress, suppressed nonradiative recombination loss, and more n-type characteristics for sufficient energy transfer. Consequently, charge recombination is significantly suppressed to result in a high open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.17 V and a reduced V OC loss of 0.33 V. A very high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.37% (with 22.75% certified) could be achieved, which is the highest value reported for inverted PVSCs. Our work reveals a very effective way of using rationally designed bifunctional molecules to simultaneously enhance the device performance and stability.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">V OC * (V) Ref 1.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>■ INTRODUCTION</head><p>Organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have gained enormous attention during the past few years owing to their superb semiconducting properties, relatively simple and easy processing, low cost, and rapidly ascending power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching as high as 25.5%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[10]</ref> However, the champion PCE of PVSC is still below that predicted from the theoretical Shockley-Queisser (S-Q) limit, mainly due to the loss from nonradiative recombination. Unlike the robust perovskite oxides, the frail Coulombic interaction and weak ionic bonding of organic-inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) cause more vulnerable atomic reorganization and deviations on the derived film surface. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">11</ref> The crystal lattice interference and atomic periodicity perturbation at the surface of OIHPs alter the electronic behavior and band structure, generating a considerable number of nonradiative recombination centers. Such behaviors are more prominent at the surface than in the bulk of OIHP films, which will significantly affect the perovskite material properties and device performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">13</ref> However, originating from the various surface terminations and undercoordinated sites, surface defects are notably different from those formed in the bulk of OIHPs. The undercoordinated Pb 2+ and halide sites are the predominant trap sources on surfaces that cause nonradiative recombination losses. In terms of the surface energy, vacant terminations are more stable than those from PbI 2 flat and methylammonium iodide/formamidinium iodide (MAI/FAI) terminations, which can induce many vacancy defects (such as V I and V MA /V FA ) on the surface. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">14</ref> The larger FA + with a smaller dipole moment has a weaker interaction with the [PbI 6 ] 2-octahedral than does MA + . Thereby, the antisite Pb I defects are formed more easily in FA + -dominant OIHPs with lower formation energies on the surface than in bulk, which may cause deep-level defects such as Pb clusters (i.e., Pb 2+ dimers). <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">15</ref> Recently, an enormous amount of effort has been devoted to suppressing the nonradiative recombination loss in order to further enhance the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) and PCE by passivating positive Pb 2+ traps and negative halide traps. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[20]</ref> Various molecules have been developed either as electron donors or as electron acceptors for passivating positively and negatively charged traps. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[30]</ref> Among them, Lewis acids such as carboxylic acid and phosphoric acid, sulfonic groups, and ammonium groups can neutralize undercoordinated halides through coordinate bonding to form Lewis adducts. On the other hand, Lewis bases, such as carboxylate and amine groups, and electron-rich aromatic structures have been reported to reduce undercoordinated lead ions and/or lead clusters by donating a lone pair of electrons.</p><p>Although numerous molecules have been developed to tailor the surface chemical environments and surface defects, most of them can only passivate either the positively or negatively charged defects. There are very few molecules that can passivate both Pb 2+ and halide ion traps on the perovskite surface. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">28</ref> To achieve enhanced passivation effects, the ability to introduce stronger binding action between the passivator and perovskite to form an ionic bond and a stable chemical interaction is critical. Therefore, it is essential to develop multifunctional molecules that can passivate both positively and negatively charged defects with simple solution treatments to further enhance the device performance.</p><p>Here, we report the development of a novel bifunctional molecule, piperazinium iodide (PI), containing both an R 2 NH and an R 2 NH 2 + group on the same six-membered ring with an in-plane dipole that is capable of functioning as an electron donor and an electron acceptor to react with different surface terminating groups. It was found that PI could form a Pb-N bond in the single crystal of (PI) 2 PbI 2 •2DMSO, which was grown as a model compound to investigate the chemical interactions between PI and PbI 2 . After introducing PI for surface treatment, the residual stress of the film surface could also be released. The tuning of surface termination with PI treatment also helps to achieve a more n-type characteristic film to facilitate charge transfer. The combined effects resulted in suppressed nonradiative recombination loss and a significantly reduced V OC loss of 0.33 V with a very low ΔV 3 of 60.13 mV. The PCE of inverted (p-i-n) devices achieved 23.37% (with 22.75% certified) with a V OC of 1.17 V, which is the highest value for inverted PVSCs to date.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>To demonstrate the specific interaction of different functional groups (neutral R 2 NH and the R 2 NH 2 + cation) in PI, we have also synthesized piperazinium diiodide (PDI) with two R 2 NH 2 + cations for comparison. The detailed synthesis is summarized in the Supporting Information (SI). The (PI) 2 PbI 2 •2DMSO (CCDC 1935315) and (PDI) 2 PbI 2 (CCDC 2009125) single crystals were grown using the reported antisolvent vaporassisted crystallization method. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">31</ref> Detailed crystal data and the refinement of (PI) 2 PbI 2 •2DMSO and (PDI) 2 PbI 2 are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S1</ref>, and the corresponding structures are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The rod-like translucent (PI) 2 PbI 2 •2DMSO single crystals are millimeter-sized and have a 1D chain organic-inorganic hybrid structure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">1a</ref>). The lone-pair electrons of the R 2 NH on PI replace a halide to bond with Pb to form a Pb-N bond with a bond length of 2.80 Å, indicating a strong chemical interaction between Pb 2+ and the lone pair of the neutral R 2 NH group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">1c</ref>). Surprisingly, different from the 3D structure of MAPbI 3 or FAPbI 3 , (PDI) 2 PbI 2 single crystals possess a 0D organic-inorganic hybrid structure in which the metal halide ions (PbI 6 4-) are completely isolated from each other and surrounded by the piperazinium organic cations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">1d</ref>). The interactions of PI and PDI with PbI 2 in the two model compounds are further explored with 1 H NMR spectrometry. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">1e</ref>, the fast proton exchanges among NH, HDO, and DMSO induce the weak signal of H from NH or NH 2 + in the PI sample. However, after mixing PbI 2 and PI in solvent, the strong interaction between R 2 NH and Pb 2+ surpasses proton exchange to give a more well-defined signal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">33</ref> On the other hand, the 1 H NMR spectrum of PDI shows less difference upon addition of PbI 2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">1f</ref>). These results help to confirm the distinctive interaction induced by the neutral R 2 NH on PI, which has not been reported before.</p><p>To investigate the potential interactions of PI and PDI with the perovskite film surface, the materials were deposited via spin coating (1 mg/mL in dry isopropanol) on the perovskite film with a composition of Cs 0.05 (FA 0.95 MA 0.05 ) 0.95 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 . High-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">2</ref>. In the C 1s XPS spectrum, the binding energies (BEs) at 284.8, 286.5, and 288.4 eV are assigned to C-C, CNH 2+ , and CO, respectively (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">2a</ref>). Oxidized carbon species may originate from the decay of the perovskite film when exposed to the ambient environment during testing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">34</ref> The peak area of CO shows a visible decrease after PI and PDI treatments, which indicates the suppressed oxidation process and improved film stability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">35</ref> In the N 1s XPS spectrum, the featured bonds of C-N (400.7 eV) and CNH 2+ (402.4 eV) from FA + /MA + in the reference film slightly shift to lower binding energies (400.5 and 402.2 eV, respectively) after PI treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">2b</ref>). This shift may originate from the formation of hydrogen bonds N-H•••N between the FA + /MA + and the R 2 NH from PI. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">36</ref> However, there is no peak shift in the N 1s spectrum after PDI treatment, which helps to differentiate the unique function of PI with the R 2 NH group. The new peaks appearing at 285.4 eV in the C 1s spectrum and at 399.8 eV in the N 1s spectrum are attributed to the C bonds to neutral N (C-NH-C) and neutral N in PI, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">37</ref> These peaks further verify the existence of PI. In the Pb 4f spectrum, the binding energies at 143.3 and 138.4 eV are assigned to 4f 5/2 and 4f 7/2 of divalent Pb 2+ , respectively. And the two shoulder peaks  at 141.6 and 136.6 eV at lower BE are associated with metallic Pb 0 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">2c</ref>). These peaks move to higher binding energy by more than 400 meV only after PI treatment (centered at 143.8 and 138.9 eV) in terms of bond formation with the R 2 NH in PI, which is in line with the single-crystal studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">38</ref> In addition, the peak area of Pb 0 decreased significantly after both PI and PDI treatments. Pb 0 is an indication of the existence of iodide and cation vacancies on the perovskite film, which can be inhibited by the surface treatments of both PI and PDI. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">39</ref> Besides, electron donor R 2 NH in PI interacts strongly with undercoordinated Pb 2+ as implied by the single-crystal results, contributing to the greatly decreased Pb 0 peak after PI treatment.</p><p>Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) characterization at an incident angle of 0.2°was also carried out to explore the surface crystallite structure of perovskite films after PI and PDI treatments. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">3a-c</ref>, the GIWAXS patterns of films treated with PI and PDI show higher intensities along the (101) ring (|q| = 0.95-1.08 Å -1 ), which indicates better crystallinity compared to that of the reference film. There are no new peaks that emerge after either PI or PDI treatment. However, excessive PbI 2 in the position at |q| = 0.88-0.94 Å -1 disappeared only after PI treatment (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">S5</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S6</ref>). This result is consistent with the measurements from grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) at an incident angle of 0.2°(Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">3d</ref>). The PbI 2 signal that decreased only after PI treatment indicates a strong interaction, which is in line with the single-crystal structure and XPS results.</p><p>To investigate the effects of PI and PDI treatments on the surface crystal structure, we employed the GIXRD technique with the 2θ-sin 2 φ method to analyze the residual stress on the film surface. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">41</ref> The (012) plane at 31.6°was chosen as the target because of its diversity in providing more grain information and a dilute orientation effect on the linear relationship of 2θ-sin 2 φ in the GIXRD measurements. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">3e</ref>-g shows that the scattering peaks gradually shift to the left by varying φ from 10 to 60°at different levels. The film stress can be calculated by fitting 2θ as a function of sin 2 φ, in which the negative slope of the fitting line indicates tensile stress that exists at the perovskite film. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">3h</ref>, the residual tensile strain gradually decreases from 61.57 ± 6.92 MPa for the reference film to 27.54 ± 2.16 and 40.15 ± 3.89 MPa after PI and PDI treatments, respectively. This shows that the defect passivation in the A-site vacancy and in undercoordinated Pb 2+ with R 2 NH 2 + and R 2 NH groups results in lower surface residual stress. After surface treatment with PI, the R 2 NH 2 + group can insert the A-site vacancy and the R 2 NH group can react with the undercoordinated Pb 2+ , thus regulating the surface termination and releasing the surface residual stress, which can play an important role in carrier dynamics and device performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">42</ref> To understand more about the passivation effect of PI, the recombination occurring in the perovskite films was investigated by steady-state PL and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analysis. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">4a</ref>, the PL intensities of perovskite films after PI and PDI treatments are about 5 and 3 times higher than those of the reference films, suggesting that their nonradiative recombination loss is alleviated considerably after surface passivation. The TRPL decay curves (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">4b</ref>) were fitted with biexponential function I(t) = A 1 exp(-t/τ 1 ) + A 2 exp(-t/τ 2 ), where τ 1 and τ 2 are the fast and slow decay components, respectively (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">S2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_6">S3</ref>). The average lifetime (τ avg ) can be calculated with τ =</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">τ τ ∑ ∑ = = A A avg i n i i i n i i 1 2 1</formula><p>. We found that the perovskite films after PI and PDI surface treatments possessed a longer carrier lifetime compared to that of the reference film. The τ avg values of the reference perovskite film and PI-and PDI-treated films are 305, 1948, and 1461 ns, respectively. The significantly prolonged lifetimes of perovskite films after PI and PDI treatments are attributed to the suppressed defects such as lead clusters, undercoordinated halides, and Pb-I antisite which usually cause nonradiative recombination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">43</ref> The combined effects of R 2 NH and R 2 NH 2 + groups on PI for defect passivation are superior to those obtained from PDI with only the R 2 NH 2 + group, which demonstrates the benefit of having multifunctional passivators. The trap density (N trap ) was calculated with space-charge- limited-current (SCLC) method (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S8</ref>). The N trap of the reference film based on the hole-only device is about 2.54 × 10 16 cm -3 . After the passivation with PI and PDI, the N trap was reduced to 8.4 × 10 15 and 1.64 × 10 16 cm -3 , respectively. The lower N trap after PI treatment demonstrates the effectiveness of defect passivation by PI compared to that by PDI, which is consistent with the PL and TRPL results.</p><p>Confocal photoluminescence (PL) mappings were also conducted to explore the optoelectronic properties of perovskite films as displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">4c-e</ref>. The PL intensity in the central area of a single grain is much higher than those from the grain boundaries, which indicates better charge transfer with minimized recombination. After PI treatment, the overall PL intensity is significantly improved and the intensity distribution is more homogeneous compared to those obtained from the reference and PDI-treated films. The PL peak position distribution of the films was counted, and the PL peak histogram of the films was demonstrated in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S9</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S10</ref>. The distribution of PL peaks on the perovskite film is considerably narrowed after PI treatment, suggesting that the surface phase segregation is suppressed. A more homogeneous film is favorable for charge transfer because the energy loss during the transfer between domains can be significantly reduced. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">45</ref> Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was employed to analyze the electronic structures of perovskite films after PI treatment. The valence band maximum (E V ) shifts by 180 meV toward the vacuum level (E VAC ), while the E F shifts by 350 meV toward the conduction band minimum (E C ) after treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S11</ref>). This E F shift indicates that the PI-treated films demonstrate more n-type characteristics, which is probably due to the changed surface termination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">47</ref> The PbI 2 termination has been reported to have deeper energy levels than those of the MA + /FA + terminations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">48</ref> After introducing PI onto the film surface, the dipole in PI orients away from the surface, exposing electropositive ammonium terminal groups and enabling band bending between the perovskite and the electron-transporting layer, which can facilitate more efficient charge transfer.</p><p>To verify the passivation effect of PI on photovoltaic performance, the devices were fabricated with a configuration of ITO glass/PTAA/perovskite/C 60 /bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">5a</ref>. The reference device without passivation showed a PCE of 20.76% (average PCE: 19.67%) with an opencircuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.06 V, a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 24.93 mA cm -2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 78.57% under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm -2 ) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">S12</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">S4</ref>). The PCE of the devices after PDI treatment was improved to 21.98% (average PCE: 21.31%), benefiting from the enhanced V OC (1.13 V) due to the passivated A-site vacancy defects by the R 2 NH 2 + group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">5b</ref>). However, J SC decreased, perhaps due to the possible formation of lowerdimensional perovskites, which inhibited charge transport. On the contrary, the devices after being treated with PI achieved a significantly enhanced PCE of 23.37% (V OC of 1.17 V, FF of 80.17%, J SC of 24.92 mA cm -2 ) (average PCE: 22.26%) with negligible hysteresis as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">5c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>. The device performance was validated by an independent certification laboratory to show a high PCE of 22.75% with a J SC of 24.68 mA cm -2 , a V OC of 1.16 V, and an FF of 79.16% (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">S13</ref>). This is the highest certified PCE for inverted PVSCs to date. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">5e</ref>. The integrated photocurrent of the champion device with 24.18 mA cm -2 matched well with the values obtained from the J-V curves.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">5f</ref> exhibits the stabilized power output at the maximum power point (MPP) for the PI-treated champion device under continuous AM 1.5G illumination. The stabilized PCE is 22.88%, which is in good agreement with the PCE obtained from the J-V curves. The greatly improved PCE is mainly attributed to the highly enhanced V OC from 1.06 to 1.17 V due to PI passivation. The V OC loss is significantly reduced to 0.33 V, which is among the lowest values in PVSCs reported so far (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">S14</ref>). Moreover, the PI passivation not only enhanced the device performance but also improved its stability. The encapsulated device could maintain 93% of its initial efficiency under humid air (RH 55 ± 5%, 25 °C), while the efficiencies of the reference device degraded to 40% of its original values. Also, the PI-treated device can maintain over 98% of its initial efficiency while that of the reference device decreased to 87% of its initial efficiency under continuous illumination at 200 h.</p><p>In order to quantitatively analyze the impact of PI and PDI treatments on V OC loss, we employed the detailed balance theory to calculate the V OC loss: <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr">[51]</ref>  Here, q is the elementary charge, ΔV is the overall voltage loss, Eg is the perovskite band gap, V OC SQ is the Shockley-Queisser limit of V OC , V OC rad refers to the V OC in which only radiative recombination occurred in PVSCs, ΔV OC SQ is the V OC loss caused by the nonideal EQE above the band gap, ΔV OC rad is the V OC loss of the sub-band-gap radiative recombination, and ΔV OC nonrad is the V OC loss of nonradiative recombination. According to the theory, V OC loss consists of three parts, ΔV 1 , ΔV 2 , and ΔV 3 . ΔV 2 results from the energy loss from blackbody radiation, where the EQE of PVSCs extend into the region below Eg. It can be computed through the highly sensitive EQE (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">6a</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">52,</ref><ref type="bibr">53</ref> The calculated ΔV 2 values are 27.37, 2.73, and 12.46 mV for the reference and the PI-and PDI-treated devices, respectively.

The EQE EL values were collected by using the PVSCs as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">6b</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">S17</ref>). The EQE EL of the reference device is 0.55%, which can be converted to a ΔV 3 value of 134.35 mV. The ΔV 3 value of the PI-treated device was reduced significantly to 60.13 mV with an EQE EL of as high as 9.77%. Such a low value is among the smallest energy losses of photovoltaic devices, further proving the excellent passivating effect of PI on reducing the nonradiative recombination loss. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">54</ref> The V OC loss analysis of ΔV 1 , ΔV 2 , and ΔV 3 is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">6c</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>.

The (PI) 2 PbI 2 •2DMSO single crystal was grown as a model compound to mimic the interactions between PI and perovskite surface defects. The PI molecule with an R 2 NH electron donor and an R 2 NH 2 + electron acceptor forms a dipole to reduce residual stress and suppress nonradiative recombination loss in perovskites to boost the efficiency of inverted PVSCs to a very high value of 23.37% (with 22.75% certified) and a reduced V OC deficit of 0.33 V. This work paves a new way for using rationally designed molecular passivators to reduce the surface defects of perovskite films and further improve the efficiency and stability of derived PVSCs.</p></div>
