<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In halide perovskite solar cells the formation of secondary-phase excess lead iodide (PbI 2 ) has some positive effects on power conversion efficiency (PCE) but can be detrimental to device stability and lead to large hysteresis effects in voltage sweeps. We converted PbI 2 into an inactive (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl compound by RbCl doping, which effectively stabilizes the perovskite phase. We obtained a certified PCE of 25.6% for FAPbI 3 (FA, formamidinium) perovskite solar cells on the basis of this strategy. Devices retained 96% of their original PCE values after 1000 hours of shelf storage and 80% after 500 hours of thermal stability testing at 85°C.</p></div>

The benefits of excess PbI 2 -either in the bulk or at the grain boundary of perovskite filmshave mainly been attributed to its passivation effect resulting from the formation of a type-I band alignment <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref>. However, excess PbI 2 is too active and leads to instability of the device and large hysteresis in current density voltage (J-V) characteristics <ref type="bibr">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr">23,</ref><ref type="bibr">25,</ref><ref type="bibr">26)</ref>. Both factors can be ascribed to the photodecomposition of PbI 2 and the enhanced ionic migration.</p><p>It is crucial to manage excess unstable PbI 2 in perovskite films to achieve high efficiency. Recently, Luo et al. developed a ligandmodulation approach to manage the excess PbI 2 and successfully improved both PCE (up to 22%) and stability <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>.</p><p>We propose stabilization of the perovskite by converting excess PbI 2 into an inactive, new, secondary-phase (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl that can improve the stability of the perovskite FAPbI 3 layer (for simplicity, the perovskite film with (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl is henceforth referred to as PIRC), in addition to improving its optoelectronic properties, the reduction of PbI 2 decreased the bandgap of the perovskite layer. As a result, a 26.1% efficiency (certification efficiency: 25.6%) of perovskite solar cells with &gt;1000 hours of shelf stability and 500 hours of thermal stability at 85°C have been developed.</p><p>We deposited nearly pure FAPbI 3 by a modified two step method used in our previous reports <ref type="bibr">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">18)</ref>. For deposition of FAPbI 3 , the PbI 2 seed layer was first grown on the sub-strate while the organic salt formamidinium iodide (FAI) solution was deposited on PbI 2 for diffusion and formation of perovskite by annealing. Further, to improve the perovskite crystallization, methylammonium chloride (MACl) was added to the FAI solution <ref type="bibr">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr">27)</ref>. In contrast to our previous reports, to enhance the thermal stability and decrease the bandgap of perovskite as much as possible, traditional organic salt methylammonium iodide (MAI) or methylammonium bromide was not used in this study. We confirmed that a 5% molar ratio of RbCl doping is the best condition for device performance, as discussed below.</p><p>We performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>) measurements to determine the perovskite film crystallinity. For the control film, the perovskite crystal grain size was ~1 mm and the grains were surrounded by PbI 2 grains (white needle shapes, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>), which formed as decomposition products on the perovskite surface after heating at elevated temperatures. For the PIRC films, the perovskite crystal size was increased to ~2 mm. Instead of a large fraction of evenly distributed white needle-shaped grains, sporadically distributed white irregular flakes were observed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). Energy dispersive spectroscopy mapping of the PIRC film (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>) revealed that the white region contained Pb, I, Rb, and Cl, but no N. This result indicated that there was no organic-inorganic hybrid FAPbI 3 perovskite phase in this region whereas a PbI 2 /RbCl mixed phase was possible (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> and tables S1 and S2). The cross-section SEM images showed that the new secondary phases only formed on top of the perovskite films (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</p><p>Conventional x-ray diffraction (XRD) for the perovskite films (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>) showed that the main diffraction peak of the control film could be assigned from the black phase of FAPbI 3 located at 14°. The yellow phase of FAPbI 3 (11.7°) was also observed in addition to the PbI 2 diffraction peak (12.6°) (the inset of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> shows the enlarged figure). The PbI 2 diffraction peak in the PIRC film was largely suppressed and a diffraction peak (11.3°) emerged (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>, inset). Grazing-incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) of the PIRC films were also consistent with conventional XRD results (fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>). We directly compared the XRD pattern of the annealed PbI 2 /RbCl precursor films with different ratios (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>), and we found that the diffraction of PbI 2 almost disappeared whereas the diffraction intensity at 11.3°was greatly enhanced when the ratio of PbI 2 /RbCl is 2. Thus, we could attribute the 11.3°peak to crys-talline (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl. Density function theory calculations and powder diffraction results also confirmed this assignment (fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref>).</p><p>To study the phase stability of the perovskite materials obtained we aged the perovskite films at 85°C for 48 hours. The XRD and SEM results showed that more PbI 2 was formed after heating of the control perovskite film (figs. S5 and S6). We found that integration of the XRD intensity ratio of PbI 2 /perovskite in the control film increased from 0.42 to 0.98 after aging whereas the PIRC film remained at ~0. trigger decomposition of the perovskite layer <ref type="bibr">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr">25,</ref><ref type="bibr">26,</ref><ref type="bibr">28,</ref><ref type="bibr">29)</ref> whereas the perovskite becomes much more stable after conversion of PbI 2 into the (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl phase. The presence of PbI 2 in the perovskite layer could lead to ion migration as a result of the formation of Schottky defects such as FA and I vacancies <ref type="bibr">(30)</ref>. We measured the temperaturedependent conductivity with a previously reported procedure <ref type="bibr">(31)</ref> to confirm that ion migration is suppressed in the PIRC films through reduction of PbI 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). We can estimate the ion migration active energy based on the Nernst-Einstein relation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">sT ¼ s 0 exp ÀE a =k B T ð Þ</formula><p>where s 0 is a constant, k B is Boltzmann's constant, s is ionic conductivity, T is temperature, and E a is the ion-migration activation energy.</p><p>We derived E a values from the slope of the ln (sT) versus 1/T of ~0.32 eV for the control films and ~1.03 eV for the PIRC films. Given the E a , we can estimate that the ion migration rates (k) at the operating temperature (50°C) are 4.2 × 10 8 s -1 and 3.3 × 10 -3 s -1 , respectively, based on the Arrhenius equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">k ¼ k B T ð Þ=ℏ exp ÀE a =RT ð Þ</formula><p>where k B stands for the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, and R is the ideal gas constant <ref type="bibr">(32)</ref>. We found that (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl could not easily react with FA cations or I ions compared with those of PbI 2 (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S7</ref>), inferring that (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl lacks similarity to PbI 2 in regards to acting as a sink for absorbing adjacent FA and I during heating, photo soaking, or voltage application. This will suppress FA and I vacancy formation, as well as ion migration. Another possible reason for suppression of ion migration as a result of (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl is that as the derivative of PbI 2 , the (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl is a fully inter-calated compound (fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref>) with narrow ion migration pathways whereas PbI 2 is a layer structure crystal with enough interlamellar space for ion migration. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization of the PIRC film showed the expected Rb 3d core level peak (Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>). For Cl, a substantial difference was found between the control and PIRC films. We estimated ~2.7% Cl in the control film (Fig. <ref type="figure">2D</ref>), resulting from the addition of residual MACl during perovskite film growth, although most MACl would have evaporated during annealing. In these perovskite films, the radius of Cl was too small to incorporate into the lattice. We estimated that ~5.3% Cl was left in the PIRC film that was bonded with Pb or Rb ions and could not be easily evaporated (Fig. <ref type="figure">2D</ref>). This excess Cl could stabilize the perovskite phase through strong Pb-Cl bonding <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr">(10)</ref>. The presence of RbCl also enhanced the formation of the black perovskite phase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>). Previous studies showed that the metallic Pb formed from PbI 2 under high-energy illumination drives loss of I 2 <ref type="bibr">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr">29)</ref>. We found that the metallic state of Pb was suppressed after introducing PIRC (Fig. <ref type="figure">2E</ref>), which could be due to much better photo stability of PIRC compared with PbI 2 (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S8</ref>).</p><p>Depth profile XPS for the PIRC films revealed that the top surface was Rb-and Cl-rich (Fig. <ref type="figure">2F</ref> and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S9</ref>), which could be a result of the secondary phase having a different solubility in the precursor solvent. Time-of-flight second ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) of the control and target perovskite films (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S10</ref>) also confirmed that Rb and Cl that convert PbI 2 into (PbI 2 ) 2 RbCl were mainly distributed on top of the perovskite. The Cl ratio on the bottom of the perovskite is about 1% higher than that in the bulk estimated from ToF-SIMS (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S10</ref>) and XPS results (Fig. <ref type="figure">2F</ref>).</p><p>Excess PbI 2 can increase the perovskite bandgap <ref type="bibr">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">17)</ref>, which could be attributed to the strong quantum confinement in perovskite/PbI 2 . The photoluminescence (PL) emission of the control film peak at 805 nm red shifted to 810 nm in the PIRC film (Fig. <ref type="figure">2G</ref>). The PIRC perovskite film showed enhanced PL intensity indicative of suppression of nonradiative recombination. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) showed that the lifetime of the perovskite increased from 0.98 ms to 2.3 ms for the PIRC films and that this lifetime can be extended to ~6 ms with the addition of a passivation layer on the perovskite surface (Fig. <ref type="figure">2H</ref>).</p><p>We fabricated the solar cell devices in an n-i-p configuration of FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite/passivation layer/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au [FTO, fluorine-doped tin oxide; spiro-OMeTAD, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,Ndipmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>]. After testing the device performance using perovskite films with 1 to 10% RbCl doping we found that the 5% RbCl device had the best performance (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S11</ref> and table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S3</ref>); additionally, improved performance was observed when Cl was used as the halide (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S12</ref> and<ref type="figure">table S4</ref>). A representative J-V curve for the control and 5% RbCl-doped device showed that each of the photovoltaic parameters increased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). The typical short circuit current density (J SC ) increased from 25.1 to 25.8 mA/cm 2 , which could be attributed mainly to the lower bandgap (Fig. <ref type="figure">2G</ref>) as well as the external quantum efficiency (EQE) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). The open circuit voltage V OC increase from 1.17 to 1.19 eV despite the bandgap decrease was due to the suppression of recombination. The fill factor (FF) was almost the same or slightly improved compared with the control device.</p><p>Overall, the PCE increased from 24.6 to 25.6%. In addition, the PIRC-based device was almost hysteresis-free whereas the control device showed obvious hysteresis. The highest PCE for an optimized device tested in our laboratory was 26.1% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>); said device also showed 25.7% efficiency and steady output for 1200 s (device area: 0.108 cm 2 ; measurement mask size: 0.0741 cm 2 ). The statistics of the PCE distribution confirm the reproducibility of our results (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">S13</ref>). These devices, which showed 25.6% certificated efficiency with a V OC of 1.182 V, a J SC of 26.3 mA/cm 2 , and a FF of 82.7% (figs. S14 and S15), were sent to the accredited laboratory in Newport, USA, for certification.</p><p>The V OC reflects the recombination rate of a given device and can be measured through the EQE at short circuit current conditions when the device is tested as a light-emitting diode. These devices had electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies as high as 21.6% under the injection current of 26 mA/cm 2 (equal to short circuit current J ph ) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>). High quantum efficiency can only be observed through charge confinement in light-emitting diodes, so the high-EL efficiency indicates that the defectrelated nonradiative recombination was largely suppressed in the tested device. Light intensitydependent results (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">S16</ref>) also confirm this conclusion <ref type="bibr">(33)</ref> and are consistent with our device simultaneously delivering high J sc and V oc .</p><p>We tracked device shelf stability and hysteresis in a nitrogen environment while using the Spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer. After 1004 hours of aging, a slight drop in the FF from 82.6 to 80.6% was observed for the RPIC strategy-based device, which could be attributed to the reduction of Spiro-OMeTAD in an oxygen-free environment <ref type="bibr">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr">35)</ref>; further, it had 96% of its original PCE. The device maintained almost the same PCE in both reverse and forward scans (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>). However, the control device could only maintain its reverse scan PCE of 24.1% whereas the forward efficiency was reduced to 22.9%. We attributed this enhanced hysteresis (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">S17</ref> and<ref type="figure">table S5</ref>) to the spontaneous formation of PbI 2 as a result of aging and enhanced ion migration.</p><p>We also tested accelerated aging stability while heating the devices at 85°C in a nitrogen environment. We removed other possible sources of instability such as the organic passivation layer and replaced Spiro-OMeTAD with Poly[bis(4phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine]. We found that the PIRC-targeted devices primarily showed improved stability. Under 500 hours of continuous heating, the device maintained 80% initial performance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3F</ref> and table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S6</ref>) whereas the control device only retained 50% of its initial PCE. The PIRC method proposed in this study could enhance both stability and device efficiency which will provide a new direction and push the development of perovskite solar cells; there is also potential for use in other optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes and photodetectors. was added into the transparent solution for reverse precipitation.

Before use, the FTO was cleaned with ultraviolet ozone for 10min. Then the substrate was spin-coated with a thin layer of SnO2 nanoparticle film (2.67%, diluted by water) at 4,000 rpm. for 30 s, and annealed in ambient air at 150 °C for 30min.</p><p>It is better to clean the substrate with ultraviolet ozone for 10min to improve the surface wetting.</p><p>After that, 1.5M of PbI2 in DMF:DMSO (9:1) solvent was spin-coated onto SnO2 at 1,500 rpm for 30 s, and annealed at 70 °C for 1min, then cooled to room temperature. For comparison, different concentrations (1%, 3%, 5%, 10% molar) RbCl were doped into the PbI2 solution. For FAPbI3 perovskite film deposition, a solution of FAI: MACl (90mg: 9-18mg in 1ml IPA) was spin-coated onto the PbI2 at spin rate of 1,800 rpm. for 30 s, and the perovskite precursor film was taken out from the nitrogen glove box to ambient air for thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15min in humidity conditions (30-40% humidity). It must be noted that the humidity is very critical for achieving high crystallinity of perovskite films and high performance of devices. This could be explained that the perovskite precursor could absorb water onto the surface, which could promote the perovskite crystal growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(36)</ref>. From our previous results, the humidity should be controlled around 30-40%, lower humidity will not promote the perovskite growth, high humidity could lead to perovskite decomposition. Humidifier or dehumidifier is usually used for keeping the humidity around 30-40% in the open ambient air environment. After perovskite formation, the samples were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box for further processing. For passivation layer, the PEAI solution was dissolved in IPA with 20mM and spin-coated onto the perovskite surface at a spin rate of 5,000 rpm. without any further processing. Then the hole transporting layer was deposited on top of the passivation layer at a spin rate of 1,500 rpm. for 30 s using spiro-OMeTAD solution, which consisted of 90mg spiro-OMeTAD, 44μl bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) stock solution (260mg Li-TFSI in 1ml acetonitrile), 37μl 4-tertbutylpyridine and 1ml chlorobenzene.

For comparing the photo-stability of PbI2 and (PbI2)2RbCl layer, these two precursors with the concertation of 1.5 M was spin coated on the glass substrate at 3000rpm for 30s and then annealing 150 o C for 10min, after that, the two obtained films were put under the ultraviolet light (395 nm, 600 mW/cm 2 ) for aging.</p></div>

The GIWAXS was performed at BL17B1 beamline of SSRF using the X-ray energy of 10KeV. Two-dimensional patterns were acquired by a PLATUS 2M detector mounted vertically at a distance ~240 mm from the sample with a grazing incidence angle of 0.2º or 0.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for crystal structure:</head><p>To confirm the possible lattice structure of (PbI2)2RbCl, we perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations ( <ref type="formula">41</ref>) by using the first-principles software VASP <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(42)</ref>. For relaxation calculations, the local density approximation (LDA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(43)</ref> method is adopted for exchange the correlation function. The energy cutoff for the plane-wave expansion is set as 500 eV, and a 6×6×3 k-grid following the Monkhorst-Pack method ( <ref type="formula">44</ref>) is used to sample the Brillouin zone. Atomic positions are fully relaxed as guaranteed atomic force is less than 0.02 eV/Å. The results show that the theoretical lattice constants of unstrained (PbI2)2RbCl are 8.42 Å in horizontal directions (a-and b-axis), and 15.16 Å in vertical direction (c-axis). Then, we further simulate the diffraction patterns by atomic structure analysis software VESTA <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(45)</ref>, where the diffraction wavelength is set to 1.54 Å. By simulating the diffraction patterns under different strains, it is found that when a strain of 2.5% in the horizontal direction and 3.5% in the vertical direction is applied to (PbI2)2RbCl, there are significant peaks at 2𝜃=11.35°, 28.62°, and 34.58°, which are consistent with the experimental results. For the synthesized of (PbI2)2RbCl powders, the XRD pattern is fully consistent with the simulation results.</p><p>Device measurement: For the device operating as a LED, the device was mounted in an integrating sphere and the power output measured for calculation of the EQE (Enlitech, LQE-50-PL). The J-V characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were obtained using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under simulated one-sun AM 1.5G illumination (100mWcm -2 ) with a solar simulator (Enlitech, SS-F5-3A) and the light intensity was calibrated by means of a KG-5 Si diode. The J-V measurements were carried out in ambient air. The devices were measured both in reverse scan (1.2V→0V, step 0.02V) and forward scan (0V→1.2V, step 0.02V). The EQE was measured using an Enlitech EQE measurement system (QE-R3018). We sent the best devices to an accredited laboratory (Newport, USA) for certification. The device thermal stability tests were carried out in a nitrogen glove box, and the devices were put on a hotplate with a temperature of 85 o C.      </p></div>			</div>
