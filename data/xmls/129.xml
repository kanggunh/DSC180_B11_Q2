The growth stage of the target film has been retarded with GABC addition, taking more than 80 s for the target film to reach the final stage. Also, the PL intensity of the control film reaches its maximum in &lt;10 s, while the PL intensity of the target film reaches its maximum in a much longer time span of ~200 s. Moreover, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the stabilized PL peak in the target film is much narrower than that of the control film, indicating better phase homogeneity. These results show that the GBAC can help slow down the film formation and improve the film quality considerably, which is in accord with the results acquired from ambient air.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Yes No</head><p>For thermal stability, the unencapsulated devices were aged under continuous heating at 65±5 °C in N2 atmosphere. The long-term operational stability of the unencapsulated cells were tracked through the high throughput solar cell lifetime test system from CRYSCO cooperation with maximum power point tracking under LED simulated AM 1.5 spectrum in an N2-filled glovebox. Duration between two test is 300 s. Improving the intrinsic film quality of metal halide perovskites is very critical to increase the power conversion efficiency and long-term stability of perovskite solar cells. Here we report a multifunctional, non-volatile additive that can be used to modulate the kinetics of perovskite film growth through a hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate phase. The additive enables the formation of large perovskite grains and coherent grain growth from bottom to the surface of the film. The enhanced film morphology results in significantly reduced non-radiative recombinations, thus boosting the power conversion efficiency of inverted (p-i-n) solar cells to 24.8% (24.5% certified) with a low energy loss of 0.36 eV. The unencapsulated devices exhibit improved thermal stability with a T 98 lifetime beyond 1,000 h under continuous heating at 65 ± 5 °C in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. This effective approach can also be applied to wide-bandgap perovskites and large-area devices to show reduced voltage loss and high efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>nature photonics</head><p>Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites have garnered great attention due to their impressive optoelectronic properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . Combining compositional and interfacial engineering strategies, the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) has now reached 25.7% (ref.</p><p>2) (<ref type="url" target="https://www.nrel.gov/pv/cell-efficiency.html">https://www.nrel.gov/pv/cell-efficiency.html</ref>). However, the reported high-efficiency devices mostly comprise the conventional (n-i-p) architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> , whereas inverted (p-i-n) PVSCs still show inferior performance despite their low-temperature processability and better compatibility in fabricating tandem and flexible devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> . The major challenge stems from the severe energy loss in inverted PVSCs, especially the non-radiative recombination loss associated with defects embedded at the interfaces and grain boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> . A high-quality perovskite film with intrinsically low defect density is, thus, critical in determining the achievable efficiency and stability for PVSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</p><p>In a typical one-step solution process, perovskite precursors dissolved in polar aprotic solvents are spin coated onto the substrate. The introduction of an antisolvent then quickly extracts the residual solvents and templates the perovskite crystal growth through intermediate phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . Various volatile solvents and organic salts have been employed as additives to tune the intermediate compositions for modulating the crystallization kinetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> . In one work, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone was added in the perovskite precursors to form a lead iodide (PbI 2 )-N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone adduct for promoting the black-phase formation at room temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . In another work, methylammonium chloride (MACl) was used to facilitate the formation of an intermediate phase for stabilizing the perovskite α-phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . However, these additives may volatilize during annealing, creating voids at the perovskite-substrate interface, Article <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41566-023-01180-6">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41566-023-01180-6</ref> organic-inorganic vacancies via Lewis acid-base reactions with the carboxyl and guanidium groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . To verify our hypothesis, we first conducted Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry to study the interactions between GBAC and organic species in perovskites. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">1a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">1</ref>, the N-H stretching peak shifted from 3,352 to 3,378 cm -1 for FA + /MA + and the C=N stretching peak in FA + also shifted from 1,713 to 1,709 cm -1 on adding GBAC, suggesting the formation of hydrogen bonds between GBAC and organic cations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . These indicate that the interplay between GBAC and FA + / MA + in the perovskite can help strengthen the film stability, especially thermal stability that is mainly governed by the organic species. We then verified this through a thermogravimetric analysis (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">2</ref>), where the impeded decomposition of the target film suggests that more energy is required to disrupt the interaction between GBAC and perovskite <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , ameliorating the film's thermal stability.</p><p>We performed high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) to study the surface chemistry of perovskites (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">3</ref>). We clearly observed the peak corresponding to GBAC π-π interaction (293.10 eV, C1s spectrum) and increased the C=O peak area (O1s spectrum) in the target film, further validating the existence of the GBAC linker in the perovskite (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">4</ref> and<ref type="figure">5</ref>). In the Pb4f spectrum (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">1b</ref>), the binding energy of 4f 5/2 and 4f 7/2 for divalent Pb 2+ shifted from 141.92 and 137.09 eV to 141.59 and 136.76 eV, respectively, due to the electrostatic interaction between the guanidium group and PbI 6 4-. We further recorded the steady-state PL and time-resolved PL profiles of perovskite films to reveal how GBAC affects the film quality and charge-transport dynamics (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). The target inducing unavoidable recombination loss and fast degradation of the perovskite <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</p><p>Here we report the formation of a hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate by adding a multifunctional molecule (4-guanidinobenzoic acid hydrochloride (GBAC)) into the perovskite precursor to modulate the crystallization kinetics and serve as an effective non-volatile passivation linker in the annealed film. Combining crystallography, in situ photoluminescence (PL) characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we reveal that the crystal growth kinetics is regulated by additional energies required for hydrogen-bond breakage and cation exchange between the intermediate phase and perovskite. Therefore, the obtained perovskite films exhibit significantly enhanced crystallinity with larger grains. Besides, the additives can form tight packs at the grain boundaries due to π-π interaction of the aryls to effectively passivate the defects in perovskites. The derived inverted PVSCs achieved a champion PCE of 24.8% with an open-circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.19 V, short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 24.55 mA cm -2 and fill factor (FF) of 84.78%. A certified PCE of 24.5% was obtained from the Japan Electrical Safety &amp; Environment Technology Laboratories, being among the highest reported for inverted PVSCs (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). We also applied this strategy to fabricate wide-bandgap and large-area PVSCs, paving the way for developing multijunction and scalable perovskite photovoltaics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterization of perovskite films</head><p>We introduced GBAC as an additive into the perovskite precursor solution, which can interact with the uncoordinated lead and </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Article</head><p><ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41566-023-01180-6">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41566-023-01180-6</ref> film exhibits six times stronger PL intensity and three times longer PL lifetime than those of the control film, agreeing well with the FTIR and XPS results that GBAC suppresses the defect-induced non-radiative recombination to reduce energy loss for improving the photovoltaic performance.</p><p>To understand how GBAC addition affects the film morphology, we collected scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films. The target film shows considerably larger grains (~1 μm) and fewer residual PbI 2 sheets than the control film (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>), with a coherent bottom-to-surface grain growth that can facilitate the transport of carriers to electrodes. Besides good film morphology, the crystallinity of the target film is significantly improved (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">1e</ref>). The decreased PbI 2 sheets in the SEM images was also confirmed by the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns, suggesting that GBAC can interact with the uncoordinated Pb 2+ and modulate film growth to obtain fully grown grains. Moreover, the addition of GBAC significantly helps modulate the crystal orientation within the film for facilitating charge transport (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</p><p>Atomic force microscopy characterization reveals a lower surface roughness after GBAC addition (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). We also applied Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to evaluate the distribution of the surface potential of perovskite films, which shows an increment of 200-300 mV in the target film (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">1f</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>), indicating a Fermi level (E F ) closer to the conductive band edge <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . The higher work function measured by KPFM matches well with the results obtained from ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometry (UPS), showing a 0.25 eV shift in E F by adding GBAC (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">10</ref>). The more n-characteristic film surface stems from the modified surface termination after adding GBAC (ref. 22), enabling more efficient charge transfer between the perovskite and electron-transporting materials (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">11</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In situ characterization of film formation</head><p>To gain more insights into the remarkably enhanced film quality, we adopted in situ PL spectrometry to understand the role of GBAC during film formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> . The evolution of the PL peak position in both control and target films shows similar trends in the long-term stage (0-750 s) (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">12</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">13</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">14</ref>). However, the initial peak position of the wet target film was slightly blueshifted compared with that of the control film due to the additional chloride from GBAC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). Also, the target film exhibits a much slower shift with negligible fluctuation in the initial stage (0-10 s) compared with those of the control sample, implying that the crystallization process was significantly retarded by adding GBAC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">2b</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . Moreover, the PL peaks of the target film are more symmetric compared with the control film, indicating a more uniform distribution of crystallite sizes, which facilitates the significantly increased grain sizes, as shown in the SEM images (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</p><p>We then analysed the evolution of PL peak intensity, which shows typical PL quenching in both films but more severe in the control film (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . Such PL quenching originates from the continuously increased Urbäch energy, indicating the gradual formation of defects in the microstructures of perovskites <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . However, it is considerably inhibited in the target film, showing a much lower defect density and better ambient stability than the control film (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">2d</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . The initial stages (0-2 s for the control sample and 0-30 s for the target sample) were then enlarged to clearly show the PL intensity evolution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">2e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>). The control film shows a typical four-stage 'up-down-up-down' process with two states (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">2e</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . In state 'I' (0-200 ms), the perovskite grains grow freely and are well crystallized/ordered, resulting in an increased PL intensity ('up'). When the solvent is almost entirely evaporated, the perovskite crystallites are exposed to the surrounding atmosphere and the surfaces of other crystallites, forming grain boundaries and triggering rapid PL quenching ('down'; 200-400 ms). In state 'II', the small crystallites further grow and merge into larger ones on annealing to reduce the overall grain boundaries, resulting in an increased PL intensity again ('up'; 400-600 ms). Such a rapid film formation can also be attributed to the absorbed moisture accumulated within the grain boundaries, inducing grain-boundary creep and subsequent merging of adjacent grains to accelerate the film growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> . The partial recovery of PL intensity also comes from the passivation effect of excessive PbI 2 at the perovskite grain boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . Eventually, the film is vulnerable under ambient conditions and prone to decomposition. This results in a stabilized but almost one order of magnitude lower PL intensity than that of PL max ('down'; after 600 ms). However, adding GBAC introduces an extra stage involving the intermediate-induced pre-growth process in the target sample (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">2f</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . The film formation is significantly slowed down, reaching its maximum PL intensity at ~20 s and maintained for longer time. These results imply that adding GBAC can modulate the crystallization kinetics by forming an additional intermediate to enhance the film quality, leading to larger grain sizes and high crystallinity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Film growth with hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate</head><p>To study the GBAC-induced intermediate phase, we grew the single crystal of GBAC-PbI 2 -N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> . We observed strong cyclic hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic acid and guanidium groups as well as DMF and guanidium groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">3a</ref>). The DMF molecules locked by hydrogen bonds help isolate the PbI 2 sheets and GBAC layer, leading to a one-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid chain structure. Due to the strong dipole of GBAC and the electron delocalization in the guanidium groups (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">15</ref>), these hydrogen bonds are very different from the typical linear hydrogen-bonded chains that serve as supramolecular synthons for layered perovskite structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> . This unique interaction mode helps build a bridge to connect the organic-inorganic components. Moreover, the interaction between GBAC and perovskite precursor components in solution was investigated by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">16</ref>), of which the results are in good agreement with those observed from XPS and FTIR measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . Through these studies, we have identified that GBAC can simultaneously interact with the solvent, organic and inorganic components in the precursor solution through both Coulomb interaction and hydrogen bonding, demonstrating its multifunctionality in solution.</p><p>We then conducted a thermal analysis of single crystals to study the phase transition from the intermediate state to perovskite. The experimental XRD pattern of the obtained transparent GBAC-PbI 2 -DMF crystals matches well with the XRD pattern simulated from the single-crystal structure, confirming their composition (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">17</ref>). The simultaneous thermal analysis profile shows an intense endothermic peak at ~80 °C corresponding to hydrogen-bond breakage (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">18</ref>). At elevated temperatures, DMF starts to evaporate, destabilizing the intermediate that then transforms into a new one-dimensional structure composed of GBAC-PbI 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">3b</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">19</ref>). This GBAC-PbI 2 phase can only be identified in a perovskite film with &gt;4 mol% GBAC dosage (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">20</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">21</ref>), where a small dosage of GBAC, in turn, functions as a passivation linker anchoring at the grain boundaries to reduce the defect density and enhance the film stability with its rigid stacking 8 .</p><p>To understand the impact of such hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate on film growth, periodic DFT calculations were performed to understand if GBAC + can spontaneously exchange with FA + during the crystallization process. Due to the substantial hydrogen bonding, the formation energy of this intermediate (GBAC-PbI 2 -DMF) (-18.58 eV) is much lower than that of δ-FAPbI 3 (-10.60 eV). Such extra stabilization is not thermodynamically favourable for crystal growth, since extra energy is required to enable the cation exchange between GBAC + and FA + (ref. 31). During the subsequent thermal annealing, the hydrogen bonds in the GBAC-PbI 2 -DMF phase were broken to form GBAC-PbI 2 Article <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41566-023-01180-6">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41566-023-01180-6</ref> with an energy of -11.85 eV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">3c</ref>). Although this significantly reduced energy barrier (1.25 eV) is easier to overcome, it will still hinder the free exchange between GBAC + and FA + , thereby slowing down the crystallization process <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</p><p>In addition to thermodynamic control, the nucleation rate mediated by kinetic control can also be altered by increasing the activation energy of cation exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . Compared with the Lewis acid-base adduct formed between PbI 2 and DMF (-0.79 eV) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">3d</ref>), the stronger ionic bonding between GBAC and PbI 2 (-1.16 eV) will cost extra energy to overcome the saddling point (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">22</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">23</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . Moreover, based on the Arrhenius equation, the inherent nucleation and growth kinetics originating from the high volatility of DMF and strong FA-precursor binding to DMF (-1.00 eV) (ref. 36) will also be hindered by the more stable GBAC-PbI 2 phase. Therefore, the crystal growth of the perovskite can be both thermodynamically and kinetically modulated by this hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">24</ref>). Due to the strong interaction between GBAC and perovskite, the retarded film formation would also accumulate GBAC at the bottom interface (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">25</ref>). Eventually, rigidly stacked GBAC can form at the grain boundaries due to π-π interaction after DMF evaporation, acting as a multifunctional passivation linker to enhance the photovoltaic performance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">3e</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Photovoltaic performance</head><p>The inverted PVSCs with a device configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/((2,7-dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl) methyl) phosphonic acid (DC-PA) (ref. 21)/perovskite (with/without GBAC)/C60/bathocuproine/Ag were fabricated to evaluate their photovoltaic performance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">4a</ref>, Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">26</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">27</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">4b</ref>, the highest PCE of the control device is 22.8%, with V OC of 1.12 V, J SC of 24.48 mA cm -2 and FF of 83.01%. However, the champion PCE of the GBAC-treated device can be further improved to 24.8% (V OC of 1.19 V, J SC of 24.55 mA cm -2 and FF of 84.78%), which is among the highest efficiencies reported so far for inverted PVSCs. The stabilized power output of the target champion device is 24.4%, matching well with the PCEs from the J-V measurement (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">4c</ref>). The device performance was also validated at an independent laboratory ( Japan Electrical Safety &amp; Environment Technology Laboratories) to show a  certified PCE of 24.5% (V OC = 1.19 V, J SC = 24.45 mA cm -2 and FF = 84.20%) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">28</ref>). The integrated photocurrent (24.38 mA cm -2 ) from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum also matches well with the values obtained from the J-V measurements (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">4d</ref>). The bandgap of the perovskite is 1.55 eV, as obtained by calculating the EQE derivative (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">29</ref>). Benefiting from the enhanced film quality and defect passivation aided by GBAC, the average V OC value was boosted from 1.12 to 1.18 V (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">4e</ref>). The overall energy loss of the champion target device can be reduced to 0.36 eV, which is very close to that of GaAs photovoltaics and represents one of the lowest energy losses in high-PCE cases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">4f</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> . DFT calculations investigated the typical I Pb antisite defect on a PbI 2 -terminated surface, revealing that GBAC passivation can help reduce these deep-level charge-carrier traps (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">30</ref>). The trap density was reduced from 2.58 × 10 16 to 1.53 × 10 16 cm -3 after adding GBAC, further demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">31</ref>). Since adding GBAC can modulate crystallization to improve the film quality, this strategy can also be explored for fabricating large-area PVSCs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">32</ref>). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">4g</ref>, a large-area device (1.008 cm 2 ) delivered a PCE of 22.7% (V OC = 1.18 V, J SC = 24.83 mA cm -2 , FF = 77.43%), which is also one of the highest efficiencies reported for similar-sized PVSCs (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). Besides, the V OC and J SC values of this device are comparable with those obtained in small-area devices, showing great promise for device upscaling (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">33</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>). To demonstrate the general applicability of this approach to different perovskite compositions, we also fabricated devices based on a larger-bandgap perovskite (1.78 eV). The average PCE showed an increase from 15.70% to 16.61%, with average V OC improvement from 1.19 to 1.25 V, which is highly favourable for fabricating tandem photovoltaics (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">34</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(i) (ii) (ii) (ii) (iii) (i) (i) (ii) (iii) (i)</formula><p>Finally, we investigated the stability of devices under an accelerated aging condition based on the recognized protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> . Unencapsulated devices were aged under continuous heating at 65 ± 5 °C (under N 2 ). The target device showed a very small PCE decay (&lt;3%) after 1,200 h, whereas that of the control device decreased nearly 30% during the same period (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">4h</ref>). This shows that the interaction between GBAC and organic components (MA/FA) helps strengthen the film to avoid severe decomposition and sublimation under heating (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">35</ref>). The long-term operational stability of the unencapsulated devices was also measured by tracking the true maximum power point under continuous one-sun illumination (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">36</ref>) in a N 2 -filled glovebox. The target device maintained ~90% of its initial PCE after 500 h, whereas that of the control device decreased to ~30% of its original value (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">37</ref>). We also performed time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurements to probe the compositional changes and ion migration related to device degradation. The control devices show dramatic changes with ions migrated to the perovskite/ETL interface after aging (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">38</ref>). However, only negligible changes were observed in the target sample aged under the same condition. Such improved device stability can be attributed to the enhanced film morphology and inhibited ion migration by adding GBAC. If GBAC can be used in conjunction with more efficient encapsulation techniques and optimal perovskite compositions, further improved PVSC efficiency and stability can be expected to meet the requirements for practical applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In summary, we report an innovative strategy for achieving high-quality and stable perovskite films by employing a multifunctional, non-volatile additive, GBAC, which forms a unique hydrogen-bond-bridged  We experimentally and theoretically unveil the mechanism of GBAC in assisting perovskite film formation, providing a design guideline for selecting suitable non-volatile additives to enhance the film quality. The greatly ameliorated optoelectronic properties are attributed to improved film morphology and crystallinity, effective defect passivation and more efficient charge transfer at the more n-characteristic film surface. Consequently, an impressive PCE of 24.8% (24.5% certified), low energy loss (0.36 eV) and remarkable device stability were achieved in inverted PVSCs. Our approach can also be extended to fabricate wide-bandgap perovskite devices and upscale devices, providing a simple and effective way towards fabricating scalable and highly efficient PVSCs.</p></div>

The washed ITO glass was dried in a 75 °C oven for over 12 h. Then, the cleaned ITO substrates were subjected to ultraviolet-ozone for 25 min and transformed in a N 2 -filled glovebox for film fabrication. DC-PA (2 mg mL -1 in IPA) was dynamically spin coated onto the cleaned ITO at 3,000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 15 min.

The morphology of the samples was recorded by an SEM instrument (Philips XL30 FEG). Steady-state PL and time-resolved PL spectrum were obtained with an FLS980 spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh) with a pulsed excitation laser of 485 nm.

A 150-nm-thick magnesium fluoride layer was deposited on the back of the glass before measurements. The EQE values were collected by an Enlitech EQE measurement system. A silicon solar cell calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory was used to obtain the AM 1.5 G solar simulator's light intensity. The devices used for the stability test had the same structure as that for the J-V test.

The light source is a superluminescent diode with a range from 400 to 1,000 nm. The superluminescent diode source is equipped with a silicon photoelectric probe to monitor the change in light intensity and automatically adjust the intensity with the control of the host.

The films were aged under 85 ± 5 ℃ for about 72 h to accelerate the decomposition. The resonance peaks belonging to the protons (peak ϒ) of the MA amine disappeared in the aged sample, suggesting the loss of MA + in the control film after thermal aging. Also, the conformation of FA + changed in the aged control film, where the resonance of protons from the NH2 groups (peak α) in FA + became broadened after aging. However, for target film aged under the same condition, the resonance of protons (peak ϒ) from MA and the inequivalent protons of the NH2 groups (peak α) in FA + both well remained. These results indicate that GBAC can interact with the organic components to enhance thermal stability.</figDesc><graphic coords="39,91.15,75.07,412.99,227.85" type="bitmap" /></figure>
