<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>P-i-n geometry perovskite solar cells (PSCs) offer simplified fabrication, greater amenability to charge extraction layers, and low-temperature processing over n-i-p counterparts. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) can enhance the performance of p-i-n PSCs but ultrathin SAMs can be thermally unstable. We report a thermally robust hole-selective layer comprised of nickel oxide (NiO x ) nanoparticle film with a surface-anchored (4-(3,11-dimethoxy-7H-dibenzo[c,g]carbazol-7-yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (MeO-4PADBC) SAM that can improve and stabilize the NiO x /perovskite interface. The energetic alignment and favorable contact and binding between NiO x /MeO-4PADBC and perovskite reduced the voltage deficit of PSCs with various perovskite compositions and led to strong interface toughening effects under thermal stress. The resulting 1.53-electronvolt devices achieved 25.6% certified power conversion efficiency and maintained &gt;90% of their initial efficiency after continuously operating at 65 degrees Celsius for 1200 hours under 1-sun illumination.</p></div>

The investigation of the device's operational stability, with electrical bias under maximum power point (MPP) operation or at open-circuit voltage (V OC ), under elevated temperatures (65°to 85°C) is critical to improve the confidence in their stability and to meet the qualification of international stability standards (i.e., International Summit on Organic Photovoltic Stability (ISOS) and International Electrotechnical Commission 61215 standards) <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref>. Whereas most studies on the SAM-based PSCs have reported the operational stability at room temperature or enhanced the device's durability under thermal stress by stabilizing perovskite surface and bulk <ref type="bibr">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr">21)</ref>, the degradation effect of SAM-forming molecules under elevated tem-perature (&gt;65°C) have rarely been discussed (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S1</ref> and table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). The thermal stability of SAM-forming molecules depends largely on their bonding to the selected substrates, as the bond between the anchoring group and the spacer of the molecule can be broken through temperature-induced desorption <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>.</p><p>We report a new SAM, (4-(3,11-dimethoxy-7H-dibenzo[c,g]carbazol-7-yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (MeO-4PADBC), which we anchored to the NiO x film to fabricate inverted p-i-n PSCs (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S2</ref>). The NiO x /MeO-4PADBC exhibited an optimal dipole moment and amenable surface for favorable contact with perovskite that resulted in an ideal energetic alignment, fast hole extraction, and low defect density. Such an interface configuration also immobilized the SAM molecules at the NiO x /perovskite interface and produced a robust hole-selective layer (HSL) for thermally stable PSCs that had thermal-degradation activation energy ~3 times greater than that for ITO/MeO-4PADBC. These synergetic effects enabled 1.53-electron volt (eV) p-i-n PSCs V OC of 1.19 V (95% of calculated potential) and a verified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.6%. 1.68-and 1.80-eVwide bandgap perovskite composition devices also showed encouraging PCEs of 22.7 and 20.1%, respectively. Moreover, 1.53-eV PSCs using NiO x /MeO-4PADBC HSL maintained &gt;90% of initial efficiency in long-term operational stability tests under 65°C for 1200 hours, and extrapolation of the Arrhenius energy indicates that the solar cells should maintain 80% of initial efficiency for more than 10 months at 25°C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAM design and synthesis</head><p>Modulating the terminal functional group is an effective way to tune the interfacial interactions between SAMs and perovskite. For ex-ample, the introduction of two methoxy groups (OMe) into [2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (2PACz) enabled a new SAM, <ref type="bibr">[2-(3,6-</ref>dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (MeO-2PACz), which improved the interfacial contact and enabled a higher efficiency of p-i-n PSC compared with 2PACz <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref>. Nonetheless, the OMe substitution on the carbazole core also caused a decrease in dipole moment from ~2.0 D of 2PACz to ~0.2 D of MeO-2PACz, which in turn led to the offset between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the SAM molecule and the valence band maximum (VBM) of the perovskite <ref type="bibr">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr">26)</ref>. This phenomenon can be ascribed to high planarity and symmetry of the carbazole structure; the incorporation of two OMe groups with opposite directions of dipole moment resulted in a net molecular dipole moment of MeO-2PACz close to zero (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">1A</ref>). We addressed this issue by using a non-coplanar screw-shaped dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (DBC) unit as the core to reduce the negative effect on the dipole moment when introducing OMe groups, affording a new SAM of MeO-4PADBC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">1B</ref>). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations verified that MeO-4PADBC only has a slightly decreased dipole moment (2.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">S11C</ref>), which could induce a highly ordered one-dimensional assembly that favors a dense, tilted, highly ordered monolayer on the substrate (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">S11D</ref>) <ref type="bibr">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr">27,</ref><ref type="bibr">28)</ref>.</p><p>We then calculated the interfacial binding energies between SAMs and perovskite, showing that MeO-4PADBC has a stronger binding with perovskite with a total binding energy (E b ) of -7.19 eV, compared with that of -5.27 eV for MeO-2PACz (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S12</ref>). The main electrostatic interaction of the calculated SAMs is the O atoms from OMe groups with the Pb from perovskite, however MeO-4PADBC has a more energetically favorable contact with perovskite compared with MeO-2PACz, which can be ascribed to the more concentrated electron distribution of the coordinated OMe group on MeO-4PADBC than that on MeO-2PACz (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">S13</ref>). Moreover, Bader charge analysis also suggests a stronger Pb-O interaction between MeO-4PADBC and perovskite with a shorter calculated interaction length of 4.7 Å than that of MeO-2PACz of 4.9 Å (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">S14</ref>), which can be further confirmed by the results  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hole-selective layer applications</head><p>We compared MeO-4PADBC SAM and NiO x / MeO-4PADBC as the HSLs for p-i-n PSCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">1C</ref>). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were then collected by scraping the MeO-4PADBC and NiO x /MeO-4PADBC films off the substrates to amplify the signal, in which the P=O (1169 cm -1 ) and P-OH (1035 and 950 cm -1 ) absorption peaks show a clear shift (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">1D</ref>), indicating the formation of a chemical bond <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref>. This can be further confirmed by the changes of the Ni 2p core level of NiO x and NiO x /MeO-4PADBC films deposited on the indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates obtained by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">S16</ref>). The crystal structure and absorbance of representative perovskite film with a composition of Cs 0.05 FA 0.85 MA 0.1 PbI 3 on both substrates remained unchanged (figs. S17 and S18). However, the perovskite deposited on ITO/NiO x /MeO-4PADBC substrate had larger crystal domains than those on control substrates (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">S19</ref>). This is because of the denser anchoring of SAM molecules onto the ITO/NiO x substrate through more robust tridentate binding absorption, which can not only reduce the surface roughness of ITO/NiO x substrate (30-32) (figs. S20 and S21), but also lead to a more hydrophobic surface (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">S22</ref>) and stronger interaction between perovskite and SAM molecules <ref type="bibr">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr">(35)</ref>. These synergetic effects contribute to facilitating the perovskite crystal nucleation and growth, thus enhancing the perovskite crystallization.</p><p>We further used ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to assess the energetic alignment of different substrates relative to perovskite absorbers with different bandgaps (1.53, 1.68, and 1.8 eV, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">1E</ref> and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">S23</ref>), and the results are summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">1F</ref>. The HOMO energy levels are -5.34 eV for ITO/MeO-4PADBC and -5.45 eV ITO/NiO x /MeO-4PADBC, respectively, and the work function (Φ) of the latter substrate is deeper than that of the former one (-4.95 versus -4.90 eV), indicative of better energetic alignment with different perovskite absorbers. However, upon application of the carbazole-based SAM molecules onto the ITO/ NiO x surface, the ITO/NiO x /MeO-2PACz system exhibited an upward shift of the Φ, in contrast to the ITO/NiO x /2PACz substrate (26, 36) (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">S24</ref>). This phenomenon can be attributed to the incorporation of OMe groups on 2PACz, which considerably reduced the dipole moment. This reduction can be explained by the highly planar carbazole motif, as discussed earlier. Timeresolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay data showed a decreased carrier lifetime from 925.5 ns for the perovskite on ITO to 42.9 and 32.3 ns for the perovskite on ITO/MeO-4PADBC and ITO/NiO x /MeO-4PADBC, respectively, indicating a more facilitated hole extraction resulted by the ITO/NiO x /MeO-4PADBC substrate (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">S25</ref> and table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Solar cell performance and characterization</head><p>We further evaluated the photovoltaic performance of PSCs with a p-i-n device configuration: glass/ITO/HSL/perovskite/two-dimensional (2D) passivation layer/C 60 /bathocuproine (BCP)/ Ag (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2A</ref>). The 2D passivation layer was a mixture of 4-trifluorophenylethylammonium iodide (CF 3 -PEAI) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) with an optimal volume ratio of 3:1 (4). The cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the PSC (1.53 eV) showed a thickness of ~715 nm for the perovskite films (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">S26</ref>). The device with NiO x /MeO-4PADBC as the HSL (1.53 eV) showed negligible hysteresis and had a high verified PCE of 25.6% for a mask area of 0.0414 cm 2 (figs. S27 and S28), with a V OC of 1.19 V, a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 25.4 mA cm -2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 84.6%, which outperformed the MeO-4PADBC-based device (PCE = 24.2% with V OC = 1.16 V, J SC = 25.4 mA cm -2 , and FF = 82.1%). The NiO x control device without a SAM only showed a PCE of 21.6%, attributed to a mismatch of energetic alignment and high surface defect density on NiO x film (37, 38) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2B</ref>). Moreover, we have also conducted HSL engineering by applying carbazole-based SAM anchoring on NiO x . The V OC of the NiO x /MeO-2PACz-based device (1.15 V) is lower than that of the device with NiO x /2PACz (1.17 V) (figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">S29, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). This issue was addressed by replacing the carbazole motif with a nonplanar DBC core in SAM molecules (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">S29, C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). To better understand the mechanism of the improved V OC and FF with the use of NiO x / MeO-4PADBC as HSL, we further conducted the FF loss (supplementary text and fig. <ref type="figure">S30</ref>) and V OC loss calculations (supplementary text, fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">S31</ref>, and table <ref type="table">S3</ref>). We observed that the improved V OC and FF of NiO x /MeO-4PADBC were mainly attributed to the suppressed nonradiative recombination loss, indicating reduced trap state density at the HSL/perovskite interface.</p><p>Our NiO x /MeO-4PADBC strategy also worked effectively for 1.68-and 1.80-eV PSCs, resulting in PCEs of 22.7 and 20.1%, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2C</ref>, fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">S32</ref>, and table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S4</ref>). Steady-state power output (SPO) confirmed the reliability of three bandgap devices, with stabilized PCEs of 25.5, 22.3, and 19.5% for 1.53-, 1.68-and 1.80-eV, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2D</ref>). Additionally, the calculated J SC values from external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the champion devices were consistent with those extracted from the current density-voltage (J-V) measurements (fig. <ref type="figure">S33</ref>), and the derivatives of EQE spectra can further confirm the perovskite bandgaps applied here (fig. <ref type="figure">S34</ref>). We further presented the EQE with internal quantum efficiency (IQE) results of representative 1.53-eV device with HSLs of NiO x , MeO-4PADBC, and NiO x /MeO-4PADBC in fig. <ref type="figure">S35</ref>. The IQE between 550 nm to 700 nm is spectrally flat and approaches nearly 100% for both of MeO-4PADBC and NiO x /MeO-4PADBC-based devices, indicating efficient charge collection and transfer at the perovskite interface achieved by the incorporation of SAM <ref type="bibr">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr">39)</ref>.</p><p>The defect density profiles were then studied to identify enhanced photovoltaic performance through the space charge limit current (SCLC) method (fig. <ref type="figure">S36</ref>). The hole-only devices with NiO x /MeO-4PADBC showed the lowest defect density of 1.96×10 15 cm -<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">foot_3</ref> , compared with those with MeO-4PADBC (2.91×10 15 cm -3 ) and NiO x (3.81×10 15 cm -3 ). In addition, the decreased slope of the light intensity dependence V OC plot for NiO x /MeO-4PADBC-based devices supported a reduced interfacial trap density at the HSL/perovskite interface (40) (fig. <ref type="figure">S37</ref>). We note that PSCs based on NiO x / MeO-4PADBC further demonstrated a lower leakage current than those on other HSLs (fig. <ref type="figure">S38</ref>), which we attributed to the compact NiO x layer preventing the perovskite from contacting ITO through the pinholes in the ultrathin SAM layer. These results demonstrated that the NiO x /MeO-4PADBC HSL effectively increased the V OC of the PSCs.</p><p>To quantify the interface losses, quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) analysis for partial cell stacks was conducted. A laser wavelength of 375 nm was used to illuminate a PSC with 1-sun equivalent intensity by accommodating the generated current near J SC under a standard solar simulator <ref type="bibr">(41,</ref><ref type="bibr">42)</ref> (supplementary text, fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">S39</ref>). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2E</ref>, the QFLS of ITO/NiO x /MeO-4PADBC/perovskite stack was comparable to the glass/perovskite stack, with implied V OC of 1.17 V versus 1.18 V for 1.53-eV perovskite film, 1.26 V versus 1.27 V for 1.68-eV perovskite film, and 1.35 V versus 1.36 V for 1.80-eV perovskite film, respectively. These results indicated a low voltage loss on the interface between NiO x /MeO-4PADBC and perovskites.</p><p>We further performed the QFLS measurements on the ITO/HSL/perovskite/passivation layer/electron-transporting layer (ETL) stacks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2F</ref>), with the V OC s of the PSCs listed as a comparison. The differences between the QFLS of PSCs on ITO/NiO x /MeO-4PADBC and the V OC extracted from related J-V measurements were comparable, demonstrating spatially flat Fermi levels throughout the device and low energy offset on the HSL for carrier extraction <ref type="bibr">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr">28)</ref>. It is noteworthy that the V OC of our 1.53-eV devices (1.19 V) reached 95% of their calculated potential and the V OC of our 1.68-eV (1.25 V) and 1.80-eV (1.34 V) devices also approached 90% of the calculated potential (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2G</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSC stability studies</head><p>Previous reports have demonstrated that SAMs desorb under thermal stress from the anchored After aging on a hotplate at 65°C for 1200 hours, the NiO x /MeO-4PADBC substrate displayed negligible CPD changes, whereas the ITO/MeO-4PADBC CPD value increased to ~70 mV (Fig. <ref type="figure">3, C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). We propose that the fluctuations of CPD for the ITO/MeO-4PADBC substrate could be attributed to desorption, morphological changes under thermal stress, or both.</p><p>To further explore the binding ability of SAM to the substrate under heating, DFT simulations were conducted to investigate the binding energies between MeO-4PADBC and ITO or NiO x substrate at 300 K (~27°C) and 340 K (~67°C) (Fig. <ref type="figure">3, E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>). MeO-4PADBC had a higher binding energy with NiO x (-22.4 eV) than with ITO (-16.7 eV) at 300 K, suggesting a stronger bonding strength on the NiO x film. This difference was attributed to the higher density of hydroxyl groups on the NiO x surface than on the ITO, which is critical to the chemisorption of SAM on the metal oxide <ref type="bibr">(43,</ref><ref type="bibr">44)</ref>.</p><p>The tridentate binding between SAM and NiO x was stronger than the bidentate binding between SAM and ITO <ref type="bibr">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr">45)</ref>. At 340 K, the binding energy between SAM and ITO decreased from -16.7 to -11.6 eV, but that between MeO-4PADBC and NiO x film showed minor changes (-20.3 eV). These results indicated that MeO-4PADBC on the NiO x film is more robust against thermal stress compared with MeO-4PADBC on bare ITO. Thermal accelerated aging measurements were conducted to evaluate the reliability of SAM-based PSCs. To avoid the influence of the 2D capping layer, the encapsulated devices without top passivation were prepared for stability testing. The initial J-V curves and photographs of the encapsulated devices are shown in fig. <ref type="figure">S40</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">S41</ref>, respectively. The PSCs were operated under constant 1-sun illumination at fixed resistance loads near the MPP with the temperature ranging from 25°to 100°C, following the ISOS-L-2I procedure <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref>. The MeO-4PADBC-based devices degraded to 85 and 65% of starting PCEs after 1200 hours at 25°C and 65°C, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>). When the aging temperature increased to 85°C, only 47% of its initial PCE was retained after 800 hours. The NiO x devices retained 85 and 65% of initial PCEs at 65°and 85°C, respectively, after 1200 hours (Fig. <ref type="figure">4B</ref>). However, the NiO x /MeO-4PADBC-based devices retained 90 and 74% of initial PCEs after 1200 hours at 65°and 85°C, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">4C</ref>), which was consistent with the degradation analysis in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Both devices based on NiO x , MeO-4PADBC, or NiO x /MeO-4PADBC as HSL showed a more obvious downward trend when the aging temperature was raised to 100°C. For a more comprehensive evaluation of the thermal stability of our NiO x /MeO-4PADBC strategy, we further applied the PSCs with top passivation to conduct the operational stability at 65°C for 500 hours (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">S42</ref>). The devices presented a slightly improved stability compared with the device without passivation at the same time stage, which maintained 96% of its initial PCE. This may be due to the higher hydrophobic surface brought by the CF 3 -PEAI passivation <ref type="bibr">(46)</ref>.</p><p>We then determined the activation energy (E a ) of the temperature-dependent degradation of our PSCs with different HSLs according to a previously reported method (supplementary text) <ref type="bibr">(47)</ref>. The E a value of NiO x /MeO-4PADBCbased devices (0.389 ± 0.022 eV) was almost three times higher than that of MeO-4PADBCbased devices (0.150 ± 0.017 eV). The lifetime acceleration factor (AF) of each temperature can be obtained from E a (Fig. <ref type="figure">4D</ref>), from which it can be estimated that PSCs with NiO x /MeO-4PADBC HSL could retained 80% of its initial PCE at room temperature after 7567 hours operation, without top passivation treatment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability tests</head><p>The long-term operational stability was conducted by following ISOS-L-2I procedure. Before the tests, the PSCs were encapsulated (LT-U001, Luminescence Technology Corp.) with cover glass (1.1 mm). The encapsulated PSCs were operated under 1 sun equivalent LED lamp in a N2-filled glovebox (with the contents of O2 and H2O &lt;5 ppm). The PSCs were biased at maximum-power-point (MPP) voltage and the power output was tracked by using a multipotentiostat (CHI1040C, CH Instruments, Inc.). During the MPP test, the current densityvoltage (J-V) curves of the devices were obtained every 12 h to get the proper loads for the MPP.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected in the reflection mode at room temperature on a Philips X'Pert diffractometer equipped with a CPS 180 detector using monochromated Cu-Kα (λ = 1.5418 A) radiation. The surface and cross-section morphology of the perovskite films were acquired by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (QUATTROS, Thermal Fisher Scientific). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was conducted in a surface analysis system (VG ESCALAB 220i XL) equipped with a Hedischarge lamp (hv = 21.22 eV) and a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray gun (hv = 1,486.60 eV), respectively. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) data were acquired via Bruker Dimension Kelvin probe force microscopy in Potential Channel equipped with PFQNE-AL probe, which is a platinum-iridium coated tip with a frequency of ≈300 kHz and a nominal tip radius of ≈5 nm. To calibrate the KPFM measurements, we developed a method using an Al-Si-Au standard. The average contact potential distribution (CPD) profile was extracted from the calibration sample, and the work function of the tip (𝑊 𝐹 𝑡𝑖𝑝 ) was calculated using the value of the CPD in the gold region (𝑊 𝐹 𝐴𝑢 ) as 𝑊 𝐹 𝑡𝑖𝑝 = 𝑊 𝐹 𝐴𝑢 -𝑒𝐶𝑃𝐷 . The measurements were performed on Bruker Dimension ICON, with the sample fixed in a custom-made vertical sample holder. The chamber was filled with high-purity nitrogen to minimize the influence of ambient conditions on the measurements. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was conducted by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Tensor 27, Germany Bruker). FTIR spectra were taken from KBr pellet-pressed power samples to amplify the signal. The powder samples were obtained by scrapping the films off the substrates. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained by Edinburgh FLS980 applied with an excitation wavelength of 375 nm. Quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) were calculated by the data extracted from photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) via exciting the corresponding samples by a 375 nm laser (Edinburgh, EPL-375) inside an integrated sphere (Edinburgh FLS980). A PSC was used to adjust the laser intensity to 1 sun equivalent intensity by obtaining a current density at 0 V approximately equal to its short-circuit current density (JSC) under standard solar simulator. Highly sensitive external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by an integrated system (PECT-600, Enlitech, Taiwan), where the photocurrent was amplified and modulated by a lock-in instrument.

Due to non-conjugated linking alkyl fragment, the hole selective fragment is electronically decoupled from the phosphonic acid, the contribution of the phosphonic acid group to the final dipole moment can be excluded. Therefore, for the calculations the phosphonic acid (PA) fragment was replaced by hydrogen. DFT calculations were performed calculated at B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) level with Grimme's D3BJ empirical dispersion correction by Gaussian 16.  </p></div>

Compound 2 (0.7 g, 1.5 mmol) was dissolved in triethyl phosphite (10 ml, 52.49 mmol) and the mixture was heated at 140 °C overnight. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the crude product was purified by column chromatography (DCM:EtOAc 1:2 v/v) to give yellowish resin. The yellowish resin was dissolved in anhydrous 1,4-dioxane (15 mL) under argon atmosphere and bromotrimethylsilane (1.5 ml, 11 mmol) was added dropwise. Reaction was stirred for 22 h at 25 o C under argon atmosphere. Methanol (2 mL) was added and stirring continued for 3 h. Finally, distilled water was added dropwise (15 ml), until solution became opaque, and it was stirred for 2 h. Product was filtered off, washed with water and recrystallization in a mixture of THF and DCM to give 0.40 g (57.7 %) of white powder. 1 H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 8.93 (d, J = 9.1 Hz, 2H), 7.98 (d, J = 8.9 Hz, 2H), 7.90 (d, J = 8.9 Hz, 2H), 7.58 (d, J = 2.7 Hz, 2H), 7.36 (dd, J = 9.2, 2.7 Hz, 2H), 4.66 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 3.94 (s, 7H), 1.99 -1.84 (m, 2H), 1.67 -1.49 (m, 4H). 13       </p></div>

The ion-electron interactions were treated by augmented plane waves (PAW) method and the energy cutoff was set as 500 eV. The GGA-PBE exchange and correlation functional was employed for all DFT computations. The Brillouin zone was using a Gamma-centered grid of k-points. A vacuum slab of 15 angstrom was added to each interfacial bulk model to avoid possible interactions between the periodic slabs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary text: Open-circuit voltage (VOC) loss analysis</head><p>The detailed VOC,loss can be described by the equation listed below:</p><p>where q, ∆V, Eg is the elementary charge, the total voltage loss, and the bandgap of perovskite, respectively. VOC SQ is the S-Q limit of open circuit voltage, VOC rad is the VOC without nonradiative recombination occurring in PSCs, ∆VOC SQ is the VOC loss due to the non-ideal EQE above the bandgap, ∆VOC rad is the VOC loss due to the sub-bandgap radiative recombination, and ∆VOC non-rad is the VOC loss of non-radiative recombination. The calculation method was following detailed balance theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(59)</ref>. Therefore, the energy loss can be divided into three parts, ΔV1, ΔV2 and ΔV3, which represent radiative recombination above Eg, energy loss from blackbody radiation and voltage loss induced by the nonradiative recombination, respectively.    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary text: space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement</head><p>Defect density calculations: The hole-only devices with the configurations of ITO/HSLs/perovskite/MoO3/Ag were prepared to calculate the defect density (N). In the SCLC regime, the current is dominated by charge carriers injected from the contacts and the currentvoltage characteristics become quadratic (I ~ V 2 ). Fig. <ref type="figure">S36</ref> shows the J-V curves of the fabricated devices on a double logarithmic scale, which comprises the ohmic region, the trapfilling limit (TFL) region and the child region. In the TFL region, the trap-state density (Nt) can be calculated by the following equation：</p><p>where ε = 26 and ε0 = 8.85E-12 F m -1 are the relative dielectric constant and vacuum permittivity, respectively. VTFL is the onset voltage of TFL region, q is elementary charge. L represents thickness of perovskite thin film (715 nm).   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary text: calculation of QFLS</head><p>The PLQY, which is related to the QFLS under the presumption that all PL emission results from the radiative recombination of free charges in perovskite film, can be represented by the following equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(60)</ref>.</p><p>where KB, and T represent Boltzmann constant and temperature, respectively. JG is the current density under illumination, and J0,rad is the dark radiative recombination saturation current density.</p><p>The following equations can be used to calculate the in accordance with the detailed balance theory:</p><p>Where q,EQEPV, 𝜙 𝐵𝐵 , E, h, c represents elementary charge, photovoltaic external quantum efficiency, black-body radiative spectrum, photon energy, Planck constant, and light speed in vacuum, respectively.</p><p>The highly-sensitive EQE shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">S39</ref>, which can be applied to evaluate the J0,rad. For 1.53 eV device, the J0,rad can be calculated as 1.48×10 -20 mA cm -2 for MeO-4PADBC device, and 1.50×10 -20 mA cm -2 for NiOx/MeO-4PADBC device. For 1.68 eV device, the J0,rad can be calculated as 1.96× 1 0 -22 mA cm -2 for MeO-4PADBC device, and 1.66× 1 0 -22 mA cm -2 for NiOx/MeO-4PADBC device. For 1.80 eV device, the J0,rad can be calculated as 3.92×10 -24 mA cm -2 for MeO-4PADBC device, and 2.12×10 -24 mA cm -2 for NiOx/MeO-4PADBC device. In this instance, JG stands for the generation current density under illumination, which is roughly equivalent to the JSC of devices. Subsequently, the PLQY of samples were measured with a 375 nm laser inside an integrated sphere. The laser illuminates the samples with a 1-sun equivalent intensity by adjusting the produced current close to the JSC of the devices. Then the QFLS of samples can be calculated from equation S5.</p></div>			</div>
