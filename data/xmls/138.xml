To improve efficiency further, it is crucial to combine effective light management with low interfacial losses <ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5</ref> . Here we develop a conformal self-assembled monolayer (SAM) as the hole-selective contact on lightmanaging textured substrates. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that cluster formation during phosphonic acid adsorption leads to incomplete SAM coverage. We devise a co-adsorbent strategy that disassembles high-order clusters, thus homogenizing the distribution of phosphonic acid molecules, and thereby minimizing interfacial recombination and improving electronic structures. We report a laboratorymeasured power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.3% and a certified quasi-steady-state PCE of 24.8% for inverted PSCs, with a photocurrent approaching 95% of the Shockley-Queisser maximum. An encapsulated device having a PCE of 24.6% at room temperature retains 95% of its peak performance when stressed at 65 °C and 50% relative humidity following more than 1,000 h of maximum power point tracking under 1 sun illumination. This represents one of the most stable PSCs subjected to accelerated ageing: achieved with a PCE surpassing 24%. The engineering of phosphonic acid adsorption on textured substrates offers a promising avenue for efficient and stable PSCs. It is also anticipated to benefit other optoelectronic devices that require light management.</p><p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently attained a certified efficiency of 26.1% (ref. 6); however, the very highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) devices have yet to meet operating stability under accelerated ageing tests <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . The limited device stability is attributed to the presence of mobile and hygroscopic p-type dopants in hole-transporting layers, which undermine moisture and thermal stability <ref type="bibr">7</ref> . Inverted PSCs present a solution by utilizing undoped hole-selective contacts <ref type="bibr">8</ref> . Recent studies have shown PCEs surpassing 25% for inverted PSCs 2 . However, when adhering to the stringent quasi-steady-state (QSS) protocol, their certified efficiency (approximately 24%) requires further improvement <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">9</ref> . Efforts to improve inverted PSC efficiency have focused on interface passivation <ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr">10</ref> . This approach suppresses non-radiative recombination and thus improves fill factors and photovoltages <ref type="bibr">11</ref> . Nevertheless, higher photocurrents are needed for efficiency gains. In normal-structure PSCs, this has been realized using textured fluorine-doped tin oxides (FTO) as the transparent conductive oxides (TCO) <ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5</ref> . The pyramidal grains on FTO minimize reflection losses and extend the length of the average optical path <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . By contrast, inverted PSCs, often built on smooth indium tin oxides (ITOs) <ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr">10</ref> , face substantial optical losses due to the lack of light management.</p><p>The discrepancy is ascribed to differences in transporting materials and deposition techniques. In normal-structure PSCs, inorganic hole-blocking layers are conformally deposited on textured substrates using spray pyrolysis and chemical bath deposition <ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5</ref> . However, inverted PSCs typically use ultrathin (less than 5 nm) organic hole-selective contacts on substrates <ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3</ref> , which can be challenging to deposit uniformly using solution processing <ref type="bibr">12</ref> . Inhomogeneity leads to energy losses and insufficient carrier extraction <ref type="bibr">13</ref> .</p><p>Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), particularly those composed of phosphonic acid molecules with hole-selective tail groups, have shown promise in addressing this issue <ref type="bibr">14</ref> . Phosphonic acids establish coordinative/covalent bonds with TCOs, enabling sufficient SAM coverage Article on rough surfaces <ref type="bibr">15</ref> . This could provide a low-loss interface, uniting light management with interface passivation. Indeed, photocurrent improvements have been observed when replacing SAM-modified ITO with FTO substrates in inverted PSCs <ref type="bibr">16</ref> .</p><p>Despite their promise, achieving a high-density, closely packed SAM remains challenging, which leads to erratic interfacial properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">17</ref> . For example, Liu and co-workers revealed that phosphonic acids failed to fully cover textured wafers, which affected the performance of tandem solar cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">18</ref> . Even on flat substrates, the formation of SAMs tends to be non-uniform, a problem usually attributed to the limited solubility of phosphonic acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">19</ref> and their insufficient chemical bond formation with metal oxides <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">20</ref> .</p><p>Several strategies have been proposed to ensure conformal SAM coverage, such as utilizing more reactive oxide surfaces (for example, nickel oxides) to promote hetero condensation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">18</ref> , using thermal evaporation for SAM deposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">21</ref> and designing highly soluble phosphonic acid molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">19</ref> . However, these methods can be laborious, requiring time-intensive molecule design, synthesis and vacuum-based layer deposition. Additionally, the use of highly reactive oxides could compromise device stability owing to redox reactions with ammonium halides <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">22</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Molecular dynamics simulations</head><p>We sought to deepen understanding of how phosphonic acids interact with textured TCOs. We began by looking at the case of 2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (2PACz), an organic molecule (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>) capable of forming SAMs on TCOs <ref type="bibr">14</ref> , and investigated its interactions with FTO. 2PACz has found extensive applications as a hole-selective contact in PSCs in view of its excellent defect passivation and deep highest occupied molecular orbital level <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">21</ref> . The surface properties of FTO were approximated using tin oxides (SnO 2 ), since commercial FTO has a fluorine-doping level under 0.5% (atomic percentage) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">23</ref> . Flat versus corrugated SnO 2 was analysed to understand the effects of surface morphology (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>).</p><p>Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that 2PACz molecules can agglomerate, forming dimers, trimers and tetramers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). Within the initial 1 nanosecond of simulations, 90% of the final number of clusters has been reached (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>), and dimers were the most prevalent among those clusters (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref>). Compared to flat surfaces, textured surfaces led to more clusters (for example, 7 versus 0 for 20 2PACz molecules on 6 nm wide SnO 2 ) (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>). The cluster formation is closely linked to the inhomogeneity of SAMs on FTO. For instance, when 162 2PACz molecules are positioned on top of textured SnO 2 surfaces, despite their initial random distribution (Supplementary Video 1), the final equilibrated structures exhibit clear phase segregation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d</ref>), in which almost 85% of the SnO 2 surface remains uncovered by any 2PACz molecules (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). These observations were also verified in a larger system (22 nm width; 1,134 2PACz molecules) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</p><p>Reasoning that a thiol group (-SH) could interact with phosphonic acids and a carboxyl group (-COOH) attached to FTO, we introduced 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>) in simulations to break apart 2PACz clusters, particularly on textured substrates. The approach is akin to the co-adsorbent strategy used in dye-sensitized solar cells to reduce dye aggregation on titanium oxides <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">24</ref> . Similar strategies have been used to improve the quality of hole-selective SAMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">26</ref> . With 3-MPA at a molar ratio of 1:9 with 2PACz, we saw a relative 15% decrease in the number of clusters on textured surfaces (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>), and a slower formation rate (20 ns -1 versus 28 ns -1 ) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). In particular, the higher order clusters (trimers and tetramers) decreased by 53% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref>). As a result, the mixed system shows less phase segregation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1e</ref> and Supplementary Video 2), leading to extended surface coverage (67% versus 15%) by 2PACz molecules (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>) indicate that the presence of 3-MPA hinders the free movement of individual 2PACz molecules by forming a supramolecular structure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1f</ref>). This reduces agglomeration with already formed dimers, suppressing the formation of higher-order clusters (Supplementary Video 3). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed surface binding energies of -3.2 eV and -2.6 eV for 2PACz and 3-MPA, respectively, which are much stronger than the interaction energies of 2PACz clusters (-0.3 to -0.1 eV per molecule). This indicates robust anchoring of 2PACz and 3-MPA molecules on contact with substrate surfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterization of organic contacts</head><p>We deposited both 2PACz and a mixture of 2PACz:3-MPA on FTO substrates using solution processing, followed by annealing the film at 100 °C and solvent washing (Methods). Micelles were detected in the processing solutions through dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>). However, owing to their limited proportion in the volume distribution compared to 2PACz monomers, film formation primarily resulted from molecular diffusion rather than direct micellar adsorption <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">27</ref> .</p><p>The film composition and its interaction with FTO substrates were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), respectively. For the film consisting solely of 2PACz molecules (the control), the presence of 2PACz was evidenced by the appearance of the phosphine (P) doublet peak (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref>) and the characteristic C-N peak and C-C/C-H peak (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">10</ref>) in the XPS spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">21</ref> . In the case of mixed film, 3-MPA was indicated by the sulfur (S) 2p doublet peak at around 163.8 eV (that is, the thiol group) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">28</ref> . From ATR-FTIR, bidentate or tridentate binding was identified as the mode of 2PACz-FTO interactions, given the appearance of the symmetric PO 3 2-stretching (at 996 cm -1 for the control sample) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">30</ref> and the disappearance of P-OH vibrations <ref type="bibr">14</ref> . These also indicated that solvent washing removed unbound molecules <ref type="bibr">14</ref> . With 3-MPA addition, a redshift of approximately 5 cm -1 was observed for the PO 3 2-vibrational mode, indicating the enhanced surface binding of 2PACz-as confirmed by AIMD simulations (Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">11</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">12</ref>). ATR-FTIR of the FTO/3-MPA sample (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>) further showed carboxylate-related peaks and a reduction in the intensity of the C=O peak, which correspond to the bidentate chelation of 3-MPA with FTO surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">31</ref> . Combining the results from XPS and ATR-FTIR, we reasoned that 3-MPA functioned as a co-adsorbent, modulating the interaction of 2PACz with FTO substrates. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Article</head><p>The resultant SAM uniformity was characterized by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Topography images revealed that, despite varying SAM modifications, the surface morphology of FTO substrates was retained owing to the ultrathin nature of SAMs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">13</ref>). From the respective contact potential difference (CPD) maps (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2c</ref>), we recorded surface potential variations on 2PACz-modified surfaces within a range of 120 mV. A Gaussian fit of the single peak in the CPD distribution yielded the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of 37 mV (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">14</ref>). Introducing 3-MPA enhanced the homogeneity of electronic properties on SAM-modified surfaces, as reflected by a narrower CPD distribution with the FWHM of 22 mV.</p><p>To directly visualize the distribution of SAMs on FTO substrates, we performed high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2d</ref> shows cross-sectional HAADF-STEM images of both control and mixed samples. Because of the contrast in the atomic number <ref type="bibr">2</ref> , SAM was discernible as a dark layer sandwiched between the brighter FTO and protective molybdenum oxide (MoO x ) layers. For the control SAM, we observed thickness variations across the same FTO facet, with certain regions showing thicknesses less than 1 nm. This suggests a low-density coverage and inhomogeneous distribution of 2PACz molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">32</ref> . The mixed sample exhibited significant improvements in terms of SAM uniformity and coverage; a consistent thickness was recorded for the mixed SAM on the same facet, albeit with variations between 1 and 2 nm across different facets. Correspondingly, mixed SAM-modified FTO substrates exhibited higher hydrophobicity than control SAM-modified counterparts (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">15</ref>). Cyclic voltammetry measurements further determined the areal density of 2PACz in the mixed SAM to be   and mixed (right) SAMs. The colour bar shows the diffraction intensity collected from the GIWAXS detector. q xy and q z represent in-plane and near out-of-plane scattering vectors, respectively. d,e, TOF-SIMS profiles of perovskites on FTO/ control SAM (d) and FTO/mixed SAM (e) substrates measured in negative polarity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterization of perovskite films</head><p>To investigate the impact of SAMs on the structural and optoelectronic properties of perovskites, we fabricated triple-cation Cs 0.05 MA 0.10 FA 0.85 PbI 3 perovskite thin films on different FTO/SAM substrates. From scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we observed no notable change in the perovskite surface morphology when 3-MPA was incorporated into the SAM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements showed nearly identical crystal structures for perovskites deposited on both the control and mixed SAMs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3c</ref>). Here, the main constituent was photoactive α-phase perovskites, with traces of the 4H hexagonal phase detected at q = 0.82 Å -1 and 0.92 Å -1 as well as PbI 2 at q = 0.90 Å -1 , respectively (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">14</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">33</ref> . Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) further confirmed that both 3-MPA and 2PACz molecules, owing to their chemisorption on FTO surfaces, remained localized at the perovskite-FTO interfaces (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>). These findings suggest that 3-MPA is not likely to change the perovskite formation process or contribute to the grain boundary or top surface passivation.</p><p>We conducted photoluminescence characterization by exciting perovskite thin films at a 1 sun equivalent photon flux. We saw an average photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 0.13% ± 0.02% for perovskites directly deposited onto FTO substrates, corresponding to a quasi-Fermi level splitting of 1.105 eV (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">34</ref> . 2PACz can passivate defects on metal oxide surfaces and effectively block electron injection <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">35</ref> , resulting in an approximately 50-fold increase in the photoluminescence intensity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3f</ref>). We noted an average PLQY of 7% ± 2% for the perovskite/2PACz/FTO stacks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3g</ref>), corresponding to a quasi-Fermi level splitting of 1.207 eV. The incorporation of 3-MPA further improved the average PLQY to 10% ± 1%. This we ascribed to better SAM coverage rather than 3-MPA passivation, as the thiol group of 3-MPA was embedded within the SAM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1f</ref>).</p><p>We used ultraviolet and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS and IPES) to determine the work function and transport energy levels of perovskites and SAMs. The secondary electron cutoff in the UPS spectra indicated an increase in the work function from 4.56 to 4.93 eV on depositing the control SAM on the FTO substrate (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">18</ref>). 3-MPA led to an additional work function shift of +100 meV. The ionization energy was 5.51 and 5.64 eV for the control and mixed SAMs, respectively. By contrast, perovskites exhibited similar conduction band minima and valance band maxima on different substrates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3h</ref>). The resultant energy-level diagrams of perovskites and SAMs are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3i,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>. A vacuum level shift of 0.17 eV was recorded between the perovskite and the 2PACz bilayer, which further increased to 0.32 eV for the perovskite/mixed SAM bilayer <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">36</ref> . A higher vacuum level shift indicates an enlarged built-in field <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">37</ref> , which in PSCs can lead to enhanced carrier extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">38</ref> . Meanwhile, the ionization energy offset between the bilayer remained consistent for the control and mixed SAMs (referenced to the Fermi level (E F )).</p></div>

All AIMD simulations were performed at Γ point. Being the most stable surface, the SnO 2 (110) was chosen as the substrate surface. The systems were equilibrated over 5 ps in the NVT ensemble and the remaining 40 ps were used for the production run. To investigate the interactions between the 2PACz and 3-MPA molecules, as well as molecules and the SnO  <ref type="formula">110</ref>)); E S is the energy of the final configuration of the slab; and E mol is the energy of the final configuration of the isolated molecule. The interaction energies of 2PACz clusters were computed after DFT relaxations of isolated clusters. Dimers, trimers and tetramers were considered. Interaction energies per molecule were calculated as ΔE i = (E tot - nE mol )/n, where E tot is the energy of the final relaxed cluster; n is the number of molecules forming the cluster; and E mol is the energy of a single relaxed molecule assumed isolated. Vibrational power spectra were computed as the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the atomic velocities.</p><p>Classical molecular dynamics simulations with full atomic resolution were realized with the help of the LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulator <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">46</ref> . The equations of motion were integrated using the velocity Verlet method <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">47</ref> , with a 1 fs time step, in which bond stretching was not constrained for any bonds. To maintain isothermal conditions, the deterministic Nosé-Hoover thermostat <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">49</ref> , with a time constant equal to 0.1 ps, was used. This ensured that thermostating was applied to both translational and rotational degrees of freedom, crucial for the asymmetric 2PACz and 3-MPA molecules. All classical molecular dynamics simulations were realized in the canonical NVT ensemble at T = 300 K comprising a V-shaped SnO 2 (110) model system with dimensions 60 Å × 105 Å × 40 Å. Periodic boundary conditions were used in x and y directions, whereas reflective boundary conditions were used in the z direction. The two considered systems, control and mixed, consisted of a total of 18,498 and 18,714 atoms, respectively, whereas the experimental molar ratio (2PACz:3-MPA = 9:1) was retained in the simulated mixed system. The systems were equilibrated for 1 ns followed by a 10 ns production simulation, during which sampling took place every 500 fs for the calculation of ensemble averages. A snapshot of the system was taken every 1,000 fs for visualization purposes. The calculation of the number distributions of formed 2PACz clusters was performed through an in-house code using a threshold distance of 8 Å among the centre of masses of adjacent 2PACz molecules, in accordance with the nearest neighbour shell of the corresponding radial distribution function as clustering criterion.</p><p>To accurately capture the interactions of SnO 2 , the thoroughly validated classical force field developed by Bandura et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">50</ref> was used. The all-atom OPLS force field was utilized for 3-MPA, wherein the corresponding interaction parameters were obtained with the help of the LigParGen server <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">51</ref> . For 2PACz, containing the phosphonic functional group, the specially designed force field developed by Meltzer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">52</ref> based on the generalized Amber force field <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">53</ref> was used. The van der Waals and electrostatic non-bonded interactions were calculated using a real-space cutoff radius of 10 Å and 8 Å, respectively, whereas the particle-particle-particle-mesh scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">54</ref> with an accuracy of 0.0001 (kcal mol -1 ) Å -1 was used for the consideration of long-range electrostatic interactions. Because the SnO 2 force field uses a Buckingham potential for the van der Waals interactions, its combination with the Lennard-Jones potential used for the compounds was realized by fitting the Buckingham parameters of SnO 2 to a suitable set of Lennard-Jones parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">55</ref> and geometric mixing rules were applied for all dissimilar non-bonded interactions.</p></div>

The stabilized PCE was measured by setting the bias voltage to the V MPP and then tracing the current density. The V MPP was determined from the reverse I-V curve. The active area was determined by the aperture shade mask (0.049 cm 2 ) placed in front of the solar cell to avoid overestimation of the photocurrent density. EQE spectra were recorded with a commercial system (Arkeo-Ariadne, Cicci Research) based on a 300 W xenon light source and a holographic grating monochromator (Cornerstone, Newport).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Note 1</head><p>Effects of surface morphology on the cluster formation process On flat surfaces, cluster formation is initially absent but becomes pronounced as the concentration of 2PACz increases (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). However, for textured surfaces, dimers were observed throughout the range of considered 2PACz concentrations (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). We ascribed this behavior to the inclined geometry of textured SnO2 slabs, which confines spaces and thereby facilitates 2PACz molecules to approach one another and nucleate <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Correspondingly, when the system contains more than 80 2PACz molecules, there is a significant increase in the number of trimers and tetramers on textured surfaces. Interestingly, beyond this threshold concentration, the number of dimers remains practically constant, suggesting that besides forming new dimers, additional 2PACz molecules are added to existing ones to form higher-order clusters. This leads to the conclusion that the textured surface favors the formation of higher-order clusters at the expense of dimers. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Atomic-level adsorption mechanism of 2PACz molecules</head><p>We performed AIMD simulations at 300 K and 1 atm. Both 2PACz and 3-MPA molecules underwent deprotonation after adsorption on the SnO2 (110) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). Immediately thereafter, they exhibited strong binding to the surface without any further noticeable diffusion.</p><p>We set up a simulation with six 2PACz molecules and one 3-MPA molecule initially placed at a certain distance from the SnO2 surface. The detailed interaction between 2PACz and 3-MPA is depicted in Movie S3. The thiol group of 3-MPA establishes a hydrogen bond with the phosphonic acid group of 2PACz. This resultant supramolecular structure mitigates the formation of higherorder clusters by restricting the interaction with nearby 2PACz molecules (Fig. <ref type="figure">1f</ref>). As these two molecules reach the SnO2 surface, the 2PACz-SnO2 and the 3-MPA-SnO2 interactions become dominant over their intermolecular attractions. Correspondingly, both molecules undergo deprotonation and adsorb onto the surface. It is noted that 3-MPA can adopt a temporary standing adsorption mode, with the carboxylate group bound to the surface and the thiol group protruding away from it, which can help guiding other freely diffusing 2PACz molecules to the surface. control (e) and (f) mixed SAM deposited substrates. The dark blue line represents a fit to the raw data. The cyan peak, observed in thermally evaporated 2PACz films as well <ref type="bibr">3</ref> , might be attributed to impurities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Note 3</head><p>Simulated vibrational power spectra and 2PACz/SnO2 interactions Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref> depicted the simulated vibrational power spectra of a 2PACz molecule adsorbed on the SnO2 surface. These were calculated from the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of atomic velocities along the ab-initio MD trajectory (33 ps). We focused on two scenarios: (1) an isolated 2PACz molecule anchored to the surface and (2) a 2PACz molecule neighbouring with an adsorbed 3-MPA molecule. In both cases we calculated and extracted the vibrational components of the PO3 2-group involved in the 2PACz adsorption. When the 3-MPA molecule is present, a red-shift of about 6 cm -1 was observed in the simulated spectrum.</p><p>The interactions between 2PACz and SnO2 were illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 12. In the isolated scenario, the PO3 2-group engages in bidentate binding by attaching its two oxygen atoms to surface Sn atoms, while the third oxygen weakly interacts with the transferred proton (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">12a</ref>). When a 2PACz molecule is situated next to an adsorbed 3-MPA molecule, the 3-MPA releases its COOH proton onto the bridging oxygen atom, thereby limiting the available deprotonation sites for the 2PACz molecule. As a result, in addition to the usual bidentate binding, the unreleased proton of 2PACz establishes a stable hydrogen bond with an adjacent bridging oxygen atom (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">12b</ref>). Based on these findings, we associated the red shift observed in the vibrational spectra (both experimentally and computationally) with </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Note 4 The origin of PCE improvements</head><p>From PL (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), we see that reduced interfacial recombination with the mixed SAM led to an increase in Voc by ~10 mV. An additional Voc improvement is attributed to a larger built-in field, as indicated by the VL shift from UPS measurements (Fig. <ref type="figure">3j</ref>). This enhanced driving force also explains the higher FF of mixed-SAM-based devices. The random textures of FTO substrates helped to reduce light reflection losses within PSCs, yielding a maximum EQE of 98% at 550 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref>). The integrated Jsc accounts for 95% of the Shockley-Queisser-limited photocurrent (27.05 mA cm -2 ). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anchoring patterns of 2PACz and 3-MPA on ITO surfaces</head><p>To elucidate the adsorption behaviours of 2PACz and 3-MPA on ITO surfaces, we performed AIMD simulations of a 2PACz or 3-MPA molecule interacting with an ITO (111) surface (with 14 mol% Sn doping). The resultant adsorption configurations were shown in Supplementary Fig. 25. We found that the anchoring pattern of 2PACz on the ITO (111) surface mirrors that on the SnO2 (110) surface, where the phosphonic acid group transfers two protons to the surface oxygen atoms and attaches its oxygen atoms to the surface indium atoms. The binding energy of -3.2 eV also aligns with that on the SnO2 (110) surface (-3. Protocol for preconditioning of the device before its characterization</p></div>

We found that compared to control devices, the mixed SAM led to improved performance (average PCE 25.0% compared with 24.1%). This came from improved open-circuit voltage (V oc , from 1.141 V to 1.159 V) and fill factor (from 82.3% to 84.1%) (Supplementary Note 4). We noted that device reproducibility was comparable for both control and mixed SAMs, probably owing to SAM inhomogeneity occurring at the nanoscale <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">27</ref> . The champion device with the mixed SAM exhibited a PCE of 25.3% from the reverse J-V scan, which agrees with the PCE obtained from the steady-state power output (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">20</ref>). The integrated short-circuit current density ( J sc ) of 25.8 mA cm -2 derived from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement matches well with that from the J-V sweep (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref>). One mixed SAM-based FTO device was characterized at Newport; and produced a QSS-certified PCE of 24.8%, with a V oc of 1.150 V, a J sc of 25.5 mA cm -2 and a fill factor of 84.5% (Fig. <ref type="figure">4d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">21</ref>). Although there have been reports of inverted PSCs with efficiencies surpassing 25% (refs. 2,3), the certified PCEs measured under stabilized conditions (including maximum power point (MPP) and QSS tracking) have yet to reach the same level (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). The QSS efficiency reported herein represents a new record for inverted PSCs, improving on the previous record QSS efficiency of 24.09% in the literature (Fig. <ref type="figure">4e</ref>).</p><p>For comparison, inverted PSCs were fabricated on smooth ITO substrates. We obtained an average PCE of 23.4% for control ITO devices, which was lower than that of control FTO devices, despite their higher average V oc and fill factor (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">22</ref>). This emphasizes the need to augment J sc for inverted PSCs. The limited J sc is ascribed to the smoothness of ITO substrates (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">23</ref>), leading to reduced light scattering and thus insufficient light absorption in the full device (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">24</ref>). Interestingly, the performance of mixed SAM-based ITO devices was only slightly improved, possibly owing to the weak interactions of 3-MPA with ITO surfaces (Supplementary Note 5 and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">25</ref>).</p><p>We evaluated the operating stability of PSCs using International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS)-L-3 protocols, in which the encapsulated device was subjected to continuous 1 sun equivalent, white light-emitting diode illumination (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">26</ref>) at 50% relative humidity and heat sink temperature of 65 °C. To impede ion and moisture diffusion, we replaced BCP with atomic layer-deposited SnO 2 as a buffer layer <ref type="bibr">9</ref> . The resultant device delivered a PCE of 24.6% at room temperature (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">27</ref>). During the ISOS-L-3 testing, the device initially demonstrated a PCE of 22.6%, which increased to 23.1% after 1.6 h of MPP tracking (Fig. <ref type="figure">4f</ref>). The lower PCE at 65 °C compared to room temperature is ascribed to the negative temperature coefficient of PSCs (-0.15% per °C) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">39</ref> . The PCE stabilized at 21.9% (95% of the peak PCE) until the end of the test (1,075 h), with the main degradation in the photocurrent (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">28</ref>). The initial performance and operating stability reported herein are compared with other PSCs subjected to ISOS-L-3 tests (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</p></div>
