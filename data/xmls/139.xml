For example, 2.2 mL pyrrole, 1.0 mg tetrabutylammonium bisulfate and 5.6 mg sodium hydroxide were dissolved in toluene (100 mL) in an ice bath. A mixture comprising 6.2 mL benzenesulfonyl chloride and 50 mL toluene was slowly dropwise added in pyrrole solution.</p><p>Then, the mixture was vigorously stirred at room temperature overnight.

Supplementary Note 1. In order to investigate and address the issue of cations inhomogeneity, we draw a conclusion that the criterial of additive molecule design should be integrating functions of modulating crystallizations of perovskite and compensating lattice mismatch. Firstly, we selected design route of sulfone group because of it has more electron doners, which would possibly regulate the crystallization better through interacting with perovskite more strongly. Secondly, geometrical parameters and polarities are determinant to additive properties.</p><p>We expected an appropriate geometrical size to ensure molecules to stay in the films rather than escape because of there would be residuals in the films to maintain inhibiting cations inhomogeneity, and compensate discrepancy of cations size in perovskite. Considering sulfoxide group is recognized to serve as electron doner for PbI2, according to PbI2 lattice space of 6.32 Å (Calculated using Bragg's Law 𝑑 = 𝜆 2sin(𝜃) = 1.54 2×sin(𝑅𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑠( <ref type="bibr">13.98°2</ref> )) = 6.32Å ), inserting two single five-or six-membered rings is most suitable to creat a stable structure.</p><p>Furthermore, the directional electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution and moderate negative potential center enable additive to precisely regulate the target site during crystallizations and stable adsorption to perovskite (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>). Therein, it is preferrable for two asymmetry single rings to be arranged on either side of the sulfoxide group. We calculated local potential of perovskite lattice adsorbed with PSP in order to assess additive properties through potential variation at specific region. The results demonstrated a significant potential variation at Cs region, suggesting PSP prefer to adsorb at Cs region through charge interaction (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">4</ref>. ToF-SIMS profiles obtained from a solar cell configuration of (a) the reference and (b) PSP sample.     that serious behavior of cations accumulation, leading to Cs-rich phase. The conventional XRD measurements results demonstrated that, with the increasing x value, the right-side shoulder peak was growing stronger and shifting towards higher 2-theta degrees. A linear relationship between Cs/(Cs+FA)-ratio and the location of shoulder peaks was observed, which is consistent with the assumption that the Cs-rich phase preferred to accumulate at the bottom region within perovskite films, thus leading to a gradient phase distribution of Cs-poor to Cs-rich evolution from the surface to bottom.     During the annealing process, PSP residuals should be a high-temperature crystal structure remain in the perovskite films, which possibly accounts for the passivation effect. However, we cannot detect PSP related characteristic XRD signals in perovskite films, it was possibly attributed to tiny amount of PSP introduced. We presume that PSP have different function interact with perovskites through different structures. At the stage of crystallization and perovskite phase transition, PSP worked as homogeneous phase regulator through RT structure.</p><p>Regarding with the as-fabricated films, PSP residues with high-temperature structure remains in perovskite films possibly worked as passivator and further stabilize the device through strengthen the bottom region.   Perovskite solar cells with the formula FA 1-x Cs x PbI 3 , where FA is formamidinium, provide an attractive option for integrating high efficiency, durable stability and compatibility with scaled-up fabrication. Despite the incorporation of Cs cations, which could potentially enable a perfect perovskite lattice <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> , the compositional inhomogeneity caused by A-site cation segregation is likely to be detrimental to the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4</ref> . Here we visualized the out-of-plane compositional inhomogeneity along the vertical direction across perovskite films and identified the underlying reasons for the inhomogeneity and its potential impact for devices. We devised a strategy using 1-(phenylsulfonyl)pyrrole to homogenize the distribution of cation composition in perovskite films. The resultant p-i-n devices yielded a certified steady-state photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of 25.2% and durable stability.</p><p>There have been significant improvements in the efficiency of lead-halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) <ref type="bibr">5</ref> , largely due to the development of new passivation strategies <ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">7</ref> and the optimization of the perovskite composition <ref type="bibr">8</ref> . Notably, the modulation of the A-site composition, specifically with FA-Cs alloyed perovskite, where FA is formamidinium, is emerging as a promising method for boosting efficiency <ref type="bibr">9</ref> . However, there are growing concerns about the stability of Cs-containing perovskites due to the segregation of the cations, which could potentially accelerate the long-term degradation <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">11</ref> . The distribution of these inhomogeneous phases within perovskites and their direct impact on efficiency are not yet fully understood.</p><p>Herein, we visualize the spatially inhomogeneous phase distribution along the vertical direction across perovskite films and propose that device performance is limited by out-of-plane compositional inhomogeneity. Furthermore, we identified that unbalanced crystallization and phase transition between A-site components have a significant effect on the segregation of the FA and Cs phases. To address this issue, we devised a strategy using 1-(phenylsulfonyl) pyrrole (PSP) as an additive to retard the segregation of cations in FA-Cs perovskites. The PSP-treated devices have a p-i-n structure and yielded a champion photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.1% (certified reverse PCE of 25.8% and certified steady-state PCE of 25.2%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Out-of-plane cation inhomogeneity</head><p>The distribution of A-site cations within perovskite films critically affects the performance of the device <ref type="bibr">12</ref> . Although Cs has been widely used as a cation dopant in perovskite formulations, there are still concerns about the inhomogeneous distribution of cations. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1a</ref> is a schematic illustration of the out-of-plane cation inhomogeneity. It shows that Cs prefers to aggregate at the bottom of the perovskite film because crystallization has a significant impact on the compositional evolution within perovskite films. An organic molecule of PSP with a sulfone group <ref type="bibr">13,</ref><ref type="bibr">14</ref> was designed as an additive to the precursor to address the cation inhomogeneity within perovskites, particularly for FA-Cs-containing perovskites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1b</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref> and Supplementary Note 1).</p><p>We conducted time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) to investigate the cation distribution (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">4</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1c</ref> illustrates that in the reference film, for the Cs there is an increasing intensity gradient from the perovskite surface towards the bottom. The FA cations have the opposite trend. This observation confirms the out-of-plane cation inhomogeneity within the perovskite film. Notably, the addition of PSP resulted in a homogeneous cation distribution. Furthermore, as inferred from the characteristic fraction of SO 2 -, PSP molecules accumulate at the bottom of the perovskite film. To further survey the elemental variation within the perovskite film, we conducted depth-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The extracted atomic percentage depth profiles have a similar out-of-plane compositional gradient (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1d</ref>).</p><p>The out-of-plane cation inhomogeneity could potentially influence the perovskite lattice, thereby altering the crystal structure. Hence, it is crucial to systematically investigate the structural variations induced by cation inhomogeneities. We visualized the out-of-plane A-site compositional inhomogeneity by studying the lattice heterogeneity of various perovskite phases. We collected cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. Three regions across the perovskite films (denoted as surface, bulk and bottom) were selected to survey the interplanar spacing of the lattice (d), which is a direct indication of phase heterogeneity. Vertical gradients for the cation distributions were directly observed by comparing the values of d values correlates with the increasing internal lattice stress within the perovskite film. The decrease in d bottom suggests that there is a significant lattice mismatch at the bottom of the film <ref type="bibr">15</ref> . This could be ascribed to the relatively smaller Cs atoms accumulating at the bottom, thereby generating a Cs-rich perovskite phase. Importantly, the detected lattice contraction implies that cation inhomogeneity is a contributory factor to the lattice strain <ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">17</ref> . In contrast, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1f</ref>, negligible variation of the d values was found in the PSP-treated film, which has d surface = 3.13 Å, d bulk = 3.13 Å and d bottom = 3.13 Å. This finding indicates that PSP treatment provides a better out-of-plane lattice alignment and releases the lattice stress by inhibiting phase segregation. We employed the grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) technique to detect the crystal structure from the exposed lower interface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1g</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1</ref>). For the reference film, the peaks are at around 28.1°, which are indexed for the (200) plane of perovskite. The split is significantly wider. Shoulder peaks emerge at around 28.4° when the incident angle was lower than 2°. These emergent shoulder peaks gradually weaken with an increase of the incident angle and ultimately vanish. The spectrum changes to stronger integrated peaks when the incident angle is larger than 3°. In contrast, the shoulder peaks are negligible after introducing the PSP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1h</ref>). Moreover, a vertical misalignment of the peaks, which is an indication of the internal strain caused by lattice mismatch, is observed for the reference and PSP-1.2 films (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>), which agrees well with the findings of the microscale TEM measurements. These results suggest that there is an out-of-plane inhomogeneous crystal structure within the reference perovskite film. The shoulder peaks may be associated with an undesired Cs-rich phase 2 in the buried region of the perovskite film.</p><p>We presume, according to the coherence between 2θ and the lattice space, that the shoulder peaks can be attributed to a Cs-rich phase caused by Cs incorporation <ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">18,</ref><ref type="bibr">19</ref> . Considering the conventional X-ray diffraction (XRD) results (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>), we may conclude that the spatially out-of-plane compositional inhomogeneity is generated by segregation of the FA and Cs phases in the perovskite films, even for Cs/(Cs + FA) ratios as low as 5%. The Cs-rich phase prefers to accumulate in the bottom region within perovskite films, thus leading to a gradient in the phase distribution from Cs-poor to Cs-rich from the surface to the bottom.</p><p>Consequently, the results obtained allow us to conclude that in FA-Cs perovskite films, the different sizes of the cations of FA and Cs result in a spatially out-of-plane lattice mismatch. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1a</ref>, from top to bottom, there is a FA-rich phase, a phase in which the cations have nominal stoichiometry and a Cs-rich phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Origin of the cation inhomogeneity</head><p>We performed in situ synchrotron radiation grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to investigate the two critical kinetics processes of crystallization and phase transition during perovskite formation. As demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2a</ref>, signals for a q vector of around 0.8, 0.82 and 1.0 Å -1 can be assigned to the δ-phase perovskite of 2H (100), 6H (101), and α-phase perovskite, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">20</ref> . We defined two periods when analysing the kinetic processes. Period I was from after chlorobenzene dripping until the emergence of α-phase perovskite. The duration of this period is indicative of the crystallization rate. Period II was the duration it took for the α phase to become stable, which reflects the δ-to α-phase transition rate. From the in situ GIWAXS results, we found that the introduction of PSP accelerates both the crystallization and phase transition. Combined with the results from 'Out-of-plane cation inhomogeneity', this shows that PSP has effectively inhibited the segregation of the FA and Cs phases. A possible kinetical culprit for the phase segregation is the slow speeds of crystallization and phase transition.</p><p>We further conducted density functional theory computations to thermodynamically investigate the barrier energy (E B ) for perovskite crystallization and phase transition and subdivided the energy into the processes for the FA and Cs components. The difference between the barrier energies was defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E E E ∆ = - B B FA B</formula><p>Cs . To evaluate more accurately the imbalance between the FA and Cs components, we calculated the mismatch factor µ =  <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">2</ref>). The lower μ I and μ II for the PSP system indicate that the differences in the crystallization and phase transition rates of the FA and Cs components were reduced. Such differences in the rates for cations were probably responsible for the tardiness observed by in situ GIWAXS. A possible reason for the cation inhomogeneity could be the soft base property of the Cs cations compared to the FA cations, which may lead to a much more intensive interaction with PbI 3 -, leading to Cs preferentially aggregating at the bottom. Additionally, the difference in the solubilities of Cs and FA components might partially also contribute to the cation inhomogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">21</ref> .</p><p>We collected adsorption spectra of the Pb L III edge using extended X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (EXAFS) to evaluate the interactions between PSP and perovskite. We selected five grazing incident angles to capture information at various depths within the perovskite film (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>, peaks at radial distances of approximately 2.2 and 2.9 Å can be attributed to Pb-O and Pb-I coordination, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">22</ref> . In the reference film, we observed a gradual downwards shift of around 0.03 Å for the Pb-I coordination with an increase in detection depth (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2d</ref>). This indicates that the lattice was compressed at the bottom of the perovskite <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">23</ref> . In contrast, the peaks associated with Pb-I coordination remained relatively stable upon the incorporation of PSP, further reinforcing the existence of out-of-plane cation inhomogeneity. Notably, in the PSP film, peaks corresponding to Pb-O coordination migrated by a higher radial distance as the depth increased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2e</ref>). This suggests the creation of a longer Pb-O coordination at the bottom of the film. By calculating of the Pb-O coordination ratio as (Pb-O)/ ((Pb-O) + (Pb-I)) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2f</ref>), we concluded that Pb atoms at the bottom of the perovskite film tend to coordinate with additional oxygen atoms from PSP. Consequently, we hypothesize that PSP possibly interacts with the Pb atoms in perovskite through electrons donated by its two oxygen atoms.</p><p>To precisely evaluate the interaction between PSP and PbI 2 , we synthesized (PbI 2 ) x (PSP) y complex crystals (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">13</ref>), and performed Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements. Peaks at around 1,328, 1,133 and 964 cm -1 correspond to asymmetric stretching vibration (ν as ) and symmetric stretching vibration (ν s ) of the sulfone (O=S=O) and vibration (ν) of the sulfoxide (S=O) group, respectively. Significant shifts in all three characteristic peaks indicate the coordination of PSP with PbI 2 through the sulfone (O=S=O) group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2g</ref>). The upward shifts of the ν as and ν s peaks imply that both oxygen atoms from PSP may serve as active sites. Additionally, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra corroborated the coordination of the O=S=O group with PbI 2 . This was discerned through shifts in the carbon atoms adjacent to the O=S=O group (nos. 1, 2, 6, 11 and 14) to a higher field (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). These findings align with the decreased PbI 2 signal observed by in situ GIWAXS tests and the peak shifts detected in XPS measurements (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">14</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optoelectronic properties</head><p>Besides retarding the phase segregation, PSP has a practical passivation effect. The steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence were examined to optically evaluate changes in recombination caused by the out-of-plane lattice mismatch. In Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>, a significantly stronger photoluminescence peak was observed for the PSP film relative to that of the reference film. Moreover, the carrier lifetime of the PSP-treated film was extended to 1,876.6 ns compared with 491.7 ns for the reference (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">3</ref>). We used thermal admittance spectroscopy to characterize the trap density of the perovskite films. Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">17</ref> depicts that the trap density of states decreased after PSP introduction at shallow and deep energetic levels. Shallow traps could be attributed to a homogeneous phase distribution, which may inhibit the formation of vacancies. Further, a released spatial lattice mismatch is beneficial for stabilizing octahedral frameworks, which in turn positively reduces the metal-related deep defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">25</ref> . We further modelled the lattice and calculated the defect formation energy using FA 0.95 Cs 0.05 PbI 3 perovskite (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">19</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure">3d</ref> shows that the defect formation energy of a series of defects was increased after PSP introduction, especially for the Pb and I vacancies, which should result in lower defect densities and longer carrier lifetimes in experiments.</p><p>Efficient carrier diffusion and extraction are affected by the vertical band alignment of different phases within a perovskite film, which correlates with the out-of-plane compositional inhomogeneity. Depth-profile ultraviolet-photoelectron spectroscopy was carried out to evaluate the internal band alignment (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">4</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure">3e</ref> shows that the out-of-plane compositional inhomogeneity may lead to quasi-type I band alignment at the contact region of the Cs-rich phase with a thickness of a few hundreds of nanometres. The conduction-band minimum and valence-band maximum are downwards and upwards twisted, respectively. This band alignment adversely affects carrier transport for solar cells through electrical doping <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">26</ref> whether in a p-i-n or n-i-p configuration (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref>). In this case, the inherent disequilibrium of electron-hole extraction would be seriously aggravated <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">28</ref> . Ultimately, it would worsen the device efficiency, especially the fill factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[31]</ref> . After PSP introduction, the band diagram had a favourable flattened alignment, mitigating energy losses of charge carriers within perovskite films (Fig. <ref type="figure">3f</ref>). The findings from transient adsorption measurements align with the conclusion obtained from energy band alignment (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>). Moreover, we tested the built-in electrical field (V bi ) in a p-i-n device. The improved V bi was beneficial for carrier diffusion as well (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">20</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Device performance</head><p>We fabricated devices with a p-i-n stack of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ poly(triaryl)amine (PTAA)/FA 0.95 Cs 0.05 PbI 3 /C 60 /bathocuproine (BCP)/ Ag. The bandgap of this perovskite recipe was determined to be 1.51 eV by the Tauc plot method (Supplementary Figs. 21) and by using the derivative of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the solar cell (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref>). The champion device yielded a notable PCE of up to 26.09%/25.16% (reverse/forward scan direction) whereas the reference cell had PCEs of 24.62%/23.48% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">4a</ref>). The corresponding steady-state power output efficiencies were 25.15% and 23.72%, respectively. An unencapsulated device achieved certified PCEs of 25.8% and 25.2% for the reverse scan and for the steady-state output, as certified by an independent organization (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">22</ref>). The fill factor of the champion device exceeded 85%, which is nearly 95% of the theoretical limit (89.5%). We attributed the remarkable fill factor improvement to the improved charge carrier extraction, which is supported by the efficiency improvement in the n-i-p configuration as well (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">23</ref>). The open-circuit voltage (V OC ) improved from 1.145 to 1.164 V, which is consistent with the reduced trap density. The short-circuit current density (J SC ) over 26 mA cm <ref type="bibr">-2</ref> was consistent with the integrated J SC extracted from the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">4b</ref>). The reproducibility was evaluated using a batch of devices comprising 16 individuals for each set-up (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">25</ref>). We further tested the solar cells in a light-emitting diode (LED) mode. The LED EQE EL improved from 7.1% to 9.7% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">4c</ref>), so that the emission peaks were around 820 nm (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">26</ref>). We fabricated devices with an upscaled area of 1 cm 2 , and the efficiency improved from 21.78% to 23.64% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">4d</ref>). This improvement was mainly associated with the enhanced fill factor. Further devices with typical efficient perovskite formulas were fabricated to assess the universality of the PSP strategy (Supplementary Figs. 27-29), although some perovskite formulas still require further evaluation. Device reliability was evaluated following the procedure specified in the ISOS protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">32</ref> .

Prepatterned ITO-coated glass substrates (7 Ω per square) were cleaned by sequential ultrasonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol each for 15 min, respectively. The cleaned substrates were dried under a flow of clean N 2 and further dried in a 60 °C oven overnight. Before depositing the hole transport layer, the substrates were exposed to oxygen plasma cleaner for 5 min and then transferred into an N 2 glovebox immediately for rest deposition progress. PTAA solution (2.5 mg ml -1 dissolved in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated onto the substrate at 6,000 rpm for 30 s, then annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. The perovskite layer was deposited by one-step spin-coating of the filtered precursor solution at 1,000 rpm for 10 s and 4,000 rpm for 40 s. Then 200 μl of chlorobenzene was quickly dropped onto the centre of the spinning substrate at 15 s before the end. The film was immediately annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature, 100 μl of phenethylammonium iodide or n-octylammonium iodide solution (5 mg ml -1 ) was dynamically coated onto the perovskite films at 3,000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min.

J.Y. and X.P. supervised the project and process. Z.L. and H.X. fabricated the perovskite devices, conducted the photovoltaic performance characterizations and analysed the experimental data described in this manuscript. Z.L., Y.Z. and H.X. wrote the manuscript. Y.Z. performed the structural characterizations, including those using GIXRD and TEM, with the assistance of J.  ) and an increase in the slow decay lifetime (τ 2 ). The five-fold reduction in τ 1 suggests effective passivation, while the nearly threefold increase in τ 2 implies a seamless carrier diffusion within the perovskite (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). This finding aligns with the conclusion obtained from energy band alignment.</p></div>			</div>
