<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alta</head><p>LG NREL NREL (MM) Achieving both high efficiency and long-term stability is the key to the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> . However, the diversity of perovskite (ABX 3 ) compositions and phases makes it challenging to fabricate high-quality films <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[5]</ref> . Perovskite formation relies on the reaction between AX and BX 2 , whereas most conventional methods for film-growth regulation are based solely on the interaction with the BX 2 component. Herein, we demonstrate an alternative approach to modulate reaction kinetics by anion-π interaction between AX and hexafluorobenzene (HFB). Notably, these two approaches are independent but work together to establish 'dual-site regulation', which achieves a delicate control over the reaction between AX and BX 2 without unwanted intermediates. The resultant formamidinium lead halides (FAPbI 3 ) films exhibit fewer defects, redshifted absorption and high phase purity without detectable nanoscale δ phase. Consequently, we achieved PSCs with power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 26.07% for a 0.08-cm 2 device (25.8% certified) and 24.63% for a 1-cm 2 device. The device also kept 94% of its initial PCE after maximum power point (MPP) tracking for 1,258 h under full-spectrum AM 1.5 G sunlight at 50 ± 5 °C. This method expands the range of chemical interactions that occur in perovskite precursors by exploring anion-π interactions and highlights the importance of the AX component as a new and effective working site to improved photovoltaic devices with high quality and phase purity.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">NREL (2-J) Varian NREL 32.9% Japan Energy NREL (3-J) Sharp (3-J) Sharp (3-J) NREL Spectrolab (3-J) 39.5% NREL (6-J) Boeing- Spectrolab (5-J) NREL/ Spectrolab (3-J) Spectrolab (3-J) Spectrolab (3-J) Boeing- Spectrolab (3-J) Boeing- Spectrolab (3-J) Boeing- Spectrolab (3-J) Boeing-Spectrolab (3-J, 240x) Boeing-Spectrolab (3-J,179x) NREL (3-J) NREL (3-J) NREL (3-J, 325.7x) FhG-ISE (3-J, 454x) SpireSemicon (3-J, 406x) SolarJunc (3-J, 418x) SolarJunc (3-J, 942x) Sharp (3-J, 302x) Spectrolab (3-J, 299x) Boeing- Spectrolab (3-J, 364x) 47.6% Varian (2-J) No. Carolina State U.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III-V Multijunction Cells</head><p>Recently, metal halide perovskites (ABX 3 ) have emerged as promising materials for various applications, especially photovoltaics. The PCE of PSCs has rapidly increased to 26.1% (ref. 6). However, maintaining their performance during long-term operation is still challenging, especially in accelerated ageing <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">7</ref> , owing to the complex chemical landscape with respect to composition and phase in perovskites <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">8</ref> . The resultant films present multiscale imperfections, such as point defects, component heterogeneity, undesirable residues, multiscale secondary phases and so on <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[5]</ref> . These lead to less optimal optical bandgap, adverse optoelectronic response and even material degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[11]</ref> . Moreover, even in high-quality FAPbI 3 films for state-of-art devices, detrimental nanoscale phase impurities are discovered <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[15]</ref> . Thus, it is urgently needed to further improve the quality of perovskite materials by minimizing multiscale impurities, especially nanoscale phase impurity, which receives limited attention.</p><p>The formation of perovskite film by means of the solution process is quick with vigorous reaction and diffusion, which often involves intermediate phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">16</ref> . Modulating precursor chemistry enables complete transformation to photoactive α phase or suppression of photoinactive δ intermediate phases. The formation of perovskite could be regarded as the reaction between AX and BX 2 . In this regard, electron donors such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">16</ref> , N-methylpyrrolidone <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">17</ref> , Cl -(ref. 18), formate (Fa -) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">19</ref> and thiocyanate (SCN -) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">20</ref> are intensively investigated, which coordinate with electron-accepting metal cation at the B site (Pb 2+ and Sn 2+ ) to retard nucleation and influence crystal growth substantially <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">19</ref> , which we refer to as the BX 2 retardants. However, commonly used electron donors such as DMSO or methylammonium chloride (MACl) only allows partial elimination of nanoscale δ-phase impurities, whereas stronger electron donors can bring in secondary phases and residuals owing to relatively strong interaction but mild crystal-growth conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">21</ref> . We proposed that, as well as merely interacting with BX 2 by using electron-donating molecules, interacting with electron-donating AX synergically by using a new type of retardants (which we refer to as the AX retardants) with electron-accepting capability may give rise to the further elaborate regulation of perovskite fabrication (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1a</ref>). However, so far, no attempts have succeeded in achieving state-of-art PSCs with the AX component as a working site for film-growth regulation. Fortunately, we find that anion-π interaction could be used as such AX retardants. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Article</head><p>The anion-π interaction between FAI and HFB Anion-π interactions generally occur between an electron-deficient (π-acidic) aromatic system and an anion, and the intensity mainly relies on electrostatic forces and anion-induced polarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">22</ref> . Earlier studies showed that the anion-π interaction between fullerene derivatives in perovskite induces n-doping of fullerene derivatives and cause passivation of defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">24</ref> . With six strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms on the arene, HFB has an overwhelming electron deficiency with large positive quadrupole moment up to +9.5 B, which leads to stronger anion-π interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">25</ref> . Accordingly, the anion-π bond strength was found to be 0.53 eV (51 kJ mol -1 ) between HFB and iodide <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">26</ref> , which was on the same order of magnitude as DMSO-PbI 2 coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">27</ref> . In the coordination process, BX 2 functions as an acceptor and retardants serve as donors; conversely, in the anion-π interaction, AX acts as a donor and HFB serves as an acceptor. Therefore, both AX and BX 2 components could interact with their retardants, realizing dual-site regulation of perovskite growth.</p><p>We use FAPbI 3 as the platform to study the anion-π interaction during film growth. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1a</ref>) showed that the iodine anion interacted favourably with HFB with overlapping electron clouds, wherein the distance between iodine and Neither HFB nor FAI/isopropyl alcohol (IPA) solution showed fluorescence at 500-560 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1b</ref>). However, when HFB was introduced to the FAI/IPA solution, a new emission peak appeared at 545 nm, suggesting that a complex is probably formed. Spectrometric titration results show that the strongest emission appears when the molar ratio [HFB]/([HFB] + [FAI]) equals 0.2, implying the complex formation between 4FAI and 1HFB. We further performed ultravioletvisible (UV-vis) absorption measurement (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1c</ref>). FAI and HFB showed absorption edges at 260 nm and 280 nm, respectively, but the HFB and FAI mixture showed a much redshifted absorption edge to 325 nm, which indicated the charge transfer between iodide and HFB. Also, in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1a</ref>), the skeletal vibration of FA + at 1,703 cm -1 and stretching vibration of -NH 2 in FA + at 3,355 cm -1 both shifted to higher wavenumber with the addition of HFB (1,722 cm -1 and 3,400 cm -1 , respectively). This is probably because the N-H⋯I hydrogen bond between FA+ and I-was weakened by HFB. It was also confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1b</ref>), in which the FAI showed a prominent shift to higher field (Δδ = -0.3 ppm) after HFB addition.</p><p>The formation of FAI-HFB complex reduces the chemical potential of FAI, as tested by cyclic voltammetry measurement in Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1c</ref>.</p><p>We then studied how HFB affects the reaction between FAI and PbI 2 . As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1d</ref>, bare PbI 2 in dimethylformamide (DMF) showed an absorption peak at 285 nm related to PbI + (DMF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">28</ref> . When adding FAI to PbI 2 solution, absorption peaks related to PbI 2 (DMF) and PbI 3 -(DMF) located at 325 nm and 370 nm appeared. However, on introducing HFB, the PbI 3 -(DMF) peak disappeared and the PbI 2 (DMF) peak decreased considerably. This indicated that the interaction between iodine and lead could be substantially inhibited with HFB. DFT calculations were taken among possible reactions in the FAI⋯HFB⋯PbI 2 three-component system, as shown below</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Article</head><p>in which reaction 1 refers to the interaction between FAI and HFB and reaction 2 refers to the interaction between FAI and PbI 2 . The Gibbs energy of reaction 1 (-89.7 kcal mol -1 ) is markedly lower than that of reaction 2 (-53.1 kcal mol -1 ), indicating that FAI has a stronger interaction with HFB rather than PbI 2 . Although HFB can also interact with the product of reaction 2 ([PbI 3 ] -), the Gibbs energy of this reaction (reaction 3) is too small (-2.51 kcal mol -1 ) to cancel out the energy difference between reaction 1 and reaction 2. The DFT calculations were performed in gas phase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1e</ref>) and the implicit solvent model (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), yielding consistent results. Thus, HFB could react with FAI to form [FAI⋯HFB] and retard the reaction between FAI and PbI 2 . We quantitatively study this retarding effect. The PbI 2 films immersed in FAI/IPA showed fast initial weight gain and soon reached saturation, as tested by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1f</ref>, upper panel), which is possibly because of the formation of δ-FAPbI 3 that impeded further diffusion of FAI <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">29</ref> . By contrast, PbI 2 in FAI-HFB/IPA solution showed much less weight gain at the beginning but no apparent saturation. Also, 3.6% of FAI was consumed in the FAI/ IPA solution, whereas only 1.2% of FAI was consumed in the FAI-HFB/ IPA solution for the first 30 s, which was measured using an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1f</ref>, lower panel). These results show that the reaction rate between FAI and PbI 2 could be effectively retarded by HFB.</p><p>As well as FAI, the UV-vis results showed that anion-π-interactioninduced polarization appears in other I --based compounds (MAI and CsI) regardless of the cation and in different anions, such as Br -, and even pseudohalogen anion SCN -(Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of HFB on perovskite film growth</head><p>In situ UV-vis absorption measurement was implemented to investigate the FAPbI 3 formation process. We refer to the perovskite samples fabricated without and with HFB as the 'control' samples and the 'HFB' samples, respectively. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2a</ref>,b shows the differential of in situ absorption of PbI 2 •DMSO films immersed in (FAI + MACl)/IPA solution and (FAI + MACl)/(IPA + HFB) solution for 1 h, respectively. The control sample exhibited an absorption threshold at 470 nm, with the maximum differential at 450 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>) corresponding to δ-FAPbI 3 , which is absent in the HFB sample (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>). The absorption of the control sample was almost unchanged after the initial 10 min, although the transformation to perovskite phase in the HFB sample was slow but continuous (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>), which suggests complete transformation from PbI 2 •DMSO to perovskites.</p><p>The in situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) test was used to evaluate the crystallization kinetics. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2d-g</ref>, the broad scattering peak at q ≈ 15 nm -1 probably originated from solvent (IPA or mixed IPA and HFB) and the sharp diffraction peaks at q = 10.2 nm -1 and 8.6 nm -1 represent the α-phase perovskite and 6H phase of δ-FAPbI 3 , respectively. The solvent peak took 30 s and 12 s for the HFB and control samples, respectively, to lose half of their initial intensity. Thermal gravimetric analysis also implies more solvent residue in HFB perovskite precursor films below 70 °C (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). As the volatilization rate of HFB was much faster than that of IPA at room temperature (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2), the solvent residue more likely originates from the strong interaction between HFB and FAI.</p><p>In the control sample, δ-FAPbI 3 and α-phase perovskite was observed immediately after organic salts were deposited (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2h</ref>). The α-phase peak was located at 10.2 nm -1 , higher than the peak at 9.8 nm -1 for α-FAPbI 3 (ref. 30), which was attributed to the incorporation of MACl into the α-FAPbI 3 lattice <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">18</ref> . Surprisingly, in the HFB sample, the δ-FAPbI 3 and α phase was absent in the first 30 s and 18 s. Different from the absorption results, some δ-FAPbI 3 still appeared in the HFB sample after 30 s, which might be associated with the moisture-induced degradation, along with solvent evaporation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">29</ref> . These results indicate that the addition of HFB could retard the reaction between FAI and PbI 2 at ) q (nm -1 ) q r (nm room temperature, which consequently suppressed the formation of δ-FAPbI 3 or other crystalline intermediate phase. On heating, HFB escapes from the film, which allows more direct formation of crystalline α-FAPbI 3 from wet film with much reduced side reaction. This dual-site regulation is different from previous methods that suppress δ-FAPbI 3 by forming another stable intermediate phase or accelerate sufficient transformation from δ-FAPbI 3 to α-FAPbI 3 (refs. 16,18,20).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of HFB on final perovskite films</head><p>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on the final HFB films (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3</ref>) shows negligible F1s signal, indicating that HFB has escaped from the perovskite films completely after annealing. Thus, the changes of the final films probably originated from the crystallization process. The HFB sample showed narrower diffraction peaks for α-FAPbI 3 , as measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>) and GIWAXS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3a</ref>,b and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</p><p>Besides, an increase in grain size from about 200 nm to more than 1 μm by the addition of HFB is clearly observed in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</p><p>Although there are no obvious diffraction signals corresponding to crystalline δ-FAPbI 3 observed in the control and HFB films, it is documented that nanoscale δ-FAPbI 3 domains (for example, nuclei) cannot be accurately detected by XRD, owing to the lack of long-range order <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15</ref> . Accordingly, low-temperature absorption of the control sample showed oscillatory features located around 700 nm at 80 K (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3e</ref>), implying the existence of nanoscale impurities <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">13</ref> . On HFB addition, the oscillatory features disappeared. These structural </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Article</head><p>differences were further confirmed using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurement. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3f</ref>, a new peak was found at 3.92 Å in R space for the control sample, which is consistent with the distance between the adjacent lead atoms in the face-sharing PbI 6 octahedral structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">31</ref> . Given that the same peak at 3.92 Å in R space was discovered in δ-FAPbI 3 single crystals, we consider that this peak originated from the δ-FAPbI 3 structure. Notably, such a peak was absent in the HFB sample. This confirms that nanoscale impurity exists in the FAPbI 3 perovskite fabricated from conventional precursors (FAPbI 3 + MACl) and could be inhibited by the addition of HFB.</p><p>In transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements, δ-FAPbI 3 was not found in the entire region (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>), which visually illustrates the phase purity of the HFB sample. A typical α-FAPbI 3 lattice was clearly seen in the enlarged image (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3g</ref>). However, the control sample was found to contain some diffraction pattern related to the δ-FAPbI 3 region (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the bandgaps of the HFB and control samples were estimated to be 1.52 and 1.54 eV, respectively, using a Tauc plot (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). The absorption threshold for the HFB sample reached more than 825 nm with increased absorbance. This probably originated from the reduced MA cation residue from MACl additives, as revealed by <ref type="bibr">1</ref> H NMR and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) mapping (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">9</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>). The HFB sample also showed 2.5 times higher photoluminescence (PL) intensity and longer carrier lifetimes (2.1 μs) than control films (1.3 μs), which suggests lower defect density (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">12</ref>). A similar trend was also found for other widely adopted perovskite components with HFB, indicating that HFB can regulate the formation process of various perovskites, as shown in Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">13</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">14</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">15</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials synthesis</head><p>MACl and FAI were synthesized using the methods reported previously. The details are as follows: 16 ml methylamine water solution (0.1 mol) or 8.8 g formamidine acetate (0.1 mol) was added to a 100-ml three-neck flask immersed in a water/ice bath. A certain amount (0.1 mol) of HX acid was slowly dropped into the bottle with continuous stirring. The mixture was refluxed for 2 h under a N 2 atmosphere. Subsequently, the solution was concentrated to a dry solid by using rotary evaporation at 80 °C. This crude product was redissolved into 20 ml ethanol, then 100 μl diethyl ether was slowly dropped along the bottle wall and a white product deposited. This recrystallization was repeated three times and the obtained precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven for 10 h at 40 °C.

For highly efficient PSCs, SnO 2 was deposited in a chemical bath, similar to a previous report <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">32</ref> , and annealed at 150 °C for 60 min in air. For the stability test, a SnO 2 nanocrystal solution was spin-coated on the ITO substrate at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s to form a 50-nm-thick film, which was then annealed at 150 °C for 60 min in air. The perovskite film was fabricated by a two-step solution process: the PbI 2 (1.5 M, dissolved in DMF/DMSO (9:1, v/v)) was spin-coated on SnO 2 at 1,500 r.p.m. for 30 s. Organic cation solution (FAI 0.55 M; MACl 0.12 M) was spin-coated at 2,100 r.p.m. for 30 s and then annealed at 170 °C for 10 min in a dehumidified box (RH &lt; 30%).

Phenylethanamine salt (20 mM) was spin-coated onto the perovskite films at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Then the HTM solution, in which a spiro-OMeTAD/ chlorobenzene (72.3 mg ml -1 ) solution was used with the addition of 35 μl Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (260 mg ml -1 ) and 30 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine, was deposited by spin-coating at 3,500 r.p.m. for 30 s. The device was finished by thermal evaporation of Au (80 nm) under vacuum. For the operational stability test inside the glovebox, a further 7 μl FK209 (0.55 M in acetonitrile) and 7 mg PTAA was added to 1 ml of the HTM solution to prevent possible dedope and deposited at 2,000 r.p.m. For the thermal stability test, 15 mg PTAA with the addition of 7.5 μl Li-TFSI/ acetonitrile (180 mg ml -1 ) and 10 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine was deposited by spin-coating at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s.</p></div>

PL was measured by a FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.) with an excitation at 450-470 nm. Time-resolved PL was measured by the FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer with excitation wavelength at 470 nm. The UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained using an UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer (Hitachi UH4150). In situ UV-vis absorption spectra were tested by reacting the as-prepared PbI 2 films and organic cation solutions in a Quartz Flow-Through Semi-Micro Cuvette with a 2-mm slit. XPS measurements were carried out on an XPS AXIS Ultra DLD (Kratos Analytical). The current density-voltage characteristics of the perovskite devices were obtained using a Keithley 2420 Source Measure Unit under AM 1.5 G illumination at 1,000 W m -2 with a Newport Thermal Oriel 91192 solar simulator. The shading mask and one of our best devices were sent to the NIM for certification. The active area was defined as 0.0831 cm 2 . EQEs were measured by an Enlitech EQE measurement system. PL mapping was measured by a laser scanning confocal microscope (Enlitech, SPCM-1000) equipped with a 470-nm pulse laser and galvo-based scanner in air, in which the signal of area 1,225 (35 × 35) μm 2 was collected. Thermal gravimetric analysis was obtained from a SDT Q600 thermogravimetric analyser (TA Instruments) with a ramping at 30 °C min -1 from 20 °C to 180 °C. For sample preparation, 100 μl of different organic cation solutions was spin-coated onto the as-prepared PbI 2 films for 10 s at 20 °C. Then the whole films were scraped from the substrate and transferred to the measurement furnaces immediately. FTIR was measured by a Spectrum Spotlight 200 FTIR microscope. Time-of-flight SIMS measurement was performed using a PHI nanoTOF II instrument (ULVAC-PHI, Inc.). A 30-keV Bi + pulsed primary ion beam was used for the analysis.

To carefully consider the weak intermolecular interaction of the complex, the DFT calculations were carried out with the DFT functional ωB9X-D (ref. 34) and basis set Def2TZVP. The electrostatic surface potential of the complex was generated with GaussView software. Films for the phase stability test were aged in a box with a humidifier. The operational stability was tested under an AM 1.5 G solar system (WAVELABS SINUS-70), in which the devices were loaded into an electrochemical workstation (CHI1000C, CH Instruments) and the loading voltage was fixed at MPP manually. During the operational stability test, the device temperature is measured to be 50 ± 5 °C.</p></div>

FAI/IPA or FAI/HFB + IPA solutions were pumped into a chamber continuously and reacted with PbI 2 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ICP-AES test</head><p>The inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) test was taken in the Prodigy7 ICP-OES (Teledyne Leeman Labs). In our experiment, PbI 2 films were coated on a glass slide by doctor blade coating, which was placed vertically and reacted with 70 ml FAI/IPA or FAI/HFB + IPA solutions (2 mg ml -1 for FAI) in a glass container. The container vial was sealed to prevent evaporation of the solvent so that the mass of FAI could not be overestimated owing to solvent evaporation. After a certain reaction time as reported in the manuscript (15 s, 30 s, 60 s, 120 s, 1,200 s, 3,600 s), the glass slide with PbI 2 film was removed immediately from the reaction container and the FAI solution was stirred evenly. Then the solution was extracted and diluted (1:39 v/v) in water before sending to test. An extra 50 mg ml -1 of sodium hypophosphite was added to prevent oxidation and evaporation of iodine. ) is still lower than that of reaction 2 (6.00 kcal mol -1 ) in solvent. Notably, reaction 3 (ΔG = -3.97 kcal mol -1 ) became more favourable in solvent, which is consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectra of the three-component system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1d</ref>). This was probably because of the coordination of solvent molecules in the implicit solvent model. But the energy of reaction 3 in solvent is still not enough to cancel out the energy difference between reaction 1 and reaction 2. Therefore, DFT calculations in gas phase as well as in the implicit solvent model (solvent = DMF) yield consistent results, that HFB reacts with FAI to form [FAI⋯HFB] and retards the reaction between FAI and PbI 2 .</p></div>

Similar redshift about the absorption edge from 280 nm to more than 320 nm was found after FAI, MAI or CsI solution mixing with HFB, indicating that this polarization appeared regardless of the cation species <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">35</ref> . Besides, the absorption edge of HFB at 280 nm shifted to 285 nm and 300 nm after mixing with Br -and SCN -, respectively. These evidences implied that such polarization also existed between HFB and bromide or even SCN -. It should be noted that there is no redshift observed when HFB is mixed with chloride, indicative of no polarization, which is probably because of the small radius of chlorine. However, because anion-π interactions also consisted of the contribution from electrostatic force, the strong electrostatic force between Cl -and HFB also leads to anion-π interactions, as reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">36</ref> .

For sample preparation, perovskite films were spin coated and scraped from substrate for TGA test. Control sample show 5% weight loss after heating to 160 °C, when HFB sample show 15% weight loss. This implies more volatility residue exists in HFB sample. Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> F1s XPS of control and HFB perovskite films deposited on ITO glass.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance of perovskite devices with HFB</head><p>We then fabricated PSCs (FTO/SnO 2 /FAPbI 3 /spiro-OMeTAD/Au). The best HFB device (0.0831 cm 2 ) achieved a PCE of 26.07% in forward scan and 26.01% in reverse scan, giving 26.04% on average (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref> and Extended Data Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). A best stabilized power output of 25.9% was achieved. By contrast, the PCE of control PSCs achieved 24.81% in reverse scan. Statistical analyses on 100 individual devices with or without HFB were summarized. The PCE for HFB achieved 25.65% on average compared with 24.53% for the control (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">17</ref>). A certified 25.8% PCE was achieved with no hysteresis at the National Institute of Metrology, China (NIM) (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">18</ref> and<ref type="figure">19</ref>). The improvement of efficiency mainly comes from current density and open-circuit voltage. We determined the radiative limit for the open-circuit voltage (V OC rad ) from the external quantum efficiency and electroluminescent spectrum (EQE-EQE EL ) (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref>), with 1.236 V and 1.254 V for the HFB and control samples, respectively, thus non-radiative V OC loss was calculated to be 0.043 V and 0.076 V for each sequentially. The enhancement in J SC is confirmed using EQE measurement (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">20</ref>). We also investigate the three following molecules by forming anion-π interactions with halogen: 2,4,6-trifluoro-1,3,5-triazine, s-tetrazine and pentafluoropyridine, which take effects similarly as HFB, as shown in Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p><p>We also fabricated PSCs with larger areas (1.003 cm 2 ) and the bestperforming device exhibited a PCE of 25.12%, with a high V OC of 1.205 V in reverse scan and 24.13% in forward scan (24.63% on average), which is the highest PCE ever reported for a 1-cm 2 device so far. PL mapping of perovskite films was performed and the HFB film was found to be more uniform (Fig. <ref type="figure">4e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>), which might be of benefit to larger-area PSCs.</p><p>The control FAPbI 3 films remained at only 45% of its initial absorbance on average for ten films, after ageing under humidity (relative humidity (RH) 50-60%) at room temperature (approximately 20 °C) for 72 h (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">21</ref>), although 82% of their initial absorption remained for HFB films on average. One of the best HFB films remained at 95% of its initial absorption after 120 h (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">22</ref>). We further investigated the operational stability of these PSCs by ageing them under nitrogen atmosphere, using MPP tracking with 1-sun illumination at 50 ± 5 °C with a spectral mismatch lower than 2% to AM 1.5 G (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">23</ref>). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4g</ref>, the PCE of the control PSCs decreased by 30% after 600 h, whereas the HFB devices remained at 94% of its initial efficiency after 1,258 h. We further studied their stability at 85 °C (Fig. <ref type="figure">4h</ref>). Control PSCs retained an average of 88.3% of their initial efficiency after 1,255 h for 12 devices. Devices with HFB retained 91.8% of their initial efficiency on average for 12 devices. The enhanced heat resistance might be understood as reduced MA cation residue in HFB perovskite.</p><p>Overall, we have shown that the growth of halide perovskites can be substantially regulated by anion-π interaction with halide in the AX component, which is independently conducted but works well together with BX 2 regulation, leading to dual-site regulation. Particularly, it inhibits formation of δ-FAPbI 3 and reduces component residue in α-FAPbI 3 perovskite, which improves component and phase purity, especially without detectable nanoscale phase impurity. Furthermore, because anion-π interactions widely present between electron-deficient systems and anions, these findings and methodologies may be extended to other solution-processed compound materials with electron-donating anions.</p></div>
