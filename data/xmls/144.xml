The first step was at 1000 rpm for 10 s with an acceleration of 200 rpm s -1 , and the second step was 4000 rpm for 40 s with an acceleration of 1000 rpm s -1 . Room temperature chlorobenzene (400 L) was used as the antisolvent. The chlorobenzene was quickly dripped onto the surface of the spinning substrate over an interval of 1 s during the second spin coating step at 20 s before the end of the procedure. The substrate was then immediately annealed on a 100 C hot plate for 10 min, followed by annealing at 65 C for over 10 min. For the EDAI2 post-treatment, 1.0 mg EDAI2 was added to 1.0 mL IPA and 1.0 mL toluene. The mixed solvent solution was stirred at 70 C for 3 h and then filtered through a 0.20 m PTFE filter before spin coating. 120 L of the EDAI2 solution was applied to the annealed and cooled perovskite films by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 20 s with an acceleration of 1333 rpm s -1 . Following spin coating, the films were immediately annealed again at 100 C for around 5 min (see more detail at Fig. <ref type="figure">S47</ref>).</p><p>For the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements, hole-only and electron-only devices were prepared. For the hole-only devices, 150 µL PTAA solution (20 mg mL -1 in chlorobenzene, doped with 1 wt% F4-TCNQ) was spin-coated onto the perovskite films fabricated on the PEDOT:PSS-coated substrates at 2000 rpm for 30 s with an acceleration of 400 rpm s -1 , and the films were immediately annealed at 65 C for around 5 min.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fabrication of solar cell devices</head><p>Glass/FTO substrates (10 Ω sq -1 , AGC Inc.) were etched with zinc powder and HCl (6 M in deionized water), and consecutively cleaned with 15 min ultrasonic bath in water, acetone, detergent solution (Semico Clean 56, Furuuchi chemical), water, and isopropanol, followed by drying with an air gun, and finally plasma treatment. The PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer was fabricated from an aqueous dispersion which was filtered through a 0.45 m PVDF filter and then spin coated on the FTO substrate using a spin program of 10 s at 500 rpm followed by 30 s at 4000 rpm. The films were then annealed in air at 140 C for 20 min. After transferring to an Ar-filled glove box (H2O, O2 &lt;0.1 ppm), the substrates were degassed at 140 C for 30 min. The perovskite layer was fabricated on PEDOT:PSS following the above-mentioned procedure. The samples were moved under Ar to a vacuum deposition chamber, where 20 nm of C60 (deposition rate 0.01 nm s -1 ) and 8 nm of BCP (deposition rate 0.01 nm s -1 ) were deposited by thermal evaporation. The top electrode was prepared by depositing 100 nm of silver (Ag) through a shadow mask. The deposition rate for Ag was firstly set as 0.005 nm s -1 to reach 5 nm, then raised to 0.01 nm s -1 to reach 20 nm, and finally raised to 0.08 nm s -1 to reach the target thickness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterization</head><p>For the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements, the samples were excited by a picosecond pulsed laser with a wavelength of 688 nm (Advanced Laser Diode System) and the excitation frequency of 10 kHz. To shorten the measurement time, the PL signal was divided with a beam splitter (transmission 50%) and detected with a pair of avalanche photodiodes (APD) (ID Quantique). The TRPL signal on each APD was recorded using time-correlated single photon counting boards (Pico Quant). Under weak excitation conditions, a defocus lens was used in order to maintain a high incident photon flux into the APDs. The initial carrier densities were calculated from the excitation photon flux and the absorption coefficient of samples at 688 nm (4.4 × 10 4 cm -1 , Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">S29</ref>). Using a variable neutral density filter, the excitation laser power was adjusted to achieve the desired initial carrier density. The TRPL dynamics were analyzed by the rate equation model reported in our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">1</ref> .</p><p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed with a Hitachi S8010 ultra-high-resolution scanning electron microscope (Hitachi High-Tech Corporation).</p><p>UV-vis absorption measurement was performed with a Shimadzu UV-3600 plus spectrometer (Shimadzu Co., Ltd.). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was conducted with an ELSZ-2000 spectrophotometer (Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd., Japan). The experiment was conducted after around five hours before the sample preparation, as the sample transporting to, and equipment adjustment in, the company. The refractive indices and viscosity of the solvent were 1.4405 and 1.1005, respectively, based on the DMF and DMSO with the volume ratio of 3 to 1.</p><p>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded with a JPS-9010 (JEOL Co., Ltd.) instrument. Perovskite film samples for XPS measurements were prepared in an Ar-filled glove box and transferred to the XPS chamber through an Ar-filled transfer vessel in order to avoid oxygen contamination.</p><p>Photocurrent-voltage (J-V) curves were measured in a N2-filled glove box (H2O, O2 &lt;0.1 ppm) with an OTENTO-SUN-P1G solar simulator (Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd.). The light intensity of the illumination source was calibrated using a standard silicon photodiode. Each device was measured with a 10 mV voltage step and a 100 ms time step (i.e. scan rate of 0.1 V s -1 ) using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The device active area was defined by an optimal mask, 0.0985 cm 2 for the regular devices and 1 cm 2 for the large area cells. Steady-state power output (SPO) measurements were performed by holding the device at the voltage of the maximum power point, as determined by the JV characteristic, and monitoring the current density over the course of 300 s.</p><p>External quantum efficiency (EQE) and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) spectra were measured with a Bunkoukeiki SMO-250III system equipped with a Bunkoukeiki SM-250 diffuse reflection unit (Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd.). The incident light intensity was calibrated with a standard SiPD S1337-1010BQ silicon photodiode.</p><p>UPS was performed with a photoelectron spectroscopy system (PHI5000 Versa Probe II, ULVAC-PHI Inc.) with He I excitation (21.22 eV). A -5.0 V bias was applied to the samples. The chamber base pressure was approximately 1 × 10 -6 Pa. Samples were transferred from the glove box to the UPS chamber without exposure to air.</p><p>ESR measurements were performed with an X-band ESR spectrometer (JEOL RESONANCE, JES-FA200). The parameters for the measurement are as follow. Sweep range, 319 ± 5 mT; sweep time, 2 min; microwave power, 0.5 mW; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation width, 0.3 mT; time constant, 0.1 s; amplitude, 4000; number of scans (accumulation), 29 × 10.</p><p>Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurements were performed on Rigaku SmartLab equipped with a hybrid pixel array detector HyPix-3000. Perovskite films were deposited on the surface of PEDOT:PSS with glass/FTO as substrates and covered with a thin film of spin-coated poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, Sigma-Aldrich) to prevent direct exposure to air. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">1</ref> H NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance-400 spectrometer (400 MHz). The NMR chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to the residual protons and carbons of DMSO-d6 (δ = 2.50 ppm in 1H NMR).</p><p>Quantum yields were determined with a Hamamatsu Photonics Quantaurus-QY Plus C13534 with calibrated integrating sphere system. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data were obtained in inert atmosphere under AM1.5G simulated solar radiation, using an Agilent E4990A impedance analyzer. Scans were taken from 20 Hz to 20 MHz, with a 30 mV oscillator voltage, recorded for forward bias voltages between 0 and 1.2 V in 0.1 V steps. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurements were carried out using a ToF.SIMS 5 (IONTOF GmbH) operated in the high lateral resolution mode (burst alignment mode). A 50 kV Bi3 2+ primary ion beam with pulses width of 125 ns was used for data acquisition. Primary ion dose density (PIDD) was maintained less than approximately 5 × 10 11 ions cm -2 in each measurement cycles to prevent sample damage from the irradiation of primary ion beam. For sample etching, a 10 kV Ar gas cluster ion beam (Ar-GCIB) with a center size of approximately 1200 atoms was used as sputtering ion beam. The raster area of the primary ion beam was 30 µm × 30 µm and that of the sputtering ion beam was 500 × 500. Depth profiles and three-dimensional images of EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated ingredients (or ions) were reconstructed from the raw data after data acquisition. In addition, mass spectra and depth profiles with high mass resolution were acquired from an area of 200 µm × 200 µm by using high mass resolution mode (bunching mode). A low-energy electron-flood gun was used for charge compensation.   perovskite films. Noting that, the size of Cl -is even smaller than that of I -within the perovskite composition. Thus, Cl -is highly mobilizable in the whole wet process of the film fabrication.</p><p>Additionally, Cl -is too small to be composed to the perovskite structure in this case, it is therefore expelled out of the perovskite structures, and ends up at the grain surfaces, especially the top the bottom surfaces of the resultant films. A perovskite precursor solution containing 20 mol% GlyHCl was rapidly injected into the chlorobenzene antisolvent under vigorous stirring, forming black perovskite crystallites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S19a</ref>). The crystallites were collected and dried under vacuum, before re-dissolving them in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 and measuring the 1 H NMR spectrum. Signals from GlyH + could be identified, in addition to those from FA + and MA + (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S19b</ref>). By comparing the integrated peak areas, the ratio of GlyH + against the total of A site component (Cs + , FA + , MA + ) was estimated to be 0.20. Assuming all the materials bind as a full coverage monolayer to the perovskite surfaces, an analysis of the surface/volume ratios suggests this would correspond to the formation of ca. 20 nm nanocrystals. More importantly, we note that the hydrogen atoms from the ammonium head of GlyH + are shifted by 0.32 ppm compared with the pristine GlyHCl (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S19c</ref>), indicating that the ammonium group of GlyH + cation has an affinity for the perovskite components.    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XRD characterization</head><p>To confirm the effect of GlyHCl on the enhancement of the film crystallinity, we also compared the XRD patterns of the films fabricated with the addition of 2, 4, and 8 mol% GlyHCl without EDAI2 post-treatment. The intensity of the (100) peak increases with the amount of GlyHCl added into the precursor solution, and no new peaks or peak-shifts can be observed. We can therefore conclude that GlyHCl enhances the crystallinity of the resultant perovskite films without inducing new crystalline phases, such as the low dimension perovskite crystals. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Surface treatment</head><p>The composition of the co-solvent system (isopropanol and toluene with the volume ratio of 1:1) used for the EDAI2 post-treatment is very important. The polarity of the isopropanol helps the organic ammonium salts to anchor to the film surface, enhancing defect passivation 2 . Sncontaining perovskites are soluble in isopropanol <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">3</ref> , however, so toluene was applied to reduce the overall viscosity of the solution to accelerate the dispersion of the EDAI2 solution on the films before spinning. The viscosity of isopropanol and toluene is 2.40 and 0.59, respectively. The average thickness of the perovskite films is 870, 830, and 860 nm for control, EDAI2treated, EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated perovskite films, respectively. The EDAI2-treated film is notably thinner than the control, this phenomenon also can be observed in the sample prepared for the SCLC characterizations (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">S2</ref>), confirming the polishing effect of the post-treatment with EDAI2 solution.     To further investigate the structural characters at the film surface, we conducted grazing incidence XRD (GIXRD) measurements with incident angles of 0.2, 0.4, and 1.0° (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S26</ref> and<ref type="figure">27</ref>). As the incident angle increases, more structural information is collected from regions further away from the top surface of the perovskite layer. As incident angle increased, the interplanar space in the crystal lattice of the films with treatments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S26a</ref> and<ref type="figure">b</ref>) expanded, indicating that the film at the surface region is more compressed than the bulk <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">4</ref> . For the films fabricated with different modifications, the intensity of the (100) peaks increases especially with the incident angle of 0.2° (Fig. <ref type="figure">S26d</ref>), confirming the benefits of the treatments on the film crystallinity, particularly at the surface region.     for the GlyHCl/EDAI2-treated sample. The value of A is three orders of magnitude lower than that of MAPbI3 1 , suggesting that our films have a lower density of traps such as the structural defects and impurities. The value of B is one order of magnitudes lower than that of MAPbI3 1 , probably because of the smaller bandgap energy of Sn-Pb perovskites. The obtained unintentionally-doped carrier density N is similar to the reported values of MAPbI3 (~10 15 cm -3 ) 1 , suggesting that the characteristic p-doping commonly observed in Sn-containing perovskite materials is largely suppressed in our GlyHCl/EDAI2-treated mixed Sn-Pb perovskite films.   Dashed lines represent the fit of the decay signals to the rate equations reported in our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">1</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Space-charge-limited currents (SCLC) characterization</head><p>Trap densities in the perovskite films were estimated from dark current-voltage (I-V) curves obtained for FTO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PTAA/Ag hole-only, and FTO/C60/perovskite/C60/Ag electron-only devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">6</ref> . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">S32</ref> shows the I-V curves of the hole-only devices. The voltages where the currents start to sharply increase can be assigned to the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), from which the trap density, Ntrap, can be estimated using the following relation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">VTFL = Ntrap(eL 2 )/(2εrε0)</formula><p>, where e is the elementary charge of the electron, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite (around 32) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">7</ref> , and L is the thickness of the perovskite film. The VTFL values are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">S2</ref>. The estimated trap densities for the control, EDAI2-treated, and EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated films were 3.0 × 10 15 , 2.9 × 10 15 , and 1.7 × 10 15 cm -3 , respectively. The EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated films have the lowest trap-state density, and therefore, the corresponding devices should have the smallest number of recombination events. Meanwhile, the EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated films also showed a low density of electron traps (2.9 × 10 14 cm -3 ), as determined from the electron only devices.               </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further detail about the filming processes for better lab-to-lab reproducibility</head><p>We observed white dots forming at the bottom surface of the films processed on 1.1 mm thick ITO substrate. However, this phenomenon cannot be observed in the films deposited on 1.8 mm thick FTO-based substrates with the normal fabrication conditions. We also found that the white dots will be formed even on the films fabricated with FTO substrate, if we drip the antisolvent preheated up to 45 °C. We therefore believe that the formation of the white dots is related to the cation exchange processes during the crystal growth (see the details in the main text). The cation exchange is a dynamic process, which is closely linked to the time dependence of the wet process.</p><p>In the case of FTO, if the films were deposited with the hot antisolvent, the wet films tend to dry much faster than the case with the cold antisolvent. In the hot antisolvent dripping case, therefore, the whole cation exchange processes cannot be completed in time, resulting in white dots at the bottom surface of the films. In the ITO case, we may alleviate it by reducing the amount of GlyHCl added into the precursor solution and/or optimizing the fabrication conditions by, for example, i) changing the temperature of the antisolvent, ii) controlling the temperature inside the glovebox, or iii) dripping the antisolvent in a time window that ensures a sufficient time to complete the cation exchange within the whole crystallization process.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PLQY characterization</head><p>We fabricated perovskite films on PEDOT:PSS to evaluate the nonradiative recombination in our system via PLQY measurement. On PEDOT:PSS, the PLQY of the EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated perovskite film is 2.1%, considerably higher than that of the control film (~0.001%), verifying that the nonradiative recombination pathways in the EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated films are largely suppressed. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. S1 .</head><label>S1</label><figDesc>Fig. S1.

A, B, and N are the carrier trapping rate, the two-carrier radiative recombination coefficient, and the unintentional doped carrier density, respectively. Note that photoexcitation produces equal numbers of electrons and holes. The initial photoexcited carrier density n (t = 0) = n0 is given as follows:</p><p>Here h, c, λ, α, Iex, and Fex are the Planck constant, the speed of light, the excitation wavelength, the absorption coefficient at the excitation wavelength, the excitation fluence, and the excitation photon flux, respectively. In our TR-PL experiments, λ = 688 nm and α = 4.4×10 4 cm -1 . The excitation fluence of Iex = 100 nJ cm -2 corresponds to n0 = 1.5×10 16 cm -3 and Fex = 3.5×10 11 photons cm -2 , comparable to the incident photon flux under AM1.5G.</p><p>By solving the rate equations, the time-dependent PL intensity can be obtained as follows:</p><p>where</p><p>and</p><p>Here, I0 is the initial PL intensity, while ξ is a constant that dependent on several factors, including the detection efficiency and the charge carrier extraction efficiency. According to the global fitting using Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), A = 9.2 × 10 4 s -1 , B = 2.0 × 10 -11 cm 3 s -1 , and N = 8.2 × 10 14 cm -3 are obtained   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impedance characterization</head><p>The complex impedance data provides an accurate and detailed picture of the equivalent circuit resistances <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">10</ref> . Representative complex impedance scans for solar cell devices fabricated with the control, EDAI2-treated, and EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated perovskite layers are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">S51a</ref>. The series resistance is minimal, while the parallel resistance, indicated by the diameter of the main semicircular feature, increases from 290  cm 2 for the control film, to 445  cm 2 for the EDAI2treated and 495  cm 2 for the EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated film. Under the measurement conditions, the parallel resistance (rp) can be interpreted as the shunt resistance of the perovskite layer, and the higher values of the EDAI2-treated and EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated layers reflect the lower leakage current anticipated from the observed improvement in crystallinity and lower trap densities indicated by the SCLC measurements. The parallel resistance for the three devices values measured over a range of applied bias voltages are compiled in Fig. <ref type="figure">S51b</ref>. The overall trends observed in Fig. <ref type="figure">S51a</ref> are reproduced at all bias voltages below 0.3 V, while as the forward bias increases the resistance values decrease as the recombination currents increase. </p></div>			</div>
