<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Substrate preparation</head><p>An etched fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass was consecutively cleaned using Hellmanex (2%, deionized water), acetone and ethanol by sonicating for 10-15 min for each solvent. After drying with compressed air, the glass was further cleaned by UV-ozone for 15min. Compact TiO 2 layer was deposited on top of FTO glass using the spray pyrolysis method (O 2 as the carrier gas): The substrate was preheated to 450 °C; a precursor solution was diluted 0.6 mL titaniumdiisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate), 75 wt % in IPA and 0.4 mL acetyl acetone with 9 mL dry ethanol. After spray pyrolysis, the FTO/c-TiO 2 substrate was heat at 450°C for 5 min before cooling down to ambient temperature. Next, mesoporous TiO 2 (m-TiO 2 ) layer was coated on the compact TiO 2 (c-TiO 2 ) substrate by spin-coating for 20 s at 4000 rpm with a ramp rate of 2000 rpm s -1 , using the commercial TiO 2 paste (30NRD, Dyesol) diluted with anhydrous ethanol at a weight ratio of 1:6. After drying at 80 °C, the as-prepared FTO/c-TiO 2 /TiO 2 paste was sinter at 450 °C for 30 min under dry air flow, yielding FTO/c-TiO 2 / m-TiO 2 , which was then deposited with perovskite freshly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perovskite active layer deposition</head><p>Perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving a mixture of PbI 2 (1.61 mmol, 742.0 mg), FAI (1.31 mmol, 224.4 mg), MABr (0.15 mmol, 16.2 mg), and CsI (0.08 mmol, 19.8 mg) Cs 0.05 FA 0.85 MA 0.10 Pb(I 0.97 Br 0.03 ) 3 with 5% excess of PbI 2 in 1 mL of mixed solution of DMF and DMSO [DMF (v):DMSO (v) = 4:1] under mild heating condition at ~70 °C to assist dissolving. The perovskite active layer was deposited using an antisolvent method, with CB as the antisolvent. The perovskite precursor solution was deposited on the freshly prepared FTO/c-TiO 2 /m-TiO 2 substrate, and a two-step spin-coating method was applied. The first step was carried out at 2000 rpm with an acceleration rate of 200 rpm/s for 10 s. The second step followed at 6000 rpm with an acceleration rate of 2000 rpm/s for 30 s. CB (100 μL) was slowly dripped at the 15 s before the second step end. After this, the substrate was annealed at 120 °C for 20 min. For PEAI and tBBAI treatment, 15 mM PEAI and tBBAI was dissolved in IPA and spin-coated on the surface of the perovskite at 2000 r.p.m for 20 s without additional annealing procedure. The preparation of the perovskite layer was carried out in a dry air-filled glove box with the relative humidity about 2%.</p><p>Hole-transporting layer Spiro-OMeTAD was selected as a hole-transporting material. Spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in CB with a concentration of 77.6 mM, 1 mL Spiro-OMeTAD solution was doped by 20.6 μL Li-TFSI (520 mg/mL in Acetonitrile) and 35.5 μL tBP. The mixed Spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin coated on the surface of the perovskite at 4000 rpm for 20 s with an acceleration rate of 2000 rpm/s.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gold electrode</head><p>The gold electrode was thermally evaporated on the surface of the Spiro-OMeTAD with the shadow mask with an aperture area of 5 mm by 5 mm. The thickness of the gold electrode was adjusted to 80 nm, and the evaporation speed was adjusted to 0.01 nm s-1 at the first 10 nm, 0.02 nm s-1 for the thickness between 10 nm and 20 nm and 0.08 nm s -1 for the rest 60 nm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Photovoltaic performance measurements</head><p>After finishing the gold evaporation, current-voltage characteristics were recorded under ambient temperature and air conditions. The PSCs were measured using a 300-W Xenon light source from Oriel. The spectral mismatch between AM 1.5G and the solar simulator was calibrated by a Schott K113 Tempax filter (Prazosopms Glas &amp; Optik GmbH). A silicon photodiode was used as light intensity calibrator for each measurement. Keithley 2400 was used for the current-voltage scan by applying an external voltage bias and measuring the response current with a scan rate of 50 mV/s. The cells were masked with a black metal mask with an area of 0.16 cm 2 . IPCE was recorded with a commercial apparatus (Aekeo-Ariadne, Cicci Research s.r.l.) based on a 300-W Xenon lamp. Stability of the cells was measured under a white light-emitting diode lamp with biologic MPG2 potentiostat and was performed under N 2 gas flow. The device area was masked to around 0.16 cm 2 . The spectral mismatch between AM 1.5G and the solar simulator was calibrated by a Schott K113 Tempax filter, whose light intensity was calibrated with a silicon diode. The light intensity was around 83 mW cm -2 , and the actual current was adjusted according to in-time calibration result from the silicon diode. The ambient stability data were acquired from the tracking of a nonencapsulated device exposed to open air. The relative humidity of the ambient atmosphere varies from 50-70%. Relative humidity was monitored by Sigma-Aldrich Humidity/Temperature Pen 445580.</p><p>XRD measurement X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were recorded on an X'Pert MPD PRO (PANanalytical) equipped with a ceramic tube providing Ni-filtered (Cu anode, λ = 1.54060 Å) radiation and a RTMS X'Celerator (PANalytical). The measurements were done in BRAGG-BRENTANO eometry from 2θ = 5-60 °.</p><p>SEM and XPS measurements SEM were recorded using a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (Gemini-SEM 300). An electron beam accelerated to 3 kV was used with either In-Lens or SE2 detector. XPS measurements were performed with a PHI VersaProbe II scanning XPS microprobe using a monochromatic Al Ka x-ray of 24.8-W power with a beam size of 100 mm. Core-level signals were obtained at 45° take-off angle. All peaks were calibrated using C 1s peak at 284.8 eV to correct charge shift of binding energies. Curve fitting was performed using the PHI MultiPak software. Depth profiling etching speed was calibrated using Si as standard. The top-view and cross-sectional morphologies of the films were characterized using a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Merlin) with an in-lens detector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contact angle measurement</head><p>The hydrophilicity of surfaces as a function of time was assessed by contact angle measurement by a drop shape analyzer (KRÜSS, DSA100) at ambient temperature. PL, TRPL, and UV-vis measurements UV-vis absorptions were measured using a Varian Cary 500 spectrometer (Varian, USA). Steady-state PL was measured using a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog Spectrofluorometer, and for PL life time measurement [time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC)], a picosecond pulse diode laser (EPL-405; excitation wavelength, 405 nm; pulse width, 49 ps) was used. PLQY Absolute photoluminescence measurements were done using an integrating sphere (from Fluorolog, Horiba JobinYvon). The samples were excited with a 442 nm CW laser (Obis) with a beam diameter of 700 µm (FWHM) and 0.1 mW intensity. This results in a photon flux of 1.5•10 21 s -1 m -2 which is similar to the above bandgap photon flux at 1 sun ( 1.66•10 21 s -1 m -2 ). The output of the integrating sphere was measured with a fiber connected with an Andor Kymera 193i spectrometer using a silicon CCD camera (iDus DU240A-OE). We calibrated the system with a halogen calibration lamp (HL-3 plus CAL from Ocean Optics).</p><p>SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES Note 1. Numerical simulations to model TRPL data Our model is similar to the work of Baloch et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> . The underlying continuity equation for the carrier concentration n(z,t) is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝜕𝑛 𝜕𝑡 = 𝐷 𝜕 2 𝑛 𝜕𝑧 2 -𝑘 1 𝑛 -𝑘 2 𝑛 2 ,</formula><p>where D is the carrier diffusion coefficient, k1 the non-radiative monomolecular bulk recombination constant and k2 the radiative bimolecular recombination constant (also called B). We use Robin boundary conditions 𝐽(𝑧 𝑏 , 𝑡) = -𝐷 𝜕𝑛(𝑧 𝑏 ,𝑡) 𝜕𝑧 = 𝑆 𝑏 • 𝑛(𝑧 𝑏 , 𝑡) to account for surface recombinations at the boundaries at zb (= 0 or L, where L is the film thickness) with the surface recombination velocities Sb which are different for each of the boundaries. For the numerical simulation we used the Crank-Nicolson method. Note 2. Determination of the radiative limit 𝑽 𝒐𝒄 𝒓𝒂𝒅 For the determination of V oc rad , we follow the work of Tress et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> . From the photoluminescence spectral photon flux 𝐽 𝑒𝑚 (𝐸) we calculate the spectral shape of the absorptance using the Boltzmann approximation of the Lasher-Stern-Würfel <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> equation 𝐽 𝑒𝑚 <ref type="bibr">(𝐸)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= 1 4 𝜋 2 ℏ 3 𝑐 2 𝐸 2 𝑎(𝐸) exp((𝐸-∆𝐸 𝐹 ) (𝑘 𝐵 𝑇) ⁄</formula><p>) and the spectral photon flux of the blackbody radiation</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝛷 𝐵𝐵 (𝐸) = 1 4 𝜋 2 ℏ 3 𝑐 2 𝐸 2</formula><p>exp(𝐸 (𝑘 𝐵 𝑇) ⁄</p><p>) which yields 𝑎(𝐸) ~ 𝐽 𝑒𝑚 (𝐸)/𝛷 𝐵𝐵 <ref type="bibr">(𝐸)</ref>. We recalibrate the absorptance with the IPCE at 775 nm (1.60 eV) from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5(c)</ref> (IPCE (1.60 eV) = 90%). This yields the absorptance spectrum as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S4</ref>. The exponential fit between 1.47 and 1.55 eV results in the Urbach energy Eu = 17.9 meV. From 𝑎(𝐸) we can calculate the emitted photon flux in thermal equilibrium 𝐽 𝑒𝑚,0 = 𝑒 ∫ 𝑎(𝐸)𝛷 𝐵𝐵 (𝐸)𝑑𝐸 and from this the radiative limit open-circuit voltage</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">V oc rad = 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 𝑒 ⁄ ln(𝐽 𝑝ℎ 𝐽 𝑒𝑚,0 + 1 ⁄ ) = 1.270 V,</formula><p>where Jph = 25 mA/cm² is the short circuit current. For this calculation we used the temperature T = 25 °C, which is the temperature of the devices during the IV measurements. As a comparison, for a bandgap of 1.55 eV the Shockley-Queisser limit of V OC is 1.278 V which is ~ 10 mV higher than V oc rad .       <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> enabling high-performing PSCs with efficiency up to 23.3% <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[5]</ref> and 23.7%, <ref type="bibr">[1a]</ref> respectively. The state-of-the-art HTL materials are organic materials bearing triphenylamine moieties (such as spiro-OMeTAD and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,5,6-trimethylphenyl) amine) to ensure the hole transport, while such organic materials are intrinsically hydrophobic and nonpolarized, resulting in contact issues of the interface between the perovskite and HTL. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[6]</ref> Moreover, due to the polycrystalline nature of solution-processed perovskite layers, large amounts of defects, such as grain boundaries and vacancies form during fabrication process. <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> The photovoltage of PSCs depends on the dynamics of charge carrier recombination which occurs in the bulk or at the interface. <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> Seo et al. report a double-layered halide architecture to overcome sluggish hole transfer from the perovskite to HTL, and achieved a PCE up to 22.7%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[9]</ref> Sherkar et al. showed that trap-assisted recombination at the interface between HTL and the perovskite Passivation of interfacial defects serves as an effective means to realize highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, most molecular modulators currently used to mitigate such defects form poorly conductive aggregates at the perovskite interface with the charge collection layer, impeding the extraction of photogenerated charge carriers. Here, a judiciously engineered passivator, 4-tert-butyl-benzylammonium iodide (tBBAI), is introduced, whose bulky tert-butyl groups prevent the unwanted aggregation by steric repulsion. It is found that simple surface treatment with tBBAI significantly accelerates the charge extraction from the perovskite into the spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporter, while retarding the nonradiative charge carrier recombination. This boosts the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSC from ≈20% to 23.5% reducing the hysteresis to barely detectable levels. Importantly, the tBBAI treatment raises the fill factor from 0.75 to the very high value of 0.82, which concurs with a decrease in the ideality factor from 1.72 to 1.34, confirming the suppression of radiation-less carrier recombination. The tert-butyl group also provides a hydrophobic umbrella protecting the perovskite film from attack by ambient moisture. As a result, the PSCs show excellent operational stability retaining over 95% of their initial PCE after 500 h full-sun illumination under maximum-power-point tracking under continuous simulated solar irradiation.</p></div>

We conceived and synthesized the new molecular passivator 4-tert-butyl-benzylammonium iodide (tBBAI). The bulky tert-butyl substitution group of tBBAI prevents the unwanted aggregation by steric repulsion as revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). tBBAI exhibits an outstanding passivation ability as implied by increased photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) accompanied by larger quasi-Fermi level splitting (ΔE F ) in the perovskite films, resulting in a high open circuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.142 V. It is worth noting that the perovskite we use is iodide-rich with I:Br = 97:3, with an optical bandgap as low as 1.55 eV. Therefore, the voltage loss of the optimized device is ≈410 mV, approaching 90% of the radiative limit. This is considered as one of the lowest voltage losses for PSCs. Timeresolve photoluminescence (TRPL) experiments reveal that the PSCs with a tBBAI interfacial layer show enhanced charge transfer from the perovskite layer to HTL than the control devices, presumably related to a reduced hole-extraction barrier due to a better contact between highly polarized perovskite layer and the nonpolarized HTL, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[9]</ref> resulting in a significant improvement in fill factor (FF) of 82% than 75%. In addition, the device with more hydrophobic tert-butyl substitution endowed tBBAI-passivated perovskite, the better resistivity to moisture. These results combined, highly efficient mesoscopic PSCs has been achieved with PCE up to 23.5%, where V OC and FF are as high as 1.142 V and 82.1%, respectively. In addition to the outstanding PV performance, tBBAI-passivated PSCs retained over 95% of their initial efficiency during PV operation for a period of 500 h under simulated full-sun irradiation.</p><p>PEAI is one of the most widely used passivation agents reported so far. <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> While with enhanced PV performance and operational stability compared to nonpassivated PSCs, incremental studies on chemical tailoring of PEAI are rare. Our previous study proved that by substituting the hydrogen (H) of the benzene ring with fluorine (F), the free energy of the perovskite surface was significantly reduced, endowing the perovskite with superior stability against moisture in ambient air. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[6]</ref> The perovskite layer Cs 0.05 FA 0.85 MA 0.10 Pb(I 0.97 Br 0.03 ) 3 with 5% excess of PbI 2 was fabricated using antisolvent method <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[14]</ref> and annealed at 120 °C for 20 min before applying the modulators. The passivation agent, PEAI and tBBAI were applied by spin coating on the perovskite surface with 15 × 10 -3 m solution in isopropanol without further annealing (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1B</ref>). The surface morphology of the PEAI and tBBAI-passivated perovskite films is characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1C-E</ref>. For the untreated neat perovskite film, it is observed that the domain size of the perovskite crystals is around 500 nm. After passivating with PEAI and tBBAI, their appearance remains unchanged, implying that the surface passivation does not alter the morphology of the perovskite active layer.</p><p>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to characterize the surface elemental properties of the passivated perovskite, and the results are summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2A-C</ref>  in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2B</ref>. In the neat perovskite film, a CO peak at ≈288 eV is observed, which is related to the oxygen and water exposure of the surface of the perovskite film. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[5]</ref> This peak is significantly suppressed in the XPS spectra of the passivated perovskite film, proving that surface passivation with PEAI and tBBAI can effectively protect the perovskite from oxygen and moisture in ambient air. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[5]</ref> A further XPS depth profiling for tBBAI-passivated perovskite was carried out to reveal the out-ofplane direction elemental distribution as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2C</ref>. Compared to the spectra of the neat perovskite film (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S1</ref>, Supporting Information), the I 3d signal gradient of perovskite/ tBBAI starts at deeper part in the film, suggesting the tBBAI layer thickness of &lt;5 nm.</p><p>The structure of the unpassivated and passivated perovskite film is characterized by XRD. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S2</ref> in the Supporting Information. The detailed XRD for 2θ &lt; 20° is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2D</ref>. Similar to a previous report, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[5]</ref> nonpassivated perovskite film shows excessive amount of PbI 2 at ≈12.8°. For the PEAI-passivated perovskite film, diffraction peaks corresponding to PEAI at 2θ = 4.3°, 8.6°, and 12.9° are observed, implying crystalline PEAI on the surface of the perovskite film. The XRD spectrum of the tBBAI-passivated perovskite film exhibits no extra diffraction peaks, which suggests an amorphous morphology of the passivation layer. We attribute this result to an increased steric hindrance due to the tert-butyl substitution of tBBAI as compared to PEAI.</p><p>We investigated the optoelectronic quality of the perovskite film by TRPL and steady-state absolute intensity photoluminescence (AIPL). TRPL measurements on samples with the structure glass/FTO/mp-Al 2 O 3 /perovskite/interface layer/ without and with HTL (spiro-OMeTAD) are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3</ref>. For the samples without HTL (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3A</ref>), at t &gt; 200 ns after the excitation pulse the TRPL curves can be well fitted with a (mono-) exponential function with the decay times shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> in the Supporting Information. We observe a significant difference between the surface treatment with the two modulators: The decay time for the PEAI-treated perovskite film is a factor of three and for tBBAI a factor of five higher than for the nonpassivated film. We apply numerical simulations to model the TRPL measurements at times beyond 200 ns. The details of these simulations are described in the Supporting Information (Note S1). Since the only difference between the samples is the surface layers, we fitted the numerical model to the data with only one free parameter, the surface recombination velocity S. For the sample with the longest decay time (tBBAI, black dots in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3A</ref>), the decay could be caused not only by S but also by nonradiative bulk recombinations (with monomolecular recombination rate constant k 1 , see Note in the Supporting Information) or radiative bimolecular recombinations (with bimolecular recombination rate constant k 2 ). Therefore, three extreme cases are considered, where the PL decay at later times for tBBAI is caused exclusively by nonradiative (bulk) recombinations ( , 0, 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">1 1 max 2 = = = k k k S</formula><p>), by bimolecular radiative (bulk) recombinations ( , 0, 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">2 2 max 1 = = = k k k S</formula><p>), and by surface recombinations (k 1 = k 2 = 0). The S-fits for all these cases are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>   Information. Taking into account these cases, one can estimate the surface recombination velocity for the different samples, which is 33±3 cm s -1 for the control, 8±3 cm s -1 for PEAI, and 3±3 cm s -1 for tBBAI which demonstrates the positive effect on surface defect passivation of PEAI and even more pronounced of tBBAI.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4A</ref> shows the external PLQY ext of the perovskite films with the different interface layers and with HTL measured at an excess carrier generation rate corresponding to 1 sun conditions. We determined the PLQY ext by AIPL measurements with the method described by de Mello et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[15]</ref> PLQY (</p><p>= P E E L E E , where P is the AIPL spectral photon flux and L in is the spectral photon flux of the excitation beam. The respective AIPL data are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S3</ref> in the Supporting Information. The PLQY ext can be expressed in terms of the radiative (R rad ) and nonradiative (R nr ) recombination rates PLQY ext = R rad /(R rad + R nr ) which makes it a useful tool to investigate bulk, interface, and surface charge recombination characteristics. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4A</ref>, the PLQY ext of PEAI is about three times and of tBBAI eight times higher than the control sample without interface layer. The interface layers cause a significant decrease of interface recombinations at the perovskite/HTL interface which implies an improved defect chemistry. From PLQY ext the quasi-Fermi level splitting ΔE F can be calculated with the following equation: <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[16]</ref> ΔE F = q V OC,rad + kT ln(PLQY ext ), where V OC,rad is the radiative limit of V OC , the calculation of which is shown in the supplementary information (Note S2, Supporting Information). ΔE F /q for the differently treated films is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4B</ref>. The PEAItreated film shows a ΔE F increase of 28 meV and the tBBAItreated film an increase of 48 meV compared to the control sample without interface layer. Since ΔE F /q is the maximum V OC that a PSC with this layer structure can exhibit, we present measured V OC 's of the complete PSCs with similar layer structure in Figure <ref type="figure">4B</ref> as well. To be comparable with ΔE F /q, which is determined from quasi-steady-state PLQY ext measurements, we measured the quasi-steady-state V OC 's, i.e., stabilized after 2 min exposure under 1 sun simulated illumination conditions. We also show the stabilized V OC 's of the same samples after 30 min light soaking under 1 sun in ambient air. With PEAI surface treatment, the V OC increased by 25 mV from 1.086 to 1.111 V and with tBBAI by 41 mV to 1.125 V compared to the control sample, which is in good agreement with the trend seen in the ΔE F measurements. The offset of ≈40 mV between the stabilized V OC and ΔE F /q can be explained by energetic misalignment at both interfaces as has been shown by Caprioglio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[17]</ref> This demonstrates the beneficial effect of PEAI and tBBAI treatment in preventing interfacial charge carrier recombination. Furthermore, it shows that tBBAI is a significantly better interface passivation agent than PEAI with a 65% higher ΔV OC increase compared to the sample without interface </p></div>

B) Stabilized V OC and quasi-Fermi level splitting ΔE F /q for the layer structure glass/FTO/compact-TiO 2 /mesoscopic-TiO 2 /perovskite/interface layer/HTL. The stabilized V OC after 30 min light soaking is also shown. passivation layer. After 30 min under 1 sun light soaking the ΔV oc 's are 32 mV for PEAI and 56 mV for tBBAI-treated films, which confirms the trend. Note that there is a 15 mV V OC drop for the control sample, 9 mV drop for the PEAI, and a negligible V OC drop for the tBBAI-treated films. This shows that the interface layers used here also increase the short-term V OC stability under light soaking in ambient air and that tBBAI shows superior performance in comparison with PEAI.</p><p>To further demonstrate the effect of these interface layers on the optoelectronic properties, we measured the TRPL of the passivated perovskites films with HTL (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3B</ref>). We attribute the rapid decay of the PL signal within the first 10-60 ns to three major processes: First, carrier diffusion leads to a fast decay of carrier concentration close to the front surface of the incident light pulse; <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref> second, halide perovskites have a positively charged mid-gap trap state caused by iodide vacancies with a large capture cross-section for electrons. Once these trap states are filled they are neutral and, hence exhibit a very low capture cross-section for holes so that the hole lifetime is in the µs range. <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref> This fast electron capture leads to a rapid decay of the PL signal at early times. Third, hole injection into the HTL also causes a rapid decay of the PL signal with a rate proportional to the carrier concentration at the interface, which is highest within the first ≈100 ns. Whereas the first two mechanisms are the same for all our samples, the third mechanism depends on the specific interface and HTL. Hence, the difference in TRPL for the first 60 ns is caused by different hole transfer rates into the HTL. The PEAI-treated film shows a significantly faster hole extraction into the HTL compared to the untreated film but it is outperformed by tBBAI. This faster charge transfer is very likely caused by a smaller hole transfer barrier and, concomitantly, by a lower hole transfer resistance. Due to the intrinsically high polarization of the perovskite material and the low polarization of the organic and hydrophobic spiro-OMeTAD, we expect a hole transport barrier that is related to the poor contact of HTL and perovskite. With the ambipolar passivation agent bearing ammonium iodide that coordinates with the perovskite and hydrophobic ligand similar to that of HTL, the barrier shall be minimized. If we compare the difference between PEAI and tBBAI, less crystalline tBBAI is most probably creating more even coverage on the surface of the perovskite (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S4</ref>, Supporting Information), creating better contact and at the same time a better defect passivation at the interface between HTL and perovskite.</p><p>To demonstrate the advantage of the new passivation agent in solar cells, PSCs are fabricated with tBBAI as passivation agent; for comparison, PEAI and nonpassivated perovskites are applied. The PSCs have the n-i-p device architecture fluorinedoped tin oxide (FTO)/compact TiO 2 /mesoscopic TiO 2 /perovskite/PEAI or tBBAI/spiro-OMeTAD/gold. I-V curves of these cells under 1 sun illumination are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5A</ref> and the corresponding PV parameters in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>. A champion cell with a PCE of 23.5% is achieved with tBBAI passivation, with a V OC of 1142 mV, an FF of 82.1%, and a J SC of 25.1 mA cm -2 . This V OC represents a voltage loss of 408 mV with respect to the optical bandgap of 1.55 eV (derived from the inflection point of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5C</ref>), which is 89.9% of the radiative limit of V oc of 1270 mV (see Note S2 in the Supporting Information). Negligible hysteresis of 1.8% and 0.8% is observed between the forward and reverse scan of PEAI and tBBAI, respectively. By contrast, the hysteresis of nonpassivated PSC is as high as 5.5%, with 20.1% PCE for the forward scan and 21.2% for the reverse scan. The PV metrics in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S6</ref> in the Supporting Information depict the high reproducibility of the PV performance in this study. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5B</ref> shows the stabilized Adv. Mater. 2020, 32, 1907757 power output at the maximum power point (MPP) for the best performing devices under dehumidified ambient air (10% RH (relative humidity)) within the first 6 min. For tBBAI, the stabilized PCE is 23.3%, which is in good agreement with the PCEs obtained from the forward and backward J-V scans. However, we observed a decrease with PSCs from initially 22.7% to 22.2% with PEAI as a passivator, which proves the superior performance of the tBBAI-treated devices. IPCEs are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5C</ref>. The integrated photocurrent is in good agreement with the corresponding J SC values measured from J-V curves (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5D</ref> shows the illumination intensity dependence of the V OC from which the ideality factor n id can be extracted. The unpassivated film has an n id of 1.72, PEAI passivation leads to 1.47 and tBBAI passivation to 1.34. An n id of 1 is expected for a film with only bimolecular radiative recombinations whereas an n id of 2 indicates that all recombinations are nonradiative monomolecular. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[20]</ref> tBBAI shows the n id closest to 1 which indicates the lowest nonradiative recombination rate followed by PEAI and the unpassivated film which is in good agreement with the findings from the optoelectronic measurements.</p><p>Operational stability data obtained with PSCs at MPP under 1 sun irradiation and in nitrogen atmosphere (N 2 ) are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6A</ref>. After 500 h, the PSC passivated by tBBAI interlayer retained 95% of its initial efficiency, in contrast to 84% for the PSC with PEAI interlayer and 70% for the nonpassivated PSC. The major contribution to the efficiency decline observed for the latter PSCs arise stems from a decrease in FF (≈87% compared to initial value), The reason for this is likely that the PEAI interlayer or the direct contact between perovskite and HTL does not form a stable interface as contrast to tBBAI. Contact angle measurements of water droplets on the surface of perovskite films with and without interfacial layers are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6B</ref>. The bare perovskite film, perovskite film with PEAI, and tBBAI surface treatments exhibit contact angles with a water droplet of 54°, 62°, and 82°, respectively. Using Neumann's equation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[6]</ref> we calculated a surface free energy of 32.9 mJ m -2 for tBBAIpassivated perovskite, which is substantially lower than 50.2 mJ m -2 for pristine perovskite film, implying a better moisture resistance for tBBAI-passivated perovskites. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[21]</ref> To further prove this, PSCs with and without interface layers are aged under ambient condition with an RH of 50-70%, the results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S7</ref> in the Supporting Information. It is observed that after 55 days (≈1300 h), the PSC with tBBAI interlayer decreased by less than 10%, while in comparison, PSC with PEAI decreases by 16% and PSCs without interface layer decreased by over 26%. This larger performance decrease implies a faster degradation of the perovskite films due to increased moisture uptake.</p><p>In conclusion, a new surface passivation agent, tBBAI was developed. Electro-optical characterizations show that tBBAIpassivated perovskite films exhibit less nonradiative charge carrier recombination, i.e., a lower defect density, and a significantly improved charge extraction from the perovskite film to the HTL. We observe a V OC increase of ≈20 mV with tBBAI compared to PEAI, and ≈50 mV compared to the perovskite films without passivation. Our tBBAI champion cell yielded PCE of 23.5%, which is among the highest PSC efficiencies achieved so far. In addition, the enhanced hydrophobicity of tBBAI compared to PEAI leads to an enhanced moisture resistivity, and thus better operational stability. PSCs with tBBAI retained over 95% of their initial PCE after 500 h MPP tracking, and over 90% of their initial PCE after 55 days ageing under ambient air with an RH of 50-70%. Our work provides a simple yet effective approach to fabricate efficient PSCs with outstanding efficiency and high operational stability.  <ref type="bibr">c)</ref> [mA cm <ref type="bibr">-2</ref> ] J SC <ref type="bibr">d)</ref> [mA cm <ref type="bibr">-2</ref>   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure S1 .Figure S3 .</head><label>S1S3</label><figDesc>Figure S1.
