This document only contains reviewer comments and rebuttal letters for versions considered at Nature Communications.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REVIEWER COMMENTS</head><p>Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author):</p><p>This is an interesting study which could be useful for the fabrication of large-area FA-based PSCs. The following questions need to be properly addressed before publication. 1. The authors consider a lower trap density of perovskite films after the treatment simply based on the blue shifted and narrowed PL peaks. However, it would be a bit risky to draw to such a conclusion by just PL data because differences in stoichiometry, thickness as well as other factors would also show an impact on the shape and position of PL spectra. I would recommend to further consolidate the claim of decreased trap density by doing other characterizations, such as pumpprobe terahertz or TRMC.</p><p>2. How does the NH3 post healing process affect the thickness of the films considering there have a liquid intermediate during the process.</p><p>3.I appreciate that the statistics have now been included in the stability data. However, details, such as the number of devices and batches, the definition of the error bars,should be properly described in the figure caption as well.</p><p>Reviewer #4 (Remarks to the Author):</p><p>The review is attached.</p></div>

NH3-FACsPbI3 film: After spin coating, the raw FACsPbI3 film is annealed at 140 ˚C for 5 min in ambient air conditions (30-40% humidity), and then transferred into a home-made chamber with the temperature around -15 ˚C. N2 gas is used to remove the moisture-laden air in the chamber. Subsequently, NH3 gas is quickly introduced into the chamber and maintained for ~5 s. Then the NH3 gas is removed from the chamber and the film is further annealed at 140 ˚C for 20 min in ambient air conditions (30-40% humidity). After annealing, some perovskite films are spin coated surface protective layer for the TRPL test, 50 mg ml -1 of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) solution in chlorobenzene was spincoated on some films surface at 3000 rpm for 30 s and without further annealing process.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response:</head><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comment on our insight about the molecular level mechanism. There may be a misunderstanding. Our paper was submitted to Nat.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response:</head><p>"We think that the high boiling point of FA 0 likely makes FA 0 molecules difficult to diffuse into DMSO-d 6 solvent." In this context, we performed the experiment at room temperature (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>), thus, the high boiling point of FA 0 cannot volatilize and diffuse into the DMSO-d 6 solvent as gas. The nonvolatile FA 0 undergoes a hydrolysis reaction in the reactor to produce ammonia (NH 3 ). Thus, only NH 3 signal was detected in the 1 H NMR (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref>(No.1) and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). When temperature of the reactor and the gas pipeline is increased to 150 ˚C, FA 0 can volatilize and enter the DMSO-d 6 solvent. At the same time, some volatile by-products also enter the DMSO-d 6 solvent, and the main compounds are detected: s-triazine, formamide and FA 0 (Table1 (No.2) and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>). The problem here is whether the FA 0 can volatilize easily and diffuse into the DMSO-d 6 solvent, which does not involve the relationship between boiling point and solubility of FA 0 . Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> | (a) Schematic illustration of the chemical reaction between FACl and NaOH powders with the gas collection by DMSO-d 6 under RT or 150 ˚C There are also a number of issues in the interpretation of the NMR data: the assignment is insufficient, some peaks are not discussed and references are not cited to corroborate the proposed assignments.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response:</head><p>Thank you for the suggestion. According to Scheme 1, there are two reactions between FAI and NH 3 , one is the ion exchange reaction, and another is transimination reaction. The both reactions occur simultaneously. On one hand, the ion exchange reaction is reversible, and there is a dynamic equilibrium process in the formed liquid phase FAI•xNH 3 as shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">16(b</ref>). When the liquid phase FAI•xNH 3 was evacuated, the volatile ammonia (NH 3 ) in the system will be greatly reduced and the dynamic equilibrium process will be destroyed and the final product is still FAI powder. On the other hand, during the transimination reaction, one external NH 3 molecular added to imine band in FAI, then the other NH 3 was eliminated from reaction intermediate to form the FAI once again (Figure <ref type="figure">1c</ref> &amp; Scheme 1: R = H). When the external NH 3 is labeled by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> N, it can be seen as a different amine with the unlabeled NH 3 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response:</head><p>Thank you for your suggestion. In FAI•xNH 3 sample, there are a variety of hydrogen bond interaction patterns, including N-H⋯I -hydrogen bond and N-H⋯N hydrogen bond, in which the N-H⋯N hydrogen bond also includes the hydrogen bond between NH 3 -FA or NH 3 -NH 3 .</p><p>The small peaks in the spectrum are the signals of NH 3 under different hydrogen bond patterns.

Can you explain why fit into bi-exponential? What are the physical meanings of the fast and slow components? Response: Thank you for your suggestion. As for the pure perovskite films, there are generally three mechanisms determine PL decay: first-order (trap-assisted nonradiative); second-order (radiative); and third-order (Auger) recombination, and their contributions depend on the intensity of the excitation laser fluence (Nat. Commun. 9, 3021 (2018); Nat. Energy 6, 63 (2021)). The third-order recombination constant under this carrier density is very small (k 3 &lt;&lt; 10 -30 cm 6 /s) and is only narrowly observed in the initial stage (Nat. Energy 6, 63-71 ( <ref type="formula">2021</ref>)). Thus, the third-order mechanism in PL decay analysis is usually neglected. Commonly, the carrier lifetime values were obtained by using the biexponential equation Y = A 1 exp(-t/τ 1 ) + A 2 exp(-t/τ 2 ), where τ 1 and τ 2 denote the fast and slow decay time and are related to the trap-assisted nonradiative and radiative recombination processes, respectively. (Science 370, 108-112 (2020); Nat. Commun. 12, 1554 ( <ref type="formula">2021</ref>)).</p><p>3.The lifetime were only 132 ns for the treated films, which is much shorter than the previous studies for FACs based perovskites (typically a few hundreds of nanoseconds to microseconds). Any explanation? Response: Thank you for your helpful suggestion. The lifetime of 132.78 ns and 10.06 ns in the manuscript is the fast components which is related to the trap-assisted nonradiative, and the longer time in the previous studies for FACs based perovskites generally refer to the average lifetime τ ave (Nat. Commun. 12, 6603 (2021); Nat. Commun. 12, 1554 (2021)). To avoid ambiguity, we have revised the expression in the manuscript. We also reprocessed the TRPL results in Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">30c</ref> and the lifetime of the trap-assisted nonradiative (τ 1 ) was fitted into 6.50 ns and 58.45 ns for Raw and NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 films, respectively. The value of fitting depends heavily on the selection range of data, and our data is equivalent to the results of Nat. Commun. 9, 3021 (2018). The relevant revision is as follows: "The reduced defect density is also evidence by the charge-limited current (SCLC) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results in Supplementary Fig. 1. Regarding the interpretation of TRPL data there is nothing to do with Auger, because the excitation laser fluence is too low for the Auger to kick in. I would also be highly suspicious if the bimolecular recombination would happen at such a low excitaion intensity. I would expect only monomolecular recombination occurred in the film. The authors attribute the fast and slow decays of the TRPL to trap-assisted nonradiative and radiative process, respectively, which should be wrong in this circumstance.</p><p>2.

The data in the old version may be insufficient due to the decomposition of the sample during mailing process. We remeasured the TRPL data and relevant TRPL results in Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">30c</ref> have been revised. The lifetime of the Raw and NH3-FACsPbI3 films was fitted into 20.49 μs and 41.34 μs, respectively.

The lifetime was calculated by bi-exponential fitting with the average lifetimes are of 4314 ns and 2049 ns for the perovskite films after and before NH3 healing.

The volatile aliphatic methylamine with both coordinating ligands and hydrogen protons as solvent or post-healing gas facilitates the process of methylamine-based perovskite films with high crystallinity, few defects, and easy large-scale fabrication as well. However, the attempt in formamidinium-containing perovskites is challenged heretofore. Here, we reveal that the degradation of formamidinium-containing perovskites in aliphatic amines environment results from the transimination reaction of formamidinium cation and aliphatic amines along with the formation of ammonia. Based on this mechanism, ammonia is selected as a post-healing gas for a highly uniform, compact formamidinium-based perovskite films. In particular, low temperature is proved to be crucial to enable formamidiniumbased perovskite materials to absorb enough ammonia molecules and form a liquid intermediate state which is the key to eliminating voids in raw films. As a result, the champion perovskite solar cell based on ammonia post-healing achieves a power conversion efficiency of 23.21% with excellent reproducibility. Especially the module power conversion efficiency with 14 cm 2 active area is over 20%. This ammonia post-healing treatment potentially makes it easier to upscale fabrication of highly efficient formamidinium-based devices.</p><p>Halide perovskite materials with the general formula ABX 3 , where A refers to a monovalent cation such as methylammonium (CH 3 NH 3 + , MA + ), formamidinium (HC(NH 2 ) 2 + , FA + ), Cs + , B represents a divalent cation such as Pb 2+ , Sn 2+ , Ge 2+ , and X represents a halide ion such as I -, Br -, Cl -, have emerged as a class of promising light-harvesting materials in photovoltaics since 2009 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . The highest certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has so far been up to 25.7% 2 , which is comparable to that of widely commercialized Si-based solar cells. The crystal structure of halide perovskites can be regarded as a [MX 6 ] 4-octahedron in a three-dimensional (3D) space with a common apex angle connecting. The A site ions fill up the gap of the octahedral and the structure is stabilized by Van der Waals forces <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . These special structural characteristics provide a variety of solution processing methods to prepare perovskite films <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> .</p><p>The high boiling point aprotic N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), γbutyrolactone (GBL), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) are the common solvents employed to dissolve the perovskite precursors with the formation of solvated iodoplumbate complexes because of the strong coordination between O-donor ligands (OLs) and Pb(II) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> .

High D N solvents with strong coordination with the Pb(II) center also result in the formation of intermediate phase OL-PbI 2 -RAI (RA refers to MA or FA, etc.) prior to perovskite phase during the film fabrication process. The anisotropic growth nature of the intermediate phase leads to rough films with onedimensional (1D) fiber-like structures and a large proportion of void area <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . In this regard, stronger coordinating additives (such as thiourea <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and pyridine <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> ) and/or the fast nucleation strategies (such as anti-solvent extraction, gas-quenching, and vacuum-assisted drying) have been introduced to regulate the growth process of the intermediate phase to achieve highly uniform perovskite films with good crystallinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</p><p>Among them, methylamine (MA 0 ) featured with the presence of hydrogen bonding and low boiling point has become an impressive coordination agent for the MAPbI 3 material. In this case, the formed intermediate phase is a metastable (PbI 2 -MAI)•xMA 0 complex, instead of simple coordinate bond-dominated OL-PbI 2 -MAI adducts. Easy formation of highly uniform (PbI 2 -MAI)•xMA 0 films and following conversion to highly uniform perovskite films are closely related to the self-leveling behavior of (PbI 2 -MAI)•xMA 0 liquid intermediate phase and the ultrafast evaporation of MA 0 gas. MA 0 employed as a posthealing gas to eliminate the voids in the MAPbI 3 perovskite film is firstly reported by Zhou et al. in 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , and the adoption of MA 0 as a volatile solvent system has become a commercially viable technology for MAPbI 3 devices with excellent device reproducibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> . In comparison with MAPbI 3 , α-FAPbI 3 has higher theoretical efficiency and thermal stability.

We have attempted to introduce MA 0 gas-related methods for the fabrication of FAcontaining perovskite layers, unfortunately, resulting in degradation of the 3D perovskite phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . The underlying reason for the irreversible transformation of FAPbI 3 with MA 0 treatment is still not fully clear, let alone make efforts to solve this problem.</p><p>Here, we have systematically studied the underlying chemical reactions between aliphatic amines/formamidine (FA 0 ) gases and FAI salt, and elucidated the addition-elimination reaction between amine compound and the imine band of FA 0 with the formation of ammonia (NH 3 ), also named transimination reaction. Based on this mechanism, NH 3 is selected as a post-healing gas to avoid the degradation of the FA-based perovskite phase during the post treatment. It is demonstrated that decreasing processing temperature is crucial for FAbased perovskite layer to enhance the absorption of NH 3 molecules, leading to the formation of a desired liquid intermediate state. Selfleveling behavior of the liquid intermediate state can quickly heal the voids in the rough perovskite film and finally form a highly uniform and compact film with the evaporation of NH 3 . At last, the PCE of FAbased PSC based on this NH 3 post-healing strategy is more than 23% with a certified PCE of 22.22%. Especially, the PSC module achieves a PCE of 20.61% which is comparable with the highest reports in PSC modules. These results demonstrate the large advantage of the NH 3 gas post-healing technology in upscaling fabrication of highly efficient PSCs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The degradation evidence of formamidinium-containing perovskites in aliphatic amines environment Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a particularly practical tool for quantifying the relative amounts of the organic cations and related chemical reactions in the perovskite precursor <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> . We started with the study of the underlying chemical reactions between FA 0 /R-NH 2 (RA 0 ) gases and FAI salt (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref>). The gases involved include FA 0 , MA 0 , ethylamine (EA 0 ), n-propylamine (PA 0 ), nbutylamine (BA 0 ), and NH 3 . The detailed preparation procedures of the relevant gases are provided in the methods section.</p><p>The synthesis of FA 0 is tricky because of its instability. Mixed FACl and NaOH powders are expected to form FA 0 by the neutralization as shown in Supplementary Scheme 1a. To study their product, deuterated DMSO (DMSO-d 6 ) solvent is used to collect released gas from the mixed powders at room temperature (RT) by a simple equipment (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>) for 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) measurement. Only NH 3 signal is detected in the 1 H NMR (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref> (No. 1) and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). We think that the high boiling point of FA 0 likely makes FA 0 molecules difficult to diffuse into DMSO-d 6 solvent. The formation of NH 3 is indicative of the existence of some chemical reactions in the process of gas preparation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). When the temperature of the reactor and the gas pipeline is increased to 150 °C and DMSO-d 6 solvent is still kept at RT, four main compounds are detected: s-triazine, formamide, FA 0 , and NH 3 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref> (No. 2) and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). The formation of s-triazine is because of the transimination reaction of three FA 0 molecules along with the formation of NH 3 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">2b</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . The s-triazine has also been detected when the FAI powder is heated at 150 °C32 . Formamide is attributed to the hydrolyzation product of FA 0 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">2c</ref>) in the presence of H 2 O which is generated from the neutralization between FACl and NaOH. Considering the long-time interval from gas collection to 1 H NMR measurement, we then employ acetic acid (HOAc) to capture FA 0 so as to limit these chemical reactions in DMSOd 6 solvent by the quick formation of FAAc. As expected, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> H NMR spectrum verifies that the reaction product at 150 °C only exists FAAc rather than s-triazine, formamide, or NH 4 Ac (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref> (No. 3) and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). The above results strongly indicate the formation and instability of FA 0 . When FAI powder is exposed to FA 0 , there is hardly any change in chemical compositions except the formation of a tiny amount of formamide as the presence of H 2 O (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref> (No. 4), Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). These spontaneous reactions and instability of FA 0 seriously limit its practical application in post-healing FA-based perovskite films.</p><p>In comparison with FA 0 , amines are more stable. When FAI powder is treated with MA 0 , EA 0 , PA 0 , or BA 0 , the powder quickly transforms into a liquid state. After the liquid is held at 60 °C for 6 h and then vacuumed (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>), it is unexpected that there are no FAI signals in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> H NMR spectrum of the final powder samples (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref> (No. 5-8), Supplementary Figs. 8-11).</p><p>Taking MA 0 as an example (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref> (No. 5)), we find that the main signals in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> H NMR spectrum belong to N,N'-dimethyl formamidinium iodide (DMFAI) (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">3</ref> and<ref type="figure">8</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . The related chemical reactions are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1 (i,</ref><ref type="figure">ii</ref>). The lone-pair electrons of N atom in nucleophilic MA 0 molecule can attack electrophilic imine bond in FAI, which leads to the formation of N-methyl formamidinium iodide (MFAI) by a transimination process (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>(i), Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> . The imine bond in the formed MFAI can carry out the second transimination reaction with MA 0 to form DMFAI (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>(ii), Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>). With excessive MA 0 and holding for enough time, FAI can fully transform into DMFAI. Similarly, when FAI powders are treated with EA 0 , PA 0 and BA 0 gases, the transimination reaction also occur with the formation of DEFAI, DPFAI and DBFAI, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref> (No. 6-8), Supplementary Figs. 9-11, Fig. <ref type="figure">1(i,</ref><ref type="figure">ii</ref>)).</p><p>When FAI powder is treated by RA 0 (R is referred to H, Me, Et etc.) gas with some H 2 O vapor evaporated from their aqueous solution (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>), the final product is RAI rather than FAI, RFAI or DRFAI (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref> (No. 9-11), Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">12</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">13</ref><ref type="figure">14</ref>). Considering there is no reaction between FAI salt and H 2 O (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref> (No. 12), Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">15</ref>), the formation of RAI mentioned above is due to the reversible ion exchange reactions between FAI, RFAI or DRFAI and RA 0 with the formation of RAI and FA 0 , RFA 0 , or DRFA 0 . The hydrolysis reactions of FA 0 , RFA 0 , and DRFA 0 lead to the formation of volatile HCOOH and RA 0 , which in turn promotes the ion exchange reactions towards the formation of RAI (Fig. <ref type="figure">1 (iii-x</ref>)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</p><p>Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">16</ref> shows the optical photos and XRD patterns of α-FAPbI 3 films before and after MA 0 post-healing treatment. δ-FAPbI 3 , MFAPbI 3 , and DMFAPbI 3 films are also measured for comparison. The formation of the non-perovskite phase after MA 0 post-healing the α-FAPbI 3 film is because of the conversion from FA + to MFA + and DMFA + . This is why aliphatic amines cannot be employed as solvents or post-healing gases for the fabrication of FA-containing perovskite materials. Inspired by the above transimination reaction, NH 3 is selected to avoid the change of composition after the gas post-healing treatment. The 1 H NMR spectrum well verifies no composition change of FAI powder after being treated with NH 3 gas (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref> (No. 13), Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">17</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feasibility analysis of ammonia as the healing gas</head><p>The reversible absorption-desorption process of gas is crucial for the post-healing strategy. MAI and FAI samples are weighted during MA 0 / NH 3 absorption and desorption as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">2a</ref>. The whole process can be divided into gas absorption at RT (Stage I), desorption at RT (Stage II), and desorption at 80 °C (Stage III). When exposed to MA 0 , MAI quickly absorbs MA 0 and reaches a saturated state with the x value of about 2.5 in MAI•xMA 0 (the x value is very sensitive to temperature and pressure). The liquid MAI•xMA 0 complex removed from MA 0 atmosphere desorbs MA 0 gas spontaneously until it transforms into a relative stable semi-solid-state with the x value of about 1.1, which is denoted as stage II. After further heating at 80 °C for 10 min (Stage III), the sample returns to a white powder with the same weight as the initial MAI, which means the complete reversibility of absorptiondesorption process in MAI-MA 0 pair. In FAI-MA 0 pair, the Stage I and Stage II are similar to these of MAI-MA 0 pair, but the weight of the final powder in the Stage III cannot return back to the initial value of FAI because of the formation of MFAI and DMFAI as presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">2a</ref>.</p><p>FAI powder exposed to NH 3 gas atmosphere rapidly achieves a liquid phase FAI•xNH 3 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">18</ref>) with the x value of ∼3.0 (Stage I). The liquid phase transforms into an ice-like transparent solidstate FAI•xNH 3 with x ∼ 1.3 as NH 3 desorption in Stage II and the XRD pattern of the ice-like complex is shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">17</ref>. The following thermal annealing at 80 °C fully removes the absorbed NH 3 molecules and leads to the formation of a white powder with the same weight as the initial FAI (Stage III). This phenomenon, similar to that of MAI-MA 0 pair, preliminarily indicates the feasibility of the NH 3 as a post-healing gas for FA-based perovskite films.</p><p>To make a profound study, the chemical reaction and intermolecular interactions between FAPbI 3 precursors and NH 3 molecules, the solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> N NMR spectra are measured as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">2b</ref> and Supplementary Figs. 19-24. The measured isotopically labeled <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> N samples are <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> NH 3 , FAI treated with <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> NH 3 , and vacuumed (FAI( 15 N)), FAI absorbing <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> NH 3 molecules (FAI•x 15 NH 3 ), PbI 2 absorbing 15 NH 3 molecules (PbI 2 •x 15 NH 3 ), and FAPbI 3 absorbing 15 NH 3 molecules (FAP-bI 3 •x 15 NH 3 ). The 15 N chemical shift of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> NH 3 in DMSO-d 6 is -377.46 ppm. The 15 N NMR spectrum of FAI after treatment with <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> NH 3 (FAI ( 15 N)) shows the <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> N signal at -356.33 ppm, which indicates the existence of transimination reaction between NH 3 and FAI (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>). The reaction process between the NH 3 and FAI is similar to the transimination reaction involving the aliphatic amine. The lone-pair electrons of N atom in NH 3 can attack electrophilic imine bond in FAI, Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> | Chemical reactions related to FAI. The transimination reactions and the ion exchange reactions between FAI and RA 0 molecules (R refers to H, Me, Et, n-Pr, or n-Bu etc.), and the hydrolysis reactions of FA 0 , RFA 0 , and DRFA 0 . leading to the exchange of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> N in NH 3 and 14 N in FAI and formation of FAI( 15 N), as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">2c</ref>. Besides, the <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> N chemical shift of FAI in FAI •x <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> NH 3 is at -265.22 ppm, which moves towards the low field about 91 ppm in comparison with FAI( 15 N). It suggests the presence of hydrogen bond interaction between NH 3 and FAI. Furthermore, the <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> N chemical shift of PbI 2 •x 15 NH 3 at -357.51 ppm moves towards the low field about 20 ppm compared to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> NH 3 , which is due to the coordination of 15 NH 3 to Pb(II). The 15 N chemical shifts of FAPbI 3 •x 15 NH 3 at -265.02 ppm and -357.53 ppm correspond to that of FA + ( 15 N) with hydrogen bond interaction with NH 3 and that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> NH 3 with coordination bond interaction with Pb(II), respectively. The coexistence of hydrogen bond and coordination bond in the intermediate phase FAPbI 3 •x 15 NH 3 is also supported by the solid-state <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> N NMR result in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">25</ref>.</p><p>NH 3 , employed as a post-healing gas, should also have good solubility for the FA-based perovskite precursors, including PbI 2 and FAI powders. The color of mixed PbI 2 /FAI powder exposed in NH 3 gas atmosphere turns into light yellow from the yellow of PbI 2 at 20 °C36 . The mass difference before and after absorption shows that the absorbed NH 3 molecule number per FAPbI 3 is ∼4. While FAPbI 3 •4NH 3 is still a solid-state rather than an expected liquid state, which is very different from liquid MAPbI 3 •xMA with x of only 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . One possible reason is the much smaller size of NH 3 than MA 0 . We have found that the absorbed amount of gas is highly dependent on processing temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . Lowering the processing temperature to -5 °C leads to the formation of a white powder with x value of ∼6.

As shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">27a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>, the raw FAPbI 3 film with voids by the traditional one-step spin-coating method can transform into a uniform film after NH 3 post-healing at -15 °C. The NH 3 post-healing FAPbI 3 is denoted as NH 3 -FAPbI 3 . The XRD spectra show that the NH 3 -FAPbI 3 film has better crystallinity and less undesired δ phase than the raw film (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">27c</ref>). This leads to the increasing PCE of the NH 3 -FAPbI 3 device compared to the raw-FAPbI 3 device (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">27d</ref>). While the PCE of NH 3 -FAPbI 3 device is still limited due to the existence of undesired δ-phase in the perovskite film. To prepare highly efficient PSCs, cesium (Cs) doped FAPbI 3 material system FA 0.9 Cs 0.1 PbI 3 (FACsPbI 3 ) is selected. The NH 3 post-healing process of FACsPbI 3 film is schematically illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">3a</ref>. Due to the thin thickness of perovskite films, the NH 3 gas absorption and desorption are much easier and faster than those of powder samples. The SEM images show that the raw FACsPbI 3 film could be well healed by the NH 3 post-healing method in the temperature range from -15 °C to 0 °C, and -15 °C was used for NH 3 gas post-healing in the following study (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">28</ref>). The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">3b</ref>) shows that there are some micrometer-scale voids in the raw FACsPbI 3 film. While the NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 film is dense and smooth (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">3c</ref>), resulting from the self-leveling of the liquid intermediate state and the quick desorbing process of the NH 3 . This gas post-healing treatment with the self-leveling behavior is essentially different from the traditional posttreatment using DMF <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> , MASCN vapor <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , etc. The corresponding atomic force microscope (AFM) images (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">29</ref>) show that the root mean square (RMS) roughness of NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 film is only 9 nm over a 20 × 20 µm 2 area, which is even lower than that of the film prepared by the traditional antisolvent method (24 nm) (denoted as anti-FACsPbI 3 ).</p><p>X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">3d</ref> and e show that the NH 3 post-healing strategy can improve the orientation of the perovskite film, and the diffraction intensity of (110) peak of the NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 perovskite film is about 100 times stronger than that of the raw FACsPbI 3 perovskite film. Besides, NH 3 post-healing decreases the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the (110) peak from 0.203 o to 0.114 o (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">3e</ref>). As shown in ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) optical absorption spectra (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">3f</ref>) and their Tauc plot curves (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">30</ref>), the raw and NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 perovskite films present almost the same absorption edge and band gap of 1.54 eV. While the absorbance of NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 perovskite film exhibits an obvious increase compared to that of raw perovskite film, resulting from the removal of voids. Photoluminescence (PL) peak of the NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 film is similar to that of the anti-FACsPbI 3 film (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">31</ref>), but obviously blue shift and narrow in comparison with the raw FACsPbI 3 film, which indicates a low trap density of NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 and anti-FACsPbI 3 films in comparison with the raw film <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> . The reduced defect density is also evidenced by the charge-limited current (SCLC) and timeresolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">32</ref>. The calculated defect density from the SCLC curves decreases from 3.97 × 10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> 9.62 × 10 15 cm -3 . And the TRPL results show that the NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 film has a much longer trap-assisted nonradiative lifetime (τ = 5.6 μs) than the Raw FACsPbI 3 film (τ = 3.2 μs).</p></div>

The champion solar cell (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>) based on NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 film displays a PCE of 23.21%, with opencircuit voltage (V OC ) of 1.16 V, short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 24.65 mA/cm 2 , fill factor (FF) of 81.20%, demonstrating obvious improvement in comparison with the PCE of 10.92% of the control device based on raw FACsPbI 3 film and comparable performance compared to the devices (PCE = 22.99%) based on the anti-FACsPbI 3 film in our lab (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">33</ref>). The certified PCE of NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 PSC is 22.22% (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">34</ref>). Meanwhile, there is less hysteresis for the NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 device (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">35</ref>). The stabilized power output (SPO) of NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 champion cells is 22.93%, shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">36</ref>. The J SC of NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 PSC is comparable with the integrated J SC from EQE results (24.41 mA/cm 2 ) in Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>. The distribution histogram of PCE based on 50 NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 devices at reverse scan direction (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref>) shows excellent reproducibility of high-performance NH 3 post-healing devices.

As the low PCE, raw FACsPbI 3 device has not been chosen to study its stability. The shelf stability of unencapsulated devices in Fig. <ref type="figure">4e</ref> shows that NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 device has negligible performance loss after 320 days of storage, which is similar to the anti-FACsPbI 3 devices and much better than anti-FMCsPbI 3 and anti-MAPbI 3 . The XRD and UV-Vis spectra of these aged perovskite films in 320-day-aged PSCs (Supplementary Figs. 39-41) show that NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 film keeps its strong light absorption, and has few PbI 2 . Meanwhile, NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 device still maintains decent crosssectional morphology with clear grain boundaries (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">42</ref>). What's more, the maximum power point (MPP) of the unencapsulated NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 , anti-FACsPbI 3 , anti-FMCsPbI 3, and anti-MAPbI 3 PSCs is tracked under white light emitting diode (LED) irradiation (Fig. <ref type="figure">4f</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">43</ref>) with an intensity equivalent to 1 sun in N 2 atmosphere. After 500 h of continuous light soaking, the NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 device maintains 80% of its initial efficiency, and the stability trend of MPP tracking is consistent with that of shelf stability in these devices.</p></div>

The testing conditions as the films were photoexcited at 483.6 nm pulse width ∼ 118.6 ps, 5 mW/pulse, and emission were collected on the surface side of the film (perovskite/ glass substrate).</p><p>J-V curves of the as-fabricated PSCs were measured using a SourceMeter (Keithley 2400) under simulated one-sun AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm -2 intensity (Oriel Sol3A Class AAA, Newport) with a scan rate of 200 mV/s (the voltage step is 20 mV with no delay time) from reverse and forward two scanning directions in air condition around 25 °C. The typical active area of PSCs is 0.09 cm 2 defined by a metal mask. The area of the mask (0.08713 cm 2 ) used for certification was certified by the National Institute of Metrology, China, No. CDjc2021-10891. The intensity of one-sun AM 1.5 G illumination was calibrated using a Si-reference cell certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. SPO is measured by tracking the current under a fixed voltage which is decided by the voltage of maximum power point at the J-V curve. Here, the fixed voltage of NH 3 -FACsPbI 3 device is 1.002 V.</p><p>For the stability tests, all PSCs were without encapsulation. For shelf-life stability, the devices were stored in a dark environment with a humidity of 10-30%, and the photovoltaic performance of PSCs was measured every ten days. The operational stability was performed using a stability setup (LC Auto-Test 24, Shenzhen Lancheng Technology Co., Ltd.), tested under continuous light illumination and maximum power point tracking (controlled and monitored to be 15 °C). The light source consisted of an array of white LEDs powered by a constant current. The LED type is MG-A200A-AE with an emission spectrum of 400-750 nm (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">40</ref>). Equivalent sun intensities were calibrated using a calibrated Si-reference cell. During aging, the device is connected with a 100 Ohm load resistance. The PSCs were masked and placed inside a sample holder purged with continuous N 2 flow. J-V curves with reverse voltage scans were recorded every 12 h during the whole operational test.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FAAc</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_12"><head>Reviewer # 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>remarks: I thank the authors for the clarification. The control (untreated) film shows quite a long PL lifetime of over 2 microseconds. The control films are full of pinholes and vacancies, indicating its poor quality. Although the morphology does not necessarily indicate strong PL quenching, 2 microseconds is still too long for such a defective film. FYI, the perovskite used in the champion inverted cells published recently on Science is only around 2 microseconds (Science 376, 416-420 (2022)). The authors need to explain why such a defective film show very long PL lifetime. Also, I strongly suggest the authors to double check the TRPL to verify if the lifetimes are consistent in different samples.</figDesc></figure>

Samples No. 3 and 4 were vacuumed before dissolving in DMSO-d 6 . For samples in Table 1 (No. 5-12), the gas sources of R-NH 2 were heated at 60 °C, and the generated gases were collected by 0.2 g FAI powder. The gas sources of R-NH 2 were methylamine alcohol solution, the mixture of EACl and NaOH, PA, BA, NH 3 •H 2 O, MA aqueous solution, EA aqueous solution, or H 2 O, respectively. The samples (No. 5-12) were kept at 60 °C for 6 h, and then vacuum treated to remove the low boiling point components. For the sample in Table 1 (No. 13), the NH 3 gas was collected with 0.2 g FAI powder. The sample was kept at RT for 6 h and then vacuumed. The obtained solid powders in Table 1 (No. 3-13) were dissolved in DMSOd 6 for 1 H NMR characterization.</figDesc><table /></figure>
