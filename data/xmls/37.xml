<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments &amp; Author Rebuttals</head><p>Reviewer Reports on the Initial Version:</p><p>Referees' comments:</p><p>Referee #1 (Remarks to the Author):</p><p>The reduction of open circuit voltage (Voc) deficit in perovskite solar cells is a common issue for the community, especially for wide-bandgap bromine-rich perovskite solar cells. In this work, Chen et al. report a diammonium molecule, 1,3-propylene diammonium (PDA), to regulate surface potential and improve open-circuit voltage of wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells. The authors demonstrate that the PDA molecule has a much better ability for surface passivation/treatment, compared to the common monoammonium molecules. Consequently, tandem solar cells using the PDA-treated widebandgap perovskite solar cells deliver a very impressive NREL-certified efficiency with a very high Voc. Overall, the results are well discussed and solid. This work presents a highly important advance for the perovskite photovoltaic field. Therefore, I would recommend publishing this work after some revisions. Comments to the authors: 1) In Line 133, the authors claim no indication of reduced-dimensional perovskite formation nor of a perovskite polymorph. While I was wondering if the PDA cation can enter the perovskite lattices. The same or similar cation was reported to extend the unit cell and form a 3D "hollow" perovskite structure (</p></div>

Reviewers' Comments to Author:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The reduction of open circuit voltage (Voc) deficit in perovskite solar cells is a common issue for the community, especially for wide-bandgap bromine-rich perovskite solar cells. In this work, Chen et al. report a diammonium molecule, 1,3-propylene diammonium (PDA), to regulate surface potential and improve open-circuit voltage of wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells. The authors demonstrate that the PDA molecule has a much better ability for surface passivation/treatment, compared to the common monoammonium molecules. Consequently, tandem solar cells using the PDA-treated wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells deliver a very impressive NREL-certified efficiency with a very high Voc. Overall, the results are well discussed and solid. This work presents a highly important advance for the perovskite photovoltaic field. Therefore, I would recommend publishing this work after some revisions.</p><p>1) In Line 133, the authors claim no indication of reduced-dimensional perovskite formation nor of a perovskite polymorph.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer #2:</head><p>Chen et al. present a passivation approach, using molecule PDA for efficient treatment at the perovskite/C60 interface.

(Lines 82-85)</p><p>3) On page 7 (lines 116 to 140), the authors state that no reduced-dimensional perovskite formation is discovered, indicating that perovskite does not react with PDA. In what way does the PDA then improve the homogeneity of the surface and prevents the segregation?</p><p>Response: XPS and GIWAXS spectra indicate that while no additional perovskite phase is formed after PDA treatment, the PDA does react with the surface of the perovskite to improve homogeneity, and it does so by removing PbI2 (Figure <ref type="figure">R2c</ref>). Diammonium cations have been shown to have a templating-effect on perovskite crystal growth (  <ref type="formula">2022</ref>)). We have rewritten this discussion in the revised manuscript to include the following:</p><p>"The suppression of surface phase segregation implies that while PDA does not induce the formation of a new crystal phase, it does react with the surface of the perovskite. This has been observed previously with diammoniums which template the growth of perovskite crystallization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">37</ref> " (Lines 121-124)  Response: Since the low-concentration post-treatment with PDA does not result in a peak-shift perceptible in the GIWAXS measurement, it is unlikely that the PDA molecules diffuse into the bulk perovskite. Additionally, the PDA signal in the TOF-SIMS results in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S5d</ref> rapidly decays, implying that PDA only resides as a very thin layer on the top surface of the perovskite.</p><p>We also investigated the possibility that PDA prevents ion migration into the C60/metal electrode by comparing TOF-SIMS results for control and PDA-treated devices after annealing on a hot plate at 100 °C for 20 hours (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">R6</ref>). We found that PDA does slightly prevent ion migration, particularly the migration of Ag into the C60 and perovskite bulk. However, the effect is not significant.  Response: We accept the reviewer's advice that the spectrum of illumination for tandem stability is important. We now updated our MPP tracking data using an AM1.5G solar simulator (G2V sunbrick) for accurate current-matching under MPP conditions. We expect that the photogenerated current in this setup is equal to the EQE integrated Jsc (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">R6</ref>).

Congratulations on this great work！ Two final suggestions: 1) Line 441 and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>, please change SAM to Me-4PACZ, which will be easily understandable. 2) Some Figures in Supplementary Materials are not too clear and could use high-resolution images. The open-circuit voltage (V OC ) deficit in perovskite solar cells is greater in widebandgap (over 1.7 eV) cells than in perovskites of roughly 1.5 eV (refs. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> ).</p></div>

This, we find, stems from inhomogeneous surface potential and poor perovskite-electron transport layer energetic alignment.</p><p>Common monoammonium surface treatments fail to address this; as an alternative, we introduce diammonium molecules to modify perovskite surface states and achieve a more uniform spatial distribution of surface potential. Using 1,3-propane diammonium, quasi-Fermi-level splitting increases by 90 meV, enabling 1.79 eV perovskite solar cells with a certified 1.33 V V OC and over 19% power conversion efficiency (PCE). Incorporating this layer into a monolithic all-perovskite tandem, we report a record V OC of 2.19 V (89% of the detailed balance V OC limit) and over 27% PCE (26.3% certified quasi-steady state). These tandems retained more than 86% of their initial PCE after 500 h of operation.</p><p>The wide range of bandgaps achievable using metal-halide perovskites (around 1.2-3.0 eV) has enabled the development of tandem solar cells with silicon, copper indium gallium selenide and organic photovoltaics <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[9]</ref> . Recently, all-perovskite tandems made from stacked wide-bandgap (WBG; approximately 1.8 eV) and narrow-bandgap (NBG; approximately 1.2 eV) layers surpassed the highest recorded power conversion efficiency (PCE) for a single-junction perovskite solar cell (PSC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">11</ref> . Despite rapid progress, the PCE of perovskite tandems is limited by the large open-circuit voltage (V OC ) loss of the WBG cell <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> . Whereas single-junction PSCs of around 1.5 eV have demonstrated V OC deficits (the difference between the bandgap and device V OC ) as low as 0.3 V 12 , mixed iodide/bromide PSCs over 1.75 eV have yet to achieve V OC deficits lower than 0.5 V (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">14</ref> . The V OC deficit has been suggested to stem from increased trap density in perovskites with over 20% Br concentration, photoinduced halide segregation and poor energetic alignment with charge transport layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">16</ref> . The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of perovskites, once in contact with charge transport layers, tends to decrease markedly, suggesting that the perovskite-transport layer interface produces recombination pathways within the perovskite bandgap <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> . Several causes have been reported in efforts to uncover the origin of this phenomenon, including band misalignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">16</ref> , energy-level pinning <ref type="bibr">5</ref> and halide migration from the perovskite into the transport layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">17</ref> . Here we examine the perovskite-C 60 interface because it is ubiquitous in perovskite tandems, is the most easily accessed interface when fabricating inverted (pin) PSCs and yet is still considered one of the worst offenders in regard to induction of trap states <ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">16</ref> .</p><p>We spin-coated WBG perovskite (Cs 0.2 FA 0.8 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 ) films on top of indium tin oxide (ITO)/hole transport layer (HTL) substrates with the structure ITO/NiOx/[4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)butyl] phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz) and measured their PLQY with and without a C 60 layer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1b</ref>). Consistent with previous reports <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">5</ref> we found that, after C 60 deposition, the PLQY is two orders of magnitude lower, equivalent to a drop of about 100 meV in quasi-Fermi-level splitting (QFLS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">18</ref> .</p><p>Previous studies have focused on post treatments that reduce the defect density of the perovskite surface and thus increase the PLQY of films <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[22]</ref> . Extending this practice to WBG perovskites, we found that treating the surface with the popular passivant butylammonium iodide (BA) increases PLQY but that the improvement was not retained following deposition of C 60 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1b</ref>). Indeed, the QFLS of the stack is probably pinned due to interfacial recombination rather than the inherent trap density of the perovskite <ref type="bibr">5</ref> .</p><p>Seeking a different approach, we reasoned that tuning the surface potential at the perovskite-C 60 interface would suppress this crossinterface recombination by reducing band offset between perovskite and C 60 , and by reducing the population of minority carriers at the interface. This effect is analogous to field-effect passivation in traditional Si solar cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">24</ref> .

Treating the perovskite surface with 1,3-propane-diammonium iodide (PDA) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1a</ref>), the diammonium equivalent to BA, we observed only a slight increase in PLQY. However, following deposition of C 60 there was no marked drop in PLQY, suggesting that the recombination pathways induced by C 60 had been effectively suppressed. We also compared the effects of perovskite post treatments with similar concentrations of 1,2-ethane-diammonium iodide (EDA) and 1,4-butane-diammonium iodide, diammonium ligands with a shorter and longer chain length, respectively. Of these diammonium ligands, only PDA resulted in retention of PLQY after deposition of C 60 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>To understand how both treatments affect interface energetics, we used ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and found that BA induces a Fermi-level downshift whereas PDA induces a Fermi-level upshift, resulting in stronger and weaker surface p-type doping, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1c</ref>). The latter change in surface potential produces a lower minority carrier concentration at the interface and reduces band offset between perovskite and C 60 by 60 meV. Drift-diffusion modelling suggests that this has the potential to increase QFLS by approximately 90 meV (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p><p>Using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and<ref type="figure">6</ref>), we found that PDA ligands are present on the film surface after treatment. Using density functional theory, we studied work function changes following PDA treatment of various surface structures (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1d</ref>). Among considered surface configurations, the pristine Pb-I-terminated surface with a bromide vacancy (V Br ), which exhibited a lower work function (by 0.44 eV) after PDA treatment (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>), was in best agreement with the 0.1 eV shift obtained from experimental UPS data. Then, through density of states (DOS) analysis of BA and PDA surface treatments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1e</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>) we found that, after PDA treatment, the in-gap surface states near the valence band maximum region were suppressed (Supplementary Materials), consistent with Fermi-level upshift relative to the valence band maximum (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1c</ref>) observed in UPS measurements.</p><p>Seeking to investigate how PDA affects films at the nanoscale, we used hyperspectral imaging to generate QFLS maps of perovskite films with and without C 60 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>,b and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>). From these maps we observed significantly greater spatial fluctuation than that observed for perovskites with narrower bandgaps (under 1.65 eV), which have a typical standard deviation (σ) in QFLS of around 10 meV <ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">28</ref> . After PDA treatment, however, σ was lowered significantly (from 61 to 24 meV), suggesting that the treated film is more homogeneous. After C 60 deposition the QFLS of the control dropped (1.32 to 1.25 eV) and broadened further (σ = 77 meV), whereas that of the PDA film was maintained at 1.33 eV but with a slightly narrower distribution (σ = 22 meV). Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>) suggested that this effect is correlated with the nonuniform contact potential of the control film, which will act to broaden interfacial electronic states when in contact with C 60 leading to increased recombination <ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">29</ref> . PDA treatment narrowed contact potential distribution significantly (σ = 2.9 mV compared with 11.1 mV for the control), which is indicative of reduced recombination and improved carrier extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">31</ref> .</p><p>We used grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to show the crystallographic consequences of PDA treatment.

The concentration of PDA spin-coated onto the perovskite surface is low and thus does not appear to result in appreciable diffusion into the bulk perovskite. Two structural differences between control and treated (30 devices for each type). d, Loss analysis for PCE and V OC of control and treated devices. PCE and V OC losses were extracted from pseudo-J-V measurements shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">18</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. 95% DB represents 95% of the detailed balance limit for V OC , and corresponding PCE.</p><p>Nature | Vol 613 | 26 January 2023 | 679 films are apparent, however: (1) a peak at 0.88 Å -1 for the control that we ascribe to PbI 2 , which was entirely removed by PDA, and (2) a secondary peak with a q-space value of 1.03 Å -1 alongside the (1 1 0) perovskite peak (1.00 Å -1 ), indicative of a Br-rich phase. This secondary peak is more obvious when probing only the first 5 nm or so of film, suggesting that the film surface is segregated into PbI 2 -and Br-rich perovskite regions, the probable cause of the broad contact potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">35</ref> . The suppression of surface phase segregation and removal of PbI 2 implies that, whereas PDA does not induce the formation of a new crystal phase, it does react with the surface of the perovskite. This has been observed previously with diammoniums that template the growth of perovskite crystallization <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">37</ref> , and is corroborated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13</ref>), transient absorption (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">14</ref>) and transient reflection spectra (Fig. <ref type="figure">2i,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>).</p><p>Transient reflection spectra show that two additional bleaches are present in the control compared with the PDA-treated sample: a peak around 500 nm (PbI 2 ) and a fast-decaying bleach at around 600 nm (approximately 85% Br-rich perovskite, which correlates exactly with the shift in q-space seen in GIWAXS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">38</ref> .</p><p>Encouraged by the reduced interfacial recombination and surface homogeneity imparted by PDA treatment, we fabricated WBG solar cells. The device structure was ITO/NiOx/Me-4PACz/perovskite/C 60 / ALD SnOx/Ag, in which Me-4PACz is a self-assembled monolayer of [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid. Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref> shows the forward and reverse J-V curves for champion control and PDA-treated 1.79 eV WBG PSCs (external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">15</ref>), exhibiting an increase in V OC from 1.23 to 1.33 V, the highest value of V OC reported for PSCs of T 90 represents the time taken for the device efficiency to drop to 90% of its original value. The tandem device retained over 86% of initial efficiency after 500 h of operation.</p><p>around 1.8 eV (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref> shows the J-V curve of a PDA-treated PSC exhibiting a V OC of around 1.33 V and PCE of 19.3%, as verified by the photovoltaic (PV) cell and module performance group at the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">16</ref>). Improvements in device V OC , fill factor (FF) and PCE were consistent across 30 control and PDA-treated devices, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>. We also fabricated 1 cm 2 WBG devices using PDA surface treatment, which delivered a V OC of around 1.35 V and PCE of 19.0% (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">17</ref>). We conducted transient photovoltage and photocurrent measurements of control and PDA-treated devices (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">19</ref>). The charge-recombination lifetime (τ r ) of the PDA-treated device was longer than that of the control device (2.0 µs compared to 0.4 µs), consistent with reduced carrier trapping at the C 60 interface after PDA post treatment (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">20</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">4</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">39</ref> . Calculating diffusion length (Supplementary Note 2), we found that PDA treatment resulted in a twofold increase, from 600 nm to 1.2 µm.</p><p>We followed the output of a PDA-treated WBG cell operating for 700 h at the maximum power point (MPP) to determine the impact of PDA on device stability (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">21</ref>). After 700 h of continuous operation under 1 sun illumination, the PDA-treated device exhibited no loss in PCE. We attribute this to an increased ion migration barrier exhibited in PDA-treated films, calculated from thermal admittance spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">22</ref>).</p><p>We used intensity-dependent PLQY measurements to conduct systematic loss analysis (pseudo-J-V) of control versus PDA-treated films (Fig. <ref type="figure">3d</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">40</ref> . Both samples have similar bulk and HTL interface losses, but PDA treatment reduced V OC loss at the electron transport layer (ETL) from 104 to 16 mV. PDA also eliminated a 14 mV mismatch between the full-stack QFLS and device V OC present in the control sample, indicating a reduced band offset between perovskite and C 60 after treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">16</ref> , consistent with the band alignment analysis shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. In addition to reduced V OC loss, PDA-treated devices exhibited reduced transport (FF) losses compared with the control (3.4% abs. versus 8.0% abs. ) (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). This also suggests favourable band bending at the treated interface, resulting in improved carrier extraction.</p><p>Using our high-V OC PDA-treated WBG active layer in combination with a Cs 0.05 FA 0.7 MA 0.25 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 NBG mixed Pb-Sn perovskite (approximately 1.2 eV), we fabricated monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells (Methods). The tandem device structure was ITO/ NiOx/Me-4PACz/WBG perovskite/C 60 /ALD SnOx/Au (1 nm)/poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/ NBG perovskite/C 60 /ALD SnOx/Ag (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>); the SEM cross-sectional image shows the thick Pb-Sn perovskite layer (approximate thickness 1.0 µm) needed for current matching (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">10</ref> . The integrated short-circuit current density (J SC ) values for WBG and NBG subcells from EQE measure ments of a tandem device were 15.4 and 15.2 mA cm -2 , respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>). Bandgaps of WBG and NBG subcells calculated from the EQE spectra were 1.79 and 1.22 eV, respectively.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref> shows forward and reverse J-V scans of a champion tandem, WBG and NBG PSCs. A record PCE of 27.4% was achieved with a high V OC of 2.19 V, along with a J SC of 15.1 mA cm -2 and FF of 83.1%. The 2.19 V V OC represents a significant improvement over the previous highest reported V OC among the best all-perovskite tandems 10,41-44 because of the high V OC of the PDA-treated WBG subcell. We sent a tandem cell to an accredited independent PV calibration laboratory (NREL). The device delivered a certified PCE of 26.29% and V OC of 2.13 V (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">23</ref>), representing a certified all-perovskite tandem that surpasses the record PCE (25.7%) of single-junction perovskite solar cells using the asymptotic maximum power (P max ) scan protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">45</ref> . We also fabricated 1 cm 2 all-perovskite tandem solar cells, which delivered a PCE of 26.03% and V OC of 2.16 V (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">24</ref>). We note that there is still room for improvement, particularly in the J SC value of the tandem because J SC values of over 16.5 mA cm -2 have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">10</ref> . Therefore, we anticipate that PCEs approaching 30% are already experimentally feasible.</p><p>We tested operating stability using MPP tracking of an encapsulated tandem in ambient air (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f</ref>). Under global standard spectrum (AM1.5G) 1 sun illumination at MPP, the device retained 86% of its initial PCE after 500 h of continuous operation. This promising operating stability, in combination with high V OC and PCE enabled by diammonium surface modification, represents an important step towards the application of all-perovskite tandem solar cells.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Device testing</head><p>Current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination from a solar simulator (Newport, Class A) with a light intensity of 100 S5 mW cm -2 (checked with a calibrated reference solar cell from Newport). J-V curves were measured in a nitrogen atmosphere with a scanning rate of 100 mV s -1 (voltage step of 10 mV and delay time of 200 ms). The active area was determined by the aperture shade mask (0.049 cm 2 for small-area devices) placed in front of the solar cell. A spectral mismatch factor of 1.0 was used for all J-V measurements. For stabilized output measurements at MPP, the device testing chamber was maintained under ambient conditions. Solar cells were fixed at the MPP voltage (determined from J-V sweeps in both scanning directions) and current output was tracked over time. EQE measurements were performed in ambient air using a QuantX-300 Quantum Efficiency Measurement System (Newport), with monochromatic light focused on the device pixel and a chopper frequency of 20 Hz. For tandem solar cells, EQE measurements were performed in ambient air and bias illumination from bright LEDs, with emission peaks of 850 and 450 nm used for measurement of the front and back subcells, respectively. No bias voltage was applied during EQE measurement of tandem solar cells.</p></div>

Default numerical settings, referred to as 'intermediate' in FHI-aims, were used. Local minimum-energy geometries of Born-Oppenheimer surfaces were obtained with residual total energy gradients below 1 × 10 -2 eV Å -1 for atomic positions, by the PBEgeneralized gradient approximation functional <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">60</ref> within the Van der Waals corrections, followed by the Tkatcheko-Scheffler (TS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">61</ref> method. DOS is calculated by the PBE-generalized gradient approximation functional, including spin-orbit coupling effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">62</ref> , within a k-point grid of 2 × 2 × 1 to sample the Brillouin zone corresponding to the unit cell shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>.</p><p>To mimic the experimental composition Cs 0.2 FA 0.8 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 , an alloyed structure was first built using a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell based on cubic phase conventional cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>) within Cs 0.25 F A 0.75 Pb(I 0.584 Br 0.416 ) 3 . Next, the slab structures (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>) with total c axis set to 100 Å were built based on these PBE + TS relaxed alloyed structures in a 1 × 1 × 3 supercell for Pb-I-terminated and (FA, Cs)-I-terminated surfaces. Detailed surface configurations are very important for prediction of work function tunability, which will be largely affected by surface terminations and defects. As a result, three different surface configurations (perfect surface, surface with one iodine vacancy (V I ) and surface with one bromine vacancy (V Br )) are considered for Pb-I terminations. On the other hand, five different surface configurations (perfect surface, surface with one Cs vacancy (V Cs ), surface with one FA vacancy (V FA ), surface with one iodine vacancy (V I ) and surface with one bromine vacancy (V Br )) are considered for (FA, Cs)-I terminations. In all geometry relaxations for the slab, the bottom three layers of atoms are fixed to mimic the bulk environment and the atomic positions of all atoms besides these three layers are relaxed by PBE + TS.</p><p>Based on these relaxed slab structures, we can calculate the work function changes resulting from PDA treatment according to the electrostatic potential difference between the treated surface (ligands on top; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8b (bottom)</ref>) and untreated surface (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8b (top)</ref>), as shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8c</ref>. Among different surface configurations (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref>), the Pb-I-terminated surface with V Br provides the closest agreement for ΔW after PDA treatment (theoretically calculated value, 0.44 eV) with the experimental UPS data (experimental result, 0.1 eV; Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>). Next, detailed DOS comparison is used to elucidate potential changes to surface states after PDA treatment and their corresponding n-/p-doping effects. In DOS comparison plots, the contribution from the third-bottom fixed Pb-I layers in the slab (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7c</ref>) is used to align DOS positions to the bulk case (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</p></div>

		<title level="m" type="main">present a passivation approach, using molecule PDA for efficient treatment at the perovskite/C60 interface. The results show significantly reduced losses, benefiting from improved energy alignment at the perovskite/C60 interface. This results in much improved single-junction device performance as well as one of the highest certified PCEs for all-perovskite tandem solar cell. The findings are well and clearly presented, and characterization techniques support the effectiveness of PDA layer, including statistics showing good reproducibility of the approach. The use of PDA is novel and with the benefits shown in this paper, I believe the manuscript will raise plenty of attention</title>
