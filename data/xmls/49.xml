T wo-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper layered metal-halide perovskites, with desirable optoelectronic properties and good environmental stability, have recently attracted extensive research interest as one of the most promising materials for the fabrication of long-term operationally stable and high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> . The general chemical formula of the layered perovskite is L 2 A n-1 M n X 3n+1 , where L is a long-chain organic cation (spacer), A is a short-chain organic cation, M is a divalent metal cation and X is a halide anion. The unique architecture, with n layers of inorganic [MX 6 ] octahedral sheets sandwiched by two long organic spacer layers, represents a natural quantum well (QW) due to a mismatch in the dielectric constants between the organic and inorganic layers <ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5</ref> . However, layered perovskites deposited using solution methods typically suffer from a mixture of multiple quantum wells with a random well width (n number) distribution (MQWs), which has severely hindered further progress in this field <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> . The component interaction in the solution generally controls the final assembly of the layered perovskite segment. The perovskite solution prepared with stoichiometric amounts of precursors, however, has been confirmed to be a complex mixture of colloid particles with a random size distribution in a mother solution of dissolved ions <ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr">10</ref> . Although the large particles can be easily filtered out, the small particles with a few unit cells persist in the solution, and could act as nucleation centres in forming QWs with different well widths. Therefore, the deposition of phase-pure QWs remains a key scientific challenge for the thermodynamic stability of compounds in solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary</head><p>Here, we report phase-pure QW thin films by introducing a molten salt spacer n-butylamine acetate (BAAc), instead of the traditional halide spacers n-butylamine iodide (BAI). For strong ionic coordination between BAAc and the perovskite framework during the initial stage of solution processing, compounds with a uniformly distributed intermediate phase can be gelled from the precursor solution with near-monodisperse unit cell particles. We observe that the phase-pure QW films with microscale, vertically aligned grains can then be crystallized from their respective intermediate phases. Two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper layered metal-halide perovskites have attracted increasing attention for their desirable optoelectronic properties and improved stability compared to their three-dimensional counterparts. However, such perovskites typically consist of multiple quantum wells with a random well width distribution. Here, we report phase-pure quantum wells with a single well width by introducing molten salt spacer n-butylamine acetate, instead of the traditional halide spacer n-butylamine iodide. Due to the strong ionic coordination between n-butylamine acetate and the perovskite framework, a gel of a uniformly distributed intermediate phase can be formed. This allows phase-pure quantum well films with microscale vertically aligned grains to crystallize from their respective intermediate phases.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Properties of MQW and phase-pure QW films</head><p>Phase-pure QW (BA 2 MA n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 ) films, with different well widths (&lt;n&gt; = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; &lt;n&gt; represents the designed n value), were prepared by introducing a molten salt spacer BAAc, instead of the traditional halide spacers such as BAI (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> . Here, n is the number of semiconducting [PbX 6 ] 4-octahedron slabs within the organic ammonium n-butylamine (BA) spacers. The number of these slabs determines the QW thickness and the degree of quantum confinement, leading to tunable exciton properties and band gaps. To probe the phase purity of the perovskite films deposited with BAAc, as well as the control films deposited with BAI, femtosecond transient absorption (TA) measurements were conducted on these films (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref> and Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). Upon a 3.1 eV photon pulse excitation, hot charge carriers are injected into all the perovskite QWs. These hot charge carriers subsequently cool to the band edge states or transfer to the adjacent QWs through quantum coupling. The cooled charge carriers in the band edge states induce pronounced photobleaching (PB) in the transitions associated with these states. The high energy level transitions, which dominate the linear absorption above the band gap, are almost invisible in this differential absorption spectrum. Therefore, even if the volume doping concentration of a QW (with n) in a film is very small, the band edge exciton transition associated with this QW (with n) can be identified in the white light probe spectrum, at the early probe delay times <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">15</ref> . Although all the films were prepared with the desired precursor stoichiometry for single-phase perovskite QWs, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> clearly shows that the TA spectra of the QWs (&lt;n&gt; = 2, 3, 4, 5) deposited with traditional BAI are dominated by multiple PB peaks. The peaks located at 516, 572, 610, 644, 670 and 760 nm closely match with the band edge exciton transitions in n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and ∞ QWs, respectively. The multiple peaks indicate that the QW films deposited with traditional halide spacers are perovskite MQWs, which is consistent with previous publications <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">14</ref> . The deposition of phase-pure metal-halide perovskite QWs was a long-term challenge for the research community. By contrast, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, the TA spectra are dominated by single PB peaks, for all the QW films prepared with the molten salt spacer BAAc. The PB signals associated with the undesired phases in each film are almost negligible. These results reveal that near-single-phase perovskite QWs films could be deposited with a molten salt spacer. The phase-pure perovskite QWs show dramatically different linear absorption (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>) and photoluminescence (PL; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref> and Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> and<ref type="figure">5</ref>) patterns from that of the perovskite MQWs. As presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>, the MQW films (for &lt;n&gt; ≥ 2) show typical multiple exciton absorption peaks <ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">17</ref> . Correspondingly, the PL spectra of these films are complicated with multiple peaks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>). Owing to the volume doping concentration of the three-dimensional (3D) perovskite, the phase increases with increasing &lt;n&gt;. This increase combined with an efficient charge carrier funnelling from the thin to thicker QWs <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[21]</ref> causes the PL of the MQW films with &lt;n&gt; &gt; 2 to be dominated by the broad emission from 3D perovskite, with a slight contribution from thin QWs. By contrast, the linear absorption and PL spectra of phase-pure QW films exhibit a clear single peak (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>). Both the absorption and PL peak wavelengths increase monotonically with increasing designed well width &lt;n&gt;. The peak positions of film &lt;n&gt; matched well with the values determined for QW n <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">19</ref> . Furthermore, no obvious PL from 3D perovskite was observed for any of the films. These results further confirm that near-single-phase perovskite QW films were deposited with the molten salt spacer BAAc.</p><p>In light of the above findings, as well as the results of a comparative optical investigation by probing from the top (QW side) and bottom (quartz side) surfaces, the schematic structures of the films deposited with BAI and BAAc are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>, respectively. MQWs with a graded vertical distribution are formed in the films deposited with BAI. Thin QWs were located near the substrate and thick QWs (including the 3D phase) were located on the top, which is consistent with previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">19</ref> . The 3D (n = ∞) phase on top of the films is subject to degradation, which is not good for perovskite stability. By contrast, the phase-pure QW films deposited with BAAc possess a continuous phase distribution, which not only ensures stability but also guarantees efficient carrier transport along the vertical direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">22</ref> . The vertical alignment of the phase-pure QWs was proved with the following crystal structure characterizations.</p><p>The X-ray diffraction patterns of the QW films deposited with BAI and BAAc are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>, respectively. In MQW films deposited with BAI, clear periodic two-dimensional (2D) crystallographic planes (00k) and (0k0) were observed for the &lt;n&gt; = 1 and &lt;n&gt; = 2 films, respectively. However, the 2D crystallographic planes disappeared in the films with &lt;n&gt; ≥ 3 for the largely mixed phases, which is consistent with previous reports 8, <ref type="bibr">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">23</ref> . By contrast, clear periodic 2D crystallographic planes (0k0) were observed in all the films (&lt;n&gt; = 2, 3, 4, 5) deposited with BAAc, which further confirmed their high phase purity. To further elucidate the crystal orientation of the QWs on the substrate, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed on the films (&lt;n&gt; = 4) deposited with BAI and BAAc (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>). The MQW film exhibited diffraction rings with the signal of the (111) plane, indicating considerable randomness of the polycrystalline orientation, which agrees well with the X-ray diffraction results. However, sharp, sporadic Bragg spots in the phase-pure QW films were observed, such as (060), ( <ref type="formula">080</ref>) and (0100) diffractions, suggesting superior crystallinity and preferential orientation with respect to the substrate and high phase purity. The aligned phase-pure QWs could build an efficient carrier-transport channel between the two electrodes, which is favourable for electronic devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">24</ref> . The surface morphologies of the films were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>,f and Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> and<ref type="figure">7</ref>). The results show that phase-pure QW films possess a smooth surface with a large average grain size of ~10 μm, while the MQW films possess much smaller grains (~1-2 µm) and obvious pinholes. The high quality of the phase-pure QW films was further confirmed by atomic force microscopy and photo-image measurements (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">8</ref> and<ref type="figure">9</ref>). These dense and pinhole-free perovskite films with smooth surfaces and excellent crystallinity are highly desirable for optoelectronic devices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probing the formation mechanisms of phase-pure QWs</head><p>The introduction of BAAc into the precursor solution instead of the traditional BAI affected the perovskite sol-gel processes during spin coating. These processes may include solution formation, gelation and crystallization <ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">26</ref> . The solution, prepared with stoichiometric amounts of precursors, has been confirmed to be a complex mixture of colloid particles with random size distribution in a mother solution of dissolved ions <ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr">10</ref> . Although large particles are easily filtered out before spin coating, the small particles with one to a few unit cells persist in the solution, and can act as nucleation centres forming QWs with different well widths. Therefore, this random particle size distribution in the precursor solution is a fundamental limitation for depositing phase-pure QWs films. Here, particle size distribution in the precursor solutions prepared with BAI and BAAc was examined by dynamic light scattering (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>). In the solution prepared with BAI, the particles were randomly distributed, with separation varying from 1 nm to several micrometres, indicating different degrees of [PbI 6 ] 4-octahedron aggregation <ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">27</ref> . Surprisingly, in the solution prepared with BAAc, the particles showed a very narrow size distribution (~0.6 nm). This narrow size distribution may originate from the strong interaction between Ac -and Pb 2+ , which prevents the aggregation of colloids with more than one unit cell.</p><p>To prove this strong interaction between the carbonyl groups of acetate and Pb 2+ , attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectra were collected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>). The asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration peaks of Ac -in pure BAAc are located at 1,557 cm -1 and 1,402 cm -1 , respectively. The corresponding peaks shifted to 1,548 cm -1 and 1,405 cm -1 upon interaction with the lead ions <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">28</ref> . This strong coordination interaction may result in the formation of a stable and homogeneous precursor solution. In addition, the local coordination environment of Pb ions in the precursor solution was examined by X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy at the Pb L3 edge (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c-e</ref>). The extended X-ray absorption fine structure study showed that the coordination environment of Pb in BAAc precursor solution is distinctly different from that in the BAI precursor solution (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). In the solution with   BAI, a dominant peak at a distance R = 2.8 ± 0.01 Å was observed in the Fourier-transformed spectrum (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref>), which corresponds to the Pb-I scattering path. However, in the solution with BAAc (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3e</ref>), the peak of the Fourier-transformed spectrum is located at R = 1.8 ± 0.01 Å, which corresponds to the Pb-O scattering path. Therefore, the strong coordination interaction between Ac -and Pb 2+ was further confirmed by the results of the X-ray absorption near-edge structure. Furthermore, the 1 H NMR spectra (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3f</ref>) show that there is a strong upfield chemical shift (Δδ ≈ 0.08 ppm) in the resonance signal of the -NH 3 + protons, by introducing BAAc (7.57 ppm) instead of BAI (7.49 ppm) into the perovskite precursor solution. This chemical shift is caused by the stronger shielding effect of N-H•••O=C-O -compared to the N-H•••I -hydrogen bond. For these strong coordination interactions between Ac -and the precursors as well as the high viscosity and negligible vapour pressure of BAAc (ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">25</ref> ), as the other solvents evaporate during the initial stage of spin coating, a uniformly distributed intermediate phase could be gelled from the precursor solution with near-monodisperse unit cell particles. Subsequently, a phase-pure QW film with microscale vertically aligned grains could be crystallized from the intermediate phase, by ejecting the coordinated molten salt and evaporating the by-product methylammonium acetate (MAAc). To more clearly illustrate the mechanisms of different QW films deposited with BAI and BAAc, the reaction formation enthalpies were also calculated using density functional theory from first principles. The results clearly show that MQW formation has the lowest enthalpy value in the case of BAI. However, the formation of phase-pure QWs is thermodynamically preferred by introducing BAAc (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Photovoltaic performance of solar cells</head><p>To demonstrate the potential application of phase-pure QW films, efficient solar cells with remarkably high stability and high V OC were constructed. The device structure is made up of layers of indium tin oxide (ITO), SnO 2 nm), perovskite QWs (~500 nm), spiro-OMeTAD (2,2' ,7,7'-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine) -9,9'-spirobifluorene) (~200 nm), MoO 3 (~5 nm) and Au (~80 nm; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>). Here, a value of &lt;n&gt; = 4 QWs is used for its balanced wide-band visible-light absorption and good stability (for other &lt;n&gt; QW devices, see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">13</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>). Scanning transmission electron microscopy cross-sectional images of a typical phase-pure QW device are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>. Compact multiple layers with clear contrast can be observed. The coloured energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental mapping exhibits a uniform distribution of lead and iodide across the perovskite layer, which is further confirmed by the intensity of lead and iodide elemental signals. The uniform element distribution in the phase-pure QW film is significantly different from the vertical gradient distribution of the elements in the MQW films <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">19</ref> . A PCE of 16.25% was achieved for the phase-pure QW PSC, with a record high V OC of 1.31 V, a short-circuit current density (J SC ) of 16.75 mA cm -2 , a fill factor of 74.07% and negligible J-V hysteresis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>). By comparison, the MQW PSC demonstrated a PCE of 13.81%, with a V OC of 1.12 V, a J SC of 18.43 mA cm -2 , a fill factor of 66.95% and visible J-V hysteresis. The increased J SC in the MQW PSC was caused by the broadened visible-light absorption in the MQW film. However, with the large increases in V OC and fill factor, the phase-pure QW PSC presented a substantially higher PCE than the MQW PSC. The steady-state output powers, measured under the maximum power point voltages, are 16.14% and 12.97% for the champion phase-pure QW and MQW devices, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and integrated J SC of the two champion devices are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>. The IPCE spectra closely match the corresponding linear absorption spectra (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>). The integrated J SC is also in good agreement with the value derived from the corresponding J-V measurements. The statistical results of the devices' performance are shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14</ref>. For each condition, 20 devices were fabricated.</p><p>To explore whether the QW phase purity will affect stability, the long-term stability of the PSCs was recorded under various conditions without encapsulation. After storage under ambient conditions (65 ± 10% relative humidity) for 4,680 h, the phase-pure QW device retained 93.8% of its original PCE, while the MQW device showed a 49.4% PCE loss (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4e</ref>). Under accelerated ageing tests in a N 2 -filled glovebox (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4f,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>), the phase-pure QW cells retained 95.7% of their original PCE after continuous heating at 85 °C for 558 h, and retained 96.2% of the initial PCE after continuous illumination at AM1.5G for 1,100 h. By contrast, the MQW device retained only 59.1% and 70.8% of its initial PCE after the corresponding ageing tests (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>). Therefore, the phase-pure QW device possesses much better stability than the MQW device under varying conditions. This conclusion is also consistent with a previous publication <ref type="bibr">12</ref> , which concluded that the stability of thin QWs is better than that of thick (or 3D perovskite). The long organic cation spacers between the inorganic slabs could be responsible for blocking the perovskite from reacting with moisture and oxygen, as well as inhibiting ion migration within the perovskite lattice <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[32]</ref> . In phase-pure QW films, the inorganic slabs are uniformly protected by the spacer layers, whereas in the MQW films, there are substantial thick QWs and 3D perovskite crystals. Hence, QW phase purity is of crucial importance for device stability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Our findings show that the traditional constraints of deposition phase-pure QW films could be overcome by introducing a molten salt spacer.

The liquid product was put into a refrigerator for 2 h to crystallize. The frozen product was washed three times with diethyl ether and then was dissolved in ethanol and recrystallized from diethyl ether three times. Then, the solid product was dissolved in ethanol again, and liquid product was collected by reduced pressure rotary evaporation at 80 °C for 1 h. Finally, the liquid product was cooled to room temperature.</p><p>Synthesis of perovskite precursors. The BA 2 MA n-1 Pb n I 3n+1 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving BAI, MAI and PbI 2 , or BAAc, MAI and PbI 2 in DMF and DMSO (volume ratio is 4:1). For the n = 1-5 systems, the molar concentration of BAAc (liquid) was 0.58 mmol ml -1 , 0.31 mmol ml -1 , 0.21 mmol ml -1 , 0.16 mmol ml -1 and 0.13 mmol ml -1 , respectively. The obtained solution was stirred at 65 °C for 2 h in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. BAAc-based precursor (&lt;n&gt; = 1) was prepared with BAAc (76.86 mg, 0.58 mmol), HI (~66 µl, 0.58 mmol) and PbI 2 (133.14 mg, 0.29 mmol) in DMF and DMSO. For the &lt;n&gt; &gt; 1 precursor, we provided additional MAI with the BAAc in the amount needed to make up for the insufficient iodine; for example, the &lt;n&gt; = 2 precursor contained BAAc (41.47 mg, 0.31 mmol), MAI (74.36 mg, 0.47 mmol) and PbI 2 (143.74 mg, 0.31 mmol); &lt;n&gt; = 3 precursor contained BAAc (28.39 mg, 0.21 mmol), MAI (67.90 mg, 0.43 mmol) and PbI 2 (147.65 mg, 0.32 mmol); &lt;n&gt; = 4 precursor contained BAAc (21.59 mg, 0.16 mmol), MAI (64.53 mg, 0.41 mmol) and PbI 2 (149.68 mg, 0.32 mmol); and &lt;n&gt; = 5 precursor contained BAAc (17.42 mg, 0.13 mmol), MAI (62.46 mg, 0.39 mmol) and PbI 2 (150.93 mg, 0.33 mmol).</p><p>Device fabrication. The patterned ITO substrate was washed with deionized water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol successively, with drying under nitrogen flow. After 15 min ultraviolet-O 3 treatments, a SnO 2 nanocrystal solution was spin coated on the substrate at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s to form a 50-nm-thick electron-transporting layer, which was then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in air. For the persistent hot-casting process, the ITO/SnO 2 substrates were preheated at 100 °C on the spin coater for 5 min, and 50 μl of precursor solution was dropped onto the hot substrate. The spin coater was immediately started with a spin speed of 4,000 r.p.m. for 20 s with 4,000 ramp, and the substrate temperature was elevated from 100 °C to 110 °C by a program controller. The colour of the thin film turned from pale yellow to brown in a few seconds as the solvent escaped. After spin coating, the substrates were quickly removed from the spin coater and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min covered with a small Petri dish. The substrates were then transferred to a nitrogen glove box to complete the device fabrication. For the hole transporting layer, a spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (75 mg ml -1 ) solution was employed with the addition of 35 μl Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (260 mg ml -1 ) and 30 μl 4-tertbutylpyridine. For the stability test, PTAA solution was obtained by dissolving 40 mg PTAA powder in 1 ml chlorobenzene with 10% TPFB. Then 35 μl of the spiro-OMeTAD solution or PTAA solution was dropped onto the perovskite-coated substrate and spin coated at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The device was finished by the thermal evaporation of molybdenum trioxide (5 nm) and Au (80 nm) under vacuum with a shadow mask that kept an active area of 0.05 cm 2 .</p><p>Characterization.

PL (excitation at 400 nm) was measured with an Edinburgh Instruments machine (FLSP980). The J-V curves were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter and 425 W collimated xenon lamp (Enlitech SS-F5-3A) calibrated with the light intensity to 100 mW cm -2 under AM1.5G solar light conditions by a certified silicon solar cell (NREL). To ensure the accuracy of the J SC measured from the J-V scans, a mask with an aperture area of 0.05 cm 2 was covered during the measurement. The J-V curves were scanned by reverse (forward bias (1.4 V) → short circuit (-0.2 V)) or forward (short circuit (-0.2 V) → forward bias (1.4 V)) scan with a scan rate of 50 mV s -1 and 1 ms delay time. The J-V measurements of non-encapsulated solar cells were performed in a N 2 -filled glove box. The IPCE was measured on a QE-3011 computer-controlled system (Enlitech). The diameter of the fibre-optical for the IPCE measurements was 3 mm. Dynamic light scattering measurements were performed by a Zetasizer Nano 55 ZS instrument (Malvern Instruments) with a 633 nm He-Ne laser.</p><p>Stability test. The thermal stability of the non-encapsulated solar cell was tested in a nitrogen atmosphere by tracking the device performance at 85 °C. Light stress stability tests were carried out under AM1.5G solar light in a N 2 -filled glove box. Full simulated sunlight was used during the whole ageing process. All devices were aged under open-circuit conditions, and were taken out from the chamber and tested at different time intervals under a separate solar simulator (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm -2 ) for J-V characterization. The J-V curves were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter under one sun illumination (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm -2 ), equipped with a 425 W collimated xenon lamp (Enlitech SS-F5-3A), in which the light intensity was calibrated by the NREL certified silicon solar cell. When measuring the cells during ageing, we removed them from the ageing chamber and allowed them to cool to room temperature, which typically took a few minutes. The relative humidity in the laboratory was within 65 ± 10% during the entire ageing test.</p><p>GIWAXS measurements. GIWAXS measurements were performed at beamline BL14B1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Samples prepared on Si/ SnO 2 substrates used an X-ray beam (λ = 0.68877 Å) at an incident angle of 0.20° for 20 s, and the scattered light was collected by a MarCCD charge-coupled device detector system at a distance of ~746 mm vertically from the sample.</p><p>Fourier-transform infrared spectra. Fourier-transform infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer equipped with a mercury-cadmium-telluride detector. KBr was put in the sample position for background collection. Infrared spectra were recorded at the same temperature in the 4,000-500 cm -1 range; 32 scans were recorded in the absorbance mode. A Nicolet 6700 instrument equipped with a mercury-cadmium-telluride detector was used to collect transmission infrared spectra of powder samples at a 4 cm -1 resolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">H NMR.</head><p>The 1 H NMR spectra were recorded on a JNM-ECZR (JEOL) NMR spectrometer. The samples were prepared by dissolving 15 μl BAAc and BAI precursors in 0.8 ml DMSO-d 6 .</p><p>Atomic force microscopy measurements. The surface morphologies of the perovskite films with &lt;n&gt; = 4 values were measured using ScanAsyst in air.</p><p>The cantilever used is ScanAsyst-Air, a silicon tip on a nitride lever with spring constant of ~0.4 N m -1 . Samples were prepared in air under the same spin-coating conditions as the devices.</p><p>Scanning transmission electron microscope measurements. We used a dual-beam focused-ion-beam system (Quata 3D FEG) to prepare the cross-sectional samples. The samples were characterized by a Titan G2 80-200 ChemiSTEM microscope operated at 200 kV. High-angle annular dark-field and transmission electron microscopy observations on the samples were conducted using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope operated at 200 kV. All transmission electron microscopy experiments were conducted under low-dose conditions to minimize beam damage.</p><p>X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy measurements. Transmission mode Pb L-III edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy measurements were collected on the 1W1B beamline of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Science. The electron beam energy of the storage ring was 3.5 GeV with a maximum stored current of 300 mA. All the collected spectra were processed and analysed using Athena and Artemis software (version 0.9.26) within the IFEFFIT package <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">34</ref> . Pb metal foil was calibrated to the literature photoelectron energy origin value, E 0 , for the Pb L-III edge (13,035 eV). The background was removed, and the data were assigned an Rbkg value of 1.4. The passive electron factors, S 0 2 , were determined by fitting the result of the experimental PbO and PbI 2 data, and then fixed for further analysis of the measured samples. The parameters including the electronic properties (for example, correction to E 0 ) and nature structure coordination environment including coordination number (CN), fitting bond distance (R) and Debye-Waller factor (σ 2 ) around the absorbing atoms were allowed to vary in the whole fitting process. The fitted ranges for R and k spaces (k weighted), where k is the wave vector of the ejected photoelectron, were selected to be R = 1.4-3.5 Å -1 and k = 2.6-13.0 Å -1 , respectively.</p><p>Transient absorption. The broadband femtosecond TA spectra of the perovskite films were taken using the Ultrafast System HELIOS TA spectrometer. The laser source was a Coherent Legend regenerative amplifier (150 fs, 1 kHz, 800 nm) seeded by a Coherent Vitesse oscillator (100 fs, 80 MHz). The broadband probe pulses (420-780 nm) were generated by focusing a small portion (around 10 mJ) of the fundamental 800 nm laser pulses into a 2 mm sapphire plate. The 400 nm laser pulses were generated by passing the strong 800 nm femtosecond laser beam through a beta barium borate crystal.</p><p>Theoretical calculation. The generalized gradient approximation proposed by Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof was used for the electronic exchange and correlation function. The energy cut-off was 500 eV, and a Monkhorst-Pack k-mesh of 2 × 2 × 1 was used in the calculations. All atoms were allowed to relax during the geometrical optimization until the force acting on a single atom was less than 0.01 eV Å -1 .
