<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Low-dimensional (quasi-) 2D perovskites are being extensively studied in order to enhance the stability and the open-circuit voltage of perovskite solar cells. Up to now, thin 2D perovskite layers on the surface and/ or at the grain boundaries of 3D perovskites have been deposited solely by solution processing, leading to unavoidable intermixing between the two phases. In this work, we report the fabrication of 2D/3D/2D perovskite heterostructures by dual-source vacuum deposition, with the aim of studying the interaction between the 3D and 2D phases as well as the charge transport properties of 2D perovskites in neat 2D/3D interfaces. Unlike what is normally observed in solution-processed 3D/2D systems, we found a reduced charge transport with no direct evidence of surface passivation, in spite of larger open-circuit voltage. This is likely due to a nonfavorable orientation of the 2D perovskite with respect to methylammonium lead iodide and to the formation of 2D phases with very low dimensionality (pure 2D).</p></div>

The general formula for pure 2D perovskites is (R-NH 3 ) 2 MX 4 , where R is an aliphatic or aromatic group. The layered perovskite family is not restricted solely to this structure, and thicker inorganic sheets can be incorporated as well.

While an increase in stability was found for the surface-modified solar cells, the performance and especially the photovoltage were not found to improve as compared to the reference MAPI devices.</p><p>In this work, we report the fabrication of 2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions by dual-source vacuum deposition, with the aim of studying the interaction between the 3D and 2D phases as well as the charge transport properties of 2D perovskites in neat 2D/3D interfaces. We prepared 2D/MAPI/2D perovskite heterostructures by employing pure MAPI (3D) and pure phenethylammonium lead iodide (PEA 2 PbI 4 , 2D). These structures were integrated into vacuum-deposited PSCs. In order to rationalize the role of each interface, we also separately studied the two possible bilayer configurations, 2D/MAPI and MAPI/2D. Unlike what was observed in solution-processed 3D/2D films, we observed generally hindered charge transport with no direct evidence of surface passivation. These phenomena are likely due to a nonfavorable orientation of the 2D perovskite with respect to the MAPI (growth parallel to the substrate and impeding charge transport) and to the formation of 2D phases with very low dimensionality (n virtually equal to 1). Despite the lower mobility and unfavorable orientation of the 2D perovskite, we identified a trade-off between the open-circuit voltage (V oc , which was found to increase up to 1.1 V) and fill factor (FF, related to charge transport) as a function of the 2D layer thickness.</p><p>The 2D PEA 2 PbI 4 perovskite thin films were prepared by cosublimation of the precursor compounds, phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) and lead iodide, upon calibration of the deposition rate for each material. The calibration factor was obtained by comparing the thickness of the thin film detected from the quartz crystal microbalance sensors with that measured with a mechanical profilometer. PEAI can be sublimed with a stable and controlled deposition rate; however, it must be properly outgassed in high vacuum before deposition.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACS Energy Letters</head><p>Letter provided in the Supporting Information. Estimation of layered PEA 2 PbI 4 perovskite stoichiometry was performed offline with X-ray diffraction (XRD). The diffractograms (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) were collected for both the pristine samples and low-temperature annealed films (5 min at 100 °C in an inert atmosphere). The as-prepared materials already show the expected XRD pattern for a 2D perovskite, meaning that crystallization occurs already at room temperature, as for vacuum-deposited MAPI films.</p><p>However, after the short low-temperature annealing, we observed more intense diffraction peaks, indicating a wellcrystallized perovskite. The c-axis diffraction signals strongly dominate the diffraction pattern, with six observed [00l] peaks (5.4°, 10.8°, 16.3°, 21.7°, 27.2°, 32.8°) corresponding to the (002), (004), (006), (008), (0010), and (0012) crystal planes, respectively. The preferential orientation along the [00l] direction suggests that the 2D perovskite film grows with the alternating organic and inorganic sheets parallel to the substrate's plane. Such an orientation is not a priori favorable for device operation as the insulating organic sheets would be perpendicular to the direction of charge transport. The optical absorption spectrum of the PEA 2 PbI 4 film (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) exhibits the characteristic components of 2D perovskites: a band in the UV-blue range, corresponding to the interband transitions leading to free carrier generation, and a red-shifted intense peak at 508 nm due to exciton absorption. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">59</ref> The corresponding photoluminescence (PL, measured upon excitation with a continuous-wave laser at 375 nm) spectrum shows the expected sharp emission peak with a very small Stokes shift at 521 nm, with a full width at halfmaximum (FWHM) of only 22 nm. Taken together, the XRD and the optical characteristics indicate the formation of a pure 2D (n = 1) perovskite compound. The morphology of the layers was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>). SEM shows a distinct morphology with well-defined, randomly distributed platelets (size up to 500 nm) composed of grains in the &lt;100 nm range. These vacuum-deposited 2D materials were found to be very reproducible and could maintain stable structural properties for more than 6 months (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S1</ref>).</p><p>We then used these 2D films to fabricate perovskite heterostructures. Initially, we deposited 10 nm thick PEA 2 PbI 4 films below and on top of a 500 nm thick MAPI film in order to investigate the influence of the 2D layers on the morphology and crystallinity of the 3D perovskite. The XRD patterns of a 3D sample on glass and sandwiched between 2D layers are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S2</ref>. As can be observed for the reference sample (MAPI on glass), a preferential orientation occurs along the [110] direction, as commonly observed for both solution-processed and vacuum-deposited MAPI. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">61</ref> However, when the MAPI layer is sandwiched between two PEA 2 PbI 4 films, we observe a decrease in the intensity of the ( <ref type="formula">110</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">220</ref>) peaks along with an increase of the ( <ref type="formula">022</ref>) and (134) reflections. These observations suggest a change in the orientation of the MAPI film when deposited between 2D perovskites. The change of the diffraction profiles together with their enlarged FWHM also indicates a reduction of the crystal size for the MAPI film. We also noted a weak diffraction signal at low angle (2θ = 12.7°), ascribed to the presence of unreacted PbI 2 , both in the pure MAPI and in the 2D/MAPI/ 2D heterostructure. The role of a small PbI 2 excess in MAPI films has been widely studied, but its effect has not been fully rationalized yet. Specifically, in vacuum-deposited MAPI films and solar cells, the presence of resilient PbI 2 has been often identified, and it seems not to interfere with charge generation and transport. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">63</ref> Interestingly, in several solution-processed 3D/2D perovskite systems, excess PbI 2 is intentionally used as a platform to then form a low-dimensional perovskite by simply spin-coating the corresponding organic ammonium halide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">41</ref> In our case, the excess PbI 2 in the MAPI film is maintained even after deposition of the 2D PEA 2 PbI 4 film. Considering that no PbI 2 diffraction could be observed in pure PEA 2 PbI 4 films (meaning that the PbI 2 signal comes only from the underlying MAPI layer), these observations suggest that no intermixing takes place between the two materials, resulting in a neat 3D/2D perovskite interface. The formation of a pure PEA 2 PbI 4 film at the interface with MAPI is also supported by the PL of a 2D/3D bilayer, where the signals correspond to those of the pure separated materials (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">S7</ref>).</p><p>While no changes were observed in the optical absorption of the 2D/MAPI/2D heterostructure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S3</ref>) as compared to the bare MAPI (the contribution of the very thin PEA 2 PbI 4 films is not noticeable because the 3D absorption saturates in the green-blue region of the spectrum), we did observe differences in their morphology. The morphology of the 3D </p></div>

The surface of the MAPI film appears homogeneous and compact (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>), composed of grains with an average size of approximately 100 nm.</p><p>In the 2D/MAPI/2D heterostructure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>), we can already observe how the PEA 2 PbI 4 layer affects the film growth and morphology as the grain size is reduced, and the surface seems more textured as compared to the bare MAPI film. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">65</ref> These effects correlate with the XRD discussed before (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S2</ref>). The surface of the samples was further analyzed by AFM. While homogeneous on a large scale (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>), the MAPI film surface was found to be rather rough, with a root-meansquare roughness R RMS of 13 nm and average height z AVG as high as 50 nm (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>). The grain size reduction observed by SEM for the 2D/MAPI/2D heterostructure was also confirmed by AFM (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>), where the topography was characterized by R RMS = 8 nm and a strongly diminished z AVG of 27 nm (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>). At the same time, the height distribution was found also to be narrower, indicating a more homogeneous surface. Grain size reduction as a result of the interaction of a 3D perovskite with large cations has also been observed previously. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">66</ref> To evaluate the potential of a 2D/MAPI/2D perovskite heterostructure in photovoltaics, we incorporated it in fully vacuum-deposited PSCs using a p-i-n device layout (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>). The diodes were prepared on indium tin oxide (ITO), using molybdenum oxide (MoO 3 , 5 nm) and N4,N4,N4″,N4″tetra([1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)-[1,1′:4′,1″-terphenyl]-4,4″-diamine (TaTm, 10 nm) as the hole transport layer (HTL) and a 500 nm thick MAPI film, fullerene (C60, 25 nm), and bathocuproine (BCP, 8 nm) as the electron transport layers (ETLs). The devices were completed with the deposition of a silver electrode (100 nm). The low-dimensional PEA 2 PbI 4 films were vacuum-deposited in between the HTL/MAPI or the MAPI/ETL interfaces, varying the thickness between 2.5 and 10 nm. All layers were thermally deposited in high vacuum with a base pressure of 10 -6 mbar. The current densityvoltage (J-V) curves of PSCs were recorded under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm -2 , Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> (only for devices with 2.5 nm thick 2D films).</p><p>We initially fabricated and tested the triple layer heterojunctions of the type 2D/MAPI/2D. The heterojunction device with 2.5 nm thick 2D films showed a short-circuit current density (J sc ) exceeding 20 mA cm -2 , only slightly lower than that of the reference MAPI solar cell (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>). While the open-circuit voltage (V oc ) was found to decrease only approximately 6-7 meV compared to the reference, we observed a strongly reduced FF (65.5%) even though the two 2D films were only 2.5 nm thick (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>). With increasing thickness of the low-dimensional perovskite films, the FF further decreased to 49.7%, accompanied by a drastic reduction in the current density, being as low as 8 mA cm -2 for 10 nm thick 2D films.</p><p>Clearly, the 2D/MAPI/2D heterojunction solar cells suffer from hindered charge extraction, a situation that becomes more severe for thicker 2D films. This is in agreement with the formation of PEA 2 PbI 4 films with insulating sheets perpendic- </p></div>

All solar cells based on the 2D/MAPI/2D heterostructure showed also hysteresis in the J-V curve when scanning in forward (from short-to open-circuit) or reverse (from open-to short-circuit) bias. However, the V oc for the devices employing 5 and 10 nm thick PEA 2 PbI 4 films was found to increase up to &gt;1080 mV, meaning that the 2D films are indeed capable of reducing nonradiative recombination of the MAPI layer.</p><p>In order to rationalize the properties of the 2D/MAPI/2D heterostructure devices, we fabricated and characterized analogous solar cells based on either 2D/3D or 3D/2D bilayers as the active materials, with increasing thickness of the PEA 2 PbI 4 films. The heterojunction device with the 2.5 nm thick 2D film at the front contact (2D/MAPI, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>), shows high short-circuit current density (J sc , 22.1 mA cm -2 ) and very good rectification, with a FF as high as 78.6% and negligible hysteresis. The V oc is approximately 1.05 V, leading to a PCE of 18.3%, comparable to that of the reference MAPI solar cells. Increasing the thickness of PEA 2 PbI 4 to 5 and 10 nm results in lower photocurrent (18 and 16.5 mA cm -2 , respectively) and causes again a drastic reduction of the FF, which is below 55% for both thicknesses. The cells with thicker 2D films show also hysteresis in the J-V curve. However, when compared to bare MAPI, the solar cell photovoltage is also found to increase to about 1070 mV for thicker 2D perovskite films.</p><p>A similar behavior was observed for the solar cells based on the MAPI/2D heterojunction (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>), where the PEA 2 PbI 4 is now deposited on top of MAPI, below the C60 ETL. The current density decreases with increasing thickness of the 2D perovskite films, from 21.8 mA cm -2 (2.5 nm) to approximately 14 mA cm -2 (10 nm). The J-V curves for devices including thicker (5 and 10 nm) 2D films show hysteresis, with slightly larger current densities (approximately 1 mA cm -2 ) in reverse bias. Also for MAPI/2D heterojunction, the FF was observed to scale inversely with the thickness of PEA 2 PbI 4 but not as drastically as in the case of 2D/MAPI structures. The FF decreases from 73.5% to 63.9% when the 2D layer thickness is increased from 2.5 nm to 10 nm. Importantly, with this device configuration, we do observe a substantial increase in the photovoltage, with the MAPI/2D solar cells having a V oc exceeding 1.1 V for 5 nm thick PEA 2 PbI 4 layers. This observation indicates that the 2D perovskite layer is indeed capable of reducing the nonradiative recombination within the MAPI film.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACS Energy Letters</head><p>Letter vacuum-deposited PEA 2 PbI 4 films on top of MAPI are indeed capable of reducing nonradiative charge recombination, although at the expense of the FF (70%). For thicker (10 nm) 2D films, we observed a reduction of the V oc , which is more prominent for the 3D/2D heterojunction with a 10 nm thick film. Although the incorporation of 2D perovskites at the interface with MAPI is beneficial in terms of photovoltage, it leads to a drop in FF, which became more important once the PEA 2 PbI 4 thickness increased from to 5 and 10 nm (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>). The loss in FF can be attributed to the unfavorable orientation of the insulating sheets formed by the bulky organic cations within the 2D perovskite films (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), perpendicularly oriented to the direction of the charge transport.</p><p>Besides the orientation of the 2D perovskite with respect to the substrate, another factor that can contribute to the loss in FF is the presence of an energy barrier for the charge extraction (either hole or electron, or both) at the 3D/2D heterojunction or at the perovskite/organic interfaces. Such an energy barrier is related to misalignment of the energy levels, which is likely to exist at least in one case (either 2D/3D or 3D/2D) as a consequence of the larger bandgap of PEA 2 PbI 4 as compared to that of MAPI. The ionization energy (IE) can be used to estimate the valence band maximum (VBM) in an intrinsic semiconductor. We measured via air photoemission spectroscopy the IE of both 3D and 2D perovskites (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S6</ref>). We found an IE for MAPI of 5.0 eV, only slightly smaller as compared to recently reported ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy measurements, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">69</ref> while a larger IE of 5.5 eV was measured for PEA 2 PbI 4 films. This implies the presence of an energy barrier for the hole extraction of approximately 0.5 eV, which supports the severe drop in FF observed when PEA 2 PbI 4 is deposited in between the HTL and the MAPI (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>). Estimating the bandgap of PEA 2 PbI 4 from the absorption spectrum (2.4 eV) and considering a MAPI bandgap of 1.6 eV, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">69</ref> the barrier for the electron extraction at the 3D/2D interface would be 0.3 eV (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S6</ref>). The lower energy difference among the electronic affinities at the 3D/2D interface agrees with the smaller FF losses associated with using the 2D perovskite on top of the MAPI surface and below the ETL.</p><p>The vacuum-deposited 2D/3D heterostructures were further studied by means of time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref> depicts the normalized time-dependent conductance traces for bare MAPI and 2D/MAPI bilayers, obtained by selectively and homogeneously exciting the 3D MAPI film at 600 nm from both sides. Due to the lack of optical absorption at this wavelength, we did not observe any appreciable signal from the 2D layer. After a fast initial rise limited by the response time of the microwave cavity, the signals decayed due to charge recombination or trapping. Interestingly, the decay kinetics of the MAPI and 2D/MAPI are very similar and independent of the excitation side and the presence of the 2D layer. Hence, from this measurement, we cannot conclude that the MAPI film is effectively passivated by the 2D layer.</p><p>From the maximum change in photoconductance, ΔG max , the product of charge carrier generation efficiency per incident photon, η, and the sum of electron and hole mobility, ∑ μ is calculated using</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∑ η μ β = ΔG I e max 0<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where I 0 is the incident intensity, e is the elementary charge, and β is a geometrical factor. For both the 3D film as well as the 3D/2D bilayer, the η ∑ μ values increase slightly with light intensity, reaching values close to 10 cm 2 /(Vs), which is comparable to values previously reported and discussed on evaporated 3D perovskite layers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">71</ref> The slight difference in maximum mobility can be related to the different substrate on which the 3D MAPI layer has been deposited. Importantly, the dependence of the MAPI film with intensity is larger than that of the 2D/MAPI bilayers, which is almost constant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>). Such dependence can be explained by the fact that the 3D film contains a substantial amount of deep traps, which become saturated at higher intensities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">72</ref> This observation agrees with the higher V oc values observed for the heterostructure devices (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>). Finally, we excited the samples at 510 nm, which corresponds with the maximum absorption of the excitonic band of the 2D perovskite (see </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACS Energy Letters</head><p>Letter Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>). The 2D layer exhibited very low signal, which can be explained by the high exciton binding energy preventing dissociation of the excitons into mobile carriers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">73</ref> The MAPI films as well as the 3D/2D bilayer gave signal intensities comparable to that of excitation at 600 nm, implying that the charge carrier yield is independent of the used wavelengths. Interestingly, exciting the 2D/MAPI sample through the 2D layer leads to a substantial decrease of the signal intensity. This can be explained by the fact that a substantial part of the incident light is absorbed by the 2D perovskite itself, and the excited states generated in the 2D layer do not lead to mobile carriers in the MAPI film by either charge or energy transfer. This inefficient charge carrier generation might partially explain the photocurrent losses observed in the heterostructure devices (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). In summary, we show for the first time the fabrication of perovskite heterostructures by dual-source vacuum deposition. This was achieved by vacuum processing thin layers of the 2D perovskite phenethylammonium lead iodide (PEA 2 PbI 4 ) below and on top of a vacuum-deposited methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) film. We investigated the morphology, structure, and optical properties of the 2D and 3D separately, as well as of the 2D/3D/2D heterostructure, and observed that vacuum-deposited PEA 2 PbI 4 films tend to grow with the alternating inorganic and organic sheets parallel to the substrate. For this reason, when incorporated into devices, the 2D/3D/2D perovskite heterostructure shows a strongly hindered charge extraction, a result of an interplay of parameters among the preferential in-plane orientation of the 2D film, the low carrier mobility, and the mismatch in the transport energy levels. By separately studying the 2D/3D and 3D/2D bilayers, we identified a trade-off between the solar cell photovoltage and FF, with 3D/2D heterojunction solar cells having open-circuit voltage as high as 1.1 V. By TRMC, we observed that the density of deep traps in the MAPI active layers is reduced in the presence of the 2D perovskite; however, the latter leads to a reduced photocurrent as we did not observe any charge or energy transfer from the 2D film to the MAPI. In general, our results show a marked difference between vacuum-deposited and solution-processed 3D/2D architectures, with unfavorable orientation but high phase purity obtained by dual-source vapor deposition. Future work will address the vacuum deposition of vertically oriented 2D perovskite films in order to promote charge transport and will focus on their role on the overall device stability.</p></div>

MoO 3 and 2,9-Dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) were purchased from Lumtec, Device preparation. ITO-coated glass substrates were subsequently cleaned with soap, water and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath, followed by UV-ozone treatment. They were transferred to a vacuum chamber integrated into a nitrogen-filled glovebox (H 2 O and O 2 &lt; 0.1 ppm) and evacuated to a pressure of 10 -6 mbar. The vacuum chamber used to sublimate the HTL, ETL and MAPI was equipped with six temperature-controlled evaporation sources (Creaphys) fitted with ceramic crucibles. The sources were directed upward with an angle of approximately 90°with respect to the bottom of the evaporator. The substrate holder to evaporation source distance was approximately 20 cm. Three quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors were used: two monitoring the deposition of each evaporation source and a third one close to the substrate holder monitoring the total deposition rate. The materials were sublimed at temperatures ranging from 140 to &gt;300°C, and the evaporation rate was controlled by separate QCM sensors obtaining precisely the deposited thickness. In general, the deposition rate for TaTm and C60 was 0.5 Å s-1 and 0.3 Å s-1 for the thinner BCP layer. For the 3D perovskite deposition, MAI and PbI 2 were coevaporated by measuring the deposition rate of each material in a different sensor and obtaining the total perovskite thickness in a third one, leading to a 500 nm-thick perovskite. The samples were transferred to another vacuum chamber for the 2D PEA 2 PbI 4 perovskite deposition.</p><p>The latter is equipped with four evaporation sources (Creaphys) fitted with ceramic crucibles and independent temperature controllers and shutters. A dedicated QCM sensor is installed above each source plus one close to the substrate for the overall deposition rate measurement (total of 5 QCM sensors). All the sources were individually calibrated for its respective material. The materials were sublimed at temperatures ranging from 150-160°C for the PEAI and 270-280°C for PbI 2 . MoO 3 and Ag were evaporated in a third vacuum chamber using tantalum boats by applying currents ranging from 2.0 to 4.8 A.</p><p>Characterization. X-ray diffractograms were collected with a Panalytical Empyrean diffractometer equipped with Cu anode operated at 45 kV and 40 mA and a PIXcel 1D detector in scanning line mode. Single scans were acquired in the 2θ = 5° to 50° range, in Bragg-Brentano geometry in air.</p><p>Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images were performed on a Hitachi S-4800 microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 2 kV over Platinum -metallized samples. Absorption spectra were collected using a fiber optics based Avantes Avaspec2048 Spectrometer. The ionization energies were using an Ambient Pressure Photoemission Spectroscopy system from KP Technology. The J-V curves for the solar cells were recorded using a Keithley 2612A SourceMeter in a -0.2 and 1.2 V voltage range, with 0.01 V steps and integrating the signal for 20 ms after a 10 ms delay, corresponding to a speed of about 0.3 V s -1 . The devices were illuminated under a Wavelabs Sinus 70 LED solar simulator. The light intensity was calibrated before every measurement using a calibrated Si reference diode equipped with an infrared cutoff filter (KG-3, Schott).</p></div>
