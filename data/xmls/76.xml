<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Two-dimensional (2D) lead halide perovskites represent an emerging class of materials given their tunable optoelectronic properties and long-term stability in perovskite solar cells. In order to assess the halide ion mobility, we have tracked the changes in the bromide and iodide composition in physically paired 2D lead halide perovskite films of different layer numbers (n = 10-1). These low-dimensional perovskites suppressed halide ion migration as a result of their intercalated spacer ligands and their strong van der Waals interactions. The rate constants for halide exchange of low dimensionality perovskites follow the Arrhenius relationship with thermal activation energy ranging from 58 kJ/mol (n = 10) to 72 kJ/mol (n = 1). The suppression of halide ion mobility (and diffusion coefficient) with modulating perovskite layer number (n) provides further insight into the role of 2D perovskites in improving the performance of photovoltaic devices.</p></div>

The halide ion mobility dependence on the perovskite layer number (n) can provide fundamental insight into designing perovskite devices with more desired properties.</p><p>Halide Ion Homogenization in Paired 2D Halide Perovskite Films. One of the convenient ways to monitor halide ion mobility is to monitor the halide compositional changes through absorption and emission spectra. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> Since the bandgap of mixed halide perovskite films shifts linearly with the ratio of halides (e.g., Br:I in MAPbBr x I 3-x ), we can monitor the changes in the onset of the absorption peak. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> In order to investigate the effect of dimensionality (n) of 2D layered perovskite on the halide ion mobility, 2D lead halide perovskite films with tunable layer numbers (n = 10-1) were prepared using the experimental procedure reported previously (see the Supporting Information). <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Stable 2D lead halide perovskite films with tunable layer numbers of n = 10, 6, 3-2, and 1 were obtained by varying the cation ratio of methylammonium:phenylethylammonium (MA:PEA) of 80:20, 66:33, 33:66, and 0:100, respectively. The corresponding layer number (n) of 2D lead halide (bromide and iodide) perovskite films was assigned based on the exciton absorption peak position. <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> The absorption spectra of 2D lead bromide and lead iodide perovskite films of different n values are presented in the Supporting Information. It is worth noting that 2D layered perovskite films (n&lt;6) have a propensity for formation of mixed phases with different n values due to the similar formation enthalpy of 2D layers (-50 ∼ -80 kJ/mol for the layer number of n = 1-5), as can be seen from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> We probed the exchange of halide ions between 2D lead bromide and lead iodide films by pairing the two films with direct physical contact. The glass slides of different 2D perovskite films with the same layer number (n) but with different halides (viz., bromide on one slide and iodide on the other slide) were clamped together with binder clips. The physically paired films were placed on the temperaturecontrolled hot plate in the range of 23-140 °C. The clamped films were maintained at a constant temperature to induce migration of bromide and iodide across the two films. All halide ion exchange experiments were carried out ≤140 °C to avoid thermal-induced destabilization of the perovskites. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> The absorption spectra of paired films (and separated film) were recorded periodically until the films are fully homogenized (i.e., the films attained halide equilibrium).</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1B</ref> show the absorption spectra of 2D lead halide (bromide and iodide) perovskite films with n = 10 and n = 1 before (spectra a and b) and after annealing (spectra a′ and b′) at 140 °C, respectively. For the films with n = 10, both excitonic absorption peaks were observed at 510 nm and at 735 nm corresponding to 2D lead bromide and lead iodide perovskites (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1A</ref>). The absorption characteristics of 2D perovskite films with n = 10 closely resemble those of the corresponding 3D perovskite films. When physically paired films of these two perovskites are subjected to thermal treatment for a period of 60 min, we induce migration of Br and I from one side to the other until both films are homogenized. Insets of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1A</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S1</ref> confirmed visual color changes of the films from greenish yellow (lead bromide) and from dark brown (lead iodide) to similar light brown (mixed halide composition) following homogenization. This observation is confirmed from the single characteristic peak at 615 nm in both films (spectra a′ and b′ in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Similar absorption changes were observed for paired films with the single-layer 2D lead bromide and lead iodide perovskite films. The initial absorption maximum peaks at 405 nm for 2D lead bromide and at 515 nm for 2D lead iodide perovskites merged to produce a single absorption peak at 435 nm following homogenization at 140 °C (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1B</ref>). We also extended these thermally induced exchange of halides in 2D perovskites with n = 6, 3-2, and 1, respectively (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1B</ref>).</p><p>The thermally-activated halide ion movement across the interface of 2D lead halide films with the layer number of n can be described by eq 1. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">+ → - + - + - +<label>(</label></formula><p>Interestingly, all of the 2D perovskite films were fully homogenized at 140 °C within 60-120 min.</p><p>To track the kinetics of halide ion exchange between bromide and iodide 2D perovskite films, absorption spectra were recorded at intermediate times. The representative spectra for 2D perovskite films with n = 10 and n = 1 are shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>. With increasing annealing time, the absorption spectra show significant changes with the appearance of a new absorption band at 610 nm for 2D perovskite films with n = 10 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>) and 430 nm for perovskite films with n = 1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). The appearance of the new band confirms the formation of mixed halide composition as the films are homogenized.</p><p>The changes in the absorption during the homogenization process are better visualized through difference absorption (ΔA) spectra. By subtracting the absorption spectrum (t = 0 min) from the spectra recorded at different times, we can observe the change in absorbance that occurs during the course of homogenization (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). These spectra further highlight the disappearance of bromide and iodide 2D perovskite and appearance of a new band corresponding to the mixed halide formation. These spectral evolutions also point out that the time required for homogenization (or mixing of Br and I) for 2D perovskites with n = 1 is greater than n = 10.</p><p>Activation Energy of Halide Exchange in 2D Perovskites. The mixing of halide ion (or homogenization) is an entropically-driven process as the mixed halide phase is thermodynamically more favorable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> The halide ion homogenization experiments (as described in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) were repeated with paired films with n = 10, 6, and 1 at different temperatures. The absorption changes at 495 nm with time at different temperatures (140-23 °C) show an increased rate of bromide disappearance from the 2D lead bromide perovskite (n = 10) film (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). The individual absorption (and difference absorption) spectra corresponding to these kinetic traces with n = 10 are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>. At room temperature (23 °C), we notice negligible change in absorption. However, the rate of homogenization of the two paired halide film increased with increasing temperature.</p><p>Since the absorption shifted to shorter wavelengths upon mixing of iodide with bromide, we were able to track the change in the bandgap of the materials. As shown earlier, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> the bandgap of the mixed halide film directly correlates with the Br:I ratio. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref> shows the kinetic traces of rate of change in iodide (in 2D lead iodide perovskite film) as monitored from the shift in the bandgap with time. The bandgap was measured from the Tauc plots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>) using the absorption spectra recorded at different temperatures (140-23 °C). The bandgap of pure 2D lead iodide film (∼1.6 eV) shifts to 1.9 eV as the film undergoes homogenization and attains mixed halide composition. The halide composition of mixed halide films after homogenization was further confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental analyses and mappings. Both 2D lead bromide and lead iodide films following homogenization at 140 °C for 1 h show homogeneous elemental distributions of Pb, Br, and I across the films along with equimolar ratio of Br:I = 1:1 (Figure <ref type="figure">S5</ref>). These changes in absorption and EDS mapping confirmed the bidirectional movement of bromide and iodide in paired films and the rate of exchange of halide ions being dependent on the temperature.</p><p>The pseudo-first-order rate constants (k, s -1 ) were determined from fitting all the traces shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref> (absorption and Tauc plots) with monoexponential fits. The apparent rate constants for halide ion exchange in the films of n = 10 increased by 2 orders of magnitude from 1.75 × 10 -5 to 1.09 × 10 -3 s -1 (from absorption plots) and from 1.85 × 10 -5 to 1.15 × 10 -3 s -1 (from Tauc plots) upon increasing the annealing temperature from 60 to 140 °C. The temperature-dependent halide ion exchange rate constants were then analyzed using Arrhenius relationships (eq 2).</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">= - + k E RT A ln( ) / ln( ) a<label>(2)</label></formula><p>From the linear dependence of ln(k) versus 1/T (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>), we determined an activation energy (E a ) for halide ion exchange to be 57.8 ± 2.4 kJ/mol (from change in absorption at 495 nm, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>) and 59.5 ± 2.8 kJ/mol (from Tauc analysis, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>), respectively. Similarity between these activation energy values further validates our analysis of tracking halide ion homogenization by monitoring the optical changes either in 2D lead bromide or 2D lead iodide in the paired films. We repeated the above temperature-dependent homogenization rate constant measurements for other 2D perovskite films (n = 6 and 1). The individual absorption spectra along with corresponding difference absorption spectra during homogenization were recorded for n = 6 (Figure <ref type="figure">S6A-H</ref>) and for n = 1 (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B, 2D</ref> and<ref type="figure">S7A-F</ref>). The absorption  changes in the paired 2D lead halide films with n = 6 (at 488 nm) and n = 1 (at 403 nm) as a function of annealing time at different temperatures (140-60 °C) and associated kinetic fits are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">S8</ref>. The Arrhenius plots (ln(k) versus 1/ T) of these two 2D perovskite films with n = 6 and 1 are compared with that of n = 10 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>.</p><p>The activation energy for halide exchange determined from these plots was 66.9 ± 0.6 kJ/mol (n = 6) and 71.5 ± 2.0 kJ/ mol (n = 1). It is evident that the activation energy increases with decreasing n value of the 2D perovskites. The activation energy as a function of the perovskite layer number (n), plotted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>, shows a marked increase in the activation energy when the n value decreases from 10 to 1. Since 2D perovskites with n = 10 resemble that of bulk perovskite (n = ∞), we only see a small change in E a . The increased activation energy with the decreasing layer number of 2D perovskite (n &lt; 10) shows the increased thermal barrier for the halide ion mobility in 2D perovskites as compared to their 3D counterparts. As one would expect, the intercalation of the bulky phenylethylammonium cation in 2D layered perovskite architectures hinders the halide ion mobility.</p><p>During halide exchanges, the bromide and iodide halide ions diffuse in opposite directions. The bromide ions diffuse into iodide side, while the iodide ions move into the bromide side until the two physically paired films equilibrate with a nearly 50:50 Br:I composition. A simplified version of Fick's second law is employed to calculate the apparent diffusion coefficient (eq 3). The parameters evaluated from the halide exchange lifetime are listed in Table</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">1 τ = d l / 2 diffusion (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>where d is defined as the effective diffusion coefficient, l is defined as the diffusion length (average film thickness), and τ diffusion is defined as average lifetime of halide exchange. The diffusion length (l) corresponds to the distance between two centers of paired 2D lead halide films as there is only one directional movement for each halide ion diffusion (vice versa). The average film thickness of the films between n = 10 and n = 1 was determined to be 97 ± 15 nm from crosssectional SEM image analyses by averaging out the thickness of four films (Figure <ref type="figure">S9</ref>). For the calculation of the diffusion coefficient, we employed a value of l = ∼100 nm.</p><p>The diffusion coefficients summarized in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> show that the 2D perovskite layer number (n) dictates the halide ion mobility. The diffusion coefficient values measured in the temperature range of 60-140 °C were in the range of 10 -15 -10 -13 cm 2 s -1 (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The film of n = 1 generally has a lower diffusion coefficient as compared to the film of n = 6 or n = 10 at the same temperature due to the increased fraction of organic layers suppressing halide ion movement. The observed values are consistent with the previous reports measured using absorption and emission spectroscopy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> This suppressed halide ion mobility in 2D perovskites explains the improved stability one observes in perovskite solar cells with the introduction of a small amount of 2D perovskites. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> The apparent diffusion coefficient values for all perovskite films (n = 1, 6, 10) increased by 2 orders of magnitude with increasing the temperature from 60 °C to 140 °C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have shown that halide ion movement is facilitated by vacancy-mediated halide transport. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> The 2D lead halide perovskites which have higher halide vacancy formation energy (5.46 eV) than that of conventional 3D MAPbI 3 perovskites (3.44 eV) also contribute to the overall lower halide ion mobility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> During the halide ion homogenization discussed in the experiments above, we expect the halide ion diffusion to be affected by diffusion length, crystallinity of films, crystallographic grain boundary, and number of halide ion vacancy sites. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> The crystallographic domain size and shape of the 2D lead halide perovskite films (between n = 10 and n = 1) employed in this study remain unchanged after homogenization (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S10</ref>). The halide ion diffusion across the films is driven by thermal activation of vacancy-mediated halide ion movement. Scheme 1 compares the halide ion migrations (and exchange) across the interface of the paired 2D lead bromide and lead iodide perovskite films with different dimensionalities of n = 10 and 1. The halide ion mobility in the 2D architecture is reduced through the introduction of the organic cation between different layers within the film. The intercalated organic spacer ligands, thus, effectively suppress the halide ion mobility across the films, resulting in long-term stability of lowdimensional perovskite films. Similar stabilization aspects of 2D have been observed in the long-term operation of solar cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> The comparison of halide mobility in the present study offers direct evidence for the suppressed mobility of halides in 2D perovskites.

The halide ion movement can be tracked by recording the absorption spectra of the physically paired 2D lead halide perovskite films with different dimensionality of n = 10-1. The temperature-and layer-number-dependence of halide ion mobility sheds light on the overall stability of 2D lead halide films. Efforts are underway to elucidate the reversible photoinduced halide phase segregation and dark recovery in the 2D lead halide perovskites. </p></div>

The FTO substrates were cleaned with soapy water and sonicated in an ethanol bath for 20 min. After that, the substrates were rinsed additionally with excess isopropanaol and dried with air-stream at ambient conditions. To remove any organic residues, the FTO substrates were further treated with plasma for 10 minutes. The FTO substrates were then immediately transferred to a N 2 -filled glovebox for the deposition of lead halide films.</p><p>The 2D perovskite films were prepared in the glove box (&lt; 10 ppm H 2 O). The 2D lead bromide and iodide perovskite films were made through the same procedures except for the halide (X = Br and I) precursors employed for the synthesis. The mixed precursor solutions containing MAX, PEAX, and PbX 2 with a stoichiometric amount was used to control the dimensionality (n). The ratio of MAX:PEAX were systematically varied such as MA:PEA = 80:20 (n = 10), 66:33 (n = 6), 33:66 (n = 3-2), and 0:100 (n = 1), respectively. The mixed solutions dissolved in DMF:DMSO mixture with a 4:1 volumetric ratio were vigorously stirred for 1 hr at room temperature. The precursor solutions were then syringe-filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE membrane filter. The 2D lead halide perovskite films were acquired through static spin-casting of 50 μL of 0.6 M PbX 2 precursor solution followed by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 25 s with an acceleration of 1200 rpm. A 0.5 mL of chlorobenzene was rapidly injected as antisolvent after 10 seconds. After spin-casting process was completed, the perovskite films were transferred to using a hot plate and annealed at 100 °C for 5 minutes. The films were cooled down and stored inside of the glovebox until use.</p><p>Halide Ion Homogenization Experiments. The 2D lead halide (bromide and iodide) perovskite films with different layer number of n = 10-1 were physically paired each other, clamped with binder clips, and then transferred to a pre-heated hot plate with different homogenization temperature (140-23 °C). Care was taken to keep the annealing temperature of the paired 2D lead halide perovskite films at constant temperature. The clamped films were then placed on a</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S3</head><p>brass plate for direct-heating of the paired films. The temperature of the brass plate was monitored and controlled by adjusting the temperature of the hotplate. The clamped (or separated) films were periodically monitored during homogenization process. The completion of homogenization was visually inspected based upon the change of film colors and confirmed by spectroscopic measurements.</p><p>Steady State Absorption Measurements. UV-Vis absorption spectra were obtained using a Varian Cary 50 bio spectrophotometer in the wavelength of 450-800 nm for 2D lead halide perovskite films with n = 10 and 350-700 nm for 2D lead halide perovskite films with n = 1.</p><p>The difference absorption spectra were acquired by subtracting the absorption spectrum at 0 min (as a reference) from the absorption spectra acquired at different annealing (or homogenization) time.</p><p>Tauc Plot Analysis in conjunction with Estimation of Bandgap energy. The absorption spectra were converted to Tauc plots using the equation of (αhν) 2 versus hν for the directlyallowed transitions materials. The straight line was fitted and extrapolated from the curvature onto X-axis to estimate the bandgap energy (E g ) of the perovskites during the course of homogenization at different temperature with time. Halide ion compositions were further analyzed based upon the bandgap energy of mixed lead iodide perovskite films with n = 10 determined from the Tauc plots (equations 1 and 2). The estimated bandgap energy (E g ) is determined to be 1.62 eV for pure 2D lead iodide film with n = 10, 2.24 eV for pure 2D lead bromide film with n = 10, and 1.93 eV for mixed 2D halide film with n = 10 (Br:I = 50:50). A simple Vegard's law with a linear interpolation is applied to approximate the halide composition.</p><p>I composition (%) = [(2.24 -E g (mixed iodide film))/(0.62)] x 100 equation (1) Br composition (%) = 100 -I composition (%) equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>)</p><p>Characterizations. Top-down view, cross-sectional SEM imaging, and EDS spectra were acquired using a Magellan 400 digital field emission scanning electron microscope operated with a beam voltage of 5 kV.     </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
