For the control perovskite films without PEAI treatment, as similar as our previous reports 8, 25 , there are two separated phases. The dark grain region is perovskite crystal, and the white grains surrounding perovskite phase are PbI2 8, 25 . After PEAI coating, the PbI2 layer has been fully covered as we can Supplementary Fig. 3b. The roughness of perovskite layer has been reduced from 32 to 24 nm after PEAI coating, indicates that PEAI salt are more easily deposited at grain boundary (usually, there is a valley at grain boundary, Supplementary Fig. 7), and thus reduces the height difference between the grain surface and grain boundary.\n",

      "In recent years, the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has increased to reach over 20%. Finding an effective means of defect passivation is thought to be a promising route for bringing further increases in the power conversion efficiency and the open-circuit voltage ( V OC) of perovskite solar cells. Here, we report the use of an organic halide salt phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) on HC(NH2)2-CH3NH3 mixed perovskite films for surface defect passivation. We find that PEAI can form on the perovskite surface and results in higher-efficiency cells by reducing the defects and suppressing non-radiative recombination. As a result, planar perovskite solar cells with a certificated efficiency of 23.32% (quasi-steady state) are obtained. In addition, a V OC as high as 1.18/thinspaceV is achieved at the absorption threshold of 1.53/thinspaceeV, which is 94.4% of the Shockley-Queisser limit V OC (1.25/thinspaceV).\n",
      "\n",
      "T he power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) swiftly increased from 3.8% to more than 20% in 10 years due to composition engineering, perovskite film growth control and perovskite/transport layer interface engineering 1-13 . To further increase the PCE of PSCs, improvement of the open-circuit voltage ( V OC) and fill factor (FF) could be more feasible than the short-circuit current ( J SC), considering that the J SC is almost close to its  limit  (~26 mA cm -2 ) for a bandgap of around 1.55 eV.\n",
      "\n",
      "The surface is the place where defects are most easily formed, and passivation of the surface defects is always the most important task in any type of solar cells 11,15,21 . In PSCs, several efficient surface passivation methods have been adopted. For example, excess PbI2 in the perovskite layer, on the surface or at the grain boundary can suppress charge recombination by formation of I-type band alignment 22-24 . Wide bandgap perovskites such as FAPbI3 -x Br x (ref. 25 ), two-dimensional (2D) perovskite materials, for example, PEA2PbI4 and BA2PbI4 (refs. 26-31 ), and super-thin insulated materials such as polystyrene 15 have been utilized. More recently, several halide compounds  such  as  quaternary  ammonium  halides 11 ,  diammonium iodide 20 ,  potassium  halide 32 and  iodopentafluorobenzene 33 have been employed to passivate dangling bonds in the perovskite layer by exploiting the associated intermolecular interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is known that the V OC of solar cells is strongly related to the recombination of defects in the bulk or on the surface of the absorber layer 14-17 . Solution-processed perovskite films are usually polycrystalline, which means they contain substantial structural disorder, such as grain boundary defects and crystallographic defects 14-17 . Although it has been theoretically predicted that most of the defects formed in the perovskite layer are shallow defects 18 , several experimental results have shown that the suppression of defects in solution-processed perovskite films is critical for further enhancing the performance of PSCs towards their thermodynamic limits 9,19,20 .\n",
      "\n",
      "Here,  we  develop  an  organic  halide  salt,  phenethylammonium  iodide  (PEAI),  for  post-treatment  of  mixed  perovskites FA1 -x MA x PbI3 (FA: HC(NH2)2; MA: CH3NH3) to suppress the surface defects of perovskite polycrystalline films for efficient solar cells. Surprisingly, the organic halide salt PEAI, rather than the 2D\n",

      "layered PEA2PbI4 perovskite proposed in many recent studiess 26-31 , serves  as  a  much  more  effective  passivation  additive  for  a  3D perovskite. We carefully control the conversion process of PEAI to PEA2PbI4 in the actual devices using direct X-ray diffraction (XRD) evidence and show that the existence of PEAI instead of PEA2PbI4 in the perovskite thin-film devices is the key to increasing the V OC to as high as 1.18 V, which is 94.4% of the Shockley-Queisser limit V OC (1.25 V). As a result, a 23.32% certificated PSC has been achieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Design and fabrication of the perovskite films\n",
      "\n",
      "The  perovskite  layer  FA1 -x MA x PbI3  was  deposited  using  a  twostep spin-coating method 8,24,34,35 , and the mixed organic salts FAI and MAI were diffused into the PbI2 bottom layer via annealing. Comparing with previous reports and ours 5,8,24 , we replaced the methylammonium bromide (MABr) in the traditional high-performance perovskite material (FAPbI3)1 -x (MAPbBr3) x with methylammonium  iodine  (MAI)  to  form  FA1 -x MA x PbI3  perovskites, which is expected to further lower the absorption threshold of the perovskites to absorb more sunlight (Supplementary Fig. 1). We found that a small amount of MAI incorporation (8% in precursor) can stabilize the /uni03B1 -phase of FAPbI3 (Fig. 1c), which is consistent with the tolerance factor empirical rule 36,37 . To introduce a passivation layer, a PEAI salt solution was spin-coated onto the perovskite surface. It is noted that no additional process was carried out for PEAI layer. The device structure of the perovskite solar cells we adopted in this study is shown in Fig. 1a. We infer that the PEAI coating on the perovskite layer fills the iodine vacancies on the surface (Fig. 1b), and at the grain boundary (Supplementary Fig. 2), resulting in passivation of the surface defects and enhancement of the device performance 20 .\n",

      "peak appeared at 4.7°, which is consistent with the diffraction pattern for PEAI powder, and there is no obvious diffraction peak at 5.4° corresponding to the 2D perovskite PEA2PbI4 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 3). It can be concluded that the dominant form of PEAI salt on the perovskite surface is the PEAI crystal itself, which is in contrast to previous reports on the formation of a 2D perovskite on a 3D perovskite surface 26-31 . We will show that PEAI itself has a much better passivation effect than a 2D PEA2PbI4 thin layer. From scanning electron microscopy results (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b), we found that the perovskite surface was covered by a PEAI layer. In addition, the roughness of the perovskite layer was reduced from 32 to 24 nm according to atomic force microscopy results  (Supplementary  Fig.  2c,d),  indicating  that  the  PEAI  salt is more easily deposited at the grain boundary (usually, the grain boundary is the deepest place on the surface, Supplementary Fig. 7). Therefore, this reduces the height difference between the grain surface and the grain boundary.\n",
      "\n",
      "We conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to confirm the existence of PEAI on perovskite (Fig. 1d). For the perovskite with PEAI treatment, in addition to C-C and C-N peaks located at 284.6 eV and 286.1 eV, respectively, we also found that a peak emerges at a binding energy of 292.0 eV, consistent with /uni03C0-/uni03C0 bonding in the phenyl functional group of the PEA + cations 26 . We also noticed that the C = O peak (288.1 eV) seen for the control film associated with oxygen/moisture is significantly suppressed after PEAI modification, indicating that the PEAI coating can slow the degradation of the perovskite layer. Furthermore, according to the Pb 4 f and I 3 d core-level energy spectra (Supplementary Fig. 4), it can be estimated that the Pb:I ratio for the control perovskite film\n",
      "\n",
      "is 1:1.55, which indicates that the surface is seriously iodine deficit, which could lead to obvious point defects (Fig. 1b). After PEAI modification, the Pb:I ratio dramatically increased to 1:2.34, indicating the presence of abundant iodide on the perovskite surface and that the iodine vacancy is likely to be filled (Fig. 1b).\n",

      "It is interesting that we found that the PL intensity and lifetime of the perovskite films become slightly weaker and shorter when the the PEAI layer is annealed above 50 °C (Fig. 2a,b). This phenomenon becomes more obvious for thermal annealing of the perovskite/ PEAI film at 100 °C (Fig. 2a,b), and the PEAI-treated perovskite film shows almost the same emission properties as the control film,\n",
      "\n",
      "We  monitored  the  steady  photoluminescence  (PL)  of  the perovskite films with PEAI treatment under different conditions (Fig. 2a). We found that the PL intensities are obviously increased after PEAI treatment without additional thermal annealing, indicating that recombination in the perovskite layer has been largely suppressed 38,39 . We also mapped the PL intensities of perovskite films with 470 nm excitation (Supplementary Fig. 5), and found that the PL from the perovskite films with PEAI treatment becomes much more intense and uniform compared with the control film. Owing to the strong absorption of perovskite at short wavelengths, we anticipate that only the perovskite surface ( < 100 nm) is excited when using 470 nm excitation. Therefore, strong PL enhancement indicates that PEAI treatment suppresses the surface non-radiative recombination defects. According to the time-resolved PL results (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 1), the carrier lifetime of the perovskite is significantly increased from 0.3 /uni03BC s to more than 2 /uni03BC s, and the recombination rate has been reduced by fivefold after PEAI treatment.\n",

      "indicating that the passivation effect has almost disappeared. From the XRD results (Fig. 2c), we found that the PEAI is gradually converted into the PEA2PbI4 phase during the thermal annealing process, and when the perovskite/PEAI layer is annealed at at 100 °C for 5 min, the PEAI crystal diffraction totally disappears (Fig. 2c). According to the PL and XRD results (Fig. 2), it can be concluded that the PEAI itself shows a much better passivation effect than the 2D perovskite of PEA2PbI4. Therefore, in this study, we utilized the PEAI layer, not the conventional 2D perovskite 26-31 , to passivate the defects in the perovskite layer.\n",

      "\n",
      "Keeping  in  mind  that  PEAI  can  efficiently  passivate  the  surface  defects  in  the  perovskite  layer,  we  fabricated  devices  with the  structure  ITO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au 8,24 (ITO: indium  tin  oxide;  spiro-OMeTAD:  2,2 /uni2032 ,7,7 /uni2032 -tetrakis( N , N -dipmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9 /uni2032 -spirobifluorene). The thicknesses of the electron transport layer SnO2, the perovskite layer and the hole  transport  layer  spiro-OMeTAD  were  about  40 nm,  800 nm and 250 nm, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7). The dependence of the device performance on the PEAI concentration (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 2) shows that the PCE jumped significantly when the perovskite films were treated with a low concentration of PEAI solution, and the PCE reached a maximum at 20 mM of PEAI. For this best condition, the mass\n",
      "\n",
      "thickness of the PEAI is about 16 nm when deposited on a smooth silicon substrate (Supplementary Fig. 9). It is noted that several tens of nanometres of PEAI films deposited on a very rough perovskite surface (roughness = 32 nm, Supplementary Fig. 2) via a solution process cannot be conformal, and the resulting PEAI film should be discontinuous or thin enough for charge transport (Supplementary Fig. 10). While the device performance began to drop at high PEAI loading  even  the  recombination  rate  was  low  (Supplementary Fig. 6), which could be due to the highly insulating properties of PEAI. The typical J -V curve of the device with PEAI (20 mM) and without PEAI treatment is shown in Fig. 3b. It can be seen that the J SC remains almost the same, while V OC substantially increases compared with the control device. We also observed that the hysteresis can be eliminated when the perovskite surface is treated with PEAI. Both the improvement of device performance and elimination of hysteresis could be related to the reduction of the surface defects, which can result in suppression of charge recombination and also charge accumulation 20 .\n",
      "\n",
      "After optimization of the PEAI-treated device, we obtained the best device with an efficiency of 23.56%, a V OC as high as 1.16 V, a J SC  of  24.9 mA cm -2 and a fill factor (FF) of 81.4% (Fig. 3c), and there is almost no hysteresis for the device (Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Table 5). The steady output for the best device shows a quasi-steady output of 23.2%, while for the device without PEAI, the output is 21.3% (Supplementary Fig. 14). The integrated current  density  from  the  external  quantum  efficiency  (EQE)  is 24.5 mA cm -2 (Fig. 3d), which is almost in agreement with the measurement from the solar simulator in this study. In addition, according to the EQE decrease to half the peak value and the differential of the EQE 40 , it can be estimated that the absorption threshold is 1.53 eV. This value is consistent with the result from the differential of absorption (Supplementary Fig. 15). The statistics of the PCE distribution confirm the reproducibility of our results and that the PEAI treatment can undoubtedly improve the performance of PSCs (Supplementary Fig. 16).\n",
      "\n",
      "We tested the device performance when the the PEAI layer was  processed  at  different  temperatures  and  found  that  the device performance degraded while thermal annealing the PEAI layer (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 3). This is consistent with the PL results (Fig. 2a,b), confirming that the PEAI itself has a better passivation effect for perovskite layer. We also screened several organic iodine salts for perovskite surface treatment and found that the device performance either showed  no  significant  enhancement  or  inferior  performance compared with the control device (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Table 4).\n",
      "\n",
      "We sent the best device to an accredited laboratory (Newport, USA) for certification. The devices showed 23.32% certificated efficiency with a V OC of 1.18 V, J SC  of  25.2 mA cm -2 and FF of 78.4% (Supplementary Figs. 17 and 18). Furthermore, it is noted that the certificated efficiency obtained here is the quasi-steady-state efficiency 41 . In this new measurement standard, the J -V parameters were measured under a 13-point IV sweep configuration wherein the bias voltage (current for V OC determination) is held constant until the measured current (voltage for V OC) is determined to be unchanging at the 0.03% level. This is intended to represent the quasi-steady-state performance of the device.\n",

      "We tested the device response under different light intensities (Supplementary Fig. 19). We found that both the control and PEAItreated devices show a linear J SC versus light intensity relationship (Supplementary Fig. 19c). This indicates that carriers can transport smoothly in the device and that there is no obvious charge barrier induced at the interface even though insulating PEAI was introduced. The relationship between V OC and light intensity is also plotted (Fig. 4a). It can be seen that the control device shows a slope of 1.88 k B T / q , while PEAI-treated devices show a much smaller slope\n",

In addition, there is only 0.35 V of V OC loss ( E abs/ q V OC) at the absorption threshold ( E abs) 1.53 eV, which is even less than that of crystal silicon solar cells (0.38 V) and comparable to GaAs solar cells (0.30 V) 13 .

Furthermore,  this  value  is substantially longer than that of the control device (versus 8.8 /uni03BC s, Fig. 4b), which could be attributed to slower surface charge recombination. We also found that the /uni03C4 t slightly decreases from 3 /uni03BC s to 2.3 /uni03BC s after PEAI treatment (Supplementary Fig. 20). The insertion of  insulting  PEAI  cannot  enhance  the  hole  extraction  from perovskite to spiro-OMeTAD and decrease /uni03C4 t. Therefore, the slight reduction of /uni03C4 t could also be due to the reduction of charge recombination on introduction of PEAI.\n",

      "We tested the solar cell device operating as a LED in the dark and under a voltage bias. We found that PEAI-treated devices showed obvious  EL  and  an  emission  peak  located  at  805 nm  (Fig.  4c). Furthermore, the device can even emit under lower applied voltage (1.2 V), which is lower than the absorption threshold of perovskite (1.53 eV)-the  apparent  violation  of  energy  conservation  could come from heat extracted from the diode 46 . It is encouraging that the device showed close to 7% EL efficiency under an injection current of 25.2 mA cm -2 (equal to short-circuit current J SC = J ph) (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 21). For comparison, the control device only shows 0.8% EL efficiency under same injection current (Fig. 4d and  Supplementary  Fig.  21).

A more thermally stable hole transport layer poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) was used to replace spiroOMeTAD for thermal stablility testing 49,50 . The initial PCE of the PEAI-treated devices with a PTAA hole transport layer was 19.1% (Supplementary Fig. 22 and Supplementary Table 6), which is lower than the best device performance using spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer. This is a common issue and could be addressed in future studies. We found that the PCE of the PEAI-treated device decreased at the start of several hours of annealing at 85 °C, and then the performance remained almost constant up to 500 h of heating. Time-resolved PL for the perovskite films/hole transport layer showed that the lifetime of the perovskite layer was significantly shortened in minutes after heating at 85 °C (Supplementary Fig. 23).

      "Materials. SnO2 colloid precursor (tin (/i.sc/v.sc) oxide, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and lead iodine (PbI2) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium bromide (MABr), methylammonium iodide (MAI), methylammonium chloride (MACl) and phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) were all purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology in China.\n",

      "Solar cell fabrication. ITO glass was cleaned by sequentially washing with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol (IPA). Before use, the ITO was cleaned with ultraviolet ozone for 10 min. Then the substrate was spincoated with a thin layer of SnO2 nanoparticle film (2.67%, diluted by water) at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, and annealed in ambient air at 150 °C for 30 min. It is better to clean the substrate with ultraviolet ozone for 10 min to improve the surface wetting. After that, 1.5 M of PbI2 in DMF:DMSO (9:1) solvent was spin-coated onto SnO2 at 1,500 r.p.m. for 30 s, then annealed at 70 °C for 1 min, and then cooled to room temperature. For FAMAPbI3 perovskite film deposition, a solution of FAI:MAI:MACl (90 mg:6.39 mg:9 mg in 1 ml IPA) was spin-coated onto the PbI2 at spin rate of 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15 min in ambient air conditions (30-40% humidity). For comparison, a (FAPbI3)1 -x (MAPbBr3) x mixed perovskite were also synthesized. A solution of FAI:MABr:MACl (90 mg:9 mg:9 mg in 1 ml IPA) was spin-coated onto the PbI2 at spin rate of 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15 min in ambient air conditions (30-40% humidity). After perovskite formation, the samples were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box for further processing. For PEAI treatment, the PEAI solution was dissolved in IPA with different concentrations ranging from 0 mM to 60 mM and spin-coated onto the perovskite surface at a spin rate of 5,000 r.p.m. without any further processing. Then the hole transporting layer was deposited on top of the perovskite layer at a spin rate of 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s using spiro-OMeTAD solution, which consisted of 72.3 mg spiroOMeTAD, 35 /uni03BC l bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) stock solution (260 mg LiTFSI in 1 ml acetonitrile), 30 /uni03BC l 4-tertbutylpyridine and 1 ml chlorobenzene. For the device thermal stability test, PTAA doped with poly[bis(4phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (TPFB) was used to replace spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer. The concentration of PTAA was 30 mg ml -1 and the weight ratio of PTAA/TPFB was 10:1 (ref. 50 ). The PTAA was deposited on top of the perovskite layer at a spin rate of 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, 80 nm of Au film was thermally evaporated as a counter electrode using a shadow mask. The device size areas were 0.108 cm 2 . When measuring, a 0.0739 cm 2 non-reflective mask was used to define the accurate active cell area.\n",

      "Material and device characterization. The scanning electron microscopy images was acquired using a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FEI NanoSEM650), which uses an electron beam accelerated at 500 V to 30 kV, enabling operation at a variety of currents. Atomic force microscopy measurements were carried out using a Solver P47 PRO. The XRD patterns of the perovskite thin films were obtained on a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 system using Cu K /uni03B1 radiation ( /uni03BB = 1.5405 Å) as the X-ray source. Scans were taken with a 0.5-mm-wide source and detector slits, with X-ray generator settings at 40 kV and 30 mA. For conventional XRD, a /uni03B8 -2 /uni03B8 model was used. For the GIXRD measurement, the incident angle was 0.5°. Absorption spectra were obtained using an ultravioletvisible spectrometer (Cary 5000). Steady-state PL was measured by a FLS980 spectrometer. Time-resolved PL spectra were obtained using a F900 spectrometer. XPS was performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi using 200 W monochromated Al K /uni03B1 (1486.6 eV) radiation. A 500 /uni03BC m X-ray spot was used for XPS analysis. The base pressure in the analysis chamber was about 3 × 10 -10 mbar. For the PL mapping, a laser scanning confocal microscope (Enlitech, SPCM-1000) equipped with a 470 pulse laser and galvo-based scanner was used. The objective was × 50 with numerical aperture of 0.8; for this objective, the confocal pinhole was set to 50 /uni03BC m size. The detector was a photo-multiplier tube (Hamamatsu) with a photon-counting module. The laser source was set to 1 /uni03BC W range on the sample for measurement. Transient photocurrent and photovoltage measurements were measured on a home-made system similar to that previously reported 8 . For the device operating as a LED, the device was mounted in an integrating sphere and the power output measured for calculation of the EQE (Enlitech, LQE-50-PL). The J -V characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were obtained using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under simulated one-sun AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm -2 ) with a solar simulator (Enlitech, SS-F5-3A) and the light intensity was calibrated by means of a KG-5 Si diode. The J -V measurements were carried out in ambient air. The devices were measured both in reverse scan (1.2 V /uni2192 0 V,  step  0.02 V) and forward scan (0 V /uni2192 1.2 V, step 0.02 V). The EQE was measured using an Enlitech EQE measurement system (QE-R3018). We sent the best devices to an accredited laboratory (Newport, USA) for certification. The device thermal stability tests were carried out in a nitrogen glove box, and the devices were put on a hotplate with a temperature of 85 °C.\n",

      "Planar structures for halide perovskite solar cells have recently garnered attention, due to their simple and low-temperature device fabrication processing. Unfortunately, planar structures typically show I-V hysteresis and lower stable device e/fficiency compared with mesoporous structures, especially for TiO2-based n-i-p devices. SnO2, which has a deeper conduction band and higher electron mobility compared with traditional TiO2, could enhance charge transfer from perovskite to electron transport layers, and reduce charge accumulation at the interface. Here we report low-temperature solution-processed SnO2 nanoparticles as an e/fficient electron transport layer for perovskite solar cells. Our SnO2-based devices are almost free of hysteresis, which we propose is due to the enhancement of electron extraction. By introducing a PbI2 passivation phase in the perovskite layer, we obtain a 19.9 GLYPH<6> 0.6% certified e/fficiency. The devices can be easily processed under low temperature (150 GLYPH<14> C), o/ffering an e/fficient method for the large-scale production of perovskite solar cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "P erovskite solar cells have attracted great attention in recent years, as their eGLYPH<30>ciency has risen from 3.8% to 22.1% via film crystal growth control, interface and device engineering 1GLYPH<21>5 . Up to now, TiO2 mesoporous structures were commonly the most successful at delivering high eGLYPH<30>ciency and stable power output for perovskite solar cells 1GLYPH<21>4 . However, one disadvantage of the mesoporous structure is the high-temperature ( > 450 GLYPH<14> C) sintering required for the TiO2 mesoporous layer, which is a barrier to low cost and stretchable device fabrication 1GLYPH<21>4 . Further interest in perovskite solar cells developed after it was realized that lead halide perovskites have charge carrier diGLYPH<27>usion lengths on the micrometre scale and possess ambipolar properties 6,7 . Therefore, it is possible to remove the high-temperature sintered mesoporous layer to make a simple planar-structure solar cell, in which all of the layers can be processed at low temperature 8GLYPH<21>12 .\n",
      "\n",
      "Planar devices are typically divided into either n-i-p (regular) or p-i-n (inverted) structures, depending on the bottom transporting layer 12 . The p-i-n inverted planar structure usually shows negligible hysteresis when using fullerene as the top electron transport layer 12 . However, it exhibits lower eGLYPH<30>ciency due to inferior perovskite crystallinity and imperfect interfacial band alignment 11,12 . For regular n-i-p planar structures using a TiO2 condensed layer as the electron transport layer, the device could show high performance under reverse scan ( V OC to J SC scan), whereas the forward IGLYPH<21>V scan usually showed much lower eGLYPH<30>ciency ( J SC to V OC scan) 4,9 , which led to diGLYPH<30>culty in obtaining a reliable power conversion eGLYPH<30>ciency 4,9 . Further results indicated that charge accumulation induced by ion migration in the perovskite layer could be the main cause of hysteresis 13GLYPH<21>15 . It was also found that the electronic contact between perovskite and electron transport layers (ETLs) could significantly aGLYPH<27>ect the behaviour of the hysteresis 16GLYPH<21>20 (generally, hole transport layers do not aGLYPH<27>ect hysteresis, because the commonly used hole transport layer, Spiro-OMeTAD, can form good electronic contact with perovskite 6 ). When the electronic contact is imperfect,\n",
      "\n",
      "the charge accumulation will become worse and aggravate the hysteresis. However, if the electronic contact is perfect and the accumulated charges can be easily extracted, the hysteresis can be alleviated or fully eliminated 17,20 . For example, either in the regular or the inverted planar structure, on introducing a fullerene layer with a strong electron extraction ability, the devices showed stable output with reduced hysteresis 16GLYPH<21>20 . However, fullerene is expensive, as well as unstable for practical applications 12 .\n",
      "\n",
      "Inorganic metal oxides such as SnO2 have a bandgap above 3.6 eV, and a deeper conduction band than TiO2. Thus, in principle they should facilitate more eGLYPH<30>cient electron transfer 21 . Furthermore, bulk SnO2 has a mobility of up to 240 cm 2 /(V GLYPH<1> s), which is 100 times that of TiO2, making it conceptually a more likely candidate for use in high-performance electronic devices 21 . Previously, SnO2 has been used as an electron transport layer in organic solar cells or dye-sensitized solar cells 21,22 . Recently, it was also used in perovskite solar cells in order to increase the eGLYPH<30>ciency and to reduce the hysteresis 23GLYPH<21>27 . During the final preparation of this Article, ref. 28 was published, reporting planar perovskite solar cells with an average PCE around 18.5% and a mild hysteresis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, we develop a regular n-i-p planar structure of perovskite solar cells with solution-processed SnO2 nanoparticles as the electron transport layer. The devices show a certified eGLYPH<30>ciency close to 20%, almost free of hysteresis. Given the SnO2 layer's deep conduction band and high electron mobility, we ascribe the elimination of the IGLYPH<21>V hysteresis to the enhanced electron extraction caused by the reduction of the energy barrier at the perovskite/ETL interface. Furthermore, an excess PbI2 phase was introduced to passivate the traps in perovskite (FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03 and deliver high device performance.\n",

      "3GLYPH<21>4 nm. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy results (Fig. 1b) indicated the SnO2 nanoparticles are highly crystallized, which is good for reducing the number of defect traps in SnO2, and should also be beneficial for charge transfer when using it as a charge transport layer. Electron diGLYPH<27>raction circles from the (110), (101) and (211) crystal planes of SnO2 were observed (Fig. 1c), indicating that the SnO2 nanoparticles are polycrystalline. X-ray diGLYPH<27>raction (Fig. 1d) results further confirmed this conclusion. All X-ray diGLYPH<27>raction peaks for SnO2 (Fig. 1d) are indexable to the tetragonal SnO2 structure (space group P 42/ mnm , a = 0.4738 and c = 0.3187 nm), indicating the formation of pure SnO2 crystals 29 . When spin coating SnO2 nanoparticles solution onto glass/ITO substrate, it can form a dense, pinhole-free film (Fig. 1e), and the film quality is much better than that of the conventionally used TiO2 nanoparticles film (Supplementary Fig. 1). In addition, we found that the SnO2 films formed showed good transparency, with transmission values greater than 95% in the visible region (Fig. 1f), with minimized optical loss in the SnO2 layer.\n",

The composition of MAPbBr3 in the perovskite mixture was about 3%, as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Supplementary Fig. 8), thus giving the form (FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03.

In situ energy dispersive X-ray analysis in a scanning electron microscope further confirms that the 'white phase' is a PbI2-rich region (Supplementary Fig. 10). The longer lifetime from the perovskite film with excess PbI2 indicated that PbI2 could passivate the defects and reduce recombination in the perovskite film (Supplementary Fig. 11). The passivation could be explained as follows: while PbI2 was formed at the grain boundary in the perovskite layer, a type-I band alignment could be formed between perovskite and PbI2 (ref. 36), which blocks electron from entering the hole transport layer and also reduces recombination.

The optimized process for the SnO2 layer can be found in Supplementary Fig. 12. To obtain the best performance, the SnO2 layer should fully cover the ITO substrate, but it must not be so thick as to introduce a high series resistance.

It was found that the perovskite with excess PbI2 showed better device performance, taking in account all the device performance parameters (Fig. 5a). In terms of the lifetime enhancement (Supplementary Fig. 11), it could be assumed that the improvement of the device performance was due to passivation of the traps, including surface or grain boundary defects in the perovskite layer, which were considered as recombination centres 39 . In inorganic solar cells, a thin layer of wide bandgap or insulating materials is usually used for passivating the surface traps; for example, a thin layer of SiO2 or Al2O3 for Si solar cells 40 and the wide bandgap of AlGaAs for GaAs solar cells 41 .

The diGLYPH<27>erent scan directions showed almost the same performance, with only a slight diGLYPH<27>erence in fill factor. More importantly, all the device performances are almost independent of the measurement conditions (Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Table 2), certainly indicating that the SnO2-based planar structure can achieve an eGLYPH<30>cient and stable power output. This behaviour is diGLYPH<27>erent from a traditional TiO2-based planar structure, as will be shown below. The typical external quantum eGLYPH<30>ciency of the devices is shown in Fig. 5c. The photo response edge has been extended to 820 nm, compared with 780 nm from CH3NH3PbI3. In the visible region, the external quantum eGLYPH<30>ciency can reach as high as 93%. The integrated short-circuit current (24.2 mA cm GLYPH<0> 2 ) matched well with the JGLYPH<21>V results.
