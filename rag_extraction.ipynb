Here we grow a stable and highly crystalline 2D (C 4 H 9 NH 3 ) 2 PbI 4 film on top of a 3D film using a solvent-free solid-phase in-plane growth, which could result in an intact 2D/3D heterojunction. An enhanced built-in potential is achieved at the 2D/3D heterojunction with a thick 2D film, resulting in high photovoltage in the device. The intact 2D/3D heterojunction endow the devices with an open-circuit voltage of 1.185 V and a certified steady-state efficiency of 24.35%. The encapsulated device retained 94% of its initial efficiency after 1,056 h under the damp heat test (85 °C/85% relative humidity) and 98% after 1,620 h under full-sun illumination.\"\n",

      "First, I'll read through the text to understand the main points. It seems the study focuses on the use of bulky ammonium iodide salts to passivate defects in the perovskite layer, which improves the device performance. They tested several salts with different bulky cations and found that the bulky ones (like phenethylammonium iodide) were more effective. They also looked into how these salts affect the structure and properties of the perovskite layer.\n",

The text mentions several bulky ammonium iodide salts, including phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI), phenylammonium iodide (PAI), butylammonium iodide (BAI), and methylammonium iodide (MAI). They tested these and found that PEAI and PAI were effective, while MAI was not.\n",

      "Next, I'll look for device performance data. The text provides power conversion efficiency (PCE) values for devices treated with different salts. The best PCE was 23.8% for the 10 mM PEAI-treated device. \n",
