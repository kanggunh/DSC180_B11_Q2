Here we grow a stable and highly crystalline 2D (C 4 H 9 NH 3 ) 2 PbI 4 film on top of a 3D film using a solvent-free solid-phase in-plane growth, which could result in an intact 2D/3D heterojunction. An enhanced built-in potential is achieved at the 2D/3D heterojunction with a thick 2D film, resulting in high photovoltage in the device. The intact 2D/3D heterojunction endow the devices with an open-circuit voltage of 1.185 V and a certified steady-state efficiency of 24.35%. The encapsulated device retained 94% of its initial efficiency after 1,056 h under the damp heat test (85 °C/85% relative humidity) and 98% after 1,620 h under full-sun illumination.\"\n",

      "First, the text discusses the formation of 2D/3D perovskite interfaces using different ligand solutions. It mentions that the formation pathway varies depending on the solvent used. The authors used in situ GIWAXS to study these transformations. They found that the formation of 2D/3D interfaces proceeds via intermediate states that differ depending on the perovskite composition. For MAPbI3, exposure to the ligand solution induces the formation of a 2D layer of PbI2 intercalated by solvent molecules, which is subsequently converted into n = 1 RDPs. For (MAPbBr3)0.05(FAPbI3)0.95 films, there is a progressive dimensional reduction from 3D fragments into n = 3 → 2 → 1. The authors also performed DFT calculations to support these findings, showing that the binding energy at the interface between two perovskite fragments increases upon substitution with VBA molecules, owing to the ring stacking interactions afforded by these ligand cations. They used these observations to hypothesize that the ligands infiltrate and bisect the 3D perovskite to form lower-dimensional fragments that continuously split into lower-n RDPs before becoming n = 1, in accordance with their observations from in situ GIWAXS experiments. By comparing photovoltaic devices with 2D/3D interfaces fabricated using different ligand solutions, they posit that lowering the concentration of IPA in the ligand solution slows the interface formation, which leads to improved photovoltaic device performance. This is supported by AFM, SEM, and ToF-SIMS measurements that reveal thicker and more disordered RDP layers are formed with higher concentrations of IPA, which leads to poorer carrier extraction from 2D/3D interfaces as determined using PL lifetime quenching. Their work highlights how a fundamental understanding of 2D/3D interface formation can inform on the design of superior devices. Future studies will be required to definitively prove these microscopic mechanisms they propose based on their experimental and computational observations.\n",
