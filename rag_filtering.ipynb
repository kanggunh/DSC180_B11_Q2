      "Excitation for the PL imaging measurements was performed with a 445 nm CW laser (Insaneware) through an optical fibre into an integrating sphere. The intensity of the laser was adjusted to a 1 sun equivalent intensity by illuminating a 1 cm 2 -size perovskite solar cell under short-circuit and matching the current density to the 𝐽 SC under the sun simulator (22.0 mA/cm 2 at 100 mWcm -2 , or 1.375x10 21 photons m -2 s -1 ). A second optical fiber was used from the output of the integrating sphere to an Andor SR393i-B spectrometer equipped with a silicon CCD camera (DU420A-BR-DD, iDus). The system was calibrated by using a calibrated halogen lamp with specified spectral irradiance, which was shone into to integrating sphere. A spectral correction factor was established to match the spectral output of the detector to the calibrated spectral irradiance of the lamp. The spectral photon density was obtained from the corrected detector signal (spectral irradiance) by division through the photon energy (ℎ𝑓), and the photon numbers of the excitation and emission obtained from numerical integration using Matlab. In a last step, three fluorescent test samples with high specified PLQY (~70%) supplied from Hamamatsu Photonics where measured where the specified value could be accurately reproduced within a small relative error of less than 5%. Measurement conditions: All films and cells were prepared fresh and immediately encapsulated in a glovebox after preparation with the exception of films and cells with spiro-OMeTAD which require oxygen doping for enabling sufficient transport capability in the device (non-oxgygen treated spiro-OMeTAD cells exhibited FFs below 20 % with negligible photovoltaic performance). Thus, films and cells with spiro-OMeTAD were treated in atmosphere overnight at 25% relative humidity, and subsequently encapsulated before the PL measurements. The PL of the samples was readily recorded after mounting the sample after an exposure between 10-20 s to the laser light. Thus, the PLQY is obtained on timescales relevant to the 𝑉 OC measurements on the cells. We note that all absolute PL measurements were performed on films with the same HTL, ETL and perovskite thicknesses as used in the operational solar cells. The absorption of the samples was considered in the PLQY calculation and was approximately 85% for cells illuminated through the top encapsulation glass, and ~93% through the bottom glass.\n",

      "We further analyze the underlying film growth mechanism in a theoretical point of view. And we assume the same interdiffusion process between the organic and inorganic species for either the α-phase (cubic) and δ-phase (hexagonal) of FAPbI3 reasonably, due to the same preparation method. The conversion process might be influenced by the alkalinity of additives. And we calculate the activation energies with existence of OH  ions in the synthesis of the α-phase (cubic) and δ-phase (hexagonal) of FAPbI3. The formation energies of both phase in normal condition and alkaline condition have been considered and the corresponding reactions of FAPbI3 are shown as follows: PbI2 + FAI → FAPbI3 (2) PbI2(OH)n + FAI → FAPbI3(OH)n (3) where the constant n represents the concentration of OH  ions in the synthesis. The OH  molecule has been inserted into the PbI2 model and FAPbI3 unit cells with different ratio n (n = 0.1 ~ 0.5) to represent the different concentration, which can be referred as \"#/unit cell\" in this simulation. The formation energies in normal condition of α-and δ-phase of FAPbI3 have been calculated as 0.157 eV and -0.271 eV, respectively. Such results indicate δ-phase of FAPbI3 is thermodynamically favored in normal synthesis conditions, in which the combination of both phase in the corresponding thin film is likely to be observed. After the introduction of OH  during film formation, the activation energy changes for the two phases follow different patterns, as is summarized in Fig.  3e  (main text). At the low OH  concentration, the δ-phase FAPbI3 has shown much higher activation energy of 5.352 eV, which is 1.834 eV higher than that of α-phase. As the OH  concentration increases, the activation energies of δ-phase FAPbI3 will experience an evident drop around 0.7 eV meanwhile α-phase FAPbI3 will undergo a subtle increase (<0.1 eV) of the activation energies. Notably, the variations of activation energy of α-phase FAPbI3 are relatively inert to the OH  concentration at low level. On contrary, the activation energy of δ-phase FAPbI3 is very sensitive, which decrease around 1 eV from n = 0.1 to n = 0.33 that is 10 times to the variation of α-phase FAPbI3. Nevertheless, when the OH  concentration reaches a high level (n = 0.5), the activation energy of these two phases will meet a cross, in which the δ-phase FAPbI3 will keep decreasing to 4.143 eV. The α-phase FAPbI3 will suddenly experience an obvious increase from 3.660 eV to 4.293 eV, which becomes larger than that of δ-phase FAPbI3. All the above-mentioned results suggest that the OH  concentration exhibits substantial influence to the formation of two phases of FAPbI3. As the OH  concentration increases, the formation of α-phase will gradually lose its advantage, and finally will be suppressed by the formation of δ-phase FAPbI3 at high OH  concentration. This preliminary result is in consistent with the observation of experiment above, illustrating the importance of control of OH  in the synthesis of different phase of FAPbI3. \n",

      "As shown in Fig.  1c , the pristine PbBr2 film showed a characteristic diffraction peak at 18.48°, corresponding to the lattice plane of (020). After dipping the film in the FAI solution, this peak completely disappeared, and a new peak at 13.84° corresponding to the (001) plane of the 3D perovskite emerged. When PEG, PS and PMMA were coated onto the PbBr2 film, the transition from PbBr2 to 3D perovskite still proceeded, as evidenced by the emergence of (001) peaks with comparable intensities to those of the pristine PbBr2 film. Notably, when the CLP was deposited on the PbBr2, the film maintained the (020) peak of PbBr2 after dipping in the FAI solution, and the (001) peak corresponding to 3D perovskite was significantly weaker. The peak intensity and integral area are presented in Supplementary Table  2 . When PbBr2 films were dipped in the 4F-PEAI solution, similar results were observed. Pristine PbBr2 reacted with 4F-PEAI, and formed 4F-PEA2Pb(IxBr1-x)4, showing a characteristic diffraction peak at 5.48°. When PEG, PS, and PMMA were used to cover the PbBr2 film, the transition from PbBr2 to 2D perovskite was not prevented. However, for PbBr2 films covered with the CLP, the intensity of the (100) peak of 2D perovskite 4F-PEA2Pb(IxBr1-x)4 was significantly reduced. The peak intensity and integral area are presented in Supplementary Table  3 . These results revealed that the CLP layer can effectively inhibit the intercalation of FA + and 4F-PEA + into the inorganic template of PbBr2. Supplementary Note 2: pEDMA and the CLP were employed to prevent the reaction between PbBr2 films and FAI at an elevated temperature of 100 °C (Supplementary Fig.  6 ). The FAI solution was spin-coated on PbBr2/pEDMA and PbBr2/CLP films, and annealed at 100 °C for 10 to 300 min. After only 30 min, XRD patterns of PbBr2/pEDMA/FAI films showed a distinct peak corresponding to 3D perovskite. On the contrary, the diffraction peak of 3D perovskite in PbBr2/CLP/FAI films remained at a much weaker intensity even after 300 min of thermal annealing. This indicates that the CLP is more effective at inhibiting ion diffusion than pEDMA under thermal stress. To investigate the stabilization effects of EDMA monomers and pEDMA in the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructures, we aged 3D/EDMA/2D and 3D/pEDMA/2D films at 100 °C for 120 min, and compared the evolution of PL spectra. As shown in Fig.  2d , EDMA and pEDMA only offer partial stabilization the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructures under thermal stress. After thermal ageing, the PL emission intensity of 2D perovskite 4F-PEA2PbI4 in both the 3D/EDMA/2D and 3D/pEDMA/2D films reduced, and PL emission of the quais-2D perovskite 4F-PEA2FAPb2I7 emerged. Thus, we conclude that the high degree of crosslinking and the network structure of the POSS-EDMA-based CLP play crucial roles in stabilizing the 3D/2D perovskite heterostructures. Supplementary Note 3: It is challenging to directly measure the thickness of the CLP layer that was prepared using a concentration of 3 mg mL -1 . Instead, we prepared CLP layers with concentrations of 10, 15 and 20 mg mL -1 , and directly measured the thickness of the CLP layers using a profilometer (Bruker, Dektak). As shown in Supplementary Figure  8a , as the concentration increases from 10 to 20 mg mL -1 , the thickness of the as-prepared CLP layer increases from ~14 nm to ~40 nm. Using polynomial fitting to simulate the layer thicknesses, we estimate the thickness of the CLP layer for the concentration of 3 mg mL -1 to be 2~3 nm. Additionally, we conducted XPS depth profiling, as shown in Supplementary Figure  8b . We used the signals of oxygen (O 1s) to track the existence of the CLP. After etching for only 30 seconds, the signals of oxygen disappeared. The etching rate of the argon gun towards the reference material (NPB, the molecular structure is shown in Supplementary Figure  8c ) was calibrated to be 0.5~0.6 Å s -1 , and thus the thickness of the CLP layer should be below 1.8 nm. Supplementary Note 4: Previously, we have incorporated 3F-PEAI for surface treatment of 3D perovskite in p-i-n inverted PSCs [5]  . Herein, for n-i-p PSCs, the principle for selecting the organic ligand and tuning band alignment is entirely different. In p-i-n PSCs, the 2D layer on the surface of the 3D perovskite should be suitable for electron transfer and can block holes. However, this requirement is not easily met by regular 2D perovskite modification strategies. The 2D perovskite layer usually has a conduction band minimum (CBM) that is much higher than that of the 3D perovskite, which results in an electron-blocking effect. Thus, using a 2D perovskite layer on 3D perovskite in a p-i-n device is likely to reduce the efficiency of PSCs. Using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and absorption spectroscopy, the band alignment of low dimensional perovskite films of differing quantum well widths (n = 1 -4) was estimated. It was found that quantum confinement upshifted the CBM, which induced electron blocking in p-i-n PSCs. In order to achieve efficient electron transfer, it is necessary to increase the n values of the low dimensional perovskites in order to minimize CBM offset. Using transient absorption (TA) spectra to evaluate the n values of the low-dimensional perovskites, it was revealed that the ligand of 3F-PEA produced low-dimensional perovskite containing majority n = Supplementary Figure  9  | XPS spectra of 3D perovskite (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 (a) and 2D perovskite 4F-PEA2PbI4 (b).

      "The film stress can be calculated according to the relationship between 2θ and sin 2 φ as the following equation  [8]  ： σ = - E 2(1+υ) π 180 cot θ 0 ∂ (2θ ) ∂ sin 2 φ (1) where E and υ are Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the perovskite film, respectively. θ0 is the diffraction peak for strain-free perovskite crystal plane and θ is the diffraction peak for the measured perovskite films. φ is the angle of diffraction vector with respect to the sample normal direction. Here, the values of E and υ are 10200 MPa and 0.3, respectively. By fitting the 2θ as a function of sin 2 φ, we can calculate perovskite film strain from formula (1), and the slope of the fitted line stands for the scale of the residual strain, the negative slope indicates the films bear tension strain. It is found that the δ-phase formed in the 0% DBSO sample was completely transformed into α-phase perovskite within approximately 30 s, but after annealing, the formed α-phase perovskite possesses lower diffraction peak intensity and larger halfpeak width (Supplementary Figure  11 ). By contrast, the intermediate phase in the 10% DBSO sample disappeared within approximately 10 s, while the fully annealed film shows much stronger α-phase diffraction peaks with smaller half-peak widths. This comparison highlights the important role of DBSO additive in promoting perovskite αphase crystal growth. For XRD measurement, we prepared perovskite precursor film samples in N2 glove box and put it into a sealed chamber. Then, the samples were quickly transferred for XRD testing (The XRD instrument is in the lab on the next floor of the device fabrication lab). When annealing, the perovskite film was kept in a N2 filled small chamber and placed on a temperature controlled hotplate for different time. The annealing hotplate was placed nearby the XRD instrument. When testing, the annealed sample was quickly taken out for XRD measurement. nature energy  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01288-7   \n",

      "Supplementary Note 1: Further discussion on the heterointerface energy band diagrams In Extended Data Fig.  3 , the perovskite bulk work function should also be affected by ΔEvac. This is because the less negative ΔEvac by replacing OAI treatment with OATsO treatment resultantly delocalizes the accumulated electrons in the potential well, which enhances the electron density and thus electron quasi-fermi level (𝐸 𝑓𝑛 ) work function of the perovskite bulk. Moreover, the change in bulk work function by surface treatment would also affect the band alignment and thus charge accumulation at the perovskite/SnO2 heterointerface. Indeed, a slightly increased hole accumulation was observed for the OATsO-treated device (Fig.  1h, i ). However, although the hole quasi-fermi level (𝐸 𝑓𝑝 ) for the OATsO-treated device slightly up-shifted, its increase is not as significant as 𝐸 𝑓𝑛 . The overall effect on the quasi-fermi level splitting is consistent with the slight VOC enhancement by replacing OAI treatment with OATsO treatment (Extended Data Fig.  5 ). \n",

      "Supplementary The paper by Yang et al. describing the preparation of EDTA-complexed SnO2 represents an interesting and obviously very high-performance perovskite solar cell electron transport layer. However, due to numerous issues with the paper, detailed below, I recommend that this paper be rejected from Nature Communications pending major revisions by the authors. First some general comments. • The authors consistently use hyperbolic language in this manuscript. They describe -even in the title -the solar cells as \"without hysteresis\" and say that hysteresis is \"completely eliminated\" in their devices. I agree that the devices have very low hysteresis for perovskite solar cells. This is clearly shown in Fig.  S11 . Nevertheless, the hysteresis is not eliminated: eliminated is simply too strong of a word. There are differences in the forward and reverse JV scans. While these differences are slight they are clearly visible. Fig.  6  shows the FF changes from 0.792 to 0.783 with scan direction. This is hysteresis. The authors should modify the language of the paper in this respect. Hysteresis is reduced, it is perhaps even negligible, but it is certainly still present and is not \"eliminated\". • The English throughout the paper requires significant improvement to improve the readability of the manuscript. This is particularly true of the methods section. In fact, it is in places difficult to understand the methods being used due to inconsistent grammar. Improving readability would greatly improve the impact of this work. • The authors use a variety of device configurations to measure material properties such as defect density, mobility, and others. While I don't necessarily disagree or refute the results as presented, there are complicating factors associated with these measurements and device architectures. The authors should be clear about the caveats associated with their measurements and why they believe these can be neglected in this case. This will give the reader a fairer picture of the measurements undertaken and the conclusions of the work. More specific comments. • The authors' description of the crystallization with respect to the Gibbs free energy is unclear. What do the authors mean that the \"hydrophilicity of the E-SnO2 surface… decreases the Gibbs barrier during perovskite growth\" and how do the authors envision this resulting in \"improved quality of perovskite film\"? What Gibbs barrier is being reduced? Are the authors merely expecting more uniform nucleation of perovskite crystals on the E-SnO2 surface? It isn't clear from the discussion of this in the text what exactly is meant and how this would affect trap densities in the perovskite layer. Also, it looks like these Nt measurements are conducted with FAPbI3. Is this a different active layer than the FACsPbI3 layers used in the rest of this work? If so, why? • The authors state that hysteresis is more severe in planar-type architecures (see pg 3). This is not universally a true statement • On page 4 the authors comment on the high annealing temperature necessary for TiO2. Contrary to this assertion, TiO2 ETLs which can be processed at low temperature with high performance have been widely shown. Including some with similar high performance to the current study. See DOI: 10.1126/science.aai9081 • The E-SnO2 solution is said to be stable. Can the authors provide device data or something else to actually confirm this? A photograph of the solution does not confirm if the solution is actually stable or not. • The authors say the obtain their XPS data from films on quartz substrates. What effects from charging do the authors see with this? I would expect very significant charging in these samples which could greatly shift the observed binding energies. • The FTIR spectra of the control SnO2 is missing. The authors show the O-O stretch at ~1000 cm-1, is this related to the SnO2 itself exposed to O2 (as described in the reference cited) or is it a result of the EDTA bound to the SnO2 surface? The authors report a success strategy in eliminating hysteresis and at the same time attaining record-efficiency in planar-type perovskite solar cells by using EDTA-complexed SnO2 (E-SnO2) electron transport layers (ETL). Statistical analysis seems sounds as well as expertiments carried out for improving understanding. I thus recommend publication after addressing these minor but useful points below. \"Even though ETL free planar-type PSCs have been reported, their performances are poor compared to those with ETL\": Please quantify the PCE of these ETL-free devices. \"ii) suitable energy level with the perovskite materials to reduce the energy barrier for electron transport\" On one hand you want to eliminate an energy barrier for electron injection, on the other you don't want the conduction band to be too much lower that that of the perovoskite otherwise it would lower the Voc. Please explain this better. \"However, the PCE of the planar-type PSCs is still lower than that of the mesoporous-type devices because there exists significant energy barrier between SnO2 ETL and perovskite absorber, leading to energy loss.\" In fact some referenced have used both SnO2 compact layer and either a compact layer ( https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024817300  65X) or a mesoporous TiO2 layer ( https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12274-017-1896-5 ) over the top to improve the efficiency confirming what the authors say. Other groups have doped the SnO2 for improved performance ( https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/cf6b/9a40dcdb8a82887d20b2335469  7dd873e7b4.pdf). I would recommend adding this further discussion and references in the introduction for the state of the art. On page 7 \"The reduced energy barrier is also believed to enhance charge transfer from the perovskite to the ETL\" . This is not an energy barrier because the conduction band of the SnO2 is lower than that of the perovskite. The electron in the solar cells is injected from the perovskite into the SnO2 during solar cell operation (this is different from IV curves in the dark where electrons are injected from the SnO2 into the perovoksite). Why should the transfer be better if the jump is lower? The Voc should be higher because the conduction band of the SnO2 is closer to that of the perovskite. Please review this explanation as well as the caption of S5. The authiors partly explain the higher crystallinity of the perovskite films using contact angle measruements, where larger grain sizes are correlated with lower contact angels. However, there is literature where investigators say that non wetting surfaces lead to higher grain size. Can the authors discuss this matter in more depth using the literature and provide a clearer or more definitive explanation of the literature on this matter? Again on page 11 when discussing why pholtoluminescence times are shorter, the explanation of higher mobility seems correct, but the reduced energy barrier does not (it is a jump). It may be that the interface or adhesion is better at the interface. Same when discussing hysteriss at the end of page 16 \"meaning no energy barrier for electron transfer (Fig.  S5 ), that is expected to facilitate electron extraction from the perovskite to the ETL.\" The explanation must be another. Maybe less traps? Better initial growth on the E-SnO2? On page 17 the authors use a bending radius of 7mm 4. As known, in the conventional structure of PSC, the instability is mainly due to the perovskite layer and spiro-OMeTAD HTL. As the author did not change the perovskite layer and HTL, why the device without encapsulation could show better stability in air with 35% humidity for a so long time of 3000 h? The author should clarify it. \n",

      "scale may be associated with intrinsic changes of the defect structure in the perovskite, which is beyond the scope of the present work. The barrier properties of the AZO and AZO/SnO x EELs have been studied by using Cacorrosion test. Detail of this test have been describe previously.  6  Specifically, we have used a setup as shown in Supplementary Fig.  5a . The substrate was a PET/ITO foil, which has an intrinsic water vapor transmission rate of 3×10 -2 gm -2 day -1 . On top of this substrate we have deposited the PCBM layer and the EEL in an identical way as in case of the solar cells. Subsequently, an array of Ca dots has been thermally evaporated (thickness 100 nm). The top-side of this stack has been encapsulated by a 200 nm thick Al 2 O 3 gas diffusion barrier using ALD. The WVTR of the Al 2 O 3 top-encapsulation is expected to be on the order of 10 -6 gm -2 day -1 (ref. 7). Thus only the water ingress from the bottom side through the substrate and the PCBM/EEL will be relevant for the corrosion of the Ca. While the Ca appears metallic in the pristine samples, the corrosion due to moisture will render the Ca transparent Supplementary Fig.  5b . Obviously, in the case of AZO the degradation of the Ca pads is substantially faster, as after 36h in air almost all the pads have vanished. Therefore the WVTR of the AZO layer does not provide any significant barrier against the ingress of moisture. On the contrary, in case of the AZO/SnO x EEL the Ca pads appear far less corroded. This corroborates the barrier functionality of the ALD grown SnO x layer on top of the AZO. It has to be noted that some statistical failure may be due to particle defects that may void the effectivity of the top encapsulation layer.  8  Reviewers' comments: \n",

For the preparation of FA-based (FAPbI 3 ) x (MAPbBr 3 ) 1-x perovskite (x equals to 0.94 in the precursor) thin film, the PbI 2 solution was prepared by dissolving 1.4 mM PbI 2 into 1 mL DMF/DMSO mixed solvent (v/v 94/6). The FAI/MABr/MACl solution was prepared by dissolving 70 mg FAI, 3 mg MABr and 11 mg MACl into 1 mL IPA. The solutions should be stirred overnight before use. the PbI 2 solution was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 70 °C for 1 min. And then, the FAI/MABr/MACl solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 1800 rpm for 30 s, followed by pre-annealing inside the N 2 glove box at 90 °C for 1 min and annealing outside the glove box at 150 °C for 10 min with 40% humidity. For the preparation of all-inorganic CsPbI 2 Br perovskite thin film, the precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.5 mM PbI 2 , 0.5 mM PbBr 2 and 1 mM CsI in 250 µL DMSO and 750 µL DMF. The perovskite solution was spin-coated on the preheated substrate (70 °C) at 2000 rpm for 35 s, to which 0.1 mL of IPA was dropped after 15 s. The spin -coated film was heat-treated at 65 °C for 1 min, followed by 260 °C for 10 min. To prepare perovskite thin films with the conjugated organic ammoniums, 5 mM PRA/IPA:CB, PRMA/IPA:CB or PREA/IPA:CB solution was drop casted at 4000 rpm on the as-fabricated perovskite thin film noted above. The volume ratio of IPA and CB is 1:1. The film was annealed at 100 °C for 3 min. Perovskite solar cells were fabricated with the following device structure: indium tin oxide (ITO)/SnO 2 /(FAPbI 3 ) x (MAPbBr 3 ) 1-x /Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag or Au. The ITO glass was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol and treated in ultraviolet-ozone for 20 min. A thin layer (ca. 30 nm) of SnO 2 was spin-coated twice onto the ITO glass and baked at 180 °C for 60 min. SnO 2 solution was diluted in water (2 mg mL -1 ) before spin-coating. After cooling to room temperature, the glass/ITO/SnO 2 substrates were transferred into a nitrogen glove box, followed by the deposition of the perovskite layer as noted above. For CsFAMAPbI 3 -based perovskite devices, the PbI 2 solution was prepared by dissolving 1.4 mM PbI 2 and 0.07mM CsI into 1 mL DMF/DMSO mixed solvent (v/v 94/6).

This fact is clearly justified by the very high efficiencies attainable (reaching 20% in lab scale devices) at a fraction of the cost of conventional photovoltaics. However, many problems must be solved before a market introduction of these devices can be envisaged. Perhaps the most important to be addressed is the lack of information regarding the thermal and thermodynamic stability of the materials towards decomposition, which are intrinsic properties of them and which can seriously limit or even exclude their use in real devices. In this work we present and discuss the results we obtained using non-ambient X-ray diffraction, Knudsen effusion-mass spectrometry (KEMS) and Knudsen effusion mass loss (KEML) techniques on MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3 and MAPbI 3 . The measurements demonstrate that all the materials decompose to the corresponding solid lead (II) halide and gaseous methylamine and hydrogen halide, and the decomposition is well detectable even at moderate temperatures (~60 °C). Our results suggest that these materials may be problematic for long term operation of solar devices. In 2009, the pioneering work published by Kojima et al.  1  regarding the use of methylammonium lead halide perovskites as sensitizers in solar cells, though obtaining quite modest results in comparison to then established dye-sensitized solar cells-DSSCs (solar conversion efficiencies obtained: 3.13% and 3.89%, with MAPbBr 3 and MAPbI 3 , respectively vs. 11.2% for the best performing DSSC that year 2 ), sparked an enormous and well motivated interest of the scientific community about this new class of sensitizers. In fact, the optimization of the device led to a very quick performance improvement of the same and hybrid cells based on MAPbX 3 sensitizers soon outperformed their DSSC counterpart. In fact, as of 2015, the best performing perovskite cells attained solar conversion efficiency of 20.1% 3 vs 13% of the best DSSC  4  . But this stunning development is accompanied by many problems  [5] [6] [7]  the most important being related to hysteresis of cells and stability issues of MAPbX 3 compounds with regards to interaction with atmospheric agents (especially moisture)  7  and to their thermal and thermodynamic stability towards decomposition, especially in severe operating conditions such as under intense solar irradiation. Despite the extreme importance of information regarding the last two issues, i.e. thermal and thermodynamic stability towards decomposition of the materials for the technological development of solar devices based on MAPbX 3 compounds, the available literature does give only very limited experimental information  [8] [9] [10] [11]  . Here we present the results of two parallel investigations on MAPbCl 3 , MAPbBr 3 and MAPbI 3 . The first is a study of the thermal stability of the compounds by means of non-ambient X-ray diffraction. The second is a study of the thermodynamics of decomposition of the compounds by Knudsen effusion-mass spectrometry (KEMS) and Knudsen effusion mass loss (KEML) techniques. By the combination of these two studies, we clarify for the first time the decomposition reactions and we obtain both kinetic data useful for the estimation of the lifetime of the devices in operative conditions as well as thermodynamic data necessary to assess the stability of the compounds in diverse conditions, such those encountered during the realization of the devices and during their operation. \n",

      "Note S1. A quantitative analysis of the TRPL. For the interpretation of the TRPL data in Fig.  1b , we fitted the TRPL curves at t > 200 ns with a model described in a previous work (1). For the modelling we assumed a mobility of 1 cm/s. Since it is impossible to distinguish between surface and bulk recombination, we modelled two extreme cases. In the first case we assumed zero surface recombination, i.e. the decay is solely caused by bulk recombination with a fitted bulk recombination constant k1 = 3.5•10 5 s -1 for the reference and 2.3•10 5 s -1 for the Fo-FAPbI3 sample. In the second case we assumed that the PL decays of both samples are dominated by surface recombination, with a surface recombination velocity S fitted as 13.9 cm/s for the Fo-FAPbI3 and 21.3 cm/s for the reference sample. Both cases gave the same fit curves as shown in Fig.  1b . These results show that the formate treatment reduces the non-radiative recombination rate significantly by either reducing bulk or surface recombination. \n",

Reducing the offset between perovskite and ETL with the CF3-PEA treatment will increase the VOC of devices dramatically regardless of defect density, however this effect is increased for higher defect densities. c, Resultant J-V curves based on a control with a ΔEC = 0.64 and an interfacial defect density of 10  16  (equivalent to a surface recombination velocity of ~ 10 3 cm/s 9 ) and a CF3-PEA treated device with a ΔEC = 0.22 and an interfacial defect density of 10 15 (equivalent to a surface recombination velocity of ~ 100 cm/s). d, Comparison of true device EQE and EQE from simulations showing that significant charge lost in the device is uncounted for by the simulations. A possible cause is a poor-quality interface which does not extract charge as efficiently across the entire film. The parameters used for simulation are found in Table  S6 -7 below.

It is clear from these data that FA + and 3-APy react to form a unique product, whereas MAI and 3-APy simply exchange acidic NH protons. Our results show that a reaction has nearly fully occurred between FA + and 3-APy within 10 minutes at room temperature, which does not rule out a faster reaction time, as this is the minimum amount of time it takes to go from sample preparation to completing the measurement. Before concluding these data as direct evidence for our proposed surface mechanism, we need quantitative integration proving a 1:2:3 H-shift ratio of the protons involved in the condensation reaction product (MPyFA, see Scheme above). Unfortunately, clean integration of chemical shifts ascribed to these protons is complicated by the FA \"formic\" CH peak and broad NH proton peaks overlapping with the MPyFA formic proton. Additionally, the NH3 chemical shifts are un-resolvable at this pH and temperature given how rapidly proton exchange is occurring.\n",

In this study, we calculated the doping formation energy to investigate the formation energy to dope the α-phase perovskite structure with additive. In this calculation, we considered one formation step of α-phase perovskite structure with cationic chloride additive; α-phase perovskite structure incorporated cationic chloride additive before annealing process (pre-annealing step). In the pre-annealing step of α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure, the doping formation energy of cationic chloride additive into the perovskite structure (ΔEd) was calculated by using the following equation (s2), d cation Cl doping non-doping A out A in C out C in ( ) ( ) E E E n m \\uf06d \\uf06d \\uf06d \\uf06d \\uf044 = - + - + - (s2) where Ecation Cl doping is the total energy of perovskite system incorporated cationic chloride.

In order to investigate the effect of the concentration of cationic chloride additive on the crystallinity of the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure, we have theoretically tested the α-phase perovskite structure, which described the system before (pre-annealing) and after (post-annealing) a thermal annealing, based on the model systems of Figure  s16 . Through these systems, we calculated the formation energy (see Figure  s13 ) and the doping formation energy (see Figure  s18 ). Note that in the preannealing step, the α-phase perovskite is doped with cationic chloride as an additive, and in the postannealing step, the α-phase perovskite is doped with I, which occupies the Cl site through anionic exchange. In Figure  s19 , the doped model systems are described, which are at their most stable states, over the concentration range of 11 % to 44 %. \\n FACl We found that the formation energy decreased as the MACl concentration increased at the preannealing step (Figure  s19 (a)), implying that the performance of materials increased from their increased structural stabilities. But, one can readily expect that there exists a limit of the additive concentration effect to increase the performance since the doping formation energy increases (Figure  s19(a) ). Thus, we examined the formation energy at the post-annealing step, where I was substituted with Cl through the annealing process (Figure  s19(b) ). And, we found that the formation energy was stabilized between 33 % and 44 %, which corresponded to the best performance shown in the experiment (i.e., 40 %).  \\n INTRODUCTION Within a short period of time, organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites have demonstrated powerful applications in solar cells as a result of high-power conversion efficiencies now exceeding 23%, 1 unprecedented in the field of photovoltaics. The high-efficiency outputs of perovskite solar cells are attributed to their exceptional material properties, 2-4 which include high optical absorption cross-sections, 5 low exciton binding energies,  6  long-range charge carrier diffusion lengths,  3, 7, 8  and easy tuning of the band gaps 8-10 via simple interchanges of the precursor components. Among the perovskite materials, formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 )-based perovskite materials are also widely used because the band gap, 1.48 eV, is closer to the optimum value of a single-junction solar cell  [11] [12] [13]  and displays a broader light absorption spectrum that extends to 840 nm, although stability can be an issue in these cells. In general, FAPbI 3 has two crystal structures: a non-perovskite yellow d-phase and a 3D perovskite black a-phase. Only the a-phase perovskite is a useful photoactive phase.  12, 14  Black a-phase perovskite readily transforms to the yellow d-phase non-perovskite because of the large size of the FA cation.  15  Studies have shown that substituting some FA + species with MA + or Cs + can inhibit this phase transformation.  12   \\n Context & Scale Numerous effective methods have been developed toward achieving high-performance perovskite solar cells. The additives are one of the most effective ways of achieving high performance. Clbased additives are among the most prevalent in literature; however, their exact role is still uncertain. Herein, we systematically researched the effects of methylammonium chloride (MACl) additive using analysis of photo-physical properties and density functional theory. The highest efficiency achieved was 24.02%, certified as 23.48%, and the resultant devices showed better thermal stabilities and photostabilities than the pristine devices. The important factors for achieving high-performance perovskite solar cells include controlling the well-defined morphologies and maintaining the high crystallization of the perovskite film.  16, 17  These features can be controlled through the choice of perovskite precursor,  18  fabrication method,  19  solvent mixing,  17  annealing conditions,  20, 21  manufacturing humidity conditions,  22  surface passivation,  23  and processing additives.  24  Recently, the incorporation of additives into the perovskite precursor solution was widely studied to provide an effective approach to improving the film morphology and crystallinity. Several additives, including polymers,  [25] [26] [27]  fullerene derivatives,  [28] [29] [30]  organic halide salts,  [31] [32] [33] [34] [35]  metal halide salts,  [36] [37] [38] [39]  inorganic acid,  [40] [41] [42] [43]  and others  [44] [45] [46]  can be used to create a uniform perovskite layer with a high crystallinity and improve the device performance. Among these, additives containing iodide ions, such as cesium iodide (CsI),  [47] [48] [49] [50]  rubidium iodide (RbI),  [51] [52] [53]  guanidinium iodide (GuI),  [54] [55] [56]  methylammonium iodide (MAI),  57  and other iodide  [58] [59] [60] [61]  have driven the high-performance efficiencies. Just 5% or 10% CsI addition to perovskite mixtures suppressed non-perovskite yellow phase impurities and induced the formation of uniformly large perovskite grains that extended the electron-to-hole collecting layer, consistent with seed-assisted crystal growth.  50  Recently, alkali iodide (LiI, NaI, and KI) was used for defect engineering and perovskite doping to reduce hysteresis and increase efficiencies using small doping concentrations of 10 mmol.  62  Apart from the cationic iodide additives, chloride-based additives have been studied recently, although few studies have compared the chlorides with the iodides. Wang et al. explored the additions of FACl and MACl in equal molar amounts to the FAPbI 3 precursor solution, demonstrating that they were good additives for increasing the crystallization of a-FAPbI 3 via the formation of intermediate mixtures, which suppressed crystallization of the d-phase FAPbI 3 .  63  A new perovskite growth method was presented using MACl to assist the vertical recrystallization in an FA perovskite film and provide an efficiency of 20.6%.  64  Mu et al. showed that MACl was a transitional \\'\\'stabilizer\\'\\' that preserved the crystal structure and formed the black FA perovskite.  65  Qing et al. also showed that the synergistic effects of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and MACl additives, which assisted crystallization of the perovskites, lead to a single-crystal-like film with a smooth surface and a low defect density, thereby providing a high-efficiency perovskite solar cell.  66  However, the efficiencies of the perovskite solar cells prepared with cationic chloride additives were lower than those prepared using cationic iodide additives. Furthermore, it is not yet clear why MACl additives would be better than others. This effect requires further investigation of the role and theoretical calculation. In this work, we systematically studied the role of MACl additive in FAPbI 3 -based perovskite solar cells. The grain size in films prepared using various contents was dramatically greater, by a factor of 6, compared to the film prepared without additive. Interestingly, MACl effectively stabilizes an intermediate to the pure FAPbI 3 a-phase without annealing-only through cationic site substitution. From the fabricating high crystallinity of ultra-pure a-phase FAPbI 3 -based perovskite, the photoluminescence lifetimes also increased by a factor of 4.3. Using density functional theory (DFT), we provide a theoretical framework for understanding the interaction of MACl with a perovskite active layer. The formation energy of the resulting perovskite structure is related to the amount of incorporated MACl. Consequently, MACl additive induces intermediate phase stabilization for over 24% efficiency. The highest efficiency achieved was 24.02%, which was obtained with the addition of 40 mol% MACl. These results suggest that the MACl additive is a promising material for high-quality film formation and high-performance device that offers great opportunities for the practical applications. \\n RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The surface morphologies of the different film compositions were evaluated by collecting top-view images using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The interesting results were that the grain sizes of perovskite films are directly related to the amount of incorporated MACl. Figure  1A  shows the photographs of the film surfaces manufactured using the MACl introduced in concentrations of 10 mol%, 20 mol%, 30 mol%, 40 mol%, and 50 mol% (denoted MA-10, MA-20, MA-30, MA-40, and MA-50, respectively). The grain size obtained without the additive (pristine) was approximately 250 nm (average). However, the MA-10 produced a film with a larger grain size of 600 nm (see Figure  1B ). The grain size obtained from the MA-20 was 1,000 nm, and the grain size further increased to 1,500 nm for the MA-40 (see Figures  1C-1F ). The grain size distributions obtained with different additions of MACl contents is shown in Figure  1G . Atomic force microscopy (AFM) phase images (Figure  S1 ) also showed that the grain sizes were increased as a function of the additive amounts. The film roughness was measured by calculating the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness as listed in Table  S1 . The pristine film consisted of small crystals with an RMS roughness of 64.7 nm. The roughness decreased to 45.8 nm, 41.0 nm, 33.6 nm, and 24.7 nm with MA-10, MA-20, MA-30, and MA-40, respectively. These results indicated that the film roughness was reduced when the MACl contents were increased. To check the substitution of the cationic site with MA ion and anionic site with Cl ion, the perovskite films were characterized elementally using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Figure  S2 . The intensity of nitrogen (N) peak decreased with the MACl contents, indicating that the MA ion was substituted for FA in the cationic site because the MA ion included one N atom and the FA ion included two N atoms. Therefore, if the FA ion had been substituted by MA ions, the intensity of N would decrease as the MACl addition increased. In contrast with the N ion, the Cl ion was not substituted into the anionic sites. Some studies have shown that the addition of Cl ions to a perovskite does not facilitate the formation of a continuous perovskite phase because Cl ions readily evaporate away during the annealing process.  63, 65  To evaluate the Cl ion content, XPS measurements of the Cl ions were conducted as a function of the MACl contents from MA-10, MA-30, and MA-50. As shown in Figure  S2B , the signal corresponding to the Cl ion content in the film was not detected in all samples. These results indicated that the Cl ion had evaporated during annealing. MACl easily decomposed into MA ion and FACl, which was easily removed from the film through evaporation with annealing.  65  To support this result, the Cl ion was monitored using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis to observe any changes in the Cl ion concentration during annealing. The results shown in Figure  S3  reveal a large initial amount of Cl present compared to the amount of Pb (Cl/Pb atomic ratio) present in a perovskite film not subjected to annealing. After annealing at 150 C for 5 min, the Cl ion content was reduced to a 0.12 Cl/Pb atomic ratio, and no EDS-detectable Cl ion was observed in the perovskite film after annealing at 150 C for 10 min. These results agree with the XPS analysis. The intensities of the Pb and I ion signals did not change, indicating that the halide mixture composition did not change. Another interesting result is that the crystallinity can be changed with different concentrations of MACl. Figure  2A  shows the diffractograms obtained from pristine, MA-10, MA-20, MA-30, MA-40, and MA-50, respectively. The pristine perovskite film (prepared without additive) showed peaks at 12.7 and 13.9 , corresponding to the PbI 2 and a-phase perovskite peaks. The small PbI 2 peak intensity indicated that the film was not fully converted into a pure a-phase perovskite film during annealing at 150 C for 10 min. The crystallinity with addition of MACl, in MA-10, MA-20, and MA-30, slightly increased the a-phase peak at 13.9 , and the PbI 2 peak at 12.7 disappeared. The a-phase perovskite peak further increased at MA-40. However, the intensity of a-phase peak is slightly decreased at MA-50. The film crystallinities obtained from different MACl contents were compared by plotting the reciprocal full width at half maximum (FWHM) from the XRD spectra as shown in Figure  2B . The FWMH values were compared under the best conditions for each additive: pristine, MA-10, MA-20, MA-30, MA-40, and MA-50. The narrower diffraction peaks were observed in the films prepared with additive as compared to the pristine film. The highest value was obtained from MA-40, which indicated that large crystallites could be obtained. These results agreed with the grain size results, as shown in Figure  1 . The very interesting result is that MACl successfully induces an intermediate to the pure FAPbI 3 a-phase without annealing, effectively stabilizing this structure. The pristine film, for example, prepared without additives and without annealing, displayed numerous unknown diffraction peaks, as shown in Fig-  ure 2C . After annealing at 150 C for 10 min, the peak corresponding to the a-phase perovskite was dominant, but some d-phase and PbI 2 were still present, indicating that it was not easy to obtain only ultra-pure a-phase perovskite film from a pristine perovskite precursor solution. However, the perovskite film, obtained using MA-40, featured only a pure a-phase perovskite peak (no detectable d-phase and PbI 2 ) even without annealing (Figure  2D ). After annealing at 150 C for 10 min, the peak corresponding to the a-phase perovskite was sharply increased with only ultra-pure structure. These results indicate that the MACl additive can influence the formation of a-phase structure even before the annealing step and that the stabilized imtermediate can be induced into the ultra-pure a-phase perovskite after the annealing step. To see the intermediate phase of FAPbI 3 perovskite with MACl addition more clearly, we measured the XRD of FAPbI 3 perovskite included with MA-40 according to the annealing time (Figure  S4 ) and magnified the peak position around 14 (Figure  S5 ). As expected, the peak position was slightly shifted to a smaller degree as the annealing time was increased, which indicated that the Cl ion was substituted by I ion during the annealing process (Figures  S2  and S3 ). The photophysical measurements were conducted from the perovskite films prepared with different additive contents. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay profiles were obtained from the perovskite films. The PL decay curves, measured at the peak emission (800 nm), showed bi-exponential decays with a fast (t 1 ) and a slow (t 2 ) component. The t 1 decay component corresponded to non-radiative recombination from defects (surface traps near the grain boundaries), and the t 2 component corresponded to radiative recombination from the bulk perovskite.  57  Figure  2E  plots the PL decay curves obtained from the different concentrations of the MACl addition. The pristine film provided t 1 (331 ns) and t 2 (68.7 ns), but the highest values were obtained at MA-40: 1,441 ns (t 1 ) and 450 ns (t 2 ), as shown in Table  S2 . The higher decay values indicated that the deposited perovskite films possessed larger numbers of carriers after 1,000 ns, attributed to the strong suppression of non-radiative recombination. Longer components suggest improved Schottky order in the bulk perovskite as a result of additives.  57  Steady-state PL measurements were collected from the perovskite films deposited on glass. The corresponding curves for all compositions are shown in Figure  2F . The intensities of the PL peaks gradually increased with the MACl contents, and a slight blue shift was observed in the emission peak due to the MA ion substitution. As discussed above, the PL was only slightly affected if only the cations were substituted, in agreement with the smaller observed shift in the band gap.  67  The highest PL intensities were found in MA-40, indicating a high crystal quality, in agreement with the XRD results. The solar cell efficiencies with different concentrations were investigated, and the results are summarized in Figure  3A  and Table  S3 . The efficiency prepared with pristine was lower than the MA-10 and MA-20 devices. It was reasonable to assume that lower crystallinity of a-phase perovskite dominated the films prepared with MA-10 and MA-20. The performances of devices prepared with MACl-30 improved, to an efficiency of 22.52%, further increased to 24.02% (MA-40), and slightly decreased to 23.36% with further addition (MA-50). These result trends agreed with the XRD, optical adsorption, and PL measurements discussed above. Larger grain size, better crystallinity, and higher absorption intensities gave rise to better performance efficiencies. The intensity of the absorption band was highest at MA-40, and the PL lifetimes were also maximized. The reliability of the efficiency results was determined by testing the devices at an external institute, as shown in Figure  S6 . The certified efficiency of 23.48% from Newport Corp. was obtained. Figure  3B  shows the J-V curves as a function of the MACl contents. The relative distribution efficiencies of the pristine film, MA-20, and MA-40 are also shown in Figure  3C . The current densities were found to be 24.99 mA cm À2 (MA-10), 25.23 mA cm À2 (MA-20), 25.45 mA cm À2 (MA-30), 25.92 mA cm À2 (MA-40), and 25.38 mA cm À2 (MA-50), better than the current density measured from the pristine perovskite, 24.84 mA cm À2 . It may be postulated that the current densities were also affected by the perovskite crystallinity. The higher crystallinity had the higher current density, which was consistent with UV-absorption spectra as shown in Figure  S7 . The large PbI 2 peak observed in the pristine perovskite film indicated that the pristine perovskite film was not fully converted into a pure a-phase perovskite film. Apart from the current density, V oc significantly differ according to the different additives. The V oc of a pristine device was 1.027 V, but higher values were obtained with the MA-10 (1.034 V), MA-20 (1.083 V), MA-30 (1.101 V), MA-40 (1.130 V), or MA-50 (1.123 V). The V oc depends on the recombination rate in the perovskite film. The efficiencies obtained from the FACl and MAI additives were also measured by fabricating the various devices using the procedures described above, and the resulting J-V curve efficiencies are shown in Figures  S8  and S9 . The cell efficiencies obtained with FACl additive were higher than those of pristine, but the MAI additions were lower than those obtained from the cationic chloride addition at all concentrations. These results suggested that the chloride ion significantly affected the device performance. Figure  3D  showed the J-V curve of reverse and forward scan for the best and pristine devices. A pure perovskite film has a slow recombination rate. The case of MA-40 had a longer lifetime and a strong PL intensity (see Figures  2E  and 2F ) compared to pristine and other additive devices, which was a major contributor to higher V oc values. The FF also has higher value at MA-40, but the difference of FF is smaller compared to the other values (Figure  3B ). Figure  3E  shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) values and its integrated J sc of pristine and best devices. The EQE spectra show that the average EQE is well matched with each current density. Because of substituting MA ion, the EQE spectra also can be slightly shifted with shorter wavelength as shown in Figure  S10 . Figure  3F  shows the stabilized steady-state current measured at the maximum power point (at 0.98 V) over 100 min. Although inorganic-organic hybrid perovskites have displayed dramatic advances in photovoltaic applications, overcoming instabilities against light, heat, and moisture remains a challenge in the development of commercial applications. Device stability tests were conducted under room temperature (RT) and 40 C, and photo stabilities were conducted under constant AM 1.5G illumination at 25% relative humidity (RH) and without encapsulation. The stability at RT showed 90% retaining of its initial performance over 1,200 h as shown in Figure  S11A . The 40 C thermal stability test showed that the pristine device degraded to 60% of its initial performance over 300 h, but the MA-40 were more stable, retaining 90% of its initial performances (Figure  S11B ). The photostabilities of the pristine and MA-40 devices also give higher stability in conditions of continuous illumination, as shown in Figure  S11C . The improved stability against thermal and light illumination was attributed to the large grain size and high crystallinity of the perovskite films. Perovskite degradation appears to initiate at grain boundaries and surface defects upon exposure to moisture or constant light.  68  The grain size in the MA-40 film was almost 1,000 nm (average), 2.7 times the value of the pristine film (370 nm [average]; see Figure  1A ). Therefore, degradation at the grain boundary sites in large-grain films was lower than in smallgrain films. The MA-40 device was more stable than the pristine device. An additional factor supporting the improved thermal and photostability was the high film crystallinity. As shown in the XRD analysis, the film prepared with MA-40 displayed a higher crystallinity in the a-phase perovskite crystal, as shown in Figures  2A  and 2B . The higher crystallinity of the film reduced surface defects capable of reacting and degrading the material. Therefore, the MA-40 device displayed a strong stability against thermal and light illumination. The mechanism by which cationic chloride improved the physical properties and efficiencies of the perovskite films was studied by using the DFT calculations (see Experimental Procedures). In view of the factors and experimental observations, we investigated the role of MACl additive on the perovskite crystal structure from three important points of view: roles of Cl and MA and concentration effect of MACl on the a-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite structure. First, to understand the role of Cl on the perovskite crystal structure, the formation energies of the a-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite structure and that including Cl, MA, or MACl were calculated (Figure  4A ) from model systems (Figures  S12  and S13 ). The formation energies revealed that Cl stabilized the perovskite structure thermodynamically compared to the system without Cl. To better understand the role of Cl in electronic properties, the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) was calculated (Figure  4B ). It has been reported that the FA interacts weakly with the I of perovskite structure with a cubooctahedral structure favored by Pb and I in the a-phase FAPbI 3 , resulting in an unstable perovskite structure.  48  Interestingly, Cl induced p orbital localization of I (red dashed circle in the Figure  4B ), and the projected density of states (PDOS) results revealed that Cl enhanced the intensity of the p orbital of I at the HOMO state (Figures  4C  and S14 ). Accordingly, the interactions of FA and I could be enhanced by the above-mentioned effects of Cl, which contributes to improving the stability of the FAPbI 3 perovskite structure. These results can be supported by the XRD and XPS results (Figures  2D  and S2 ). Second, we investigated the effects of MA cation incorporated into the perovskite structure. Lee et al. reported that the incorporation of the Cs cation at the FA site improved the stability of the perovskite by enhancing interactions between FA and I through shrinkage of the cubo-octahedral volume.  48  Based on this observation, we also confirmed the total volume shrinkage in the MA cation-incorporated system (i.e., $0.57%) compared to the bare a-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite system (Figure  4D ). The main contribution for this volume shrinkage is attributed to the contraction of MA-included cubo-octahedral site compared to the bare system (i.e., $0.89%) (Figure  S15 ). Moreover, we predicted that the dipole effect of the MA cation was another factor of lower formation energy of the MA system (Figure  4A ) because the MA cation had a dipole moment 10 times that of the FA cation.  69  Our calculations indicated that p orbital localization of I in the MA system resulted from the dipole effect of the MA cation (blue dashed circle in Figure  4B ). The PDOS of the MA cation-incorporated system revealed that the intensity of the p orbital of I in the HOMO state was higher than the bare a-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite structure (Figure  4E ). Therefore, we conclude that the effects of the volume shrinkage and the dipole enhance the interactions between FA and I, which improved the stability of the perovskite structure. We additionally investigated the volume shrinkage of perovskite structure in terms of the MA concentration. For this investigation, the four concentration systems were constructed (Figure  S16 ). It was found that the volume shrinkage increased as the concentration of MA increased from calculation and experiment results. The degree of the volume shrinkage from both methods agreed well with each other (Figure  S17 ). Thus, we confirmed that MA induced the volume shrinkage of the perovskite structure and its concentration influenced the degree of volume shrinkage. Third, to elucidate the appropriate concentration of MACl additive for obtaining high crystallinity of a-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite structure, the concentration effect of MACl was investigated. Based on the four concentration systems in Figure  S16 , we predicted that the optimal concentration ranges for high crystallinity of perovskite solar cell could exist and be elucidated by considering formation energy (Figure  S13 ) and doping formation energy (Figure  S18 ). Our theoretical prediction was in good agreement with experimental observation. In Figure  S19 , the optimal concentration of MACl was caused by the doping formation energy of MACl into the a-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite structure in the pre-annealing step and the formation energy of the perovskite structure including MAI in the post-annealing step. Especially, the formation energy was stabilized between 33% and 44%, which corresponded to the best performance shown in the experiment (i.e., 40%). These theoretical predictions were in good agreement with experimental observations of results of the J-V curve (Figure  3B  and Table  S3 ). Overall, from the three points of DFT calculation, we can understand why MACl additive stabilized the perovskite formation and showed high performance. \\n Conclusion In summary, we investigated the MACl effects in the perovskite films, which construct the intermediate-phase into the perovskite film for the high-quality pure a-phase perovskite film. With achieved high-quality pure a-phase perovskite film, the surface morphology, crystallographic properties, optical absorption, and photoluminescence properties were enhanced, which resulted in high-performance perovskite solar cells. We achieved 24.02% perovskite solar cell performance. The mechanism of MACl\\'s effect on the formation of a-phase perovskite structure was elucidated using DFT calculation. We believe that our new finding will help researchers to achieve high performance of perovskite solar cells. \\n EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \\n Materials Formamidine acetate salt (99%), hydriodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in water), titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate), 2-propanol (anhydrous, 99.5%), chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous 99.8%,), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, > 99.5%) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Methylamine hydrochloride (MACl, 98%) was procured from Acros Organics. Fluorine-doped tin oxide on glass (FTO glass, 7 U sq -1 ) was obtained from Asahi. Ethanol (absolute, 99.9%) was procured from Changshu Yangyuan Chemicals. Diethyl ether (extra pure grade) was procured form Duksan. TiO 2 paste (SC-HT040) was procured from ShareChem. Lead iodide (PbI 2 , 99.999%) was purchased from TCI. \\n Materials Synthesis Formamidinium iodide (FAI) was synthesized as reported elsewhere.  70  Briefly, 25 g formamidine acetate was directly mixed with 50 mL hydriodic acid in a 500 mL round-bottomed flask with vigorous stirring. A light yellow powder was obtained by evaporating solvent at 80 C for 1 h in a vacuum evaporator. The resulting powders were dissolved in ethanol and precipitated using diethyl ether. This procedure was repeated 3 times until white powders were obtained, and the powders were recrystallized from ethanol and diethyl ether in a refrigerator. After recrystallization, the resulting powders were collected and dried at 60 C for 24 h. Single-crystal FAPbI 3 was fabricated as reported previously.  71, 72  Device Fabrication Asahi FTO glass (FTO glass, 7 U sq -1 ) was used as the substrate for the devices. The substrates were cleaned using the RCA-2 (H 2 O 2 -NCl-H 2 O) procedure  73  for 15 min to remove metal ion impurities. The substrates were then cleaned sequentially with acetone, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in an ultrasonic system for 15 min. To deposit the compact TiO 2 layer, 60 mL of a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)/ethanol (with 1:10 volume ratio) solution was applied by spraying. Prior to spraying, the substrates were placed on a hot plate and the temperature was increased to 450 C rapidly. After completing the spray pyrolysis step, the substrates were stored at 450 C for 1 h to improve the electrical properties,  74  then slowly cooled to room temperature. On top of the c-TiO 2 layer, a mesoporous TiO 2 (mp-TiO 2 ) layer was deposited by spin-coating. The TiO 2 paste, approximately 50 nm in diameter, was purchased from ShareChem. The paste was dispersed in ethanol/terpineol (78:22 w/w). The FTO/c-TiO 2 substrates prepared with mp-TiO 2 were heated at 500 C on a hot plate for 1 h to remove organic compounds and then slowly cooled to 200 C. To fabricate perovskite solar cells, the perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing 1,139 mg mL -1 FAPbI 3 in a mixture of DMF and DMSO in a 4:1 ratio by volume. MACl was added in the range 0$50 mol%. For each sample, 70 mL of the filtered solution was spread over the FTO/c-TiO 2 /mp-TiO 2 substrate at 6,000 rpm for 50 s with 0.1 s ramping. During spin coating, 1 mL diethyl ether was dripped after spinning for 10 s using a pipette. The film was dried on a hot plate at 150 C for 10 min. After cooling the substrate, the perovskite film was spin coated with phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) dissolved with IPA (5 mM) at 3,000 rpm. The hole transfer materials were deposited by preparing a spiro-OMe-TAD (Lumtech) in chlorobenzene (90 mg/mL) and mixing with 35.5 mL 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), 23 mL Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) (520 mg/mL acetonitrile), and 5 mL tris(2-(1h-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III)tris(bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209, Lumtech) (180 mg/mL acetonitrile). Finally, a gold counter electrode was deposited on the substrate using a thermal evaporation system. The back and front contacts were formed from 100 nm thick Au films deposited by vapor deposition at a pressure of 10 À6 torr. \\n Characterization The phases of the perovskite films prepared with different additives were analyzed using X-ray diffractometry (XRD) using a D8 Advance (Bruker) diffractometer equipped with Cu Ka radiation (l = 0.1542 nm). The morphologies of the perovskite films were assessed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi). Steady-state photoluminescence and TRPL measurements were conducted using PicoQuant FluoTime 300 (PicoQuant GmbH, Germany) equipped with a PDL 820 laser pulse driver. A pulsed laser diode (l = 375 nm, pulse FWHM < 70 ps, repetition rate 200 kHz-40 MHz) was used to excite the sample. XPS spectra were collected using a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250XI at a base pressure of 1.0 3 10 À9 torr using a monochromic Al-Ka X-ray source. The solar cells were measured using a solar simulator (McScience, K3000 Lab solar cell I-V measurement system, Class AAA) at 100 mA cm -2 , illumination AM 1.5 G. The light intensity was calibrated using a Si-reference cell certified by NREL before taking measurements. No light soaking was applied before the potential scan. The J-V curves were measured using a reverse scan (from a forward bias [1.2 V] to short circuit [0 V]) and a forward scan (from a forward bias [0 V] to short circuit [1.2 V]). The step voltage was fixed at 100 mV. The cells were masked using a metal mask in order to limit the active cell area to 0.0804 cm 2 . EQE measurements were obtained using a QEX7 system (PV Measurement). The stability test was conducted without encapsulation. The thermal stability test was performed by aging on a hot plate at RT and 40 C, respectively. The performances of the devices were periodically measured under illumination AM 1.5 G after cooling the devices to RT. The photostability test was performed under a maximum power point tracking and continuous light irradiation (AM 1.5G) at 25 C and below 30% RH. \\n Density Functional Theory Calculation All DFT calculations were performed using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) program.  75, 76  The electronic exchange correlation potential was treated using a generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) functional.  77  The interactions of the electron-ion cores were described using a norm-conserving pseudopotential.  78  The van der Waals interactions were corrected using the Tkatchenko and Scheffler (TS) method.  79  Spin polarization was considered in all calculations. The electronic wave functions were expanded using the plane wave basis set with the energy cut-off of 700 eV. The self-consistent field calculations were performed using the convergence criterion of 1 3 10 À6 eV/atom. The convergence criteria for the geometry optimization were set to 1 3 10 À5 eV/atom for the maximum energy change, 0.03 eV/A ˚for the maximum force, 0.05 GPa for the maximum stress, and 1 3 10 À3 A ˚for the maximum displacement. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a 1 3 1 3 3 k-point set with the Monkhorst-Pack scheme  80  for geometry optimization. Note that for calculation of projected density of states (PDOS), 2 3 2 3 6 k-point set was used.      Note that the formation energy (ΔEf) of the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure prepared with chloride, cation, or cationic chloride was calculated using the equation (s1), \\n SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION f system FA Pb I cation Cl E E nE mE lE kE tE \\uf044 = - - -- - (s1) where, Esystem is the total energy of the chloride, cation, or cationic chloride-incorporated perovskite system.

The pristine system was taken to be reference for the calculation of the volume shrinkage percent. The lattice parameter was calculated by using the Bragg equation 2 ; 2 sin dn \\uf071\\uf06c = , where d is the distance between atomic layers, θ is the diffraction angle, n is the order of reflection, which is an integer (for this case, n is 1), and λ is the wavelength of the radiation (for this case, λ is 1.54056 Å (copper source)). In this study, we calculated the doping formation energy to investigate the formation energy to dope the α-phase perovskite structure with additive. In this calculation, we considered one formation step of α-phase perovskite structure with cationic chloride additive; α-phase perovskite structure incorporated cationic chloride additive before annealing process (pre-annealing step). In the pre-annealing step of α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure, the doping formation energy of cationic chloride additive into the perovskite structure (ΔEd) was calculated by using the following equation (s2),  where Ecation Cl doping is the total energy of perovskite system incorporated cationic chloride. Enon-doping is the total energy of the system that does not incorporate the cationic chloride. μA out (μC out) and μA in (μC in) are the chemical potentials of anions (cations), which are deleted from or inserted to the perovskite structure with cationic iodide and cationic chloride. n and m are the number of anions and cations, respectively. In order to investigate the effect of the concentration of cationic chloride additive on the crystallinity of the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure, we have theoretically tested the α-phase perovskite structure, which described the system before (pre-annealing) and after (post-annealing) a thermal annealing, based on the model systems of Figure  s16 . Through these systems, we calculated the formation energy (see Figure  s13 ) and the doping formation energy (see Figure  s18 ). Note that in the preannealing step, the α-phase perovskite is doped with cationic chloride as an additive, and in the postannealing step, the α-phase perovskite is doped with I, which occupies the Cl site through anionic exchange. In Figure  s19 , the doped model systems are described, which are at their most stable states, over the concentration range of 11 % to 44 %. \\n FACl We found that the formation energy decreased as the MACl concentration increased at the preannealing step (Figure  s19 (a)), implying that the performance of materials increased from their increased structural stabilities. But, one can readily expect that there exists a limit of the additive concentration effect to increase the performance since the doping formation energy increases (Figure  s19 (a)). Thus, we examined the formation energy at the post-annealing step, where I was substituted with Cl through the annealing process (Figure  s19(b) ). And, we found that the formation energy was stabilized between 33 % and 44 %, which corresponded to the best performance shown in the experiment (i.e., 40 %).  • Announce a grant/award • Elevate your company\\'s profile Online job board product options listing your vacancy will be on Cell Career Network for 60 days and it will appear alongside Cell Press journal articles and research relevant to your job advertisement on Cell.com Add a featured job banner ad to one of our top rated journals Banners Banners New for 2018: our banners are now responsive!

In this study, we calculated the doping formation energy to investigate the formation energy to dope the α-phase perovskite structure with additive. In this calculation, we considered one formation step of α-phase perovskite structure with cationic chloride additive; α-phase perovskite structure incorporated cationic chloride additive before annealing process (pre-annealing step). In the pre-annealing step of α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure, the doping formation energy of cationic chloride additive into the perovskite structure (ΔEd) was calculated by using the following equation (s2), d cation Cl doping non-doping A out A in C out C in ( ) ( ) E E E n m \\uf06d \\uf06d \\uf06d \\uf06d \\uf044 = - + - + - (s2) where Ecation Cl doping is the total energy of perovskite system incorporated cationic chloride. Enon-doping is the total energy of the system that does not incorporate the cationic chloride. μA out (μC out) and μA in (μC in) are the chemical potentials of anions (cations), which are deleted from or inserted to the perovskite structure with cationic iodide and cationic chloride. n and m are the number of anions and cations, respectively. In order to investigate the effect of the concentration of cationic chloride additive on the crystallinity of the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure, we have theoretically tested the α-phase perovskite structure, which described the system before (pre-annealing) and after (post-annealing) a thermal annealing, based on the model systems of Figure  s16 . Through these systems, we calculated the formation energy (see Figure  s13 ) and the doping formation energy (see Figure  s18 ). Note that in the preannealing step, the α-phase perovskite is doped with cationic chloride as an additive, and in the postannealing step, the α-phase perovskite is doped with I, which occupies the Cl site through anionic exchange. In Figure  s19 , the doped model systems are described, which are at their most stable states, over the concentration range of 11 % to 44 %. \\n FACl We found that the formation energy decreased as the MACl concentration increased at the preannealing step (Figure  s19 (a)), implying that the performance of materials increased from their increased structural stabilities. But, one can readily expect that there exists a limit of the additive concentration effect to increase the performance since the doping formation energy increases (Figure  s19(a) ). Thus, we examined the formation energy at the post-annealing step, where I was substituted with Cl through the annealing process (Figure  s19(b) ). And, we found that the formation energy was stabilized between 33 % and 44 %, which corresponded to the best performance shown in the experiment (i.e., 40 %).  \\n Context & Scale Numerous effective methods have been developed toward achieving high-performance perovskite solar cells. The additives are one of the most effective ways of achieving high performance. Clbased additives are among the most prevalent in literature; however, their exact role is still uncertain. Herein, we systematically researched the effects of methylammonium chloride (MACl) additive using analysis of photo-physical properties and density functional theory. The highest efficiency achieved was 24.02%, certified as 23.48%, and the resultant devices showed better thermal stabilities and photostabilities than the pristine devices. The important factors for achieving high-performance perovskite solar cells include controlling the well-defined morphologies and maintaining the high crystallization of the perovskite film.  16, 17  These features can be controlled through the choice of perovskite precursor,  18  fabrication method,  19  solvent mixing,  17  annealing conditions,  20, 21  manufacturing humidity conditions,  22  surface passivation,  23  and processing additives.  24  Recently, the incorporation of additives into the perovskite precursor solution was widely studied to provide an effective approach to improving the film morphology and crystallinity. Several additives, including polymers,  [25] [26] [27]  fullerene derivatives,  [28] [29] [30]  organic halide salts,  [31] [32] [33] [34] [35]  metal halide salts,  [36] [37] [38] [39]  inorganic acid,  [40] [41] [42] [43]  and others  [44] [45] [46]  can be used to create a uniform perovskite layer with a high crystallinity and improve the device performance. Among these, additives containing iodide ions, such as cesium iodide (CsI),  [47] [48] [49] [50]  rubidium iodide (RbI),  [51] [52] [53]  guanidinium iodide (GuI),  [54] [55] [56]  methylammonium iodide (MAI),  57  and other iodide  [58] [59] [60] [61]  have driven the high-performance efficiencies. Just 5% or 10% CsI addition to perovskite mixtures suppressed non-perovskite yellow phase impurities and induced the formation of uniformly large perovskite grains that extended the electron-to-hole collecting layer, consistent with seed-assisted crystal growth.  50  Recently, alkali iodide (LiI, NaI, and KI) was used for defect engineering and perovskite doping to reduce hysteresis and increase efficiencies using small doping concentrations of 10 mmol.  62  Apart from the cationic iodide additives, chloride-based additives have been studied recently, although few studies have compared the chlorides with the iodides. Wang et al. explored the additions of FACl and MACl in equal molar amounts to the FAPbI 3 precursor solution, demonstrating that they were good additives for increasing the crystallization of a-FAPbI 3 via the formation of intermediate mixtures, which suppressed crystallization of the d-phase FAPbI 3 .  63  A new perovskite growth method was presented using MACl to assist the vertical recrystallization in an FA perovskite film and provide an efficiency of 20.6%.  64  Mu et al. showed that MACl was a transitional ''stabilizer'' that preserved the crystal structure and formed the black FA perovskite.  65  Qing et al. also showed that the synergistic effects of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and MACl additives, which assisted crystallization of the perovskites, lead to a single-crystal-like film with a smooth surface and a low defect density, thereby providing a high-efficiency perovskite solar cell.  66  However, the efficiencies of the perovskite solar cells prepared with cationic chloride additives were lower than those prepared using cationic iodide additives. Furthermore, it is not yet clear why MACl additives would be better than others. This effect requires further investigation of the role and theoretical calculation. In this work, we systematically studied the role of MACl additive in FAPbI 3 -based perovskite solar cells. The grain size in films prepared using various contents was dramatically greater, by a factor of 6, compared to the film prepared without additive. Interestingly, MACl effectively stabilizes an intermediate to the pure FAPbI 3 a-phase without annealing-only through cationic site substitution. From the fabricating high crystallinity of ultra-pure a-phase FAPbI 3 -based perovskite, the photoluminescence lifetimes also increased by a factor of 4.3. Using density functional theory (DFT), we provide a theoretical framework for understanding the interaction of MACl with a perovskite active layer. The formation energy of the resulting perovskite structure is related to the amount of incorporated MACl. Consequently, MACl additive induces intermediate phase stabilization for over 24% efficiency. The highest efficiency achieved was 24.02%, which was obtained with the addition of 40 mol% MACl. These results suggest that the MACl additive is a promising material for high-quality film formation and high-performance device that offers great opportunities for the practical applications. \\n RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The surface morphologies of the different film compositions were evaluated by collecting top-view images using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The interesting results were that the grain sizes of perovskite films are directly related to the amount of incorporated MACl. Figure  1A  shows the photographs of the film surfaces manufactured using the MACl introduced in concentrations of 10 mol%, 20 mol%, 30 mol%, 40 mol%, and 50 mol% (denoted MA-10, MA-20, MA-30, MA-40, and MA-50, respectively). The grain size obtained without the additive (pristine) was approximately 250 nm (average). However, the MA-10 produced a film with a larger grain size of 600 nm (see Figure  1B ). The grain size obtained from the MA-20 was 1,000 nm, and the grain size further increased to 1,500 nm for the MA-40 (see Figures  1C-1F ). The grain size distributions obtained with different additions of MACl contents is shown in Figure  1G . Atomic force microscopy (AFM) phase images (Figure  S1 ) also showed that the grain sizes were increased as a function of the additive amounts. The film roughness was measured by calculating the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness as listed in Table  S1 . The pristine film consisted of small crystals with an RMS roughness of 64.7 nm. The roughness decreased to 45.8 nm, 41.0 nm, 33.6 nm, and 24.7 nm with MA-10, MA-20, MA-30, and MA-40, respectively. These results indicated that the film roughness was reduced when the MACl contents were increased. To check the substitution of the cationic site with MA ion and anionic site with Cl ion, the perovskite films were characterized elementally using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Figure  S2 . The intensity of nitrogen (N) peak decreased with the MACl contents, indicating that the MA ion was substituted for FA in the cationic site because the MA ion included one N atom and the FA ion included two N atoms. Therefore, if the FA ion had been substituted by MA ions, the intensity of N would decrease as the MACl addition increased. In contrast with the N ion, the Cl ion was not substituted into the anionic sites. Some studies have shown that the addition of Cl ions to a perovskite does not facilitate the formation of a continuous perovskite phase because Cl ions readily evaporate away during the annealing process.  63, 65  To evaluate the Cl ion content, XPS measurements of the Cl ions were conducted as a function of the MACl contents from MA-10, MA-30, and MA-50. As shown in Figure  S2B , the signal corresponding to the Cl ion content in the film was not detected in all samples. These results indicated that the Cl ion had evaporated during annealing. MACl easily decomposed into MA ion and FACl, which was easily removed from the film through evaporation with annealing.  65  To support this result, the Cl ion was monitored using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis to observe any changes in the Cl ion concentration during annealing. The results shown in Figure  S3  reveal a large initial amount of Cl present compared to the amount of Pb (Cl/Pb atomic ratio) present in a perovskite film not subjected to annealing. After annealing at 150 C for 5 min, the Cl ion content was reduced to a 0.12 Cl/Pb atomic ratio, and no EDS-detectable Cl ion was observed in the perovskite film after annealing at 150 C for 10 min. These results agree with the XPS analysis. The intensities of the Pb and I ion signals did not change, indicating that the halide mixture composition did not change. Another interesting result is that the crystallinity can be changed with different concentrations of MACl. Figure  2A  shows the diffractograms obtained from pristine, MA-10, MA-20, MA-30, MA-40, and MA-50, respectively. The pristine perovskite film (prepared without additive) showed peaks at 12.7 and 13.9 , corresponding to the PbI 2 and a-phase perovskite peaks. The small PbI 2 peak intensity indicated that the film was not fully converted into a pure a-phase perovskite film during annealing at 150 C for 10 min. The crystallinity with addition of MACl, in MA-10, MA-20, and MA-30, slightly increased the a-phase peak at 13.9 , and the PbI 2 peak at 12.7 disappeared. The a-phase perovskite peak further increased at MA-40. However, the intensity of a-phase peak is slightly decreased at MA-50. The film crystallinities obtained from different MACl contents were compared by plotting the reciprocal full width at half maximum (FWHM) from the XRD spectra as shown in Figure  2B . The FWMH values were compared under the best conditions for each additive: pristine, MA-10, MA-20, MA-30, MA-40, and MA-50. The narrower diffraction peaks were observed in the films prepared with additive as compared to the pristine film. The highest value was obtained from MA-40, which indicated that large crystallites could be obtained. These results agreed with the grain size results, as shown in Figure  1 . The very interesting result is that MACl successfully induces an intermediate to the pure FAPbI 3 a-phase without annealing, effectively stabilizing this structure. The pristine film, for example, prepared without additives and without annealing, displayed numerous unknown diffraction peaks, as shown in Fig-  ure 2C . After annealing at 150 C for 10 min, the peak corresponding to the a-phase perovskite was dominant, but some d-phase and PbI 2 were still present, indicating that it was not easy to obtain only ultra-pure a-phase perovskite film from a pristine perovskite precursor solution. However, the perovskite film, obtained using MA-40, featured only a pure a-phase perovskite peak (no detectable d-phase and PbI 2 ) even without annealing (Figure  2D ). After annealing at 150 C for 10 min, the peak corresponding to the a-phase perovskite was sharply increased with only ultra-pure structure. These results indicate that the MACl additive can influence the formation of a-phase structure even before the annealing step and that the stabilized imtermediate can be induced into the ultra-pure a-phase perovskite after the annealing step. To see the intermediate phase of FAPbI 3 perovskite with MACl addition more clearly, we measured the XRD of FAPbI 3 perovskite included with MA-40 according to the annealing time (Figure  S4 ) and magnified the peak position around 14 (Figure  S5 ). As expected, the peak position was slightly shifted to a smaller degree as the annealing time was increased, which indicated that the Cl ion was substituted by I ion during the annealing process (Figures  S2  and S3 ). The photophysical measurements were conducted from the perovskite films prepared with different additive contents. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay profiles were obtained from the perovskite films. The PL decay curves, measured at the peak emission (800 nm), showed bi-exponential decays with a fast (t 1 ) and a slow (t 2 ) component. The t 1 decay component corresponded to non-radiative recombination from defects (surface traps near the grain boundaries), and the t 2 component corresponded to radiative recombination from the bulk perovskite.  57  Figure  2E  plots the PL decay curves obtained from the different concentrations of the MACl addition. The pristine film provided t 1 (331 ns) and t 2 (68.7 ns), but the highest values were obtained at MA-40: 1,441 ns (t 1 ) and 450 ns (t 2 ), as shown in Table  S2 . The higher decay values indicated that the deposited perovskite films possessed larger numbers of carriers after 1,000 ns, attributed to the strong suppression of non-radiative recombination. Longer components suggest improved Schottky order in the bulk perovskite as a result of additives.  57  Steady-state PL measurements were collected from the perovskite films deposited on glass. The corresponding curves for all compositions are shown in Figure  2F . The intensities of the PL peaks gradually increased with the MACl contents, and a slight blue shift was observed in the emission peak due to the MA ion substitution. As discussed above, the PL was only slightly affected if only the cations were substituted, in agreement with the smaller observed shift in the band gap.  67  The highest PL intensities were found in MA-40, indicating a high crystal quality, in agreement with the XRD results. The solar cell efficiencies with different concentrations were investigated, and the results are summarized in Figure  3A  and Table  S3 . The efficiency prepared with pristine was lower than the MA-10 and MA-20 devices. It was reasonable to assume that lower crystallinity of a-phase perovskite dominated the films prepared with MA-10 and MA-20. The performances of devices prepared with MACl-30 improved, to an efficiency of 22.52%, further increased to 24.02% (MA-40), and slightly decreased to 23.36% with further addition (MA-50). These result trends agreed with the XRD, optical adsorption, and PL measurements discussed above. Larger grain size, better crystallinity, and higher absorption intensities gave rise to better performance efficiencies. The intensity of the absorption band was highest at MA-40, and the PL lifetimes were also maximized. The reliability of the efficiency results was determined by testing the devices at an external institute, as shown in Figure  S6 . The certified efficiency of 23.48% from Newport Corp. was obtained. Figure  3B  shows the J-V curves as a function of the MACl contents. The relative distribution efficiencies of the pristine film, MA-20, and MA-40 are also shown in Figure  3C . The current densities were found to be 24.99 mA cm À2 (MA-10), 25.23 mA cm À2 (MA-20), 25.45 mA cm À2 (MA-30), 25.92 mA cm À2 (MA-40), and 25.38 mA cm À2 (MA-50), better than the current density measured from the pristine perovskite, 24.84 mA cm À2 . It may be postulated that the current densities were also affected by the perovskite crystallinity. The higher crystallinity had the higher current density, which was consistent with UV-absorption spectra as shown in Figure  S7 . The large PbI 2 peak observed in the pristine perovskite film indicated that the pristine perovskite film was not fully converted into a pure a-phase perovskite film. Apart from the current density, V oc significantly differ according to the different additives. The V oc of a pristine device was 1.027 V, but higher values were obtained with the MA-10 (1.034 V), MA-20 (1.083 V), MA-30 (1.101 V), MA-40 (1.130 V), or MA-50 (1.123 V). The V oc depends on the recombination rate in the perovskite film. The efficiencies obtained from the FACl and MAI additives were also measured by fabricating the various devices using the procedures described above, and the resulting J-V curve efficiencies are shown in Figures  S8  and S9 . The cell efficiencies obtained with FACl additive were higher than those of pristine, but the MAI additions were lower than those obtained from the cationic chloride addition at all concentrations. These results suggested that the chloride ion significantly affected the device performance. Figure  3D  showed the J-V curve of reverse and forward scan for the best and pristine devices. A pure perovskite film has a slow recombination rate. The case of MA-40 had a longer lifetime and a strong PL intensity (see Figures  2E  and 2F ) compared to pristine and other additive devices, which was a major contributor to higher V oc values. The FF also has higher value at MA-40, but the difference of FF is smaller compared to the other values (Figure  3B ). Figure  3E  shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) values and its integrated J sc of pristine and best devices. The EQE spectra show that the average EQE is well matched with each current density. Because of substituting MA ion, the EQE spectra also can be slightly shifted with shorter wavelength as shown in Figure  S10 . Figure  3F  shows the stabilized steady-state current measured at the maximum power point (at 0.98 V) over 100 min. Although inorganic-organic hybrid perovskites have displayed dramatic advances in photovoltaic applications, overcoming instabilities against light, heat, and moisture remains a challenge in the development of commercial applications. Device stability tests were conducted under room temperature (RT) and 40 C, and photo stabilities were conducted under constant AM 1.5G illumination at 25% relative humidity (RH) and without encapsulation. The stability at RT showed 90% retaining of its initial performance over 1,200 h as shown in Figure  S11A . The 40 C thermal stability test showed that the pristine device degraded to 60% of its initial performance over 300 h, but the MA-40 were more stable, retaining 90% of its initial performances (Figure  S11B ). The photostabilities of the pristine and MA-40 devices also give higher stability in conditions of continuous illumination, as shown in Figure  S11C . The improved stability against thermal and light illumination was attributed to the large grain size and high crystallinity of the perovskite films. Perovskite degradation appears to initiate at grain boundaries and surface defects upon exposure to moisture or constant light.  68  The grain size in the MA-40 film was almost 1,000 nm (average), 2.7 times the value of the pristine film (370 nm [average]; see Figure  1A ). Therefore, degradation at the grain boundary sites in large-grain films was lower than in smallgrain films. The MA-40 device was more stable than the pristine device. An additional factor supporting the improved thermal and photostability was the high film crystallinity. As shown in the XRD analysis, the film prepared with MA-40 displayed a higher crystallinity in the a-phase perovskite crystal, as shown in Figures  2A  and 2B . The higher crystallinity of the film reduced surface defects capable of reacting and degrading the material. Therefore, the MA-40 device displayed a strong stability against thermal and light illumination. The mechanism by which cationic chloride improved the physical properties and efficiencies of the perovskite films was studied by using the DFT calculations (see Experimental Procedures). In view of the factors and experimental observations, we investigated the role of MACl additive on the perovskite crystal structure from three important points of view: roles of Cl and MA and concentration effect of MACl on the a-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite structure. First, to understand the role of Cl on the perovskite crystal structure, the formation energies of the a-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite structure and that including Cl, MA, or MACl were calculated (Figure  4A ) from model systems (Figures  S12  and S13 ). The formation energies revealed that Cl stabilized the perovskite structure thermodynamically compared to the system without Cl. To better understand the role of Cl in electronic properties, the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) was calculated (Figure  4B ). It has been reported that the FA interacts weakly with the I of perovskite structure with a cubooctahedral structure favored by Pb and I in the a-phase FAPbI 3 , resulting in an unstable perovskite structure.  48  Interestingly, Cl induced p orbital localization of I (red dashed circle in the Figure  4B ), and the projected density of states (PDOS) results revealed that Cl enhanced the intensity of the p orbital of I at the HOMO state (Figures  4C  and S14 ). Accordingly, the interactions of FA and I could be enhanced by the above-mentioned effects of Cl, which contributes to improving the stability of the FAPbI 3 perovskite structure. These results can be supported by the XRD and XPS results (Figures  2D  and S2 ). Second, we investigated the effects of MA cation incorporated into the perovskite structure. Lee et al. reported that the incorporation of the Cs cation at the FA site improved the stability of the perovskite by enhancing interactions between FA and I through shrinkage of the cubo-octahedral volume.  48  Based on this observation, we also confirmed the total volume shrinkage in the MA cation-incorporated system (i.e., $0.57%) compared to the bare a-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite system (Figure  4D ). The main contribution for this volume shrinkage is attributed to the contraction of MA-included cubo-octahedral site compared to the bare system (i.e., $0.89%) (Figure  S15 ). Moreover, we predicted that the dipole effect of the MA cation was another factor of lower formation energy of the MA system (Figure  4A ) because the MA cation had a dipole moment 10 times that of the FA cation.  69  Our calculations indicated that p orbital localization of I in the MA system resulted from the dipole effect of the MA cation (blue dashed circle in Figure  4B ). The PDOS of the MA cation-incorporated system revealed that the intensity of the p orbital of I in the HOMO state was higher than the bare a-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite structure (Figure  4E ). Therefore, we conclude that the effects of the volume shrinkage and the dipole enhance the interactions between FA and I, which improved the stability of the perovskite structure. We additionally investigated the volume shrinkage of perovskite structure in terms of the MA concentration. For this investigation, the four concentration systems were constructed (Figure  S16 ). It was found that the volume shrinkage increased as the concentration of MA increased from calculation and experiment results. The degree of the volume shrinkage from both methods agreed well with each other (Figure  S17 ). Thus, we confirmed that MA induced the volume shrinkage of the perovskite structure and its concentration influenced the degree of volume shrinkage. Third, to elucidate the appropriate concentration of MACl additive for obtaining high crystallinity of a-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite structure, the concentration effect of MACl was investigated. Based on the four concentration systems in Figure  S16 , we predicted that the optimal concentration ranges for high crystallinity of perovskite solar cell could exist and be elucidated by considering formation energy (Figure  S13 ) and doping formation energy (Figure  S18 ). Our theoretical prediction was in good agreement with experimental observation. In Figure  S19 , the optimal concentration of MACl was caused by the doping formation energy of MACl into the a-phase FAPbI 3 perovskite structure in the pre-annealing step and the formation energy of the perovskite structure including MAI in the post-annealing step. Especially, the formation energy was stabilized between 33% and 44%, which corresponded to the best performance shown in the experiment (i.e., 40%). These theoretical predictions were in good agreement with experimental observations of results of the J-V curve (Figure  3B  and Table  S3 ). Overall, from the three points of DFT calculation, we can understand why MACl additive stabilized the perovskite formation and showed high performance. \\n EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \\n Characterization The phases of the perovskite films prepared with different additives were analyzed using X-ray diffractometry (XRD) using a D8 Advance (Bruker) diffractometer equipped with Cu Ka radiation (l = 0.1542 nm). The morphologies of the perovskite films were assessed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi). Steady-state photoluminescence and TRPL measurements were conducted using PicoQuant FluoTime 300 (PicoQuant GmbH, Germany) equipped with a PDL 820 laser pulse driver. A pulsed laser diode (l = 375 nm, pulse FWHM < 70 ps, repetition rate 200 kHz-40 MHz) was used to excite the sample. XPS spectra were collected using a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250XI at a base pressure of 1.0 3 10 À9 torr using a monochromic Al-Ka X-ray source. The solar cells were measured using a solar simulator (McScience, K3000 Lab solar cell I-V measurement system, Class AAA) at 100 mA cm -2 , illumination AM 1.5 G. The light intensity was calibrated using a Si-reference cell certified by NREL before taking measurements. No light soaking was applied before the potential scan. The J-V curves were measured using a reverse scan (from a forward bias [1.2 V] to short circuit [0 V]) and a forward scan (from a forward bias [0 V] to short circuit [1.2 V]). The step voltage was fixed at 100 mV. The cells were masked using a metal mask in order to limit the active cell area to 0.0804 cm 2 . EQE measurements were obtained using a QEX7 system (PV Measurement). The stability test was conducted without encapsulation. The thermal stability test was performed by aging on a hot plate at RT and 40 C, respectively. The performances of the devices were periodically measured under illumination AM 1.5 G after cooling the devices to RT. The photostability test was performed under a maximum power point tracking and continuous light irradiation (AM 1.5G) at 25 C and below 30% RH. \\n Density Functional Theory Calculation All DFT calculations were performed using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) program.  75, 76  The electronic exchange correlation potential was treated using a generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) functional.  77  The interactions of the electron-ion cores were described using a norm-conserving pseudopotential.  78  The van der Waals interactions were corrected using the Tkatchenko and Scheffler (TS) method.  79  Spin polarization was considered in all calculations. The electronic wave functions were expanded using the plane wave basis set with the energy cut-off of 700 eV. The self-consistent field calculations were performed using the convergence criterion of 1 3 10 À6 eV/atom. The convergence criteria for the geometry optimization were set to 1 3 10 À5 eV/atom for the maximum energy change, 0.03 eV/A ˚for the maximum force, 0.05 GPa for the maximum stress, and 1 3 10 À3 A ˚for the maximum displacement. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a 1 3 1 3 3 k-point set with the Monkhorst-Pack scheme  80  for geometry optimization. Note that for calculation of projected density of states (PDOS), 2 3 2 3 6 k-point set was used.      Note that the formation energy (ΔEf) of the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure prepared with chloride, cation, or cationic chloride was calculated using the equation (s1), \\n SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION f system FA Pb I cation Cl E E nE mE lE kE tE \\uf044 = - - -- - (s1) where, Esystem is the total energy of the chloride, cation, or cationic chloride-incorporated perovskite system.

The pristine system was taken to be reference for the calculation of the volume shrinkage percent. The lattice parameter was calculated by using the Bragg equation 2 ; 2 sin dn \\uf071\\uf06c = , where d is the distance between atomic layers, θ is the diffraction angle, n is the order of reflection, which is an integer (for this case, n is 1), and λ is the wavelength of the radiation (for this case, λ is 1.54056 Å (copper source)). In this study, we calculated the doping formation energy to investigate the formation energy to dope the α-phase perovskite structure with additive. In this calculation, we considered one formation step of α-phase perovskite structure with cationic chloride additive; α-phase perovskite structure incorporated cationic chloride additive before annealing process (pre-annealing step). In the pre-annealing step of α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure, the doping formation energy of cationic chloride additive into the perovskite structure (ΔEd) was calculated by using the following equation (s2),  where Ecation Cl doping is the total energy of perovskite system incorporated cationic chloride. Enon-doping is the total energy of the system that does not incorporate the cationic chloride. μA out (μC out) and μA in (μC in) are the chemical potentials of anions (cations), which are deleted from or inserted to the perovskite structure with cationic iodide and cationic chloride. n and m are the number of anions and cations, respectively. In order to investigate the effect of the concentration of cationic chloride additive on the crystallinity of the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure, we have theoretically tested the α-phase perovskite structure, which described the system before (pre-annealing) and after (post-annealing) a thermal annealing, based on the model systems of Figure  s16 . Through these systems, we calculated the formation energy (see Figure  s13 ) and the doping formation energy (see Figure  s18 ). Note that in the preannealing step, the α-phase perovskite is doped with cationic chloride as an additive, and in the postannealing step, the α-phase perovskite is doped with I, which occupies the Cl site through anionic exchange. In Figure  s19 , the doped model systems are described, which are at their most stable states, over the concentration range of 11 % to 44 %. \\n FACl We found that the formation energy decreased as the MACl concentration increased at the preannealing step (Figure  s19 (a)), implying that the performance of materials increased from their increased structural stabilities. But, one can readily expect that there exists a limit of the additive concentration effect to increase the performance since the doping formation energy increases (Figure  s19 (a)). Thus, we examined the formation energy at the post-annealing step, where I was substituted with Cl through the annealing process (Figure  s19(b) ). And, we found that the formation energy was stabilized between 33 % and 44 %, which corresponded to the best performance shown in the experiment (i.e., 40 %).  • Announce a grant/award • Elevate your company's profile Online job board product options listing your vacancy will be on Cell Career Network for 60 days and it will appear alongside Cell Press journal articles and research relevant to your job advertisement on Cell.com Add a featured job banner ad to one of our top rated journals Banners Banners New for 2018: our banners are now responsive!
